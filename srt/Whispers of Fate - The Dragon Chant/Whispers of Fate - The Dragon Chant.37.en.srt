[Whispers of Fate]

2
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,950
[Episode 37]

3
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,229
You can continue being a princess,

4
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,740
and I'll become the Sword Master.

5
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,270
If we two women join forces,

6
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,430
both the imperial court

7
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,350
and jianghu

8
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,039
will be under our control.

9
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,380
Wouldn't that be

10
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,490
a wonderful world?

11
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,259
I won't hurt you,

12
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,670
and you won't hurt me either.

13
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,259
We need each other

14
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,750
and we rely on each other.

15
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,509
We...

16
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,950
can be a pair of phoenixes

17
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,820
looking down upon the world.

18
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:09,860
We...

19
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,630
can be an invincible duo.

20
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,730
All you need to do is...

21
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,630
All I need to do is give you
the votes I receive,

22
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,790
so you can defeat Tang Lici.

23
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,640
I'll leave Your Highness to it.

24
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,470
I believe Your Highness

25
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,310
will make the decision

26
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,170
that best serves your interests.

27
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,280
Your Highness,

28
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,470
Mr. Tang invites you for a meeting.

29
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,540
These are Morning Dew Flowers.

30
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,940
They blossom at midnight

31
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,280
and wither before dawn.

32
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,960
They only bloom

33
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,160
one night a year.

34
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,140
Since their blossoms don't last long,

35
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,670
few people know about them.

36
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,579
They're most beautiful when in bud.

37
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,530
They already look stunning now.

38
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,310
After they bloom,

39
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,460
won't there be a more spectacular view?

40
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,070
After they bloom,

41
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,090
only the rotten centers will remain.

42
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,910
People admire their beautiful appearances

43
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,770
simply because

44
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,440
they've never seen the inside of them.

45
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,860
So much ugliness exists in the world.

46
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,070
There's no such thing as absolute beauty.

47
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,630
Growing wildly is better

48
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,270
than being ordinary.

49
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,310
Even just a brief moment of glory

50
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,860
is enough.

51
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,590
Look how pretty it is now.

52
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,560
You got injured.

53
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,220
The rotten centers

54
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,909
breed venomous insects.

55
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,750
When the toxins get to
one's heart and meridians,

56
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,280
this person can't be cured.

57
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,800
Therefore,

58
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,510
these flowers had better

59
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,710
be admired from afar,

60
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,330
and not be approached.

61
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,620
Those who heedlessly pluck them

62
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,330
will inevitably get hurt.

63
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,310
It turns out this little speech

64
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,160
is why you asked me to come.

65
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,310
You also disapprove of me
running for the position of Sword Master?

66
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,340
Yes.

67
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,520
I'm in over my head.

68
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,140
But so what?

69
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,960
I'm just living for myself.

70
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,700
Even if I'll be covered in wounds,

71
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,220
or...

72
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,310
or I'll have to hurt others,

73
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,510
I'll still rather not upset myself

74
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,710
and spend the rest of my life in regrets.

75
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,780
Ms. Zhong.

76
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,990
We need more practice.

77
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,700
Indeed.

78
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,460
I hate this.

79
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,220
So much noise in the early morning.

80
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,870
Why did I never notice

81
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,600
how noisy Mount Cloud could be?

82
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,380
Chi!

83
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,990
We heard you had come back,

84
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,190
so we came for a visit.

85
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,870
Coming. I'll open the door.

86
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,450
Even the door is sealed up?

87
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,170
Is that necessary?

88
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,300
Forget it.

89
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,550
I'm having a terrible headache.

90
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,010
I don't want to see anyone.

91
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,750
Chi Yun,

92
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,950
are you sick?

93
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,370
Shall I get you a royal physician?

94
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,550
Scram!

95
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,020
You're sick!

96
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,550
I'm not!

97
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,580
Go away!

98
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,550
What's wrong with you?

99
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,430
Maybe Chi is in a bad mood.

100
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,300
Let's come back another day.

101
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,940
You know what?

102
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,790
Mr. Chi isn't recuperating.

103
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,420
In fact, he's been poisoned.

104
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,220
Really?

105
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,310
What kind of potent poison is it?

106
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,580
If it were an ordinary poison,

107
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,780
he would've been cured.

108
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,630
I heard he was exposed

109
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,580
to a new poison
generated by the Blood Ghost Pills.

110
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,380
The poisoned ones tend to

111
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,630
become irritable and aggressive.

112
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,670
When provoked,
they may even attack others.

113
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,220
Those who are unfortunately injured

114
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,430
by them will be infected

115
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,460
even without taking the Evil Pills.

116
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,110
Then why did Mr. Tang

117
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,460
bring him back to the Sword Alliance?

118
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,790
Aren't we in danger now?

119
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,140
Mr. Chi's condition

120
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,270
is quite worrisome.

121
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,020
Miss Xifang,

122
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,430
did you anticipate

123
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,760
the current situation?

124
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,090
By saying this, Master Jiang,

125
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,140
are you asking me to guide you

126
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,580
through perplexity,

127
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,070
or...

128
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,820
are you going to offer me advice,

129
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,880
since you've figured out something?

130
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,550
Don't get me wrong, Miss Xifang.

131
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,460
Since you joined the Sword Alliance,

132
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,630
you've prioritized
eradicating Fengliu Shop

133
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,820
and protecting the innocent all the time.

134
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,580
I'm a witness

135
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,070
to all the efforts you've made.

136
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,460
Tang Lici's kindness

137
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,860
is certainly admirable.

138
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,480
But even Shui Duopo has said

139
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,780
that it'll take a long time
to develop an antidote.

140
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,380
The poisoned people
are honestly beyond help.

141
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,990
Now, a new poison has emerged.

142
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,020
I'm afraid
its spread will get out of control.

143
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,260
At the moment, the Sword Alliance

144
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,700
needs a decisive and composed leader

145
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,260
such as yourself, Miss Xifang.

146
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,340
Tang Lici and the fuss he's making
must be stopped soon,

147
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,510
or the entire Sword Alliance

148
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,950
and even the whole jianghu

149
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,480
may be plunged into danger.

150
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,690
Considering that,

151
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,750
the Investigation Hall

152
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,100
and the Nine Heavenly Sword Weapons
I'm in charge of

153
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,150
will be at your service

154
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,610
in the upcoming election,

155
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,909
Miss Xifang.

156
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,270
How reasonable and just of you,
Master Jiang.

157
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,580
However,

158
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,380
Mr. Chi is a friend of Mr. Tang's.

159
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,360
If we interfere with this matter,

160
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,580
Mr. Tang will definitely
fight tooth and nail against us.

161
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,840
This won't do good to the Sword Alliance.

162
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,980
Miss Xifang, you're saying...

163
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,310
Recently, it has come to my notice

164
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,550
that Mr. Tang is behaving suspiciously.

165
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,390
It seems

166
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,740
he's hiding something.

167
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,220
Miss Xifang, have you found

168
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,700
any specific clues?

169
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,270
Tang Lici a very cautious man.

170
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,870
It's not that easy to uncover

171
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,540
the secrets he's trying to keep.

172
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,750
With Master Shao looking after Liu Yan,

173
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,120
I can put my mind at ease.

174
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,870
But even with Liu Yan's help,

175
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,670
it'll still take some time

176
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,270
before the antidote is made.

177
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,840
Worse still, the toxins in Chi Yun

178
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,790
don't allow him to wait too long.

179
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,190
I must expedite the making process
for him.

180
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,510
Can you stop acting the hero?

181
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,590
How much more blood can you lose?

182
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,860
Your power and blood
have been depleted,

183
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,070
and your inner energy disrupted.

184
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,150
These days,
you must refrain from losing blood

185
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,100
and using the Rebirth Scroll again

186
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,900
to save lives.

187
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,310
Those three pills have been used up.

188
00:09:59,310 --> 00:09:59,950
Your current condition

189
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,220
is far more dangerous than you imagine.

190
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,420
One reckless move could cost your life.

191
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,950
Senior,

192
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,150
the Sword Alliance now needs

193
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,670
a Tang Lici in his prime.

194
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,220
And my companions

195
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,580
also need that.

196
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,070
Master Shao,

197
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,870
it all counts on you.

198
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,880
Fifteen grams too much.

199
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,430
Miss Shui,

200
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,700
in my spare time lately,

201
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,310
I've been researching
how to counter the effects

202
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,460
brought by the Blood Ghost Pills.

203
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,820
I've made some progress.

204
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,550
I would love to have your input.

205
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,460
Who's been researching?

206
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,030
Me.

207
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,700
Miss Shui, do you think this formula

208
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,300
will work?

209
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,510
What a genius you are in medicine,
Master Shao.

210
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,210
Like a hidden gem, aren't you?

211
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,390
I'm so flattered.

212
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,030
I just want to learn more.

213
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,390
One is never too old to learn, right?

214
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,790
Drop the act.

215
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,700
Only someone with profound knowledge

216
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
of both medicine and poison

217
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,230
could create this formula.

218
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,960
Master Shao, level with me.

219
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,120
Where did you get this formula?

220
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,090
No wonder you can be my senior.

221
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,910
I shouldn't have lied to a real expert.

222
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,240
You've seen me through.

223
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,680
The potent poison
within the Blood Ghost Pill

224
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,310
can hardly be eliminated
by neutral

225
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,440
and mild antidotes.

226
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,410
It has to be countered by another poison.

227
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,880
He's on the right track.

228
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,620
But it takes careful consideration
before deciding

229
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,910
the portions of toxic ingredients

230
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,860
and the way they're meshed together.

231
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,580
There will be more progress

232
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,040
if I get to meet and discuss

233
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,500
with the creator of this formula
in person.

234
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,030
It's better not to meet him.

235
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,460
I got it.

236
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,670
Next time,

237
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,950
bring this to him.

238
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,220
What is it?

239
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,740
The notes I took when I studied

240
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,740
the poison pills.

241
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,010
My findings may be helpful to him.

242
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,900
On behalf of the Sword Alliance,

243
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,210
I express my gratitude to you, Miss Shui.

244
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,550
Footprints?

245
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,670
Was someone

246
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,220
eavesdropping on us?

247
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,030
Welcome home, my best assassin.

248
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,740
I'm afraid that after today,

249
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,340
you need to pick someone else

250
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,050
as your best assassin, Chief.

251
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,350
Do you plan to join the Sword Alliance?

252
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,740
Entering a righteous sect
after working as an assassin

253
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,200
can't be that easy, can it?

254
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,340
Even Xifang Tao was admitted

255
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,740
into the Sword Alliance.

256
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,170
Why can't I join it too?

257
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,640
The Sword Alliance took Xifang Tao in

258
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,360
because she had

259
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,030
Master Puzhu as her referee.

260
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,500
Then, she devised

261
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,860
clever plans herself.

262
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,460
By contrast, you only have

263
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,060
Tang Lici as your supporter.

264
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,030
Elections are about

265
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,870
winning the voters' hearts.

266
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,190
People in fear would only

267
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,790
want to protect themselves.

268
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,310
Xifang Tao has seized upon

269
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,040
this very part of human nature.

270
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,460
She takes drastic measures

271
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,860
against the poisoned people.

272
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,310
Also, she's running for
the position of Sword Master

273
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,370
on a promise to protect the innocent.

274
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,670
Therefore,
the more serious the poison crisis is,

275
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,950
the more people will follow

276
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,820
and support

277
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,860
Xifang Tao.

278
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,670
By contrast,

279
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,390
Tang Lici and the princess

280
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,050
have set off on bumpier roads.

281
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,270
The former needs to atone
for Liu Yan's sins,

282
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,070
while the latter bears
court-appointed responsibilities.

283
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,400
Neither of them can turn their backs
on the poisoned people.

284
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,310
But how many people in this world

285
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,490
are willing to risk getting infected

286
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,190
to speak up for those

287
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,070
who deserve death?

288
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,950
Suppose you weren't

289
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,810
the top assassin of Shisan Tower,

290
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,460
but just

291
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,100
an ordinary person
with no means of self-protection,

292
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,670
who...

293
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,680
will you choose?

294
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,100
Lici,

295
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,750
there you are.

296
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,030
I've brought you

297
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,230
those precious herbs

298
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,720
you asked for last time.

299
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,860
Blood?

300
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,900
I didn't ask for this.

301
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
My blood contains

302
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,500
the power of the Rebirth Scroll

303
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,220
and resists all kinds of poison.

304
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,910
I used it on you previously
when I suppressed

305
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,910
the toxins in you.

306
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,670
When you're about
to be killed by the Evil Pills,

307
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,270
you'll know how useful it is.

308
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,250
Show me your wrist!

309
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,310
If the Rebirth Scroll is the same

310
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,100
as before,

311
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,060
why hasn't your wound

312
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,820
healed yet?

313
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,390
Did you

314
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,250
save lives with your blood again?

315
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,500
The wound will heal eventually.

316
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,680
The Rebirth Scroll

317
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,150
shouldn't be wasted
on such trivial matters.

318
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,610
Can you stop putting on a brave front?

319
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,750
How much more blood can you lose?

320
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,340
More than you can.

321
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,930
If you die before I do,

322
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,630
I'll quit working on the antidote.

323
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:53,860
Liu Yan,

324
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,670
I won't die.

325
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,590
Before you finish making the antidote,

326
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,270
I won't let you die either.

327
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,350
Always keep this in mind:

328
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,319
you must get the antidote done

329
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,060
to make amends for your misdeeds

330
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,190
to those you harmed.

331
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,060
No.

332
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,670
No!

333
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,190
No.

334
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,640
This time you must listen to me.

335
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,109
You must listen to me!

336
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,950
Liu Yan!

337
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,390
When will you cut off this madness?

338
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,780
You must listen to me.

339
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,829
You must!

340
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,500
The tea is ready.

341
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,730
I used the Longjing tea leaves
from behind the village.

342
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,270
Mr. Tang, have a cup of it too.

343
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,830
It's very tasty.

344
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,410
The villagers all like it.

345
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,240
Let me refill your cup.

346
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,260
Don't bother.

347
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,220
He has never liked

348
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,640
Longjing tea since he was little.

349
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,160
I see the Sword Alliance

350
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,110
can't afford the tea you usually enjoy.

351
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,100
When did you learn
to settle for the less ideal?

352
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,190
Occasionally

353
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,520
forcing myself to do what I'm reluctant to

354
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,350
actually feels nice.

355
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,310
Thanks for the tea, Miss.

356
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,880
The future herb deliveries...

357
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,020
will be made

358
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,020
by Master Shao as before.

359
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,030
Stop testing the concoctions on yourself.

360
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,630
The well-being of all mankind

361
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,690
now depends on you.

362
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,270
Make sure you try your best.

363
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,870
Stop using your blood

364
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,730
to save others!

365
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,670
You ignored my advice again.

366
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,070
You never took my advice!

367
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,190
You disregarded my advice every time.

368
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,640
You just wouldn't take my advice.

369
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,070
No wonder you two
could be fellows in a sect.

370
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,510
[Tingyun Pavilion]

371
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,590
This...

372
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,590
should be enough to suppress

373
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,520
the toxins in Chi Yun for a few days.

374
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,390
Tang Lici.

375
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,430
Yique Yinyang?

376
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,190
This is...

377
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,640
Mount Baojing?

378
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,220
Why, to this day,

379
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,620
are you still so obstinate?

380
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,350
Have you not realized

381
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,110
that these vile and inferior beings

382
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,300
shouldn't exist at all?

383
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,630
What do you mean?

384
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,390
Are you feeling

385
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,300
you're completely useless now?

386
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,460
You thought you could save everyone

387
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,220
all by yourself.

388
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,830
Everything you've done

389
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,190
is nothing

390
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,910
but futile struggle.

391
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,480
You've even worn yourself down
to this state.

392
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,260
Nonsense!

393
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,330
We both come from the same place.

394
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,220
Soon, our homeland

395
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,500
will descend upon Shenzhou.

396
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,870
Tang Lici,

397
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,730
I can give you power.

398
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,990
We can become gods together.

399
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,910
You know where to find me.

400
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,060
Mr. Tang,

401
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,260
your meal

402
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,460
is placed at the door.

403
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,870
Here's a reminder from Master Shao:

404
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,130
please eat regularly during seclusion.

405
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,210
When did I fall asleep?

406
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,950
The bronze tree has been destroyed.

407
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,810
It's impossible
for Yique Yinyang to materialize.

408
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,230
Whatever plans Tianren Realm has,

409
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,030
they won't be fulfilled.

410
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,150
Why hasn't Mr. Tang Lici

411
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,670
arrived yet?

412
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,040
It's taking so long.

413
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,670
Yeah.

414
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,740
Why hasn't Mr. Tang

415
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,740
shown up yet?

416
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,670
Is something holding Mr. Tang back?

417
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,000
Among the 3 candidates,

418
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,410
he's the only one who hasn't arrived yet.

419
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,260
I can't believe

420
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,670
Mr. Tang actually lacks faith

421
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,950
in his ability to be elected Sword Master.

422
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,880
Or...

423
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,210
does he not care about the Sword Alliance
at all?

424
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,080
Master Shao,

425
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,590
it's about time.

426
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,840
Shall we start counting the votes?

427
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,500
Begin it now.

428
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:48,700
Yes.

429
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,260
The rules of the Central Plains

430
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,500
Sword Alliance for the election
of Sword Master are as follows.

431
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,630
Each regular disciple

432
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,460
has one vote.

433
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,980
Each elder

434
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,220
has 10 votes.

435
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,950
Each of the 3 Sword Masters

436
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,830
has 20 votes.

437
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,190
Each guest member

438
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,020
has 30 votes.

439
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,590
The presiding Sword Master

440
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,390
has 50 votes.

441
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,050
The candidate with the most votes

442
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,540
will be elected as Sword Master.

443
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,740
Over the past 15 days,

444
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,870
we have tallied the votes

445
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,270
from regular disciples.

446
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,460
Master Jiang Wenbo

447
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,720
is temporarily acting

448
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,980
as the Branch Chief
of the Investigation Hall.

449
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,980
Disciples under his command

450
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,180
amount to 124 people.

451
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,260
Twelve of them

452
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,450
vote for Tang Lici.

453
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,700
Ninety-seven of them

454
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,000
vote for Xifang Tao.

455
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,020

and 30 vote for

466
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,540
Zhong Chunji.

467
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,680
The Branch Chief of the Service Hall,
Xiao Qilan,

468
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,870
commands

469
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,790

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,300
Zhong Chunji.

476
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,570
In summary,

477
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,670
among the Sword Alliance's

478
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,800

Master Cheng and Master Puzhu

are absent from the election.

515
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,630
So, we will now

516
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,150
proceed to count the ballots.

517
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:40,880

Xifang Tao

received 680 votes.

523
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,080
Miss Xifang got 680 votes?

524
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:58,780
I misjudged it.

525
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,870
Miss Xifang got quite a lot of votes.

526
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,670
Therefore...

527
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,870
Master Cheng asked me

528
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,800

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,780
I voluntarily

568
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,700
offer all the votes I got

569
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,150
to another candidate.

570
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,870
I-Is that even allowed?

571
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,910
I believe...

572
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,990
that candidate is the perfect fit.

573
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,300
This person...

574
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,630
is Mr. Tang.

575
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,540
Mr. Tang?

576
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:40,830
Ms. Zhong,

577
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,860
I think of you as a friend.

578
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,540
It's true

579
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,880
that you have your own agenda,

580
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,460
but you do intend to do

581
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,420
what's in my best interest.

582
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,300
Such

583
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,590
kindness

584
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,720
is not what I need, though.

585
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,490
You don't blame me?

586
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,090
You actually...

587
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:16,700
understand me?

588
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,540
I

589
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,080
understand you.

590
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,980
But I wouldn't say I don't blame you.

591
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,020
Take this flower as an example.

592
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,720
There will always be

593
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,280
someone plucking it

594
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,870
out of fondness,

595
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,070
yet getting hurt by it

596
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,540
at the same time.

597
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,550
Such is the entanglement

598
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,350
of fate.

599
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,080
It's pointless

600
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,220
to blame

601
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,900
the flower or the person.

602
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,670
The past is behind us.

603
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,130
It's better to look ahead.

604
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,020
There are

605
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,700
more beautiful views in front of us.

606
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,700
What's done is done.

607
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,700
Truth

608
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,260
and falsehood

609
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
no longer matter.

610
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,540
As long as the blooms are pretty,

611
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,080
someone will find them adorable
eventually.

612
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,850
So you've known everything
the entire time.

613
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,460
Ms. Zhong,

614
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,220
since...

615
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,360
you've chosen to be a princess,

616
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,560
I hope...

617
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,590
you can be

618
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,520
the kind of princess you wish to be.

619
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,540
Xifang Tao said something

620
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,270
quite right.

621
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,980
"The Sword Master
doesn't have to be the princess."

622
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,440
"He or she can be
a friend of the princess's."

623
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,060
Yuchi Hu!

624
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,150
The votes received by Princess Lang Ya

625
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,090
shall be transferred to Tang Lici.

626
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,750
Everyone, please take a look.

627
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,300
Great!

628
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,350
So it was written beforehand!

629
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,220
Why not tell us earlier?

630
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,300
How dramatic!

631
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,530
Therefore,

632
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,270
Mr. Tang has received a total

633
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,220
of 1,002 votes.

634
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,590
That is to say,

635
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,270
Mr. Tang has the most votes now.

636
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,700
Everyone,

637
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,610
the new Sword Master is...

638
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,430
Tang Lici.

639
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,630
This is great!

640
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,190
Greetings, Sword Master.

641
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,550
Congratulations, Mr. Tang.

642
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,020
Miss Xifang,

643
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,500
thank you.

644
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,700
I'm wondering

645
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,190
if you, Master Tang, will do your utmost

646
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,590
to protect

647
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,780
the innocent.

648
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,220
We only disagree on how to

649
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,950
deal with the poisoned people.

650
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,890
But about capturing the head of the evil,

651
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,190
namely Liu Yan, we've always been

652
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,910
on the same page.

653
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:24,830
Right?

654
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,870
It's wrong!

655
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:38,980
Wrong!

656
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,260
Wrong...

657
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,710
It's wrong!

658
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,710
Why are all the concoctions wrong?

659
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:46,910
Yan!

660
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,700
What happened?

661
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,910
That antidote was clearly working.

662
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,310
Why would it suddenly...

663
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,740
Yan, what are you doing?

664
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,780
Yan, it's me.

665
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,710
Wake up!

666
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,920
Don't blame me.

667
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,680
Is this the antidote you made?

668
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,060
You're still doing tests on yourself?

669
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,460
Didn't Tang Lici tell you

670
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,190
to just present your formula

671
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,060
to Shui Duopo?

672
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,430
Why are you still using

673
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,960
yourself as a test subject?

674
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,380
Give me that bottle with yellow tassels...

675
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,510
Be quick!

676
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,740
Yan!

677
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,700
The Blood Ghost Pills
contain a potent poison.

678
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,150
The cure for it is also a poison.

679
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,540
How am I supposed to know if it's safe

680
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,070
without testing it myself?

681
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,700
I'll catch some poisoned people

682
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,500
as your test subjects.

683
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,020
No!

684
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:42,910
Xiaohong, do you know why Lici

685
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,440
doesn't come here anymore?

686
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,990
He must be facing

687
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,740
some serious difficulties.

688
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,980
We can't make an appearance

689
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,980
at a time like this

690
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,860
and cause trouble to Lici.

691
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,050
Then give me the antidote.

692
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,950
Test it on me.

693
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,540
No.

694
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,110
I need you to quickly find a way
to get in contact

695
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,020
with Shui Duopo and tell her the making

696
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,740
of the antidote will take some more time,

697
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,390
and that hasty moves must be avoided.

698
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:04,950
Yan!

699
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,310
The time is pressing.

700
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,010
Only the antidote can help Li.

701
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:17,980
Stop it...

702
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,750
At this rate, you'll die!

703
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,980
What's the point of living

704
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,580
if I can't make the antidote?

705
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,389
Don't!

706
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,179
Miss Shui,

707
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,760
only you and I are here.

708
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:37,830
No need

709
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,090
to focus on my illness.

710
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,070
The antidote is more important.

711
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:47,460
Your condition has finally improved a bit.

712
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,739
Though you're no longer the Sword Master,

713
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,600
at least you're lucky to be alive.

714
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,909
My pulse is indeed

715
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:55,570
much more stable than before.

716
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,909
Miss Shui,

717
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,310
about that formula I showed you

718
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,350
a few days ago...

719
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,330
Master Shao, your medical skills

720
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,140
have really improved remarkably.

721
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,140
In a few more days,

722
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,730
maybe you should replace me

723
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,350
as the Physician of Miracle.

724
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,750
I've made a pill

725
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,010
based on that formula.

726
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,660
Chi Yun learned about it

727
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,390
and insisted on giving it a try.

728
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,830
I couldn't stand his pestering,

729
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,160
so I gave him half a pill.

730
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,180
He also asked me

731
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,790
to keep it secret from Tang Lici,

732
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,730
saying that he'd give

733
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,790
Tang Lici a surprise a few days later.

734
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,180
It's time for Tang Lici to stop

735
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,180
drawing blood from himself, right?

736
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,910
Thank you.

737
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,950
I had the poisoned people escorted

738
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,790
to the Sword King City for treatment.

739
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,500
Those who came back from the task told me

740
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,270
a discovery there—

741
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,580
the Black Tuli produced by the dead

742
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,580
had disappeared.

743
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,060
It might have been stolen

744
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,460
by someone highly skilled in martial arts.

745
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,840
Ghostly Peony is dead.

746
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,160
Who else would need Black Tuli?

747
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,830
That's what I've been thinking too.

748
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,140
Master Tang, bad news!

749
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,910
Mr. Chi...

750
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,660
fainted.

751
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,270
I underestimated

752
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,390
the toxicity of the Blood Ghost Pills.

753
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,190
I thought Chi Yun had recovered.

754
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,350
Even if you drain up

755
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,140
your blood,

756
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,060
how many people can you save?

757
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,190
If the antidote can't be...

758
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,580
Come in!

759
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,980
The antidote?

760
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,580
Didn't you say the making of the antidote

761
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,750
was far from completion?

762
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,880
Why is there suddenly a breakthrough?

763
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,060
It's great news.

764
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,660
Why keep it from us?

765
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,430
Senior Shui, I wonder

766
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:51,430
what kind of medical expert
has offered you guidance.

767
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,780
You have such sharp ears, Master Jiang.

768
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,400
Who told you there was a breakthrough?

769
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,100
Before the antidote is made,

770
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,750
Master Tang, please keep Mr. Chi

771
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,620
in prison,

772
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,570
so as to soothe the nerves
of all jianghu heroes.

773
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,910
Mr. Tang,
since you're the Sword Master now,

774
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,540
I don't think

775
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,670
you need my reminders on such matters.

776
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,580
Senior Shui,

777
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,910
please feed him

778
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,710
one more Worry-Relieving Pill.

779
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,910
When he wakes up,

780
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,390
I will personally

781
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,910
escort him to prison.

782
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,980
I meant to seek a chance
to impeach Tang Lici

783
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,440
based on Chi Yun's matter,

784
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,140
so he'd step down as Sword Master.

785
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,750
Yet he didn't fall for my trick.

786
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,210
Miss Xifang, don't worry.

787
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,180
His weaknesses will be revealed
sooner or later.

788
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,230
Last time when I escorted prisoners

789
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,490
to the Sword King City,

790
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,350
the people there said

791
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,660
Black Tuli had gone missing.

792
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,870
They suspected some members

793
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,140
of Fengliu Shop were at large

794
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,340
and stole that thing.

795
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,010
Is it possible that...

796
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,620
Shut up!

797
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:57,090
We've already eliminated Fengliu Shop.

798
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,490
What members at large could there be?

799
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,950
Stop talking nonsense.

800
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,270
We didn't mean to speak out of turn.

801
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,930
This matter seems rather odd.

802
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,400
Every disciple's been talking about it.

803
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,020
Alright.

804
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,910
No need to make a fuss.

805
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,870
Black Tuli decomposes

806
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,020
on its own in an hour

807
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,750
after leaving its host bodies.

808
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,060
I guess the disciples are spreading

809
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,100
false information due to lack of knowledge

810
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,660
about the nature of this substance.

811
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,390
There's no need to panic at all.

812
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,310
Yes.

813
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:35,910
Chi,

814
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,490
you must've suffered.

815
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,950
Tell me the truth.

816
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,880
Am I beyond help?

817
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,660
How could that be?

818
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,020
In this world,

819
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,280
there's no poison Mr. Tang can't tackle.

820
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,350
Plus, we have Senior Shui's help.

821
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,180
The other disciples are just

822
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,510
being overly cautious.

823
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,000
You look quite well.

824
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,660
I guess you'll recover soon.

825
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,460
When the toxins in you are cleared,

826
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,860
I'll treat you to drinks.

827
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,510
Mr. Tang,

828
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,280
goodbye.

829
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,100
You guys,

830
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,580
guard this cell day and night.

831
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,140
Don't let anyone approach it.

832
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,660
Yes.

833
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,180
If I'll truly recover soon,

834
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,980
why am I still chained up?

835
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:21,910
Foxy Tang,

836
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,710
are you lying to me again?

837
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,990
When have I ever lied to you?

838
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:26,970
Just relax.

839
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,230
I'm able to cure you.

840
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,700
Foxy Tang,

841
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,460
I saw

842
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,060
what the poison did to Jiang Cheng,

843
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,870
and heard

844
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,730
what Jiang Wenbo and others said.

845
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,980
Just tell me the truth.

846
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,660
Am I...

847
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,140
beyond help?

848
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,960
Since it's a poison,

849
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,580
there must be an antidote for it.

850
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,100
What?

851
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,200
You don't trust me?

852
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,430
I do.

853
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,100
Now, except you,

854
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,230
a white-haired fox,

855
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,040
who else can I trust?

856
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,230
Drink this up.

857
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,160
Why is this stuff again?

858
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,920
It tastes like rust.

859
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,930
Do you want to drink it yourself,

860
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,980
or let me get in,

861
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,610
press your acupoints,

862
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,910
and pour it down your throat?

863
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,310
You're

864
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,350
bullying me

865
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,150
just because I'm chained up now.

866
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,910
You'll feel better
when you get used to it.

867
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:29,710
Get used to it?

868
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,150
I have to drink that stuff again?

869
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,770
Take it or leave it.

870
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,110
What does that mean?

871
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,750
D-Don't leave, Foxy Tang!

872
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,680
Explain it to me!

873
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,710
Don't leave!

874
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,690
Explain what you just said!

875
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:46,950
Foxy Tang!

876
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,580
Xifang Tao probably have doubts

877
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,580
about the origin of the formula now.

878
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,260
Liu Yan's location must not be exposed.

879
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:04,910
My blood

880
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,270
can no longer fully suppress

881
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,470
the toxins in Chi Yun.

882
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,100
Shui Duopo's recent experiments

883
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,760
have produced zero progress.

884
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,230
It seems

885
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,950
I'll have to try making blood serum.

886
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,460
Though the process is complex,

887
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,460
and the cost huge,

888
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:46,830
blood serum

889
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,490
is more effective than blood.

890
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,470
A new poison emerged,

891
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,190
and the crystal was stolen.

892
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,870
Those were not coincidences.

893
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,910
Those who take the Blood Ghost Pill

894
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,510
will produce a black crystal

895
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,740
called Black Tuli inside their bodies.

896
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,390
It's the best nourishment
for the bronze tree.

897
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,720
Xifang Tao never left the Sword Alliance.

898
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:40,870
Who has kept

899
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,980
stealing the crystal?

900
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,950
And was that dream...

901
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,830
really just a dream?

902
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,870
We both come from the same place.

903
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,310
Soon, our homeland

904
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,100
will descend upon Shenzhou.

905
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,390
Tang Lici,

906
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,600
you know where to find me.

907
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,060
He has repaired his body so quickly.

908
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,740
How many more secrets

909
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,710
are there about the bronze tree?

910
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,750
It's almost dawn.

911
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,110
You'd better...

912
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,060
leave right away.
