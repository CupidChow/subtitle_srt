[Whispers of Fate]

2
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,910
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,360
Master Puzhu, since you're here,

4
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,420
why hide yourself?

5
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,560
It's cold and windy outside.

6
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,310
Please come join us.

7
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,340
Have a taste of

8
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,070
the food and drink

9
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,420
I personally prepared.

10
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,430
It is Master Puzhu.

11
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,789
I observe strict religious precepts.

12
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,190
I'm afraid I can't accept

13
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,430
your food and wine.

14
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,680
Perhaps you should offer them to the souls

15
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,810
of the Ranqing Sect who died unjustly.

16
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,940
Sir, do you believe

17
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,800
I killed those people?

18
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,079
Even if it wasn't you directly,

19
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,430
you were still involved.

20
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,430
You're truly blinded by prejudice.

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
Or perhaps

22
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,520
you and the Central Plains Sword Alliance

23
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,310
are willingly

24
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,710
being manipulated by the Blood Ghost Pill?

25
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,730
The one known to kill all with one strike,

26
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,310
Shisan Tower's

27
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,080
Shen Langhun.

28
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,120
This is

29
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,730
the evidence you wanted me to see?

30
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,630
He's wounded.

31
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,720
Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

32
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,190
The Sword King has been
by my side all along.

33
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,470
When did you fight him?

34
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,510
Strange, isn't it?

35
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,960
Master Puzhu

36
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm afraid you've fallen into
Yu Qifeng's trap.

37
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,240
Yu Qifeng killing to silence witnesses

38
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,370
is nothing unusual.

39
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,240
But the dead

40
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,220
cannot come back to life.

41
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,890
Yu Qifeng will be exposed eventually.

42
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,080
That's why Mr. Tang

43
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,190
deliberately took me
to the Tianyan Sword Wall.

44
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,250
It was to force Yu Qifeng to make a move

45
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,740
and frame me before the public trial.

46
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,190
Shen Langhun,

47
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,070
it's you!

48
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,830
And Master Puzhu,

49
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,870
you happened to become the witness.

50
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,150
To prove that

51
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,590
the Shen Langhun I was chasing

52
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,650
was an impostor...

53
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,000
I had the self-proclaimed

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,430
clever Sword King Yu

55
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,360
to create

56
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
an alibi for Shen.

57
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,920
Shen Langhun!

58
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,450
What a clever counter-scheme.

59
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,420
When a rat steals food,

60
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,400
is it possible for it
to be caught by a cat

61
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,190
while simultaneously

62
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,850
being trapped in a mousetrap?

63
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,920
Certainly not.

64
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,830
Then,

65
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,160
the rat

66
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,890
with its tail cut off by the trap

67
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,440
cannot be the same one in the cat's paws.

68
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,430
This is merely

69
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,290
Mr. Tang's one-sided statement.

70
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,130
I'm not here to clear my name.

71
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,560
I only want Master Puzhu

72
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,990
to know there are
other suspicious individuals.

73
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,630
You shouldn't focus solely on me.

74
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,120
Don't you want to know

75
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,360
where the rat

76
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,070
that you couldn't catch today

77
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,190
came from?

78
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,330
Tomorrow at noon,

79
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,120
you are cordially invited

80
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,250
to the Lake Pavilion

81
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,970
in Sword King City.

82
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,710
You still haven't told us

83
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,800
about what you and that monk outside

84
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,460
were being mysterious about.

85
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,600
Master Puzhu

86
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,860
is a lay disciple of Tianjing Pavilion.

87
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,030
What were you and that rat

88
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,480
being mysterious about?

89
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,430
Master Puzhu is the cat.

90
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,490
What about the rat then?

91
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,590
The rat is obviously...

92
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,630
Shen always wears black

93
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,880
and likes to hide in shadows to kill.

94
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,540
He really does resemble a rat.

95
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,390
He's angry?

96
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,820
He got angry at that?

97
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
That's unnecessary.

98
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,880
Chi, what's wrong?

99
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,560
Zhong.

100
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,630
Well,

101
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,390
Shen has also been to the dungeon.

102
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,000
How can we prove

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,280
he didn't kill Jiang Qingyu?

104
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,340
No need to prove it.

105
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,600
Because there's no need to clear

106
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
my suspicion.

107
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,090
I just need to make Puzhu

108
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,390
suspect Yu Qifeng

109
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,780
and the goal

110
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
will be achieved.

111
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,990
Foxy Tang,

112
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,510
you're something else!

113
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,970
Don't celebrate too soon.

114
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:45,860
Why?

115
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:46,920
I'm guessing

116
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,920
the upcoming public trial at Qiongtai

117
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,800
is where Yu Qifeng

118
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,200
plans to turn the tables.

119
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,060
It's a trap?

120
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,490
Then are we still going?

121
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,390
Of course we are.

122
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
It's time

123
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,420
to turn the tables on them.

124
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:16,910
Miss Hong,

125
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,190
I never thought

126
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,670
Puzhu's Light Technique
would be so powerful.

127
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,070
I almost got exposed.

128
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
You went to great lengths

129
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,310
to lure Puzhu in there.

130
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,920
Yet he didn't take anyone away.

131
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,530
Shen Langhun wasn't captured?

132
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,830
Why?

133
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,360
You weren't exposed,

134
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,960
but Yu Qifeng

135
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,750
was.

136
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,169
I don't understand.

137
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,120
Why does the Master

138
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,480
insist on using this fool

139
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,640
to deal with Tang Lici?

140
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,470
Even if the Master doesn't trust us,

141
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,900
if we called on
the East and West Palace Chiefs,

142
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,760
we could've dealt with Tang Lici.

143
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,280
We have more important matters

144
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,370
to attend to in Sword King City.

145
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,970
What about Yu Qifeng?

146
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,930
We needn't concern ourselves
with his fate.

147
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,180
Commander, we lost them.

148
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,550
Chi,

149
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,290
drinking on an empty stomach isn't good.

150
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,490
Have some sweet soup.

151
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,510
It doesn't feel right.

152
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,550
Shen went off

153
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,630
with Foxy Tang to fight.

154
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,230
Thank you.

155
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,030
I, the great master Cloud,

156
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,840
am reduced to drinking sweet soup here.

157
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,720
That move...

158
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,510
Could it be him?

159
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,850
An old friend has returned.

160
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,910
It's him. So cool!

161
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,910
Such a greeting is truly...

162
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,870
something I've rarely seen before.

163
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,440
Don't hit below the belt.

164
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,280
Beauty,

165
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,980
what happened just now

166
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,710
was because I saw you all

167
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,010
looking so glum,

168
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,270
and wanted to cheer you up.

169
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,670
It was carefully prepared.

170
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,910
Convincing, wasn't it?

171
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,510
Miss Shei, please accept it.

172
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,360
Otherwise,

173
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,370
Senior Xue might not

174
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,240
sleep well for the whole year

175
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,670
after that embarrassment.

176
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,060
Thank you.

177
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,070
Senior Xue Xianzi,

178
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,360
I was the glummest person just now.

179
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,680
Do I also get

180
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,840
flowers?

181
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,410
Yes.

182
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,260
There's food to eat.

183
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,320
Let's eat first.

184
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,120
Let's eat.

185
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,840
Not to brag,

186
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,010
but I, Xue Xianzi,

187
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,720
was born to enjoy the good life.

188
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,050
Look,

189
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,720
even though I owe you money,

190
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,670
you still have to

191
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,060
treat me to fine food and wine, don't you?

192
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,910
Just for this alone,

193
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,440
you're being very good to me.

194
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,030
If there's even one fingerprint

195
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,320
on this clothing,

196
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,690
your repayment period

197
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,400
will likely be extended by another year.

198
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,580
This little fox

199
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,160
dresses opulently every day.

200
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,120
Don't you know

201
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,000
to hide your wealth?

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,330
Come.

203
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:01,610
Let me.

204
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,910
Let me, let me.

205
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,080
Senior, Senior,

206
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,030
I, Chi Yun, have admired you
for a long time.

207
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,910
At Tiandu Peak,

208
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,030
you fought fiercely
against the Jile Sect's nine villains.

209
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,240
At Maoya Peak, you swept through
thousands of troops.

210
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,770
With just one sword strike,

211
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,000
you made the master
of Jiangling's Yu family...

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,790
Yang family.

213
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,690
Made the master of Jiangling's Yang family

214
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,920
too scared to say a word.

215
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,640
What heroic bearing!

216
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,890
Well, I've been out of practice
for a long time.

217
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,140
Let's not mention
such trivial matters anymore.

218
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,410
Don't mention it again.

219
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:36,890
Senior,

220
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,200
I have

221
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,910
a treasured portrait here.

222
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,720
I'd like to ask you to...

223
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,120
I...

224
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,390
I...

225
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,000
Here.

226
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,200
When you pressed here,

227
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,730
pressing on your own heart,

228
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,190
it was like pressing on my heart too.

229
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,260
But seriously,

230
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,870
that old Yu's Westwind Slashing Wildfire

231
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,200
did have some issues.

232
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,310
The Eight Winds Yanhuang Sword Manual

233
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,820
has always been powered
by righteous energy.

234
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,910
But his sword essense

235
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,970
had surprisingly heavy evil energy.

236
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,360
So,

237
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,240
just Yu Qifeng alone

238
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
is enough to give anyone a headache.

239
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,500
If

240
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,270
that sworn brother of yours

241
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,600
comes looking for you

242
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,570
and they join forces,

243
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,750
then that fox head of yours

244
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,210
will be chopped off again.

245
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:29,670
Of course,

246
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,030
if you receive help

247
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,720
from a rare master...

248
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,370
For only 20,000,

249
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,690
I can manage to do it.

250
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:44,730
No need.

251
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,360
At least name a price.

252
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,070
Ten thousand.

253
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,740
Before I leave Sword King City,

254
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,820
if I need you again,

255
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,390
you must help.

256
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,810
Ten thousand is too little.

257
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,680
I won't fight Puzhu,

258
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,650
won't fight Yu Qifeng,

259
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,510
and won't fight your sworn enemy.

260
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,120
That won't do.

261
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,750
If you get killed,

262
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:04,980
who

263
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,300
will I collect my debt from?

264
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,610
You clever fox.

265
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,900
Ten thousand it is.

266
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,090
It's almost noon.

267
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,280
Mr. Tang, shouldn't you be leaving

268
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,240
to meet with Master Puzhu?

269
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,200
Scheming isn't needed with a gentleman.

270
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,430
Sincerity is all that's needed.

271
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,440
Last night, Master Puzhu

272
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,840
did not capture Shen.

273
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,200
Yu Qifeng and Fengliu Shop's plot

274
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,630
to kill by another's hand

275
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,520
has already failed.

276
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,510
To win with a follow-up move,

277
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,360
we must expose the connection

278
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,560
between the Yu family

279
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,120
and Fengliu Shop to everyone.

280
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,080
Turning their attack
against them is the best strategy.

281
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,270
But Yu Qifeng isn't stupid.

282
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,130
He must have hidden the evidence.

283
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,410
A cornered dog will seek its master.
That's when the show begins.

284
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,770
Foxy Tang.

285
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,150
What's my task?

286
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,040
I'm standing right here.

287
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,610
Can't you see me?

288
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,550
Patience.

289
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,150
Master Puzhu

290
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,680
came here for the Evil Pill.

291
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,150
We should certainly help him

292
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,030
find evidence

293
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,810
of Yu Qifeng's involvement
with it.

294
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,470
Only then will we have leverage
to work with him.

295
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,840
However,

296
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,030
this evidence

297
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,030
must be hidden very well.

298
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
But I have my ways

299
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,840
to make the evidence come to us.

300
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,910
This most difficult task

301
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,390
will fall upon you,

302
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,870
great hero Chi.

303
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,640
Am I that important?

304
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:01,960
Tell me.

305
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,880
What do you want me to do?

306
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,880
This task

307
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,829
is both fun and impressive.

308
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,280
Moreover,

309
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,010
you'll have three subordinates,

310
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:16,650
guaranteeing quite an impressive presence.

311
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,089
That's exactly what I want.

312
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,609
What?

313
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,089
How is this a nice task?

314
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,200
So, Mr. Tang

315
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,530
called us to gather here

316
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,080
just for...

317
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,750
Take a look!

318
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,860
Fragrant and sweet!

319
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,590
Baked flatbread!

320
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,550
Sir,

321
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,570
a bowl of wontons, please.

322
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,900
You go ahead.

323
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,610
There are too many people here.

324
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,690
You do it.

325
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,590
What?

326
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,190
The master of Wanqiao Chamber?

327
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,320
Yes,

328
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,650
it's that master of Wanqiao Chamber.

329
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,750
People say

330
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,760
he's part of the imperial family

331
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,270
and is in charge of
the imperial family's procurement.

332
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,930
The money he handles each year

333
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,640
amounts to half the empire's wealth.

334
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,270
Since it's procurement,

335
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,600
there must be imperial transport, right?

336
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,030
I just wonder

337
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,830
which shipping company he uses.

338
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,350
I think I heard that

339
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,070
they...

340
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
they came here this time

341
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,550
to find

342
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,960
a suitable fleet

343
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,660
to transport their goods.

344
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,720
Wanqiao Chamber

345
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,170
is wealthy beyond measure.

346
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,920
What treasures don't they have?

347
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,000
If this deal goes through,

348
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,180
we'll definitely get rich.

349
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,940
However,

350
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't know

351
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,420
how to contact with them.

352
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,830
It's actually quite simple.

353
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,110
Wanqiao Chamber is opening

354
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,050
a branch in Sword King City.

355
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,680
They need the Boat Guild right now.

356
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,750
They only require

357
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,580
cooperation with major clients
for over 3 years

358
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,550
and you can go
discuss details at the dock.

359
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,350
Since this is a key location
for imperial transport,

360
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,550
there should be many qualified candidates.

361
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,210
Indeed, there should be many.

362
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:04,790
I

363
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,750
happen to have worked with
Sword King Yu before,

364
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,350
so I believe

365
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,070
I meet Wanqiao Chamber's requirements.

366
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,750
Is that so?

367
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,200
I'll go now

368
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,880
and have my assistant

369
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,160
prepare the account books.

370
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,690
This way,

371
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,480
I can prove my qualifications.

372
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,160
I should prepare thoroughly as well.

373
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:21,960
Wait.

374
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,160
Did you hear that?

375
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,010
What a great opportunity!

376
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,720
I need to hurry

377
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,400
and prepare my account books too.

378
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,200
If I'm late, I'll miss my chance.

379
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,920
Foxy Tang, the fish is in the pond.

380
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,480
Sir, you left in such a hurry.

381
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,400
Our conversation was cut short last night,

382
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,330
so I had to trouble you again today.

383
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,370
Before you start making excuses,

384
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,310
I have

385
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,050
a few questions to ask.

386
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,230
Please go ahead, Sir.

387
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,500
In the Hao Wenhou murder case,

388
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,710
with your abilities,

389
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,530
if you had acted sooner,

390
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,240
Yang Shangqing wouldn't have been

391
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,370
silenced by murder.

392
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,140
Jiang Cheng

393
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,160
wouldn't have died either.

394
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,030
For those who tainted
by the Blood Ghost Pill,

395
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,290
it's merely a question of

396
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,940
dying sooner or later.

397
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,940
In the Yanmen Sect incident,

398
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,880
even Master Jiang

399
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,480
couldn't do anything to you.

400
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,140
You willingly entered Yanmen's prison

401
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,200
to lure the Fengliu Shop into action.

402
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,760
If not for this,

403
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
how could I have drawn out

404
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,280
a big fish like Yu Qifeng?

405
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,480
But have you ever considered

406
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,440
that Miss Zhong and those close to you

407
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,740
were put in danger because of this,

408
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,950
as was Yanmen Sect?

409
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,860
Innocent people might've been implicated.

410
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,750
What about those
poisoned by the Blood Ghost Pill?

411
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,210
Aren't they innocent too?

412
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,970
Sacrificing the innocent
to save the innocent

413
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:55,880
is not justice,

414
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,270
nor is it heroic.

415
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,180
I never claimed to be a hero,

416
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,750
nor have I ever pretended
to stand for justice.

417
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,720
These concepts are useless

418
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,070
in the face

419
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,440
of real conspiracies and schemes.

420
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,310
Sophistry!

421
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,860
You're stubbornly unrepentant.

422
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,590
I must ask you

423
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,540
to leave Sword King City immediately.

424
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,400
As for Yu Qifeng

425
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
and his collusion with the Fengliu Shop,

426
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,330
I will investigate it personally.

427
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,510
So, are you saying

428
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,960
you already know

429
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,460
where the other rat

430
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,830
came from?

431
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,070
You and Master Shao

432
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,640
of the Sword Alliance

433
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,510
have both been searching

434
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,160
for the Fengliu Shop

435
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,960
without any success,

436
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,250
right?

437
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,110
If you want to find

438
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,200
the mastermind behind the Fengliu Shop,

439
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,840
you

440
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,000
can't do it without me.

441
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,440
As for everything else,

442
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,110
I'm not interested.

443
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,000
So the lives of others

444
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,880
mean nothing to you?

445
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,720
You would sacrifice everyone

446
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,220
just to force out that one person?

447
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,550
You disregard human lives.

448
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,280
Keeping you here
would bring endless trouble.

449
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,430
Our paths differ.

450
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,570
We can still work together.

451
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,070
While we're here

452
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,130
discussing these useless feelings,

453
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,140
the mastermind behind all this

454
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,000
may already be making their move.

455
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,650
If trouble stirs in the city again,

456
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,070
will it

457
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,440
really be my fault

458
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,200
or yours?

459
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,310
Please allow me to take your pulse.

460
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,440
Candied haws!

461
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,550
Sweet candied haws!

462
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,790
Come take a look!

463
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,680
Little charms!

464
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,510
Fragrant and sweet!

465
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,370
Thank you, sir.

466
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,110
Take care.

467
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,550
Mom, we have a kite now!

468
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,480
We can finally go fly it!

469
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,400
Yes, hold it carefully.

470
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,310
Kites!

471
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,910
Kites!

472
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,920
Come see!

473
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,790
Fox kites!

474
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,320
Sir,

475
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,880
the third day of the Sword Duel Festival

476
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,260
happens to be the Double Ninth Festival.

477
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,110
This fox kite symbolizes
good fortune and prosperity.

478
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,510
Would you like to buy one?

479
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,440
The Double Ninth Festival

480
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,040
is perfect for flying kites.

481
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,400
Fly?

482
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,940
How could I possibly let him go?

483
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,310
Get out of here!

484
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,770
No money, no treatment.

485
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,480
Get lost!

486
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,880
Go as far as you can.

487
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,140
Don't dirty our place.

488
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,550
You want to get treated without money?

489
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,680
Please, have mercy.

490
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,650
My chest hurts.

491
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:43,810
Have mercy?

492
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,030
Get away from here,

493
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,960
you sick wretch.

494
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,400
I can tell

495
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,650
you don't have much time left anyway.

496
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,300
I'll do you a favor today.

497
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,300
Go buy a mat to be buried in.

498
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,410
I'll accept

499
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,880
this consultation fee.

500
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,240
Try breathing in and out three times.

501
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,030
It doesn't hurt anymore.

502
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,830
It really doesn't hurt anymore.

503
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,200
Impressive!

504
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,030
This young man's medical skills
are remarkable.

505
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,270
Just three needles
and the illness is gone.

506
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,930
I don't cough or itch anymore.

507
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,760
Benefactor.

508
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,190
Thank you, benefactor!

509
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,110
You truly are

510
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,170
a miracle doctor who heals the world.

511
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,590
A true miracle doctor!

512
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,920
So remarkable!

513
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,350
Thank you for your kindness.

514
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,680
Thank you, benefactor.

515
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,210
Thank you, benefactor.

516
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,440
Bravo!

517
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,350
So impressive!

518
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,750
Miracle doctor!

519
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,440
Amazing!

520
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,030
Great!

521
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,810
Miracle doctor!

522
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,160
Impressive.

523
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,550
After holding a sword to kill for so long,

524
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,310
I've almost forgotten

525
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,110
what it feels like
to use needles for acupuncture.

526
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,120
Lici.

527
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,820
This gentleman is not only kind,

528
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,100
but also so handsome.

529
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,920
Shallow.

530
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,540
Who are you talking about?

531
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,960
You even admire Foxy Tang.

532
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
You clearly don't understand this.

533
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,010
Miss Shei, let's go.

534
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,110
As if you're the only one with taste.

535
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,030
If I don't have taste, who does?

536
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,550
I wonder what it'll feel like

537
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,480
to kill these new friends

538
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,450
of yours.

539
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,470
What's wrong, Chi?

540
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,200
Let's go.

541
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,690
It's nothing.

542
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,140
Did you find anything?

543
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,680
The heart disease
has penetrated your bones.

544
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,410
Your vital energy is depleted.

545
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,540
Since your days are numbered,

546
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,490
why bother?

547
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,480
I don't have the same mindset as you, Sir.

548
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,940
I lack the enlightenment
to save all beings.

549
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,160
If I want to survive,

550
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,640
I must

551
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,780
find the mastermind behind Fengliu Shop.

552
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,980
Can he save your life?

553
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,830
Of course not.

554
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,970
Then what are you after?

555
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,440
He can't,

556
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,790
but finding him

557
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,230
can.

558
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,930
Since we are not adversaries,

559
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,050
we can cooperate.

560
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,910
Otherwise, we both lose.

561
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,740
It will only allow the Blood Ghost Pill

562
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,670
to continue spreading poison
throughout the world.

563
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,570
Everything you do

564
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,270
is just to save your own life.

565
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,150
It's precisely because

566
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,550
I only care about myself.

567
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,840
Thus,

568
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,960
what I want and what you want

569
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,480
are not in conflict.

570
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,580
Why should I conspire with

571
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,210
someone who cares about nothing?

572
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,140
Desperate times

573
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,100
call for desperate measures.

574
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,520
If we judge everything by intention,

575
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
nothing will ever be accomplished.

576
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,340
Master Puzhu and Master Shao,

577
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,200
the evidence you cannot find

578
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,440
using your honorable methods

579
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,610
is not difficult to obtain

580
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,740
for someone like me.

581
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,230
Just this point alone

582
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,310
is enough to tempt you, Sir.

583
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,960
How arrogant.

584
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,750
I certainly have reason to be arrogant.

585
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,550
Otherwise,

586
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,030
you wouldn't have

587
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,160
come personally to test my abilities.

588
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,880
The Sword Alliance has internal conflicts.

589
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,720
Master Shao

590
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,920
wants to start with Sword King City

591
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,580
to eliminate the Fengliu Shop

592
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,200
but lacks a suitable tool.

593
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,170
Am I right?

594
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,820
I'm not afraid of a bad reputation.

595
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,220
This particular quality

596
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,550
is perfectly useful

597
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,950
for you two.

598
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,170
However,

599
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,110
my sword only points

600
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,160
in the direction I choose.

601
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,150
Sir, if you still don't trust me,

602
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,730
why don't we

603
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,780
make a bet?

604
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,960
What bet?

605
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,240
I'll provide a list
of everyone in Sword King City

606
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
who has taken the Evil Pill,

607
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:52,990
as well as

608
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,720
evidence of Yu Qifeng

609
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,380
selling the Blood Ghost Pill.

610
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,650
Tonight,

611
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,940
I will personally deliver
the list and evidence

612
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,180
to you.

613
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,380
And

614
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,280
I won't harm a single innocent person.

615
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,580
What do you want in return?

616
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,070
Your cooperation with my plan.

617
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,520
Apart from that,

618
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,030
you must not interfere

619
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,430
with any other matters
within Sword King City.

620
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,630
You won't work with me

621
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,430
and instead want me

622
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,520
to stay out of it?

623
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
What's the wager?

624
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,550
If you interfere with matters
in Sword King City,

625
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,720
then you lose.

626
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,070
Conversely,

627
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,720
if I fail to

628
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,510
deliver the list and evidence to you,

629
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:36,990
or

630
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,720
if any innocent person is harmed

631
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,680
during the capture

632
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,550
of Yu Qifeng,

633
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,380
then I lose.

634
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,740
If I lose,

635
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,100
you may hand me over
to the Sword Alliance...

636
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,880
to be dealt with as they see fit.

637
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,280
Red leaves float,

638
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,550
red leaves swirl,

639
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,320
phoenix flowers bloom with ancient glory.

640
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,840
Test sword essence,

641
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,070
fly paper kites,

642
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,880
ascend together to honor the Yanhuang Way.

643
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,090
The battle of Tiandu Peak?

644
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,140
Thankfully, that demon is dead.

645
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,000
The seven masters

646
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,400
almost couldn't defeat him.

647
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,550
What kind of monster
are you talking about?

648
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,960
If it weren't for Master Xuanqing

649
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,760
and Head Fang,

650
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,760
we wouldn't have today's prosperity.

651
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,320
It's such a pity about Head Fang.

652
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,320
Such a good person

653
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,070
died just like that.

654
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,430
Lici,

655
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,360
why did you kill me?

656
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,310
Lici, why did you kill me?

657
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:22,860
Lici.

658
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,170
Lici.

659
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,540
Lici.

660
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:25,860
Thank you, sir.

661
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,360
What were you thinking about just now,

662
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,690
to be so lost in thought?

663
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,790
Can you help me choose

664
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,940
which of these two hairpins

665
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,080
suits me better?

666
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,550
This one

667
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,030
suits you better.

668
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,150
This hairpin is prettier.

669
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,670
This hairpin

670
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,120
is sharper and more pointed.

671
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,390
When you encounter bad people,

672
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,110
you can use it as a weapon.

673
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,170
There are many bones here.

674
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,020
Stab here

675
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,270
and it will be easier to succeed.

676
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,480
You're quite amusing, sir.

677
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,320
I'll remember that.

678
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:16,110
The master offers 30,000 taels of gold

679
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,360
to rent Qiongtai

680
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,360
for tomorrow's banquet.

681
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,910
Jiang Qingyu is dead,

682
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,490
so Shen Langhun is the culprit.

683
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,360
Master Puzhu and I

684
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,220
witnessed this with our own eyes.

685
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,490
If Tang Lici truly cares about the truth,

686
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,920
he should hand over Shen Langhun

687
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,630
to us

688
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,360
and explain to all martial arts fellows

689
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,840
why the criminal

690
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,010
happens to be his subordinate.

691
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,490
But the owner said someone framed him.

692
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,060
The master also says

693
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,400
only the true culprit

694
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
would get as angry as the Sword King.

695
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,210
The master knows everything.

696
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,250
It seems the Sword King
isn't so great after all.

697
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,080
Indeed, not so great.

698
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,670
Children speak without filters.

699
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,840
Please forgive them, Sword King.

700
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,550
However,

701
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,910
hosting this banquet

702
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,810
to reveal the truth to everyone

703
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,880
was also Master Puzhu's intention.

704
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,750
Sword King,

705
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,360
would you reconsider?

706
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,840
I'll allow it.

707
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,090
Thank you, Sword King.

708
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,590
This way, everyone.

709
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,840
Tang Lici!

710
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,130
I have used my own flesh and blood

711
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,660
to refine it for four years.

712
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,690
Once it's complete,

713
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,300
it will become your weakness.

714
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:43,570
Master,

715
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:44,860
you...

716
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,030
What is it?

717
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:52,210
Master, I, Yu Qifeng, request an audience.

718
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,630
Go back.

719
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,700
The Master doesn't want to see you.

720
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,320
Everyone thinks
they're good at planning and adapting,

721
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,050
hiding their true intentions.

722
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,880
But when facing major events,

723
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,080
decisions are often made in an instant,

724
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,670
driven by emotions,

725
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:20,990
such as jealousy,

726
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:21,970
anger,

727
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,730
and sadness.

728
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,830
They're irrational behaviors.

729
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,440
When someone looks at you
a moment too long,

730
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,880
you yell at them.

731
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,780
When someone insults you,

732
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,740
you must fight back.

733
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,280
If your loved ones
suffer from misfortunes,

734
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,400
you want to make the other party

735
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,280
and their entire family perish.

736
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,790
Huiniang.

737
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,190
An eye for an eye.

738
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,110
Huiniang.

739
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,150
Huiniang!

740
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,770
Promise me.

741
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,710
If you meet Liu Yan,

742
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,080
you must not act rashly.

743
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:50,960
Why?

744
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,230
I have my own way to help you get revenge.

745
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,070
But for now,

746
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:56,770
if you see him,

747
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,380
run away.

748
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,020
Promise me.

749
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,580
Promise me.

750
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,770
You always talk about justice,

751
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,070
but that's only
when things haven't happened

752
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:06,920
to yourself.

753
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,750
Once disaster befalls you,
all you'll think about

754
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,790
is an eye for an eye,

755
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,120
a tooth for a tooth.

756
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,400
Don't you think

757
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,000
I'm right?

758
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,410
It's my technique.

759
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,780
But who are you?

760
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,320
That look in your eyes...

761
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,170
You hate me.

762
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,890
We have a grudge?

763
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,410
You've gotten your revenge.

764
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,880
Are you happy now?

765
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,870
I remember now.

766
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,130
Your eyes.

767
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,150
You look like him.

768
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:07,280
Too bad.

769
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,550
With your limited skills,

770
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,180
you still can't kill me.

771
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,790
Shen... Lang... Hun.

Rebirth Scroll.

773
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,950
Tang Lici's things may be disgusting,

774
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,940
but they still have some use.

775
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,990
Die!
