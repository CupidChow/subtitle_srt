00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,940
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,120
Mother...

4
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,789
The Thousand-Armed and Thousand-Eyed

5
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:46,990
Unhindered Great Compassion Dharani.

6
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,240
What they're doing

7
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,700
won't help with anything.

8
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,720
There isn't much time left.

9
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,850
I'll have to use
the Heaven-Halo Technique.

10
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,980
The Rebirth Scroll?

11
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,340
Such pure power,

12
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,750
plus that armor...

13
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,750
He's the Holy Son!

14
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,530
Now that you've recognized me,

15
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,630
why not step back?

16
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,740
Only I can save her life.

17
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,140
Heaven Halo, activate!

18
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,960
It's the Heaven-Halo Technique!

19
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,490
Retreat!

20
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,120
Quickly inform the Asura King

21
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,380
of Lord Ye Mo's return!

22
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,020
The Goddess will be saved!

23
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,490
The Heaven-Changing Scripture?

24
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,030
Didn't expect that, did you?

25
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,630
As the Holy Son of Tianren Realm,

26
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,310
you have infinite power.

27
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,410
Your body

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
is perfect for me.

29
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,990
Why give it away to Yique Yinyang
for nothing?

30
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,800
Since the beginning,

31
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,240
you've been calculating.

32
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,950
If I had mistakenly killed the Goddess,

33
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,410
I wouldn't have been born,

34
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,590
and Yique Yinyang couldn't be revived.

35
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,760
Then you could continue being yourself.

36
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,290
Correct.

37
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,400
If I didn't kill her,

38
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,750
you'd use the Heaven-Changing Scripture

39
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,210
to disrupt her meridians.

40
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,600
In order to save her,

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,590
I'd definitely activate the Heaven Halo,

42
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,320
presenting you a chance
to possess my body.

43
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,230
That's right.

44
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,680
Knowing that I'd regain my power
in Tianren Realm,

45
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,450
you had me inhale the toxic air

46
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,280
given out

47
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,910
by the plants in the Plum Garden,

48
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,370
so as to suppress my power.

49
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,030
Given that,

50
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,470
even in Tianren Realm,

51
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,020
the strike I just launched

52
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,220
wouldn't be able to kill you.

53
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,630
Tang Lici,

54
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,630
you

55
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,750
have

56
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,280
lost.

57
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,630
Nonetheless,

58
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,589
I still need to thank you.

59
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,230
If it hadn't been for you,

60
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,430
I would never have known

61
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,000
that my mother

62
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,190
has always loved me.

63
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,390
A Holy Son of Tianren Realm

64
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,750
with all sorts of emotions...

65
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,350
What a perfect Tianren body.

66
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,440
It's finally going to be mine.

67
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,810
When we become one,

68
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,190
we'll form

69
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,560
a new Yique Yinyang.

You finally woke up.

You look

143
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,360
exactly

144
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,550
like I imagined.

145
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,730
Remember:

146
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,690
Mother

147
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,620

Mother.

The notorious Sky-reaching Pillar

150
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,940
shouldn't exist at all.

151
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,020
Dragon fire, burn the non-heavenly titan!

152
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,660
Yique Yinyang,

153
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,670
the bronze tree has been destroyed.

154
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,120
How are you going to come back to life?

155
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,000
Son,

156
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,890
take a look at the starry sky
outside for me.

157
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,150
Remember:

158
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,470
Mother

159
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,610
loves you.

160
00:10:59,050 --> 00:10:59,650
Mother...

161
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,470
I predicted

162
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,020
that you'd win this battle.

163
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,250
But, Mr. Tang, you didn't predict

164
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,450
that I'd leave without saying goodbye.

165
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,400
Ghostly Peony attempted to use a puppet

166
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,260
and the power of the bronze tree

167
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,480
to guide Yique Yinyang back to life.

168
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,770
I hid the third pill, the real one,

169
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,680
from everyone.

170
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,250
I then merged
the Sky-Fallen Stone fragment in me

171
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,130
with the pill.

172
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,090
This time,

173
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,750
I've finally

174
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,410
thought one step ahead of you.

175
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,580
I recalled my real name

176
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,990
and found out where I'm from.

177
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,390
I also misunderstood

178
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,240
and lied to you.

179
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,340
I can't face you again.

180
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,090
I just hope that after I leave,

181
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,480
you'll no longer fear

182
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,080
being understood by others.

183
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,530
You hate to explain yourself.

184
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,200
You don't care if others understand you

185
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,050
or trust you.

186
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,130
You don't mind even if everyone

187
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,330
misunderstands you.

188
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,610
I used to think of it

189
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,190
as arrogance.

190
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,170
Only some time later did I realize

191
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,180
that you were just afraid.

192
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,170
You feared
that you didn't deserve to be understood

193
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:45,880
or trusted.

194
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,390
Being understood isn't a bad thing.

195
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,670
This is the last time

196
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,870
I offer you my advice.

197
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,400
At the end of the road,
it's better to let go of the past.

198
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,440
Mr. Tang,

199
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,280
let's stay out of each other's life
for good.

200
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,030
Okay.

201
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,320
Shei, just go to a place

202
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,920
where Tang Lici isn't there.

203
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,270
Lead a life of your choice.

204
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,450
News of victory!

205
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,520
Tang Lici, the Guest of Honor
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

206
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,150
ventured alone into enemy lines

207
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,870
to destroy Fengliu Shop at one fell swoop,

208
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,530
and eliminated the mastermind,
Ghostly Peony!

209
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,150
Everyone in Shenji Branch,

210
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,950
did you see it?

211
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,320
When the bronze tree collapsed,

212
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,630
the earth split, mountains crumbled,
and flames went everywhere!

213
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,910
First, Xiuyu Peony Pavilion fell.

214
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,320
Then, the Plum Garden was flattened.

215
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,750
The enemy's base and final stronghold

216
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,320
were taken down by us once at a time.

217
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,050
Fengliu Shop

218
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,360
will never stand a chance to rise again!

219
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,720
Bravo!

220
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,960
Victory is finally ours
after such a long time!

221
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,890
How satisfying!

222
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,280
It's good to take an optimistic attitude.

223
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,940
However...

224
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,380
has Shenji Branch

225
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,910
found any trails of Mr. Tang

226
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:56,980
and Mr. Chi,

227
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,710
who went to look for the former?

228
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:59,910
Well...

229
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,200
Given the complex terrain

230
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,240
of Puti Valley,

231
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,330
and that we are remotely

232
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,530
stationed this time,

233
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,520
we can only figure out
their general movements.

234
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,810
With luck, they'll be able

235
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,590
to escape before the mountain collapses.

236
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,920
But without luck...

237
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,320
Stop picturing the worst case scenario.

238
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,000
I just...

239
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,630
People are finally having a chance

240
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,890
to take a breather now.

241
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,120
In my opinion,

242
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,270
we should delay announcing

243
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,960
Mr. Tang's disappearance.

244
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,940
[Half a month later]

245
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,360
One.

246
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:29,840
Two.

247
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,170
Everyone, look sharp!

248
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,920
Just because we've won doesn't mean

249
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,820
we can slack off.

250
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,530
Some members

251
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,120
of Fengliu Shop are still at large.

252
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,080
It depends on you to maintain

253
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,480
the order
of the future martial arts world.

254
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,080
Your Highness.

255
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,330
Dismissed.

256
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,020
I, Gu Xitan, am glad

257
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,170
to meet Your Highness.

258
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,660
Where is my master?

259
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,610
Where is he?

260
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,020
Master Shao is in Qingyang Realm.

261
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,460
Your Highness!

262
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,390
May I ask

263
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,640
if you were conscious

264
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,330
when you stabbed Mr. Tang?

265
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,160
Will you believe me?

266
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,330
I'd love to, if I can,

267
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,490
Ms. Zhong.

268
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,550
Master, after you entrusted

269
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,270
the Sword Alliance to my care,

270
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,240
I spent 10 years fixing

271
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,740
the damage caused by Yique Yinyang,

272
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,120
and 10 years elevating my spirit

273
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,480
as I longed for jianghu

274
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
to be reshaped by drastic measures.

275
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,970
I have waited 10 years

276
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,910
for the game changer.

277
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:04,850
Master,

278
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,860
why are you here alone?

279
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,840
I...

280
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,440
I'm admiring the scenery of Mount Cloud.

281
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,630
I used to be so busy with the affairs
of the Sword Alliance

282
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,510
that I never knew

283
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,710
there was such beautiful scenery here.

284
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,440
People can't see

285
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,550
what they normally can't

286
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,150
until they take a pause
from hustle and bustle.

287
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,600
I heard...

288
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,480
that Chi Yun and Shen

289
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,880
went to look for Mr. Tang.

290
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,770
I'm talking about Mr. Tang.

291
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,750
Master!

292
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:45,960
Master!

293
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,550
Master!

294
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,240
Senior,

295
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,250
what happened to my master?

296
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,510
He worked himself into illness,

297
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,480
which has already taken a toll
on his health.

298
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,790
Then, during the battle on Mount Cloud,

299
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,030
he suffered severe internal injuries.

300
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,490
Instead of working again,

301
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,010
he should've taken a rest.

302
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,790
Now, his heart

303
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,000
and meridians have been harmed.

304
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,069
At this rate,

305
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,619
you'll even die before Tang Lici does.

306
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,079
Is it really that serious?

307
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,230
It seems I've discovered more than

308
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,150
the scenery of Mount Cloud
during this pause from work.

309
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,020
Master,

310
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,339
please listen to Senior.

311
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,000
Master Shao.

312
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,610
Look at you.

313
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,530
You haven't recovered yet.

314
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,960
Why come here

315
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,160
to join the crowd?

316
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,380
At least I can still stand on my feet.

317
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,640
All I suffered

318
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,700
was a tiny little injury.

319
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,510
This "tiny little injury"

320
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,590
nearly killed you.

321
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,260
It hasn't healed after half a month.

322
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,680
Fengliu Shop has been taken down already.

323
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,400
God knows what you are

324
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,510
still busy with every day.

325
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,310
There's something I have to say.

326
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,500
Senior Shui...

327
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,790
Miss Shui,

328
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,790
Chunji,

329
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,630
I'd like to have a word with Master Cheng

330
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,620
and Master Puzhu in private.

331
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,640
Master Shao is inviting all the elders

332
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,030
and Branch Chiefs of the Sword Alliance

333
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,030
to Qingyang Realm for a discussion

334
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,290
on an important issue.

335
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,110
Today, I gathered all of you here

336
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,370
to make an announcement.

337
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,790
What happened?

338
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,170
I've decided

339
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,000
to step down as Sword Master

340
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,520
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

341
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,450
Though Fengliu Shop has been crushed,

342
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,210
its members at large
might cause turbulence again.

343
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,850
Tough measures must be taken promptly

344
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,180
to root out all the evil.

345
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,050
My frail body can no longer
bear heavy responsibilities.

346
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,050
It is high time

347
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,690
you elected a new leader.

348
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,690
Master Shao,

349
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,750
the Sword Alliance

350
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,280
still needs your leadership.

351
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,410
Please reconsider.

352
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,350
Master Shao, please reconsider.

353
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,440
Please reconsider!

354
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,770
Don't worry, everyone.

355
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,640
I've consulted Master Puzhu

356
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
and Master Cheng.

357
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,480
In the next two months,
Master Cheng will be

358
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,070
the acting Sword Master.

359
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,780
There's still time
before the election begins,

360
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,510
which allows us to deliberate.

361
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,830
Master Shao, do you

362
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,370
have anyone in mind as your successor?

363
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,350
None of the former Sword Masters

364
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,550
were appointed by their predecessors.

365
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,680
They were nominated

366
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,810
by senior members such as yourselves.

367
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,730
Master Shao,

368
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,200
does everyone get to make a nomination?

369
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,310
Of course.

370
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,680
Anyone can

371
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,240
be nominated.

372
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,440
The key is
to gain the approval and recognition

373
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,790
of the alliance and everyone.

374
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,480
That said,

375
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,830
candidates had better
have made contributions to defending

376
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,160
the martial arts world.

377
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,040
Master Shao,

378
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,160
I'd like to nominate...

379
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,150
myself.

380
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,590
What?

381
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,480
Miss Xifang,

382
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,070
you've just joined the Sword Alliance.

383
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,680
Indeed, I'm new here
and still familiarizing myself

384
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,080
with the Sword Alliance.

385
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,620
May I ask, Master Shao,

386
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,550
if seniority is a must for those running

387
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,410
for the position of Sword Master?

388
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,900
As far as I know,

389
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,120
Mr. Tang didn't join the Sword Alliance

390
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,690
much earlier than I did.

391
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,030
Is Mr. Tang,

392
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,400
who has rendered monumental service
to the alliance,

393
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,440
also not qualified

394
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,640
to run for the position of Sword Master?

395
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,440
Since you know little

396
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,750
about the Sword Alliance,

397
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,210
why boldly engage yourself
in the election?

398
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,510
I don't know much now,

399
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,830
but it doesn't mean
I'd stay that way forever.

400
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,720
Besides, I'm also

401
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,650
a member of the Sword Alliance now.

402
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,350
Seniority is not a must for those

403
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,840
running for the position of Sword Master.

404
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,770
But the approval of all the masters

405
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,050
and disciples is still necessary.

406
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,730
Thank you, Master Shao.

407
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,590
All I need to know

408
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,970
is that I'm qualified

409
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,170
to run for the position of Sword Master.

410
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,650
As for gaining people's approval...

411
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,720
that's my own concern.

412
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,920
Miss Xifang,

413
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,510
since you joined the Sword Alliance,

414
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,640
you've appeared eager and ambitious.

415
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,790
You and I are merely

416
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,920
acquaintances.

417
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Master Puzhu,

418
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,000
as her referee,

419
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,120
what's your opinion?

420
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,550
It's unnecessary

421
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,280
to trouble Master Puzhu
with my own business.

422
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,070
Master Puzhu

423
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,680
is simply a guide for me.

424
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,270
The path I'll walk in the Sword Alliance

425
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,960
doesn't necessarily

426
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,890
have to be decided by Master Puzhu.

427
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,640
I know

428
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,240
that you, Master Shao,

429
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,900
and Master Cheng have doubts.

430
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,830
Since I used to work for Fengliu Shop,

431
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,830
your concerns are understandable.

432
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,030
Let me just point out two things.

433
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,070
First,

434
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,210
among all the people present,

435
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,400
except Master Cheng

436
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,830
and Master Puzhu,

437
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,470
I am the best martial fighter here.

438
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,440
Second,

439
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,350
though Fengliu Shop has been defeated,

440
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,680
its remaining power
could still be a threat.

441
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,750
Nobody knows

442
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,160
Fengliu Shop better than I do.

443
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,820
Therefore,

444
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,390
before Fengliu Shop is annihilated,

445
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,590
I'm most suited for the position

446
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,760
of Sword Master, temporarily.

447
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,960
Temporarily?

448
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,090
What do you mean?

449
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,340
I hereby swear to all of you...

450
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,780
Within half a year,

451
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,800
I'll root out Fengliu Shop.

452
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,760
Well...

453
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,590
After that,

454
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,950
I'll step down,

455
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,680
so the Sword Alliance

456
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,360
can elect a new Sword Master.

457
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,920
Why?

458
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,030
Miss Xifang, are you planning

459
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,030
to fulfill

460
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,210
some sort of wish in half a year?

461
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,510
I'm aware of the grave sins I committed.

462
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,980
Running for the position of Sword Master

463
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,310
is never my intention,

464
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,490
but I have no other choice.

465
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,620
If I am to atone for my sins,

466
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,130
my only option is to eradicate

467
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,000
Fengliu Shop.

468
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,480
In that case,

469
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,070
Miss Xifang,

470
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,150
why apply to be Sword Master?

471
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,750
Just lead from the line

472
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,610
when we attack Fengliu Shop.
Won't that be enough?

473
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,300
Everyone,

474
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,350
I also think I'm qualified

475
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,550
to run for the position of Sword Master.

476
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,880
Well...

477
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,050
Your Highness,

478
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,450
leading the Sword Alliance

479
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,970
is by no means an easy task.

480
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,550
Of course,

481
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,790
I don't think less of you

482
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,250
as an eligible candidate.

483
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,480
But even Master Puzhu

484
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,410
and Master Cheng

485
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,310
show no interest in this position.

486
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,110
So, you see...

487
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,200
Miss Zhong,

488
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,910
I suggest you just be content

489
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,110
with your position as a royal princess.

490
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,200
But, I...

491
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,710
am my Master's only disciple

492
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,300
and the chief of Shanfeng Branch.

493
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,480
Since the age of eight,

494
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,200
I've been observing how Master

495
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,930
manages the Sword Alliance
by his side every day.

496
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,750
I've handled more alliance affairs

497
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,880
than the fellow martial practitioners

498
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
you killed
when you worked for Fengliu Shop.

499
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,830
Miss Xifang,

500
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,830
as a newcomer
who was an outsider not long ago,

501
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,090
you have the nerve to enter the election.

502
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,240
How am I, the chief of Shanfeng Branch,

503
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,570
the least qualified

504
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,240
candidate for the post?

505
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,070
It seems Your Highness has quickly

506
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,730
got tired of being a princess.

507
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:30,950
Master Shao.

508
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,980
Mr. Tang is back!

509
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,590
Mr. Tang?

510
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,240
Mr. Tang?

511
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,200
I wonder

512
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,240
if I'm qualified for the election.

513
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,070
Mr. Tang,

514
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,220
you finally came back.

515
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,000
Your injuries...

516
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,680
I'm fine.

517
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,920
I have fully recovered.

518
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:05,970
However...

519
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,920
You don't seem well,

520
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,600
Master Shao.

521
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,770
I venture to compete

522
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,880
for the position
of the Sword Alliance's Sword Master.

523
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,830
I hope to have

524
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,640
your support.

525
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,980
When I saw Mr. Tang,

526
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,070
my body was out of control,

527
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,910
and I stabbed him.

528
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,160
Your Highness,

529
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,810
will you withdraw from the election?

530
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,750
At the moment,

531
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:27,960
Master needs a good rest.

532
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,360
I'm afraid the successor he deems suitable

533
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,420
may not be me.

534
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,260
It's also my belief

535
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,550
that after making so many contributions,

536
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,830
it's time for Master Shao to recuperate,

537
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,430
since the battle is over now.

538
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,160
But Your Highness is indeed

539
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,890
more familiar with the alliance affairs
than others.

540
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,290
Mr. Tang's sudden return

541
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,590
may not be good news

542
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,640
to Your Highness.

543
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,910
Your Highness comes from jianghu

544
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,040
and values loyalty.

545
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,440
It's admirable.

546
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,360
But the old days have passed.

547
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,640
Now,
Your Highness is the Emperor's daughter.

548
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,400
That means

549
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,440
Your Highness can't act like
someone in jianghu anymore,

550
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,480
especially not
be too emotionally involved.

551
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,410
That won't bring

552
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,390
anything good

553
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,350
to Your Highness or the court.

554
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,510
Are you suggesting

555
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,510
I go against my Master's will

556
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,680
and replace him?

557
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:16,980
I dare not.

558
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,740
Without Master's guidance,

559
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,020
I wouldn't have become who I am today.

560
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,030
I don't allow anyone to be disrespectful

561
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,070
to my Master.

562
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,920
I've overstepped my bounds.

563
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,730
I beg for Your Highness's forgiveness.

564
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,470
But has Your Highness thought about this?

565
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,130
Now, Fengliu Shop has fallen.

566
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,510
The future martial arts world

567
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,550
needs a Sword Master

568
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,880
who's adept in governance
and the art of balance.

569
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,590
Your Highness is a member of the court

570
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,590
and Master Shao's direct disciple.

571
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,790
Your Highness has great respect

572
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,720
and care for Master Zhao,

573
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,520
and thus won't be a threat to him.

574
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,560
But will others in the Sword Alliance

575
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,480
still be bound to Master Shao
by the ties of discipleship

576
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,880
just like Your Highness?

577
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,440
You're referring to...

578
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,560
Xifang Tao?

579
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,680
Xifang Tao acts flamboyantly

580
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,410
and curries favor everywhere.

581
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,920
Mr. Tang always takes radical action.

582
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,980
He was once stabbed by Your Highness.

583
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,000
At the moment, Master Shao is unwell.

584
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,190
I'm afraid the rivalry

585
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:06,750
between Mr. Tang and Xifang Tao

586
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,400
will plunge the alliance
into a new crisis,

587
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,310
and that Your Highness
will lose your foothold.

588
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,350
Neither Master Shao nor the Emperor

589
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,300
would like to see that happen.

590
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,580
Your Highness,

591
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,570
that suggestion of mine
is not only for your own good,

592
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,640
but also for the interest
of the entire jianghu

593
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,370
and your master's life's work.

594
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,310
I get it.

595
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,910
You may leave.

596
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,240
Senior!

597
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
I see you're back.

598
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,410
Now that Fengliu Shop has collapsed,

599
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,030
you won't have to tire yourself out
anymore.

600
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,680
From now on,

601
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,880
come here more often.

602
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,690
I'll make sure you get well.

603
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,310
Take a seat over there.

604
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,440
I'll check your pulse later

605
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,700
to see how you've been.

606
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,550
I'm not ill.

607
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,580
Only the doctor has the final say.

608
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,440
You already got your martial strength
back.

609
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,770
But since your power and blood
have been depleted,

610
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,070
and your inner energy disrupted,

611
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,310
you won't be able to heal

612
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,910
as fast and easily as before.

613
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,400
These days,
you must refrain from losing blood

614
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,480
and using the Rebirth Scroll again

615
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,280
to save lives.

616
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,080
Those three pills have been used up.

617
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,160
Your current condition is far more

618
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,030
dangerous than you imagine.

619
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,200
One reckless move could cost your life.

620
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,790
Senior,

621
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,880
if anyone asks,

622
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,760
can you reply
with the first sentence only?

623
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,400
Senior.

624
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,310
Now, the Sword Alliance

625
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:49,960
needs

626
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,440
a Tang Lici in his prime.

627
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
And my companions

628
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,960
also need that.

629
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,340
So,

630
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,210
please do me a favor.

631
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,200
Does Shei still count

632
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,530
as a companion of yours?

633
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,680
Master.

634
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,930
Are you alright?

635
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,790
Hearing about your return,

636
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,030
he insisted on visiting you.

637
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,490
I couldn't stop him at all.

638
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,130
Don't worry.

639
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,920
I'm fine.

640
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,980
How's your health?

641
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,320
He has regained his martial strength.

642
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,450
Anything else?

643
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,550
He's fine. Just leave.

644
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,990
All this noise is giving me a headache.

645
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,980
Thank you, Senior.

646
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,410
Let's go.

647
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,200
Shei...

648
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,440
is gone.

649
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,920
Miss Shei

650
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,480
already left.

651
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,070
When will she...

652
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,630
come back?

653
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,620
She won't be back anymore.

654
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,980
Master, you're lying.

655
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,830
Shei likes you a lot.

656
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,300
She'll definitely come back.

657
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,350
Anything you want to say to me, Shen?

658
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,450
Chi Yun went to look for you.

659
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,190
I asked him to send me messages,

660
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,890
but I haven't heard from him so far.

661
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,230
How long has he been gone?

662
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,490
More than half a month.

663
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,530
There's one more thing.

664
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,310
I received a message from Chief,

665
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,960
saying that he had

666
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,920
found the last jewel

667
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,460
of the Seven-Treasure Jade Hairpin,

668
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,920
and that I should go back
to Shisan Tower instantly.

669
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,720
If I arrive before the deadline,

670
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,830
he'll return Huiniang's body to me.

671
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,640
If not,

672
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,190
he'll consider it a breach of agreement

673
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,850
and destroy Huiniang's body.

674
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,520
When's the deadline he gave you?

675
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,030
Tomorrow noon.

676
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,750
This matter can't wait.

677
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,160
Shen,

678
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,440
set off today.

679
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,010
But what about Chi Yun?

680
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,520
I'm here now.

681
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,460
How are you still worried?

682
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,550
I'm not.

683
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,490
Goodbye.

684
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,610
No need to see me off.

685
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,680
Bye.

686
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,480
Master,

687
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,040
why are there...

688
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,080
less and less people around?

689
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,520
People...

690

are born to be

691
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,430
separate individuals.

692
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,640
No.

693
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,370
I'll always be with you, Master.

694
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,440
Sure.

695
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,890
I asked to meet you for an inquiry.

696
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,050
Do you know

697
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,950
where the Plum Garden is?

698
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,580
[Half a month ago]

699
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,220
It has been destroyed.

700
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,500
Tang Lici is fine now.

701
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,000
You can go now.

702
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,380
Miss Bai...

703
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,030
I don't know

704
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,640
what secrets you're keeping from me.

705
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,510
But I know you're a good person.

706
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,230
Chi Yun,

707
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,960
stop waiting for me.

708
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,510
Miss Bai...

709
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,590
I'm sorry.

710
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,170
I shouldn't have bothered you
with my unrequited feelings.

[Marriage Agreement]

712
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,070
Your father arranged a marriage for us.

713
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,840
I've been carrying this agreement with me.

714
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,449
I've finally realized how foolish I was

715
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,750
for thinking I could marry you

716
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,610
based on this mere sheet of paper.

717
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,739
I've burned the marriage agreement now.

718
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,580
It's officially void.

719
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,440
I, Chi Yun,

720
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,070
swear to make you gladly marry me

721
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:43,530
one day.

722
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,360
If I can't marry you,

723
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,050
I won't marry anyone else.

724
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,670
Whatever.

725
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,090
It's your own business.

726
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,190
Besides,

727
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,590
I have my own matters to attend to.

728
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,780
She came here alone.

729
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,920
Did Fengliu Shop force her

730
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,850
to do something?

731
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,940
That's bad. I must follow her.

Try the newly harvested tea of this year.

735
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,230
Rich aroma.

736
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,540
Sweet aftertaste.

737
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,920
It's a fine product from Camellia Island.

738
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,110
Does Master Cheng

739
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,710
know you took his tea leaves?

740
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,440
He won't,

741
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,570
if nobody tells him.

742
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,970

on the same boat.

745
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,550
I'm afraid this boat

has been infiltrated by the crooked.

00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,150
she publicly offers rewards
for Liu Yan's capture,

756
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,440
and relentlessly hunts after

757
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,630
the remaining members of Fengliu Shop.

758
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,450
Her reputation has quickly soared.

759
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,630
Now, in people's eyes,

760
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,510
she's a pioneer in eliminating the evil.

761
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,400
Internally,

762
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,440
she cares for those
who were wounded in the battle,

763
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,880
and patiently offers instructions

764
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,280
to the new disciples
of the Sword Alliance.

765
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,800
The last time I met her,

766
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,070
she was chief

767
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,520
of the West Palace in Fengliu Shop.

768
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,460
In just a bit over a month,

769
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,190
she has somehow become

770
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,670
a revered heroine of justice.

771
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,880
It's hard to discern

772
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,750
the true nature of those of her kind—

773
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,030
I mean people who are skilled

774
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,320
in ingratiating themselves with others.

775
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,920
Master Shao, are you worried

776
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,920
that she may have ulterior motives?

777
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,510
As for Mr. Chi...

778
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,320
why don't I issue a missing person notice

779
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,180
in the name of the Sword Alliance?

780
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,670
I'd hate to trouble the alliance now.

781
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,030
At the moment, our priority

782
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,560
is to stop the spread
of the Blood Ghost Pills.

783
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,280
Speaking of which,

784
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,230
given

785
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,150
that we've devastated the Sword King City,

786
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,920
which was the major route

787
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,670
for selling poison pills
on land and by water,

788
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,710
and that we've destroyed
Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

789
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,880
and the Plum Garden,

790
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,190
there should be less and less

791
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,710
Blood Ghost Pills.

792
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,990
Why has there been a large number

793
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,110
of new victims

794
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,510
in the past half a month?

795
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,280
Someone hopes for the disaster

796
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,480
brought by such Evil Pills to continue.

797
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,400
It seems

798
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,070
a new Sword Master of the Sword Alliance

799
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,480
needs to be elected quickly.

800
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,010
I was truly in a rush before,

801
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,400
but now I'm not.

802
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,630
Why?

803
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,760
You're already back.

804
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,090
What's there to worry about?

805
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:57,820
Me?

806
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,010
Come on.

807
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,400
Now, everyone knows

808
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,230
Mr. Tang has escaped death

809
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,520
and regained his martial strength.

810
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,810
On Mount Cloud,

811
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,880
in terms of reputation, prestige,

812
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,480
wisdom, talent, and...

813
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,710
Let's skip that part.

814
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,400
I did declare to enter the election,

815
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
but in fact,

816
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,020
you and I are both aware

817
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,560
that I'm not suited to be

818
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,440
the leader of a righteous sect.

819
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,360
Besides,

820
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,510
you are completely altruistic,

821
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,400
while I...

822
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,180
am totally different.

823
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,850
You have personal agendas.

824
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,710
That makes you an even better fit
for the position of Sword Master.

825
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,440
Otherwise, how are you going to

826
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,390
abuse public power for personal gain?

827
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,400
I don't need the Sword Alliance

828
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
to help me with my personal affairs.

829
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,870
How am I aching again?

830
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,110
I'd better go meet

831
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:58,920
Senior Shui Duopo now

832
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,980
for another acupuncture treatment.

833
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:01,880
Mr. Tang.

834
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,000
Mr. Tang,

835
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
drink the tea now.

836
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,800
Put your heart and soul into the election.

837
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:09,800
Master Shao.

838
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,220
What an old weasel.

839
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,070
These Fengliu Shop disciples'

840
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,760
bodies

841
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,260
should be fed to dogs!

842
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,110
Miss Xifang, how kind of you

843
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,320
to bury them all.

844
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,120
Piled-up corpses could cause a plague.

845
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,410
They must be properly disposed of.

846
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,080
Hey, you!

847
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,760
Just dump the body there.

848
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,890
That's about right.

849
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,690
Thank you for the hard work,
Master Shangguan.

850
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,960
I've heard that the poison pills

851
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,360
have made a particularly fierce comeback.

852
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,420
God knows what's going on.

853
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,550
Right after the ferocious battle,

854
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,280
an enormous number

855
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,630
of Evil Pills suddenly appeared
in jianghu again.

856
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,550
Thankfully, the visionary Master Shao

857
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,360
has ordered a search
for villains at large,

858
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,000
and those secretly taking Evil Pills
to be detained.

859
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,480
Also, we're fortunate
to have your instructions

860
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,320
on the drug crackdown.

861
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,110
You've taught us how to

862
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,840
break up Fengliu Shop strongholds

863
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,360
and deal with those afflicted by poison.

864
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,020
Otherwise,

865
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,590
we rough fellows

866
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,340
would be completely lost.

867
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,670
Unfortunately,

868
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,670
some people are still picking on me,

869
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,860
since I once worked for Fengliu Shop.

870
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,760
Your contributions to the Sword Alliance

871
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,660
are evident to all.

872
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,840
Even commoners are saying

873
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,030
you're a heroine of justice.

874
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,400
Just ignore those remarks

875
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,760
made out of jealousy.

876
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,400
If I become Sword Master,

877
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,280
I'll not only eliminate all poison pills

878
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,340
within half a year,

879
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,040
but also distribute the gold

880
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,000
of Fengliu Shop

881
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,340
to all the elders and disciples

882
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,420
who fought hard

883
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,720
in the battle.

884
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,250
Is that true?

885
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:48,800
Of course.

886
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,230
Mr. Tang brought 100,000 taels of gold in

887
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,160
when he joined the Sword Alliance.

888
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,230
I certainly

889
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,840
need to make a gesture too.

890
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,280
Hold on.

891
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,890
Are you trying to bribe me?

892
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,010
Don't read too much into that,
Master Shangguan.

893
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
Whether I can be Sword Master or not,

894
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,450
I'll serve the Sword Alliance
wholeheartedly.

895
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,900
It's getting dark.

896
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,190
Why don't you bring the disciples back,

897
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,320
Master Shangguan?

898
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,850
I'm going to pay a visit to Mr. Tang.

899
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,320
How nice of you, Miss Xifang.

900
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,670
Even such exhausting work in the daytime

901
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,590
can't stop you from visiting Mr. Tang
at night.

902
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,110
What a devoted member you are.

903
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,710
I'm only atoning for my sins.

904
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:26,710
Okay.

905
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,800
Brothers, finish up quickly.

906
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,190
We're going home!

907
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,710
On my way back from down the mountain
just now,

908
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,280
I saw these poisoned people

909
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,440
suddenly assault others.

910
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,360
I've had those poisoned

911
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,840
yet living individuals detained.

912
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,760
These people were from jianghu.

913
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,400
It was the Evil Pills
that took their lives.

914
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,920
Some ate too many Evil Pills

915
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,710
and died when the toxins kicked in.

916
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,650
Others were attacked and killed
by pill takers.

917
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,450
When the bodies

918
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,480
over here were found,

919
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,660
they were far from each other.

920
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,400
It proves there has been

921
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,460
a large-scale outbreak of toxicity.

922
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,880
Black Tuli has been stolen.

923
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,190
These wounds were caused

924
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,480
by the Moon-crossing Ring.

925
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
Did Chi Yun encounter these people?

926
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,790
Chi Yun has been gone for a long time.

927
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,150
Even Shen Langhun can't find him.

928
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,400
Is he in trouble now?

929
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,510
Oh, right.

930
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,920
Perhaps

931
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,980
the Soul-seeking Technique
of Tianren Realm can help.

932
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,280
Even this technique

933
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,710
can't locate Chi Yun.

934
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,760
He must be trapped

935
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,590
somewhere.

936
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,510
Mr. Tang,

937
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,020
can I see you now?

938
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,440
You've come to me

939
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,360
before I go to you.

940
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,360
We finally met again after half a month.

941
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,760
Mr. Tang, I heard

942
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,550
that you had not only recovered,

943
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,280
but also regained
all your martial strength.

944
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,400
It is great news to the Sword Alliance.

945
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,960
My survival through great peril

946
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,630
must be extremely bad news

947
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,510
to you, Miss Xifang.

948
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:45,000
Now, the poison crisis has risen again.

949
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,110
The Sword Alliance needs

950
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:48,480
someone who knows
how to properly deal with it.

951
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,510
You're indeed

952
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,510
the best martial fighter in the world.

953
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,310
But when it comes to this matter,

954
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,510
you're not as competent as I am.

955
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,780
How dare you bring this up?

956
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,130
Although Fengliu Shop has collapsed,

957
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:01,880
there is

958
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,230
a drastic increase in the number of people

959
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,800
affected by the poison pills.

960
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,110
I think you know best

961
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,000
about why,

962
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,880
don't you?

963
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,230
You can't prove it.

964
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,090
Don't throw false accusations, Mr. Tang.

965
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,680
I've brought you some health tonics.

966
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,150
Mr. Tang,
if you don't need them for yourself,

967
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,350
keep them for Mr. Chi,

968
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,020
who has gone missing.

969
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,470
Perhaps they'll be helpful to him.

970
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,850
Mr. Chi has been missing for a long time.

971
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,250
Had better find him soon.

972
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,860
No need for the tonics.

973
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,320
Why did you join the Sword Alliance?

974
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:38,480
Did Ghostly Peony send you?
