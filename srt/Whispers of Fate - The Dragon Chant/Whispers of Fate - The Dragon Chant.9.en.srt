[Episode 9]

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,710
Rebirth Scroll?

4
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:34,430
Tang Lici's things may be disgusting,

5
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,440
but they still have some use.

6
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,310
Die!

7
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,070
Looks like we're entering the next act.

00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,729
Three Character Classic

9
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,010
You're back?

10
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,000
Shen!

11
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,450
Did you find any clues?

12
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,079
I saw Liu Yan.

13
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,980
Where?

14
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,980
Shen, what's wrong?

15
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,329
There's something

16
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,030
on him.

17
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,590
Hiding behind a facade,

18
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,910
putting on a mysterious air.

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,360
Sound Killing Technique.

20
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,860
I should have known it was you.

21
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,910
It's been four years

22
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,240
and your methods are still so crude.

23
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,430
Crude?

24
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,680
You truly are cold-blooded.

25
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,070
In your eyes,

26
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,630
haven't I always been

27
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,760
a cold-blooded and heartless person?

28
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,600
What,

29
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,720
you're having doubts now?

30
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,159
Doubts?

31
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,710
No.

32
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,390
Since you killed Fang Zhou

33
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,520
right in front of me,

34
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,600
I've never doubted

35
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,460
that you're a cold-blooded
and heartless monster.

36
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,680
Yan,

37
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:02,900
listen to me.

38
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,600
That day,

39
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,540
-it wasn't what you think.
-Excuses!

40
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,510
Tang Lici,

41
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,510
four years ago, I slit your throat

42
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,970
with great satisfaction.

43
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,930
Today, here,

44
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,910
I'll kill you again.

45
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,600
Four years ago,

46
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,800
you couldn't kill me.

47
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,040
And now,

48
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,800
you only dare to face me

49
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
in this illusion.

50
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,800
You have even less courage than before.

51
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Claiming to do things you can't
is just boasting.

52
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,610
Tang Lici,

53
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,190
you're already a wandering ghost.

54
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,620
Why did you come back?

55
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,390
Yes.

56
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,130
Because you're an inhuman,

57
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
undying,

58
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,400
and ungrateful

59
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,270
monster.

60
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,280
Monster?

61
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,920
Yan,

62
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,360
if I am a monster.

63
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,680
then what are you?

64
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,159
You were so eager to see me.

65
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,010
Isn't it because you want to

66
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,600
take the other half
of the Rebirth Scroll from me?

67
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,400
What's wrong?

68
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,280
Realized your days are numbered

69
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,000
and afraid to die again?

70
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,690
Sir.

71
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,270
Sir?

72
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,570
Does it hurt?

73
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,290
You couldn't kill me four years ago.

74
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,390
And four years later,

75
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,330
you still haven't improved at all.

76
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,370
You've switched to framing others.

77
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,360
Is it because
you can't bring yourself to kill?

78
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,290
Or have you finally discovered...

79
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,240
Your own helplessness?

80
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,270
Can't bring myself to kill?

81
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,510
That's absurd.

82
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,830
If this were truly a setup,

83
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,720
how could I let someone like you,

84
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,950
the world's biggest hypocrite,

85
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,840
escape punishment

86
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,390
and play the role of

87
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,520
a righteous savior?

88
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,600
To watch you continue this act,

89
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,440
it's not a waste for me

90
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,870
to postpone your death a little longer.

91
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,860
How long do you think
you can keep up this act?

92
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,150
You'll soon expose

93
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,100
your true nature,

94
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,190
because you don't know how to save people.

95
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,390
You can only destroy.

96
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,390
Everything that comes close to you

97
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,790
will be destroyed by you.

98
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,620
Zhoudi Tower should never have saved you.

99
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,960
Zhoudi Tower...

100
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,700
I had already forgotten

101
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,430
that place.

102
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,550
However,

103
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,190
since you brought it up,

104
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,980
I should still thank you.

105
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,610
Fang Zhou brought me back.

106
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,430
Yan,

107
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,790
it was you

108
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,740
who healed me.

109
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,850
I should never have saved you!

110
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,790
You shouldn't be alive.

111
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,860
Once you reveal your true nature,

112
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,190
no one in this world will want you

113
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,740
to live.

114
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,150
You know that, don't you?

115
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,640
Without you,

116
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,340
everyone in this world

117
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,750
would be better off.

118
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,100
Better off.

119
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,790
I regret it.

120
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,150
I regret saving you,

121
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,470
giving you the chance
to deceive Fang Zhou,

122
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,710
letting you harm him

123
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,030
and destroy

124
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,490
the Zhoudi Tower
we tried so hard to protect!

125
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,750
You're wrong.

126
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,860
What you regret is

127
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,150
that to kill me,

128
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,550
you've become

129
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,910
neither human nor monster.

130
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,740
You keep saying

131
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,070
you believe what you saw.

132
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,270
You're convinced

133
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,330
I killed Fang Zhou.

134
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,070
But deep down,

135
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,910
you shamefully have doubts.

136
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,670
What if?

137
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,450
What if there's the slightest chance

138
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,310
that you're wrong?

139
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,910
So,

140
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,910
you keep testing me,

141
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,700
trying to see

142
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,310
if I really am a cold-blooded

143
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,570
and heartless person.

144
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,200
Would killing me

145
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,740
really allow you to

146
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,860
serve justice?

147
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,860
Yan,

148
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,860
to kill me,

149
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,820
this evil being,

150
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,490
you became a fallen angel,

151
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,700
a lonely hero in the night.

152
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,100
But

153
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,500
you're afraid.

154
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,910
You fear that all of this

155
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,920
is just your imagination.

156
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,550
You fear it's all

157
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,460
just a false excuse

158
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,660
you made up to kill me.

159
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,670
You're afraid...

160
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,030
you'll kill the wrong person.

161
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,430
Am I right?

162
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,790
No.

163
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,740
No.

164
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,500
Stop trying to manipulate me
with your words.

165
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
You may have fooled Fang Zhou,

166
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,700
but you can't fool me.

167
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,460
You hypocrite and liar!

168
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,820
I really envy you.

169
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,820
You killed Fang Zhou,

170
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,220
destroyed Zhoudi Tower,

171
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,840
and still live so comfortably
with yourself.

172
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,980
This qin is in your hands?

173
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,700
Human nature is good at birth.

174
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,150
Lici.

175
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,580
This qin

176
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,440
is called the Heart-Moon Return.

177
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,310
The name's meaning

178
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,210
expresses hope that when you play it,

179
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,430
it can ignite the fire in your heart,

180
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,190
cleanse your mind,
and guide you to goodness.

181
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,270
However,

182
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,070
if you truly want to
follow the path of goodness,

183
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,930
you must persevere until the end.

184
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,730
To accomplish this

185
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,700
is indeed very,

186
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,150
very difficult.

187
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,460
Today,

188
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,100
I will

189
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,310
give this zither to you.

190
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,100
You don't do enough good
to be truly virtuous,

191
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,980
and when you do evil,

192
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,620
you can't commit great evil either.

193
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,100
Yan,

194
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,910
with your personality,

195
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,700
you can never reach
the extremes of good or evil.

196
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,460
In the end,

197
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,580
you're destined to accomplish nothing.

198
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,340
Give up.

199
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,150
You're still trying to
manipulate with words.

200
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,070
Raging Thunder!

201
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,000
Shattered Jade Across the Realms!

202
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,860
Joy.

203
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,100
Anger.

204
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,500
Sorrow.

205
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:57,730
Happiness.

206
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,460
Worry.

207
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,070
Fear.

208
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,270
Dread.

209
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,370
Tang Lici,

210
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,980
I want to destroy
all seven of your emotions

211
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,790
and atone for your sins before Fang Zhou!

212
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,910
Go to hell!

213
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,880
Shock the universe,
seven sounds extinguished!

214
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,510
White Dragon Taizhen Dance.

215
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,910
The one Fang Zhou chose
to inherit his legacy

216
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,910
was never you,

217
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,190
but me.

218
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,060
Yan,

219
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,020
the illusion is broken.

220
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,480
You must be feeling awful.

221
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,630
You woke up first.

222
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,150
How boring.

223
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,690
Move aside.

224
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,520
I congratulated

225
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,500
you and the Master

226
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,060
on a happy reunion.

227
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,910
Sir,

228
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,060
why are you so cold?

229
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,390
Shen Langhun,

230
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,820
the illusion,

231
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,870
and now, you.

232
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,520
These three useless moves

233
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,240
have already made me

234
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,980
lose my patience.

235
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,870
Useless moves?

236
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,380
If you want to be my opponent,

237
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,110
you're not good enough.

238
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,540
Your opponent

239
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,670
is not me.

240
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,590
Since you're so clever,

241
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,390
why don't you guess

242
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,870
what Master

243
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,880
will do to your friends

244
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,460
next?

245
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,450
What does he want to do?

246
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,870
Master said

247
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,950
you

248
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,480
must pay the price.

249
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,780
Master said

250
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,350
your physique is exceptionally strong.

251
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,910
No matter how severe the injuries,

252
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,220
as long as you don't die,

253
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,300
you can recover.

254
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,460
But the only wound

255
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,390
you cannot heal

256
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,690
is in your abdomen.

257
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,670
Master has deliberately

258
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,500
mixed something into the misty flower sea

259
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,700
that will trigger

260
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,780
your old wound.

261
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,220
And my blood

262
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,580
is the catalyst.

263
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,630
Trigger the old wound?

264
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,870
I was here first!

[Wanqiao Chamber Account Book Collection]

266
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,350
Everyone, please calm down.

267
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,780
Take it easy.

268
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,710
I was here first!

269
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,740
I was here first!

270
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,590
Don't push.

271
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,760
I was here first.

272
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,420
Everyone, please be patient.
One at a time.

273
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,400
Don't rush.

274
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,780
We are here

275
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,740
because we want to get rich

276
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,600
with all of you.

277
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,190
Sir, look,

278
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,220
we've all been waiting

279
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,420
for quite a while now.

280
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,570
What kind of fleets

281
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,830
are worthy of working with you?

282
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,150
I see you all

283
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,600
have brought your account books.

284
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,990
Hand them over for us to examine.

285
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,670
Those who have worked with

286
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,730
major clients in the past three years

287
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,830
will have a chance.

288
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,160
In the past three years?

289
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,520
No...

290
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:20,720
No hurry.

291
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,230
No rush, no need to hurry.

292
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,430
Our account books

293
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,150
are our most valuable possessions.

294
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,540
That's right.

295
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,150
Exactly.

296
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,950
This wasn't the rule before.

297
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,980
If we hand them all over to you,

298
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,630
what if the information in our accounts

299
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,430
gets leaked?

300
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,150
How can we continue

301
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,630
our business at the docks?

302
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,630
So, we can't hand over
these account books.

303
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,220
We can't.

304
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,830
In this world, there's never gain

305
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,020
without sacrifice.

306
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,400
You may lose your former clients,

307
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,630
but you'll gain Wanqiao Chamber

308
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,630
as a new client.

309
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,170
This is a trade-off

310
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,520
that you all should understand clearly.

311
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,830
That may be true,

312
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,060
but I think...

313
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,430
Wanqiao Chamber

314
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,060
has mountains of wealth

315
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,150
precisely because our business

316
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,220
never loses money.

317
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,690
Yes, we understand.

318
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,630
Since you all

319
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,590
don't even have the courage
to submit your account books,

320
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,540
the exit is that way.

321
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,300
No, no, no.

322
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:06,910
We...

323
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,110
I'm willing to provide my account book.

324
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,300
Our fleet

325
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,830
is clean and honest.

326
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,260
We have nothing to hide.

327
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,950
That's why I say

328
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,950
you cowards

329
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,300
will never make big money.

330
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,220
But it doesn't matter.

331
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,150
This way, no one will

332
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,020
compete with me for this deal.

333
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,750
Everyone, the exit is that way.

334
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,300
This young sir

335
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,660
is so courageous

336
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,660
and straightforward.

337
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,110
You're the kind of person
Wanqiao Chamber appreciates.

338
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,150
Please, come aboard.

339
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,020
This way, sir.

340
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:31,830
Please.

341
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,250
Time to make money!

342
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,080
He's allowed to get on the boat already?

343
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,940
Will this work?

344
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,990
Relax.

345
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,390
Walk forward.

346
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:38,990
Let's go.

347
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:39,670
One.

348
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,630
Two.

349
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,950
Wait!

350
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,350
Three.

351
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,260
Wait!

352
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,350
Wait!

353
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,300
Sir,

354
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,220
our accounts are clean too.

355
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,700
Right?

356
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,220
Yes, they're clean.

357
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,350
We have nothing to hide.

358
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,300
That's right.

359
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,260
Sir, I've thought it through too.

360
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,910
We'll submit our books as well. Come on.

361
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,540
Yes, we'll all submit them.

362
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,670
Come on.

363
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,980
Everyone gets a turn.

364
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,240
Everyone has a chance.

365
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,030
Don't rush, don't rush.

366
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,390
Why are you dawdling?

367
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,260
Come on, one at a time!

368
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,020
One at a time.

369
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,020
Line up!

370
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,950
By order of the Sword King City's lord,

371
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,300
during the Sword Duel Festival,

372
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,630
all vessels on the canal

373
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,020
are forbidden from private gatherings,

374
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,740
banquets,

375
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,980
concealing weapons,

376
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,950
or engaging in combat.

377
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,150
Those who have not registered

378
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,740
are forbidden from conducting business.

379
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,020
Those without an official sword token

380
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,150
may not leave the city.

381
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,780
If Wanqiao Chamber wants to do business,

382
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,980
you must wait until after
the Sword Duel Festival.

383
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,110
These are the rules.

384
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,150
Mind your own business

385
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,350
and stay in your lane.

386
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,950
The rules of Sword King City

387
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,630
don't apply to

388
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,830
the Wanqiao Chamber.

389
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,820
Move them out!

390
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,080
What are you doing?

391
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,060
Chi, what should we do?

392
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:46,910
Stop!

393
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:50,830
Chi.

394
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,030
Chi Yun, are you okay?

395
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,420
As expected of Cloud.

396
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,470
Your belly is full of cotton.

397
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,780
I'm impressed.

398
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,740
Look, everyone!

399
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,220
Is this a scam?

400
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,540
Isn't this the same person from before?

401
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,600
Turns out he was wearing a fake beard.

402
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,300
Chi Yun!

403
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,190
Don't be impulsive.

404
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,950
We've been tricked.

405
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,500
Yeah!

406
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,380
Calm down.

407
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,740
Yu Furen, Commander of Sword King City,

408
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,740
pays respects to the Branch Chief
of Shanfeng Branch,

409
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,460
Ms. Zhong.

410
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,500
Mr. Yu,

411
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,060
the Sword Duel Festival in Sword King City

412
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,020
welcomes heroes from all over the world.

413
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,260
Wanqiao Chamber
is just running a business.

414
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,590
There's nothing wrong with that.

415
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,720
Why cause conflict?

416
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,750
You're right.

417
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,170
If that's the case,

418
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,350
Wanqiao Chamber should

419
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,080
return all these account books

420
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,960
and promise to follow
Sword King City's rules

421
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,460
from now on.

422
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,540
Then, I will immediately apologize

423
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,910
to Mr. Chi.

424
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,460
Mr. Yu,

425
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,700
right now, we're just

426
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,430
collecting account books for examination.

427
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,300
As for discussing business deals,

428
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,960
that may still take some time.

429
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,390
Sword King City is responsible for
imperial transport.

430
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,780
If any confidential information
about the imperial transport

431
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,910
were to be leaked...

432
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,430
Why don't we meet halfway

433
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,560
and compromise?

434
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,910
These people

435
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,870
mostly come from private shipping groups

436
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,330
and have nothing to do with

437
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,590
imperial transport secrets.

438
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,020
Mr. Yu, why don't you

439
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,980
leave these

440
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,630
non-confidential account books

441
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,630
with us?

442
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,990
This way, everyone wins.

443
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,390
On what grounds?

444
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,100
Give it to him.

445
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,630
So be it.

446
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,710
Take it away.

447
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:44,910
Are we just letting them

448
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,910
take away that box of account books?

449
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,980
What if all the clues

450
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,830
are in there?

451
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,220
With just these scraps left,

452
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,430
how can we investigate?

453
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,490
It's alright, Chi.

454
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,630
We're just avoiding confrontation for now,

455
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,030
right?

456
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,060
This might actually be a good thing.

457
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,710
What do you mean?

458
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,740
Mr. Yu's arrival

459
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,600
must be on Sword King Yu's orders.

460
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,150
I've observed Mr. Tang's actions.

461
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,590
They're all aimed at
pressuring the Sword King,

462
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,190
forcing him to make mistakes.

463
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,790
Whether those account books

464
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,670
actually contained

465
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,950
the evidence we wanted

466
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,810
was uncertain.

467
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,670
But judging from the Yu family's reaction,

468
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,910
doesn't it prove

469
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,300
there must be
incriminating evidence inside?

470
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,030
Take it away.

471
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,980
As for the box they took,

472
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,700
with Cloud's skills

473
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,670
and some shady tactics,

474
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,430
I'm sure we have ways

475
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,390
to get it back.

476
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:34,950
Shei,

477
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,470
you've learned some bad habits
from Foxy Tang.

478
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,020
Don't wait for me for dinner.

479
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,220
I'm going to give that guy some trouble.

480
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,390
Be careful, Chi.

481
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,420
This Yu Furen
isn't heading to Sword King City.

482
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
Where is he going?

483
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,540
Master.

484
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,220
Is Tang Lici

485
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,950
really that powerful?

486
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,540
Not only did he force you

487
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,260
to nurture the Thousand Curse Needle
with your body,

488
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,520
but he also wounded you

489
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,600
in the illusion.

490
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,780
Today, I should've

491
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,380
sacrificed my physical body

492
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,230
to kill him completely
with the sea of flowers.

493
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,140
The song is halfway done.

494
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,590
The climax is coming.

495
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,760
All things cannot be rushed.

496
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,220
Besides,

497
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,790
what if you get hurt too?

498
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,690
Who will help me avenge this deep hatred?

499
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,680
I've planned every step

500
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,260
to finally lure him to this place.

501
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,050
How could I not enjoy this game?

502
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,740
The curse bug flower
can trigger his old illness.

503
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,350
But if he dies like this,

504
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,460
wouldn't that be too easy for him?

505
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,460
This time,

506
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,090
I'll make him die while abandoned by all,

507
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,620
with no one to bury his bones.

508
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,300
Give this to Yu Qifeng.

509
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,440
It's time for the curse bug

510
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,910
raised for Tang Lici

511
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,520
to be put into use.

512
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,220
Why did you only bring back
these account books?

513
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,550
-This voice...
-Madam.

514
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,890
Trying to retrieve all the account books

515
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,290
would be unreasonable.

516
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,150
Commander Yu,

517
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,090
you're still too merciful.

518
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,900
It seems this matter
will require more effort.

519
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,540
Please tell me, Madam,

520
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
what exactly is the relationship

521
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,460
between my Master and Wanqiao Chamber?

522
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,060
You don't need to know these things.

523
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,500
You only need to understand

524
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,000
that whatever the Sword King
wants you to do,

525
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,370
you should do it.

526
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,870
Are these account books

527
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,870
truly evidence planted by Tang Lici

528
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,060
to frame my family,

529
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,300
as Master said?

530
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,500
Also,

531
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,220
if Tang Lici is truly

532
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,150
the villain selling the Evil Pill,

533
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,350
then why doesn't Master Puzhu

534
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,060
just arrest him?

535
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,040
You don't trust me,

536
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,420
but do you not trust the Sword King?

537
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,710
I wouldn't dare.

538
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:51,700
Go back now.

539
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,420
Stay alert these days.

540
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,500
If there's anything else to be done,

541
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,100
the Sword King will find you.

542
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,110
Yes.

543
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:32,960
It's you.

544
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,670
Mr. Tang!

545
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,830
You sent everyone to look for Chi.

546
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,980
Did something happen?

547
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,580
Stay back.

548
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,500
You're hurt.

549
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,190
I'll go get a doctor.

550
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:13,980
Stop.

551
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,630
It's just my old illness acting up.

552
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,500
It's nothing.

553
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,670
Don't tell anyone

554
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,220
about this.

555
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,080
Understand?

556
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,250
But your injury...

557
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,060
Get out.

558
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,780
Mr. Tang!

559
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,630
I've been looking for you for three years.

560
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,760
Since you're alive,

561
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,830
why didn't you come find me?

562
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,030
I have nothing to do with you.

563
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,390
Why should I go find you?

564
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,500
I'm your fiancé.

565
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,780
Your father made a vow
to the heavens and ancestors

566
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,910
for our engagement.

567
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,300
How do you have nothing to do with me?

568
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,340
I've torn up the engagement.

569
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,740
Now, I'm Sword King Yu's concubine.

570
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,020
Don't act like a lecher,

571
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,220
putting your hands all over me.

572
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:27,910
Nonsense!

573
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,670
You are my fiancée.

574
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,570
How could you be with Yu Qi—

575
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,350
How could you be involved

576
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,210
with Yu Qifeng?

577
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,120
I promised your father I would marry you.

578
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,520
No matter what's happening to you now,

579
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,220
I'm taking you with me today.

580
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,170
Bai Suche,

581
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,460
you're poisoning me?

582
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:04,980
Yes,

583
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,830
you will die here.

584
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:16,850
Madam!

585
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,480
No need to chase after him.

586
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,500
Cloud

587
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,800
isn't so easy to catch.

588
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,909
Butler Sen,

589
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,540
look there, look there!

590
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,510
-Mr. Chi!
-Chi!

591
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:03,980
Fang Zhou.

592
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,760
Fang Zhou.

593
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,430
Fang Zhou!

594
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,100
Fang Zhou.

595
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,580
Fang Zhou!

596
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,430
Fang Zhou,

597
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,290
don't leave again.

598
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,790
I'm about to fulfill

599
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,990
what I promised you.

600
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,060
Lici,

601
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,870
stop fooling yourself.

602
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,310
I'm already dead.

603
00:36:59,310 --> 00:36:59,950
Fang Zhou,

604
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,440
trust me one more time.

605
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,000
I always succeed in

606
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,950
what I want to do.

607
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,700
I said I would bring you back,

608
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
so I will definitely do it.

609
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,900
I won't break my promise.

610
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,000
Why do you want to save me so badly?

611
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,910
I...

612
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,200
Your past

613
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,980
was full of killing,

614
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,140
betrayal,

615
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,450
and destruction.

616
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,560
You don't want this past,

617
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,310
yet you're not sure

618
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,570
about your own nature,

619
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,180
right?

620
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,310
I don't know.

621
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,660
I don't know.

622
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,230
Fang Zhou,

623
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,030
don't ask me anymore.

624
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,270
Lici,

625
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,880
do you regret it?

626
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,910
Regret?

627
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:05,570
Saving you?

628
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,990
I don't regret it.

629
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,730
My strength has returned.

630
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,140
Mr. Tang, you're awake.

631
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,910
Who let you in?

632
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,430
I saw you were injured

633
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,430
and was very worried about you,

634
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,960
so I gave you some medicine.

635
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,390
I'm sorry.

636
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,140
I...

637
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,710
Get out.

638
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,670
This medicine

639
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,310
can heal my old wound

640
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,560
and even neutralize the curse bug poison.

641
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:00,100
[Marriage Letter]

642
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,710
After the Bai family was massacred,

643
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,240
she suddenly disappeared.

644
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,230
I spent over a year looking for her

645
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,270
to no avail.

646
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,790
Now, she claims to be

647
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,120
Yu Qifeng's concubine.

648
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,430
She even poisoned me.

649
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,580
Tell me...

650
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:52,980
Have you recovered?

651
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,910
The remaining poison is gone. I'm fine.

652
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,430
Good.

653
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,830
Today, accompany me

654
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,790
to the Qiongtai Banquet.

655
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,910
Let's not talk about

656
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,910
that Qiongtai appointment now.

657
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,040
Help me analyze this situation first.

658
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,830
Bai Suche is my wife.

659
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,270
How can I just stand by and watch her

660
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,180
be with Yu Qifeng?

661
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,140
Just because you like her,

662
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,620
does that mean she must marry you

663
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,270
and can't marry someone else?

664
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:14,950
On what grounds?

665
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,710
Because we were engaged first!

666
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,660
Since we were engaged,

667
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,660
she belongs to me.

668
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,500
She doesn't belong to anyone.

669
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,660
She is free.

670
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,870
Even if you, Chi Yun,

671
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,020
believe yourself to be

672
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,620
a thousand times better than Yu Qifeng,

673
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,710
she still has the right not to choose you.

674
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,100
What?

675
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,580
Can the mighty Cloud

676
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,750
only hide behind parental arrangements

677
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,980
and matchmakers?

678
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,370
Tang Lici,

679
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,500
I've worked for you for a year,

680
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,310
serving you faithfully,

681
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,390
and there hasn't been a single thing

682
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,020
I've done to let you down, right?

683
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,060
Now, instead of speaking up for me,

684
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,020
you're defending that outsider, Yu Qifeng?

685
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,820
Do you even consider me a friend?

686
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,660
Friend?

687
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,030
When did I, Tang Lici, ever acknowledge

688
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,820
that we were friends?

689
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:02,790
Fine.

690
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,310
I'm not worthy of being your friend.

691
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:06,790
So now,

692
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,390
there's nothing left to say.

693
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,620
Let's not work together anymore.

694
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,550
Let's part ways!

695
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,410
Chi!

696
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,540
What?

697
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,240
Do you want to leave too?

698
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,020
She vanished without a trace a year ago.

699
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:25,750
A year later,

700
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,500
she just happened
to appear in Sword King City,

701
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,830
so you suspect Bai Suche

702
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,830
works for Liu Yan.

703
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,580
You're worried that Chi Yun
is too impulsive

704
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,660
and getting in too deep.

705
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,910
You're afraid he'll get hurt,

706
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,910
so you deliberately drove him away.

707
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,590
Desperate times

708
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,640
call for desperate measures.

709
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,620
Chi Yun is simple-minded.

710
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,890
Emotions cloud judgment.

711
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,230
If he finds out

712
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,890
that Bai Suche is connected
to the Fengliu Shop,

713
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,350
he'll throw everything down

714
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,660
to take Bai Suche away.

715
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,350
Rather than letting him

716
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,680
fall into another trap,

717
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,760
it's better to let anger

718
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,610
fill his mind first.

719
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,000
It's better than letting him
be manipulated now.

720
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,140
I'm afraid the one whose heart is troubled

721
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,430
isn't just Chi Yun.

722
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,630
You've been off

723
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,550
since you saw Liu Yan yesterday.

724
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:18,910
You're losing focus.

725
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,060
If this continues, you'll lose.

726
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:21,710
Is that so?

727
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:24,980
Liu Yan might win,

728
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,020
but Tang Lici

729
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,060
will never lose.
