[Whispers of Fate]

2
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,910
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,229
So, Senior,

4
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,310
you're not here to arrest Mr. Tang?

5
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,509
To prevent any leaks,

6
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,820
only the Sword Master,

7
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,680
Master Puzhu,

8
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,880
and I know about this.

9
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,630
You're too honest.

10
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,490
I was worried you might expose us.

11
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,759
Then why

12
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,610
did you want to arrest Mr. Tang
outside the city?

13
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,150
By catching him,

14
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,640
I could bring him to Biluo Palace

15
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,920
and use him as leverage

16
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,350
to request an audience
with Palace Chief Wanyu.

17
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,950
That would

18
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,310
make everything more convincing.

19
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,039
Then why did Mr. Tang try to escape?

20
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,039
Did he?

21
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,010
He was just traveling with me.

22
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,610
Cheng Yunpao's target

23
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,120
was never Tang Lici.

24
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,830
Tang Lici was just a pretext

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,430
for him to achieve

26
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,280
his real purpose—

27
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,640
secretly getting inside

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,470
Biluo Palace.

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,150
So,

30
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,210
you believe Mr. Tang is a good person?

31
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,020
He may not be evil,

32
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,850
but that doesn't make him
a good man either.

33
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,079
He deliberately made himself conspicuous

34
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,960
to attract Fengliu Shop

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,190
and the swordsmen hunting him,

36
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,000
all to hold back his strength for today

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,630
and force Palace Chief Wanyu

38
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,120
to aid the Sword Alliance.

39
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,490
Maybe the reason

40
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,600
Palace Chief Wanyu

41
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,680
sheltered those from Fengliu Shop

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,820
was that Tang Lici's methods
were too extreme

43
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,950
and displeased him.

44
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,150
I see.

45
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,360
Currently, there's no need

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,890
for Master Cheng to act yet.

47
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,430
Tonight,

48
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,580
our biggest problem

49
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,300
is Xifang Tao.

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,190
That girl's cunning

51
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,120
is no less than Liu Yan's.

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,520
At present,

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,680
I haven't yet formed a true alliance

54
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,960
with Biluo Palace,

55
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,440
which means Fengliu Shop

56
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,380
still has a chance to act.

57
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,180
Tonight,

58
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,490
she's sure to make her move.

59
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,550
Even if that's true,

60
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,190
we...

61
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,840
we are not allowed to fight

62
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,170
in Biluo Palace anyway.

63
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:36,910
What...

64
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,910
can we do in here?

65
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,320
You'll have to ask Palace Chief Wanyu

66
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,960
what he wants

67
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,430
and why he's housing us

68
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,840
separately.

69
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,190
Also...

70
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,310
there's the hint

71
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,630
Bi Lianyi just gave us.

72
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,240
The hint?

73
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,150
There are 7 of them,

74
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,079
but only 5 of you.

75
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,740
This isn't fair to you.

76
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,790
The Palace Chief
doesn't only care about the outcome,

77
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,390
but also your performances.

78
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,030
After nightfall,

79
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,630
that's when we get our chance to act.

80
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,769
But aren't there guards
patrolling at night?

81
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,959
How can we act?

82
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,390
Perhaps...

83
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,870
he wants us to avoid these guards

84
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,160
when we act.

85
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,390
The reason Palace Chief Wanyu

86
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,560
deliberately separated us

87
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,510
must be that

88
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,310
he wants us

89
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,570
to do certain things

90
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,790
in Zixiao Courtyard.

91
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,340
And these things

92
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,100
are his test for us.

93
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,690
If we do them right,

94
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,240
he'll cooperate with the Sword Alliance.

95
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,170
If we fail

96
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,270
and make Palace Chief Wanyu

97
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,400
think we're idiots,

98
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,360
Biluo Palace

99
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,470
will side with Fengliu Shop.

100
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,520
So what should we do?

101
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,240
Before we do anything,

102
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,310
we need to understand

103
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,510
the rule of this game.

104
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,830
Isn't the rule

105
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,159
that we can't fight?

106
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,410
Perhaps...

107
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,350
that's not really a rule,

108
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,270
but a loophole.

109
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,159
Where's that drum sound coming from?

110
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,310
It's giving me a headache!

111
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,360
Now is the time.

112
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,190
Morning bells and evening drums.

113
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,190
Night has fallen.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,460
The show is about to begin.

115
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,840
Madam, what do you mean?

116
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,890
If you want to survive,

117
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,310
don't go outside.

118
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,830
These evil people

119
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,310
won't just sit and wait for death.

120
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,260
Now that night has fallen,

121
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,830
I'll find out what they're planning.

122
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,040
We'd better reach

123
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
Palace Chief Wanyu before they do.

124
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,430
Stay here

125
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,750
and don't act rashly.

126
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,680
Wait for my news.

127
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,190
Okay.

128
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,960
If you encounter danger,

129
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,440
just call out.

130
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,560
Why such a hurry?

131
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,250
Isn't Senior Brother a bad navigator?

132
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,190
Being alone, how can he...

133
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:24,680
Senior!

134
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,070
Senior!

135
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,070
Senior!

136
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,710
Palace Chief,

137
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,770
six people have left their rooms.

138
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,390
As you predicted,

139
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,010
they've started to act.

140
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,510
I've checked.

141
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,390
Xifang Tao and Fucui

142
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,540
have left their rooms.

143
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,310
There are only 16 guards

144
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,640
patrolling the entire Zixiao Courtyard.

145
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:12,950
Too few.

146
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,010
It seems Xifang Tao

147
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,310
has also noticed the key.

148
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,390
The one who noticed the key

149
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,540
is the opposition's critical target.

150
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,070
Which directions did they head?

151
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,160
Xifang Tao went west,

152
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,290
and Fucui went east.

153
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,430
The Zixiao Courtyard
is laid out like a chessboard,

154
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,360
with long corridors and many rooms.

155
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,680
But they can't use
the Shadow Concealment Technique.

156
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,340
Checking every room thoroughly

157
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,140
won't be easy.

158
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:38,720
Good.

159
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,270
I'll go after Xifang Tao,

160
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,590
and you follow Fucui.

161
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,120
Let's do this according to the plan.

162
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,510
Okay.

163
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:01,870
Senior!

164
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,950
Senior!

165
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,030
Just waiting here

166
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,360
is so boring!

167
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,260
I want to go out to find them too.

168
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,600
My lightness skill

169
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,200
is clearly most useful here.

170
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,440
Chi, I know you

171
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,640
want to find Miss Bai.

172
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,120
Thank you for protecting me.

173
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,730
I can still tell what's most important

174
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,390
and what can wait.

175
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,670
We're on the move,

176
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,390
and they definitely are too.

177
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,960
Right now, the rear

178
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
is the weakest point for both sides.

179
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,230
Forget it.

180
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,120
In Sword King City,

181
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,250
I was careless once.

182
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,750
This time,
I'll make sure to keep you safe.

183
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,880
That's a good thing.

184
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,410
Why did Biluo Palace

185
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,750
build so many

186
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,000
identical houses?

187
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:12,960
Senior!

188
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,200
Senior!

189
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,360
Mr. Tang?

190
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,620
Don't speak so loudly.

191
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,550
Be careful not to reveal our location.

192
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,350
What's wrong?

193
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,900
Isn't fighting forbidden

194
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,100
inside Biluo Palace?

195
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,250
It is,

196
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,250
but what if no one finds out?

197
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,910
Tonight, there will be patrols

198
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,240
in Zixiao Courtyard.

199
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,440
While they're patrolling,

200
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,900
we can't be seen fighting.

201
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,200
If we are caught,

202
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,070
we'll be locked up.

203
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,390
If the patrollers don't see it,

204
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,630
it doesn't count as fighting.

205
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,330
Palace Chief Wanyu surely knows

206
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,240
that the Central Plains Sword Alliance

207
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,900
and Fengliu Shop are enemies.

208
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,200
He separated all of us

209
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,950
into different rooms

210
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,720
to see

211
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,550
who on each side

212
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,200
could identify the key points

213
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,390
and take charge,

214
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,350
and whether teammates
have any tacit understanding

215
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,710
to help each other.

216
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,870
The guards here

217
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,150
are surprisingly few.

218
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,630
His goal

219
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,000
is to watch us fight each other.

220
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,150
How will he determine the results?

221
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,840
The side

222
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,200
with more people down

223
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,670
will be the loser.

224
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,530
What should we do then?

225
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,490
I'll go find Master Cheng.

226
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,680
Chi Yun's room

227
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,350
is in the second column from the east,

228
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,810
second row from the north.

229
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,630
You...

230
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,550
Master Cheng,

231
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,870
you must be very careful.

232
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,760
Why did he suddenly go quiet?

233
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,690
What are you doing?

234
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,590
The Tai'e Sword!

235
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,340
Good people are always so well-behaved.

236
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,070
Presumptuous!

237
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,340
Where is she hiding?

238
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,660
I'll find you.

239
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,270
It's you,

240
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,150
Tang Lici?

241
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,440
That enchantress from Fengliu Shop

242
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,020
broke the rule.

243
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,870
She used force.

244
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,960
Master Cheng, who are you planning

245
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
to report this to?

246
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,270
As long as we aren't caught,

247
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,400
it doesn't count as breaking the rule.

248
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,440
But...

249
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,270
the Sword Master's token,

250
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,130
the Tai'e Sword, was taken by her.

251
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,440
Gu Xitan—

252
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,360
he's in the first room on the left

253
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,670
after passing two pavilions to the east.

254
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,870
He's with Chi Yun.

255
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,270
You go find them first

256
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,690
and save your strength.

257
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,750
I'll go retrieve the Tai'e Sword.

258
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,670
Can I trust you?

259
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,440
If you don't trust me,

260
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,770
who else can you trust?

261
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,950
Master Cheng.

262
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,270
Master Cheng!

263
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,560
East is that way.

264
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,680
I don't need you to tell me.

265
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,000
Palace Chief,

266
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,030
who do you think will win?

267
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,860
Steward Bi,

268
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
observe the stars

269
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,440
with your eyes

270
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,440
and perceive them with your heart.

271
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,670
The rooms in Zixiao Courtyard

272
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,320
are arranged in 6 rows and 6 columns.

273
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,270
In total there are 3600 of them.

274
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,000
When I found Gu Xitan

275
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,800
in the 1st corridor to the north,

276
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,480
Cheng Yunpao and Xifang Tao

277
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,200
were fighting at the pavilion

278
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,930
where the 4th and 5th corridors
to the north meet.

279
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,880
Xifang Tao took the Tai'e Sword
and escaped.

280
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:19,870
Cheng Yunpao met me

281
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,320
at the intersection
of the 2nd corridor to the north

282
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,120
and the 4th corridor to the east.

283
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,470
North of there

284
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,740
is the courtyard wall.

285
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,360
To the east, she'd have to go past Chi Yun

286
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,240
and Shui.

287
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,030
The only possibility is...

288
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,490
There are many rules
in the martial arts world.

289
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,240
When we first enter
the martial arts world,

290
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,440
we knew there were things we mustn't do,

291
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,850
like rape, robbery,

292
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,200
murder, and arson.

293
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,510
Some people ignore these rules,

294
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,360
but they have their own.

295
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,030
For example, Chi Yun is a master thief,

296
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,120
but he only steals from the unrighteous.

297
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,030
Shen Langhun

298
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,200
only takes contracts
to kill people in jianghu

299
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,960
and doesn't harm the weak, the elderly,
women, or children.

300
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,840
Indeed.

301
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,480
But there are always some people

302
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,010
who don't follow the rules.

303
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,080
Like Fengliu Shop.

304
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,750
Those who follow the righteous path

305
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,560
all wish to eliminate them.

306
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,380
In jianghu, besides rules,

307
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,510
there are other things.

308
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,440
There's a blurry line.

309
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,510
Some people

310
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,390
can exploit loopholes in the rules

311
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,030
without breaking them.

312
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,270
Those are the ones who ultimately survive.

313
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,000
And these people

314
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,270
will eventually become
a different kind of person.

315
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,070
Palace Chief, are you saying...

316
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,770
the ones who make the rules?

317
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,570
They are the ones

318
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,360
Biluo Palace should ally with.

319
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,490
The ones who make the rules

320
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,790
are the ones

321
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,930
Biluo Palace should ally with.

322
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,109
Madam,

323
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,680
when did you

324
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,740
join Fengliu Shop?

325
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,270
You don't need to know

326
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,819
what you're not supposed to know.

327
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,680
Fine.

328
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,069
I just want to know

329
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,200
when

330
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,839
Sword King...

331
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,400
I know

332
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,850
what you're thinking.

333
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,450
You're starting to suspect...

334
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,030
your father.

335
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,210
You think it's a secret?

336
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,400
In fact, Fengliu Shop

337
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,200
has known it all along.

338
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,640
Acting City Lord Yu,

339
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,590
it doesn't matter

340
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,240
whether your father

341
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,570
joined Fengliu Shop

342
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,350
or whether

343
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,640
he was really selling

344
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,900
the Blood Ghost Pills.

345
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,440
What matters

346
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,570
is the outcome.

347
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,270
And the outcome is that

348
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,680
when the truth was exposed,

349
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
Sword King City's reputation

350
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,590
was ruined,

351
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,950
the Tianyan Sword Wall was destroyed,

352
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,310
and your father

353
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,640
died at Tang Lici's hands.

354
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,520
Oh, right.

355
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,550
Are you wondering

356
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,080
why I dare

357
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,770
to use force against you here?

358
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,410
When doing bad things,

359
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,520
as long as you're not caught,

360
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,380
it doesn't make you a bad person.

361
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,720
Where did these bastards

362
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,280
go?

363
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,750
Good!

364
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,110
Here you are.

365
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,410
The second row from the north?

366
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,690
Who is it?

367
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,240
Gu?

368
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,600
Brother Chi,

369
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,330
Miss Shei, you're really here.

370
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,070
Now you call me Brother?

371
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,730
Well, my Senior isn't here.

372
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,920
I see.

373
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,590
Your Senior isn't here?

374
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,310
Then aren't we

375
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,240
in great danger?

376
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,960
Exactly.

377
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,350
Found them.

378
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,920
They're here.

379
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,230
Taking down 3 at once.

380
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,750
Don't run!

381
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,720
You're the one getting taken down.

382
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,450
Hold him.

383
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,540
Don't hit my face.

384
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,090
Get lost!

385
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,200
Stop!

386
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,720
Foxy Tang was right.

387
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,300
You're just an idiot.

388
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,270
All muscle,

389
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,720
no brains.

390
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:52,830
Fucui,

391
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,030
you broke the rule.

392
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,830
Come with us.

393
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,640
Didn't you see?

394
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,200
They used force too!

395
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,890
We didn't see that.

396
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,110
We only saw you use force

397
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,040
and injure them.

398
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,400
You set me up!

399
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,930
That's exactly what we did.

400
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,510
You dare use force in front of us

401
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,910
and offend Biluo Palace?

402
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,000
I don't dare!

403
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,760
Take him away.

404
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,270
You'll all pay for this!

405
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,850
Are you alright?

406
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,610
I'm perfectly fine.

407
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,200
Thank you for your hard work.

408
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,000
Foxy Tang's plan really worked.

409
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,810
We've already taken one down.

410
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,910
It's three actually.

411
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,830
Before coming here,

412
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,230
I found Hua Wuyan's room,

413
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,440
and Lady Qingchan was in there too.

414
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,750
By now, Tang Lici

415
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,560
should have captured them.

416
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,680
Tang Lici?

417
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,790
So Fengliu Shop

418
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,920
only has Bai Suche

419
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,050
and Xifang Tao left?

420
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,990
You did a good job acting just now.

421
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
It's Xifang Tao.

422
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,940
Shen, let's encircle her!

423
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,790
Shen?

424
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,760
Miss Shei,

425
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,490
let's hide inside first.

426
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,680
Why is there a floral scent?

427
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
I don't smell it. What floral scent?

428
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,720
Bai Suche?

429
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,030
Chi,

430
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,790
you really came?

431
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,480
Miss Bai,

432
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,150
why are you...

433
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,480
Such a fool.

434
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,600
Looks like West Palace Chief was right—

435
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,050
men

436
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,680
are always so easy to trick.

437
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,670
Stay away from me from now on.

438
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,290
Don't let me see you again.

439
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,250
Foxy Tang, why are you here?

440
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,360
I was chasing Xifang Tao.

441
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,030
She's not here?

442
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,680
I came here

443
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,010
chasing Xifang Tao too.

444
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,730
Shen even lost track of her.

445
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,510
Xifang Tao's rouge?

446
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,830
Hide Yu Furen

447
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,560
and then wander around

448
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,880
to lure Chi Yun out.

449
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,300
I'll go catch the people in the rooms.

450
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,890
This rouge

451
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,030
will make them think you're me.

452
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,030
We got trapped.

453
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,110
Foxy Tang!

454
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,750
We lost Gu Xitan,

455
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,880
Yu Furen, and Shei;

456
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,480
captured Bai Suche,

457
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,610
Lady Qingchan,

458
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,720
and Hua Wuyan;

459
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,930
and took down Fucui.

460
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,310
We're one person ahead of Fengliu Shop.

461
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,370
But Xifang Tao

462
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,960
took the token that Master Shao

463
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,400
gave to Master Cheng—

464
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,720
the Tai'e Sword.

465
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,110
This is a significant achievement.

466
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,240
Even though

467
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,100
they lost one more person than us,

468
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,160
in reality,

469
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,200
they have the upper hand.

470
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,590
Yes.

471
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,360
Forget about Chi Yun.

472
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,750
This time I acted impulsively

473
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,830
and failed to protect Shei and the others.

474
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,640
Forget about me? What does that mean?

475
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,770
It's not your fault.

476
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,550
Xifang Tao targeted Chi Yun

477
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,480
just like we targeted Fucui.

478
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,950
We'd all tend to go after

479
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,560
the most naive member
in the opposing camp.

480
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,510
I've let everyone down.

481
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,840
It's already 3 a.m.

482
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,160
There's less than 2 hours

483
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,510
before we meet Palace Chief Wanyu.

484
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,240
Given the size of Zixiao Courtyard,

485
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,790
as long as Xifang Tao

486
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,000
keeps moving,

487
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,190
it'll be hard for us to catch her.

488
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,480
Interesting.

489
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,460
Besides finding Xifang Tao

490
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,060
and retrieving Tai'a Sword,

491
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,680
I also have a way

492
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,010
to rescue all the captured people.

493
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,550
Xifang Tao can hide,

494
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,920
but those she caught

495
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,180
cannot.

496
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,240
She must have,

497
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,280
like us,

498
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,590
hidden them in a room.

499
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,000
And that room

500
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,670
is one we wouldn't check,

501
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,400
because it originally

502
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,750
housed one of our own.

503
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,380
This person is rigid

504
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,310
and lost something valuable.

505
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,240
While searching for the lost item,

506
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,350
they might have also lost themselves.

507
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,010
You're talking about Cheng Yunpao,
aren't you?

508
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,830
Exactly.

509
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,750
They must be in Master Cheng's room.

510
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,180
Why did I not only fail
to find the enchantress

511
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,310
but end up back here?

512
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,550
I thought

513
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,210
the one who came was Tang Lici.

514
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,970
Since you're here,

515
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,920
he must be searching
all over Zixiao Courtyard

516
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,590
to find me.

517
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Once dawn breaks,

518
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,230
I'll win.

519
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,940
Let me tell you a secret.

520
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,200
Actually, Tang Lici

521
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,540
never actually

522
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,680
wanted to kill Liu Yan.

523
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,720
You're just a pawn

524
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,310
he's been using.

525
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,510
A wooden bell?

526
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,110
It's time.

527
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,030
This is a wooden bell

528
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,440
I made with my own hands.

529
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,310
It makes a sound

530
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,390
that only I can hear.

531
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,310
Mr. Tang, it seems

532
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,480
you are not only exceptional
in martial arts and intelligence,

533
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,010
but also in craftsmanship.

534
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,550
A good hunter

535
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,000
often

536
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,300
disguises himself as prey.

537
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,750
Miss Xifang,

538
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,400
we meet again.

539
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,790
Miss Xifang?

540
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,350
The Tai'e Sword

541
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,810
has returned
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

542
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
Mr. Tang, you only won a small round.

543
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,200
This is not a victory.

544
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,750
It's not dawn yet.

545
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,180
Mr. Tang,

546
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,610
don't get separated from those around you.

547
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:39,830
Enchantress,

548
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,670
give me back the Tai'e Sword!

549
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,760
Master Cheng!

550
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,760
You got the Tai'e Sword back?

551
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,650
This is my room.

552
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,960
Why is everyone here?

553
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,090
Where is Bandit Chi?

554
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,280
Master Cheng,

555
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,550
you'd better

556
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,240
not leave

557
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,300
this room anymore.

558
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,400
The Tai'e Sword

559
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,300
has returned
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

560
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,870
Everything's settled.

561
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,410
Dawn should be breaking soon.

562
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,030
Looks like

563
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,510
Tang Lici and Xifang Tao

564
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,940
have already decided the winner.

565
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,720
Master Cheng,

566
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,550
Mr. Tang.

567
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,060
Congratulations.

568
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,510
The Palace Chief will only see one person.

569
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,510
Which one of you is going to meet him?

570
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,550
I'm just the middleman.

571
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,199
Master Cheng is here

572
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,070
on behalf of
the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

573
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:18,590
So,

574
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Master Cheng should be the one to go.

575
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,260
Please.

576
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,250
I'll go right away.

577
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,320
I'm Cheng Yunpao from Camellia Island,

578
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,920
a branch
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

579
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,870
Greetings, Palace Chief Wanyu.

580
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,480
Why is the Central Plains Sword Alliance

581
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,840
visiting Biluo Palace?

582
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,030
What?

583
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,680
The negotiation failed?

584
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,480
Rigid Cheng, you...

585
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,130
Who are you talking to, Bandit Chi?

586
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,190
I'm talking to you!

587
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,960
We worked all night

588
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,280
and finally got a chance

589
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,740
to meet that palace chief.

590
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
And you messed it up?

591
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,440
What if he allies with Fengliu Shop

592
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,370
and kills us to show his sincerity?

593
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,150
Foxy Tang,

594
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,290
don't you agree?

595
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,010
Where are you going?

596
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,000
I've fulfilled my promise,

597
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,840
so I'll leave.

598
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,000
Wait.

599
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,400
Biluo Palace

600
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,280
didn't agree

601
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,480
to ally with the Sword Alliance, did it?

602
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,800
So what?

603
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,780
My agreement with Master Puzhu

604
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,960
was only to introduce
the envoy of the Sword Alliance

605
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,560
to the chief of Biluo Palace.

606
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,070
Whether

607
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,960
an alliance is formed

608
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,740
is none of my concern.

609
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,670
If Biluo Palace

610
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,190
is going to ally with the Sword Alliance,

611
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,650
Liu Yan would surely come.

612
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,110
He won't let this happen.

613
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,600
Master Cheng,

614
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,040
how did you negotiate

615
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,450
with Palace Chief Wanyu?

616
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,190
Why is the Central Plains Sword Alliance

617
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,590
visiting Biluo Palace?

618
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,960
The Wanyu clan

619
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,280
was framed by Yique Yinyang

620
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,080
and fled here.

621
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,520
You've lived in seclusion for 30 years.

622
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,150
Now, Fengliu Shop
is wreaking havoc in jianghu.

623
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,860
The Blood Ghost Pills they are spreading

624
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,660
are a poison Yique Yinyang left.

625
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,770
This Tai'e Sword

626
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,320
was left by Jiangnan Feng,
the ancestor of the Sword Alliance.

627
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,630
It represents the authority
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

628
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,070
I,

629
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,840
entrusted by Master Shao

630
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,110
and bearing this sword
as a token of sincerity,

631
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,630
earnestly request the Wanyu clan,
the former Imperial Preceptor,

632
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,820
for the sake of your past vengeance

633
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,930
and present justice,

634
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,060
to join forces with the Sword Alliance

635
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,770
to oppose Fengliu Shop
for all under heaven.

636
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,550
Is this

637
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,480
the sincerity
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance?

638
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,030
I am truly disappointed.

639
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,060
Palace Chief Wanyu...

640
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,320
Invite Miss Xifang here.

641
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:29,960
Yes.

642
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,350
Master Cheng,

643
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,320
you're really naive.

644
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,070
It's no surprise at all

645
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,070
that the Central Plains Sword Alliance

646
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,600
can't defeat Fengliu Shop.

647
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,760
Mr. Tang,

648
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,840
why are you being so sarcastic?

649
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,050
Forming an alliance

650
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,030
is simply exchanging your conditions

651
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,630
for those of the other party.

652
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,190
Did Master Shao mention

653
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,370
any conditions

654
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,590
the Sword Alliance

655
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,480
could offer Biluo Palace before you left?

656
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:04,960
No.

657
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,030
He only told me to form an alliance

658
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,860
with Biluo Palace no matter what.

659
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,260
Then what should I do now?

660
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,410
What conditions

661
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,590
should I offer

662
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,930
Palace Chief Wanyu?

663
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,000
You should consider

664
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,150
what Palace Chief Wanyu

665
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:19,840
needs.

666
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,910
Doesn't Biluo Palace

667
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,130
just want to return to the Central Plains?

668
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,550
I'm Xifang Tao, Palace Chief

669
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,480
of the West Palace of Fengliu Shop.

670
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,120
Greetings, Palace Chief Wanyu.

671
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,110
In Biluo Palace,

672
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:48,290
only the Palace Chief can be addressed
as Palace Chief.

673
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,300
I apologize for my rudeness.

674
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,400
I, Xifang Tao,

675
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,090
pay my respects to Palace Chief Wanyu.

676
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,730
You requested to enter Biluo Palace.

677
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,060
What do you want to say?

678
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,320
Fengliu Shop is willing to offer

679
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,760
one-third of the martial arts world

680
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,190
to invite you

681
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,510
to join Fengliu Shop.

682
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,600
The world
doesn't belong to Fengliu Shop yet.

683
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,360
If you agree,

684
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,710
who in this world

685
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,730
could possibly stop the alliance

686
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,930
of Biluo Palace and Fengliu Shop?

687
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,510
But last night, Fengliu Shop's

688
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,370
performance in Zixiao Courtyard

689
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,440
was not enough to prove this point.

690
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,280
Palace Chief Wanyu, perhaps you should

691
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,070
focus on more practical matters.

692
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,920
Xifang Tao,

693
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
mind your words.

694
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,760
The fall of the former dynasty

695
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,840
was closely related to

696
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,710
the old Palace Chief's recommendation

697
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,710
of Yique Yinyang.

698
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,400
Now that the dynasty has changed,

699
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,820
no one can stop Biluo Palace

700
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,700
from returning to the Central Plains,

701
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,510
but people still vividly remember

702
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,070
the suffering of those years.

703
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,070
Will the people

704
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,360
truly not hold the Wanyu clan accountable?

705
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,260
Presumptuous!

706
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,840
If you help the Sword Alliance,

707
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,960
Biluo Palace will remain Biluo Palace,

708
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,230
never greater
than the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

709
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,690
this righteous alliance.

710
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,760
You may even

711
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,820
be constrained

712
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,960
by your past mistakes.

713
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,750
But joining Fengliu Shop is different.

714
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
If Biluo Palace joins Fengliu Shop,

715
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,700
Fengliu Shop promises

716
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,440
to give one-third
of the martial arts world

717
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,170
under Biluo Palace's control,

718
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,320
and Fengliu Shop
will not interfere in the slightest.

719
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,400
Palace Chief Wanyu,

720
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,120
why don't you lead Biluo Palace

721
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,050
to dominate the martial arts world

722
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,930
and restore the Wanyu clan's honor?

723
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,500
Master Cheng brought the Tai'e Sword.

724
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,910
And what did you bring?

725
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,290
to prove your promised conditions?

726
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,840
What I brought are my words,

727
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,170
spoken with authority.

728
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,380
No proof is needed.

729
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,630
Miss Xifang,

730
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,360
please return to Zixiao Courtyard to rest.

731
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,070
I...

732
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,520
will give you my answer later.

733
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,630
Mr. Tang.

734
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,190
Fucui

735
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,460
has been released.

736
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,780
Master Cheng

737
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,270
requested
to meet Palace Chief Wanyu again.

738
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,090
But Palace Chief Wanyu refused to see him.

739
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,090
Wanyu Yuedan won't see Master Cheng,

740
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,550
because

741
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,910
the current Sword Alliance

742
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,230
cannot offer Palace Chief Wanyu

743
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,190
what he wants.

744
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,800
What about Fengliu Shop?

745
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,480
Miss Shei, please have a seat.

746
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,280
What kind of person

747
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,360
do you think Wanyu Yuedan is?

748
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,510
A master.

749
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,510
He is not a master.

750
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,760
He's a king.

751
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,000
A king?

752
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,810
He's a king of jianghu,

753
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,490
who bows to no one

754
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,320
and submits to no threat.

755
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,630
When weak,

756
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,680
he flees to the ends of the earth.

757
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,610
When strong,

758
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,360
he rules the world.

759
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,990
Biluo Palace was destroyed

760
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,190
when Wanyu Moru was ruling,

761
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,150
