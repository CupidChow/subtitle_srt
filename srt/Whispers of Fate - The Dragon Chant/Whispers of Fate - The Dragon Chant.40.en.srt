perhaps I didn't care enough
for my disciple,

The bronze tree has come alive again?

190
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,790
Why did he ask me to come here?

191
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,330
Do you know that

192
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,380
the Heaven-Changing Scripture,
like the Rebirth Scroll,

193
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,310
can absorb another person's power

194
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,590
for one's own use?

195
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,070
Ghostly Peony

196
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,340
didn't tell you

197
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,260
about this, did he?

198
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,940
What are you worried about?

199
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,520
Worried that Zhong Chunji
will turn on you?

200
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,200
Or worried that your status as a heroine

201
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,260
will go up in smoke?

202
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,310
You're anxious and restless.

203
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
You're eager

204
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,530
to hurry back to the Sword Alliance

205
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,010
to fight for something for yourself.

206
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,380
Godfather,
you truly are extraordinarily wise.

207
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,480
If we expose now

208
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,120
that Zhong Chunji

209
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,360
is a fake princess,

210
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,530
there's still room to turn things around.

211
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,170
Attempts that are bound to fail

212
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,070
are not worth making.

213
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,510
Thanks to Tang Lici,

214
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
I now understand people

215
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
far better than before.

216
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,940
Before I understood human nature,

217
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,600
I thought a single tattoo

218
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,630
could turn someone

219
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,870
with an unknown background

220
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,270
into a princess,

221
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,080
my pawn.

222
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,720
But now I understand—

223
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,200
they never cared whether the princess

224
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
was real or fake.

225
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,760
They just needed someone to play the part

226
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,320
to strengthen their power.

227
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,640
I thought I fooled the world,

228
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,120
yet it turns out

229
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,280
I was the one being fooled.

230
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,770
People lie

231
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,840
and play dumb.

232
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,270
That is exactly

233
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,690
what makes the human heart so treacherous.

234
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,030
Godfather,

235
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,200
I want to ask you for something.

236
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,560
What is it?

237
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,240
Freedom.

238
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,240
You are my most prized student.

239
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,100
If I had freedom,

240
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,130
I would certainly grant it to you.

241
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,080
However,

242
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,290
a puppet's entire life

243
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,900
can never escape the pull of its strings.

244
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,890
As long as the master lives,

245
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,220
how can there be freedom?

246
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,630
Yique Yinyang said he needs us.

247
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,360
The bronze tree's roots
spread across the entire Shenzhou.

248
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,440
Tang Lici only destroyed

249
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,600
its trunk.

250
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,800
If...

251
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,880
the bronze tree can be restarted

252
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,510
and it can draw in the power
of all Shenzhou,

253
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,640
it could be revived.

254
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,530
By then,

255
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,370
he will be waiting for us
in the Reincarnation Sea.

256
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,750
The Reincarnation Sea?

257
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,030
The place where Yique Yinyang died?

258
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,960
Why would he be there?

259
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,910
A puppet...

260
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,100
doesn't need to know that much.

261
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,790
Finally,

262
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,270
it's done.

263
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,750
As long as I return
to the Reincarnation Sea,

264
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,030
where the Time Crack is located,

265
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,050
[In Memory of My Best friend, Chi Yun]
[In Memory of My Old friend, Liu Yan]

266
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:10,970
[In Memory of My Master and Friend,
Shao Yanping]

267
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,200
and activate it,

268
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,320
you

269
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,900
will all be able to come back.

270
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,200
You should be called

271
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,450
the Calamity-Free Cosmos.

272
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,080
This...

273
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,210
is the Reincarnation Sea.

274
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,340
It is said to be forged

275
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,870
from all the suffering of this world

276
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,200
that the Ancient Emperor collected.

277
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,910
Meanwhile,

278
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,080
it is the point where space and time

279
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,280
are at their weakest.

280
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,890
Ordinary people

281
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,690
cannot enter at all.

282
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,070
And Ye Mo

283
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,960
will only appear here.

284
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,670
It's time.

285
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,570
Master told me

286
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:11,840
that person

287
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,740
has already arrived
at the Reincarnation Sea.

288
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,830
This is the moment.

289
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,950
Activate the bronze tree's power
of absorption.

290
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,240
The Black Tuli
we've been accumulating for 20 years

291
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,120
will finally serve its purpose.

292
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,600
What is that?

293
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,530
This is the sign of the world's end.

294
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,090
Look over there!

295
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,460
That's Yique Yinyang!

296
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,600
What should we do now?

297
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,320
[Reincarnation Sea]

298
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,290
Yes.

299
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,360
You're here.

300
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,420
The stolen crystal

301
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,280
and the poisoned corpses
at West Wind Garden—

302
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,110
this was

303
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,800
all part of your plan.

304
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,440
Xifang Tao still has allies
in the Sword Alliance.

305
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,630
Your staying here is the only way

306
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,110
to prevent internal chaos.

307
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,680
Your goal

308
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,190
was to lure me here.

309
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,130
It seems that...

310
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,050
what the mural records

311
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,750
is not the past,

312
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,890
but the future.

313
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,590
You and I...

314
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,320
will meet here.

315
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,720
So it really is you.

316
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,790
The Sword Alliance is heavily guarded.

317
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,260
How did the fake rescue letter
forged by Xifang Tao

318
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,860
get out of the Sword Alliance

319
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,510
and reach the disciples
of Huoyun Fortress?

320
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,100
I mentioned Liuyan's hiding place

321
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,900
only to Master Shao.

322
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,130
But I didn't realize

323
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,640
you were there

324
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,190
at the time.

325
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,920
When I rescued Liu Yan,

326
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,950
I blocked almost every killing strike—

327
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,510
except yours,

328
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,510
the one strike from you
when you came to help.

329
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,000
Go now!

330
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,600
Your work wasn't flawless;

331
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,980
it was actually full of holes.

332
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,960
Yet I refused

333
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,500
to suspect you.

334
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,630
Stone.

335
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,670
Master,

336
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,830
how could something fake

337
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,350
fool your eyes?

338
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,090
I am indeed Stone,

339
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,780
but I am also Ye Mo.

340
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,240
Both of them

341
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,730
are the real me.

342
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,080
So,

343
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,710
you look exactly like him.

344
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,390
Because...

345
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,250
he is my puppet.

346
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,720
Setting a trap
and having Ghostly Peony possess my body

347
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,240
was only your first move.

348
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
And making me become Fang Zhou to Stone,

349
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,720
teaching you that human nature
is inherently good

350
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,910
and letting you experience emotions

351
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,440
and awaken as Ye Mo—

352
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,180
that was your backup plan.

353
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,860
Master, you're right.

354
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,970
Have a seat.

355
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,790
We still have a long way to go.

356
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,390
We have time to talk.

357
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,320
You know what, Master?

358
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,180
I truly admire you
from the bottom of my heart.

359
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,190
If

360
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,430
I stay as your disciple a little longer,

361
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,190
perhaps

362
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,859
I will no longer want

363
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,359
to become Ye Mo again.

364
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,329
What are you thinking about, Master?

365
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,589
I'm wondering...

366
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,690
if someone with the god‑like power

367
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,200
of Yique Yinyang

368
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,980
were to use it for good,

369
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,480
what would this world become?

370
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,070
This is the question

371
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,600
Fang Zhou had been pondering all along.

372
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,480
When he met me at Mount Li,

373
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,330
he saw my golden eyes and forehead mark.

374
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,690
At that time,

375
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,720
he wasn't sure

376
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,320
whether I was Yique Yinyang,

377
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,030

386
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,370

439
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,500
This is the truth of the world.

440

What does it have to do with my choices?

441
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,630
What you're saying

442
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,880
is not the reason

443
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,810
you chose to become Yique Yinyang.

444
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:54,960
The fate of the two of us was determined

445
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,560
from the moment we were born.

446
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,000
We are the same kind.

447
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,070
No matter how different

448
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,070
the paths we took,

449
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
we will always

450
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,120
meet the same end.

451
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,340
Master,

452
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,800
you are good in every way—

453
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,870
except that you are too naive.

454
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
So naive that even now

455
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,860
you still hold hope about human nature.

456
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,850
The goodness you pursue

457
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,210
is nothing

458
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,210
but an illusion.

459
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,030
If you know what I, your disciple,

460
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,110
have done,

461
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,920
will you

462
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,020
still be so naive?

463
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,510
Let me guess

464
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,880
what you intend to do.

465
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,560
You merged
Ghostly Peony's Heaven-Changing Scripture

466
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,800
into the bronze tree,

467
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,370
using it to operate the Black Tuli

468
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,370
as nourishment for the bronze tree,

469
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,310
driving it to grow toward the Void.

470
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,370
What you truly want

471
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,140
is to use the bronze tree as a medium

472
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,770
to draw the power of Shenzhou

473
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,750
and link the bronze tree

474
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,920
to the Xuan Tree above the Void,

475
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,260
allowing the Tianren Realm

476
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,830
to reappear.

477
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,110
Tang Lici,

478
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,950
you can't stop
the bronze tree from growing.

479
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,920
Dream on.

480
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,000
Come on.

481
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,640
It's time

482
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,850
to complete the mission of a puppet.

483
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,170
Master, you're so clever.

484
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,830
You've figured out

485
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,110
everything I've done.

486
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,400
The spiritual energy above the Void
has dried up.

487
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,160
Our people suffer

488
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,960
from the Tianren Five Declines.

489
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,680
That's why they sent me

490
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,750
to Shenzhou.

491
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,630
All of it was for this very day.

492
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,930
To end the Tianren Five Declines,

493
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,610
you are willing to sacrifice
the whole Shenzhou.

494
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,780
The mistakes made by

495
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
the Tianren Realm itself back then—

496
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,480
you now want the living beings

497
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,110
of Shenzhou to pay for them.

498
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,650
Dream on!

499
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,370
I'm using this filthy and wicked world

500
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,940
to bring
the Tianren Realm back to Shenzhou,

501
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,200
freeing them
from the cycle of life and death

502
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,670
and granting them immortality.

503
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,500
By then,

504
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,550
you can even

505
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,750
bring your friend back to life,

506
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,160
and you can have me continue

507
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,890
being your obedient disciple.

508
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,690
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

509
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,120
There is indeed much evil in this world,

510
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,240
but there are also many things

511
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,300
worth cherishing.

512
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,280
Every life is free

513
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,440
and should not be sacrificed

514
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,970
for someone else's desire.

515
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
Kindness is human nature.

516
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,550
Even though human nature is fragile

517
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,830
and love and hate are ever‑changing,

518
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,200
given even one chance,

519
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,790
no one would willingly
sink into eternal darkness

520
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,550
and become a puppet

521
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,880
who shares their master's joy and sorrow.

522
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,270
Everyone

523
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,070
deserves a chance

524
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,270
to start anew.

525
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,970
You always wear that bracelet.

526
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,750
Perhaps there's still goodness in you.

527
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,020
Master Puzhu,

528
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,100
what's inside these beads

529
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
is deadly poison—

530
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,480
cinnabar.

531
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,920
It can be poison,

532
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,790
but it can also be medicine.

533
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,270
It all depends

534
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,290
on a single thought in you.

535
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,590
Light Technique—

536
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,010
Stars Scattered Across the Sky.

537
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,800
Didn't you want freedom?

538
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,740
Becoming a part of the bronze tree—

539
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,430
that is freedom.

540
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,840
Master,

541
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,500
this is the final move.

542
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,110
This is

543
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,120
true freedom.

544
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,040
The Peach of Three Hues—

545
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,890
Perish Together.

546
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
So...

547
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,070
this is what it feels like.

548
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,680
I'll call you Little Puppet.

549
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,440
You said just now

550
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,850
that you still want to be Stone.

551
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,860
That means your conscience
hasn't completely gone.

552
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,750
Let go of your hatred.

553
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,580
Don't knock it down.

554
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,160
Only by not knocking it down

555
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,930
can you truly claim it as yours.

556
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,890
Master,

557
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,980
how could you forget everything?

558
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,170
Master, you have done no evil,

559
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,080
yet evil happened because of you.

560
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,310
Everywhere you go, there is destruction.

561
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,170
How are you any different from me?

562
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,070
I...

563
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,920
just want to live.

564
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,440
Master,

565
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,680
now I'm grateful

566
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,860
that I wasn't swayed by your naivety

567
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,660
and didn't forget
the most important mission

568
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,790
I was born to fulfill.

569
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,480
Master,

570
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,230
the time has come.

571
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,640
Your coming here to fight me

572
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,200
was all part of my plan.

573
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,440
We are both Holy Sons.

574
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,440
I need two streams of power

575
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,050
from the Tianren Realm to merge

576
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,860
in order to activate the bronze tree

577
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,980
to draw out the Xuan Tree above the Void,

578
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,590
and bring the Tianren Realm
back into the world.

579
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,680
What I want is not just

580
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,940
the power of Shenzhou.

581
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,720
What I want

582
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,940
is your power.

583
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,480
The bronze tree has already merged with me

584
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,400
completely.

585
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,910
All things are me,

586
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,430
and I am all things.

587
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,590
Now the entire Shenzhou

588
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,480
will be mine.

589
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,680
Master,

590
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,640
come on.

591
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,830
Witness the return of the Tianren Realm

592
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,000
to Shenzhou with me.

593
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,920
Run!

594
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,110
Everything is over.

595
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,200
Yes.

596
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,190
It's over.

597
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,650
I always thought

598
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,250
that if I were persistent enough,

599
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,480
strong enough,

600
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,510
I could protect everything I cherish.

601
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,000
But in the end,

602
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,920
I gradually realized...

603
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,410
that I couldn't.

604
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:01,930
Let's go!

605
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,630
To Sword King City!

606
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,400
I can't let you go.

607
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,480
Sand City was so beautiful.

608
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,030
He had so much fun.

609
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,230
When it was time to leave,

610
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,000
he was reluctant to leave.

611
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,170
Because Sand City doesn't belong to him.

612
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,770
He couldn't take it with him.

613
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,750
Mr. Tang,

614
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,160
you've lost.

615
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,360
I haven't finished

616
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,110
what I want to do yet.

617
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,790
I'm useless.

618
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,610
What are you doing?

619
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,240
This half of the Rebirth Scroll

620
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,570
was yours to begin with.

621
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,050
I'm just returning it
to its rightful owner.

622
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,200
No!

623
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,510
Stop it now!

624
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,000
The transfer has already started.

625
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,110
If we stop now,

626
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,590
wouldn't I end up

627
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,750
like Fang Zhou?

628
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
You know that better than I do.

629
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,680
No...

630
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,510
No!

631
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,880
With this half of the Rebirth Scroll,

632
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,070
at least your life

633
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,070
can be preserved.

634
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,590
At least it gives me time

635
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,000
to find a way to save you!

636
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,590
But if you...

637
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,430
you give it back to me now,

638
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,440
then…

639
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,240
No!

640
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,350
Liu Yan,

641
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,400
you can't do this.

642
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,510
Lici,

643
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,210
I have the body
of the Ten Thousand Curse Bugs.

644
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,880
I can use my own body

645
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,560
to cultivate medicinal primers

646
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,080
to make Blood Ghost Pills.

647
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,160
That's why Ghostly Peony

648
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,760
destroyed all my meridians.

649
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,310
But...

650
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,420
there is still one he doesn't know about—

651
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,070
my heart meridian.

652
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,000
Lici,

653
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,160
I've lost in this life.

654
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,030
Lost completely.

655
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,440
That's why you must win.

656
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,030
Win back everything...

657
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,960
including my share.

658
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,750
I used to

659
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,690
never want to lose anything

660
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,480
or let anything go.

661
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,250
I wanted to hold on to everyone

662
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,850
and change every ending.

663
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,610
But the more I tried to grasp,

664
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,830
the more I lost.

665
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,220
So...

666
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,790
it's better to let go.

667
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Life and death happen in an instant;

668
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,650
all things return to their origin.

669
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,790
To overturn heaven and earth

670
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,550
is to be reborn.

671
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,180
Rebirth Scroll—

672
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,960
reincarnation.

673
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,830
A complete Rebirth Scroll?

674
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,770
How is that possible?

675
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,970
When did you...

676
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,720
When you thought

677
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,650
you had seriously injured Liu Yan.

678
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,850
When you believed
you had controlled everything

679
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,980
and victory was already in your grasp.

680
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,500
The splendor of the mortal world

681
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,160
is as fleeting as morning dew—

682
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,500
only when it's lost

683
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,670
do we feel regret and sorrow.

684
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,870
Love and hate

685
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,990
shift in an instant.

686
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,900
Only possession

687
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,810
can leave a lasting mark on the heart.

688
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,540
Then I'll teach you
the Three Character Classic.

689
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,750
Man...

690
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,000
on...

691
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,640
earth,

692
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,190
good...

693
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,790
at...

694
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,350
birth.

695
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,110
If everything in this world

696
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,880
became an unchanging eternity,

697
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:22,270
it would no longer be worth remembering,

698
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,940
let alone cherishing.

699
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,550
You understand

700
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,280
all of this—

701
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,719
you're just...

702
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,080
too afraid.

703
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,320
Am I?

704
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,210
What will happen then?

705
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,630
Where will I go?

706
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,790
You are still attached to Shenzhou.

707
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,030
The next time we meet,

708
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,810
you will be an ordinary human.

709
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,240
An ordinary human?

710
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,310
What do I need to do?

711
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,490
Just follow your heart—

712
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,590
grow,

713
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,270
live,

714
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,030
and spend your life freely.

715
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,520

Of course.

899
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
It's said

900
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,550
that at the foot of Mount Li,

901
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,070
there lived a white fox

902
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,360
who had been startling the villagers.

903
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,760
In Zhoudi Tower,
there was a man of great kindness

904
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,840
who moved it with compassion

905
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,480
and taught it music.

906
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,430
And so, 7 years passed.

907
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,610
Little Fox.

908
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,790
One day, clouds rose and mist gathered,

909
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,140
and a white dragon soared into the sky.

910
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,850
Four years later,

911
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,720
when calamity struck the world,

912
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,280
the fox-dragon,
remembering the kindness it once received,

913
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,840
offered itself as the way

914
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,760
and reversed the fate of heaven and earth.

915
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,560
Then it vanished among the common people.
