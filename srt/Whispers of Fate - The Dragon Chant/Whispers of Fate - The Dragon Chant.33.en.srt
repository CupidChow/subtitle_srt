[Episode 33]

3
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,110
Don't you dare... hurt my master...

4
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,150
Since you're so eager to die for him,

5
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,920
I'll grant your wish.

6
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,310
You can actually wake up in that state—

7
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,870
and it's because of him?

8
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,910
Someone like you
actually cares about others?

9
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,900
And you care about

10
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,690
such an insignificant person.

11
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,760
How laughable.

12
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,840
Fine.

13
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,480
Then I'll let you

14
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,870
watch...

15
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,280
Almost there.

16
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,270
Watch the person you care about
die right in front of you.

Stone...

18
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,850

Yan,

20
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,890
why don't you understand?

21
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,870
Back then...

22
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,079
I was just like you.

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,079

00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,760
How did you recover?

27
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,880
You were clearly struck by

28
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,620
the Thousand Curse Needle!

29
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,190
Shut up.

Liu Yan.

31
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,410
Your Thousand Curse Needle

32
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,040
did almost kill me,

33
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,850
but

34
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,740
Fang Zhou's

35

heart crystal, which blocked
my heart meridian,

36
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,180
also blocked your needle.

37
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,190
I extracted his heart crystal,

38
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,090
and the power

39
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,130
condensed within it before he died

40
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,500
merged with my meridians.

41
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,850
That was his way

42
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,579
of telling me

43
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,220
not to hate myself.

44
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,300
Letting him go

45
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,360
was the right choice.

46
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,060
Fang Zhou

47
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,950
saved me again.

48
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,829
Impossible!

49
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,640
Fang Zhou saved you?

50
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,220

You know what?

53
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,670
The first time I ever felt regret

54
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,100
was...

55
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,500
for not killing you.

56
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,980
Show me your strongest move.

and cut off his last chance to revive.

141

To break free from this,

Yan!

196
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,620
As for you,

197
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,690
from the very day I met you

198
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,820
by the Yellow River,

199
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,730
I knew you were

200
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,330
far too easy to control.

201
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,430
Without obsession,

202
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,570
you'd never become extreme.

203
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,180
Without extremity,
you'd never be narrow-minded.

204
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,450
Without narrow-mindedness,

205
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,710
you'd have left me no opening to exploit,

206
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,830
nor any chance to lead you astray.

207
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,400
In other words,

208
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,810
all weaknesses

209
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,450
stem from human emotions.

210
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,670
Without emotions,
there would be no weaknesses

211
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,940
and no mistakes.

212
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:33,990
Master Liu.

213
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,370
Goodbye.

214
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,850
The Lotus of Salvation blooms,
guiding countless souls across.

215
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,780
Yan.

216
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,140
Remember:

217
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,900
strive to live on.

218
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,400
Lici!

219
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,500
Lici!

220
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,210
I didn't expect

221
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,610
that in such a short time,

222
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,300
you could break
the Heaven-Changing Scripture.

223
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,500
You truly have the real Rebirth Scroll.

224
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,230
Unfortunately,

225
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,590
you have only half of it.

226
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,250
Are you looking for this?

227
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,140
Mr. Tang,

228
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,660
you've lost.

229
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:10,770
Shei,

230
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,380
please invite Mr. Tang

231
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,980
to the Plum Garden for a chat.

232
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,380
The mighty Minister Tang

233
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,210
picked up someone
whose throat had been slit.

234
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,180
You're actually still alive.

235
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,860
They say

236
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,180
Minister Tang even adopted him
as his godson.

237
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,970
Really?

238
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,620
He survived even with his throat slit?

239
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,750
You're still alive.

240
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,620
You're still alive.

241
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,050
How can you still be alive?

242
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,540
How?

243
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,280
How can you still be alive after that?

244
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,900
Monster!

245
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,140
You're a monster!

246
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,860
Why won't the jar
return to its original form?

247
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,860
Why?

248
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,140
Look at this pitiful creature.

249
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,420
Is it that your enemy can't be killed,

250
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,900
or do you not dare to kill again?

251
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,580
Poor thing.

252
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,660
How pathetic.

253
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,380
Who is it?

254
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,660
Who's there?

255
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,820
How laughable...

256
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,620
Who is it?

257
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,940
Who's there playing tricks?

258
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,010
Who?

259
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,670
The wine jar that can't be opened.

260
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,340
The fire starter that can't be lit.

261
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,040
The qin string

262
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,860
that can never be tuned!

263
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,750
Who do you think you are?

264
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,730
What gives you the right

265
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,050
to judge me?

266
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,900
I'm someone

267
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,290
who can help you make Tang Lici

268
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,770
regret everything he's done.

269
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,790
This is the last one left in the world.

270
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,130
Please cherish your hands.

271
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,800
They're very precious to me.

272
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,610
An evil pill!

273
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,340
An evil pill...

274
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,230
Yan.

275
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,780
Remember:

276
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,860
strive to live on.

277
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,420
Do you see

278
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,340
clearly now?

279
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:50,970
Lici...

280
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,880
I was wrong...

281
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,900
Fang Zhou...

282
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,290
I'm sorry.

283
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,010
Lici...

284
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,900
You can't die.

285
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,770
You can't die...

286
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,120
[Plum Garden]

287
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,770
Stone is seriously injured
and still unconscious.

288
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,620
Tang Lici and Shei

289
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,660
are nowhere to be found.

290
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,290
It must have been Liu Yan

291
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,290
who took them away during the chaos.

292
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,530
There are traces of sword energy
in the valley

293
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,860
behind Qingyang Realm.

294
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,070
Shen is tracking it.

295
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,200
Hopefully, he'll find something.

296
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,660
Listen to me...

297
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,810
Save...

298
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,140
I keep having the same dream.

299
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,740
The dream in which I kill you.

300
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,870
I've dreamed it countless times.

301
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,900
Each time I dream,

302
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,010
I kill you in a different way—

303
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,420
each one more cruel

304
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,820
and vicious than the last.

305
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,180
Save...

306
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,860
I've even been shocked awake...

307
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:22,860
Save...

308
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,120
By my own viciousness.

309
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,660
But the moment I saw you,

310
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,450
I realized

311
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,940
that all those methods in my dreams

312
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,650
weren't vicious enough.

313
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,240
Have you ever experienced
Floating Light Like Dreams?

314
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,680
It'll make you give in
to your inner demon,

315
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,700
forcing you to relive
your most painful memories.

316
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,900
I'll let you

317
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,340
die slowly,

318
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,670
tortured in endless agony.

319
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,410
Save...

320
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,820
Tang Lici...

321
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,540
Ghostly Peony...

322
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,250
has...

323
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,340
has caught...

324
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,900
What did you say?

325
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,820
In the Plum Garden...

326
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:16,980
Save...

327
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,210
Save...

328
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,580
The Plum Garden?

329
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,380
What kind of place is that?

330
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:33,900
No idea.

331
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,620
But Liu Yan said

332
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,010
Tang Lici was taken there.

333
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,420
Can we trust

334
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,930
that fiend's words?

335
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,580
Then what should we do now?

336
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,580
We can't just abandon Mr. Tang, can we?

337
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,420
Whether what he said is true or not,

338
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,180
Mr. Tang's life hangs in the balance.

339
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,040
We can only choose to believe him.

340
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,340
What matters now

341
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,620
is quickly figuring out a way

342
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,660
to find Mr. Tang.

343
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,180
Perhaps there's one person

344
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,380
who might know about Mr. Tang's safety.

345
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,750
You, Enchantress from Fengliu Shop!

346
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,820
Master Puzhu,

347
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,270
what do you mean by this?

348
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,580
I'm here today

349
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,930
to introduce someone

350
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,390
to join the Sword Alliance.

351
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,340
I'm Xifang Tao.

352
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,820
Greetings, Master Shao.

353
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,580
Greetings, Mr. Shen.

354
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,580
I know who you are.

355
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,560
No need for pleasantries.

356
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,360
Master Puzhu,

357
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:24,930
you...

358
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,730
you want to recommend this Enchantress?

359
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,530
In this battle,

360
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,340
she helped us.

361
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,120
Indeed.

362
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,350
She helped Master Puzhu

363
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,030
kill Qiaoyi Qiankun.

364
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,810
I know well that Fengliu Shop

365
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:35,970
has committed countless evils,

366
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,010
selling the Evil Pill

367
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,820
and bringing disaster
to the martial arts world.

368
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,150
I've long wanted to
cut all ties with them.

369
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,900
I hope all of you Sword Masters
will not hold past grudges

370
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,030
and give me a chance.

371
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,440
I can provide

372
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,900
the full list of those who purchased

373
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,670
and consumed the Evil Pill.

374
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,490
I will definitely help the Sword Alliance

375
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,690
root out Fengliu Shop

376
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,410
and eradicate the scourge
of the Evil Pill.

377
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,450
Fine.

378
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,100
Then tell me now—

379
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,340
where is the Plum Garden?

380
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,860
Mr. Shen.

381
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,020
I'm afraid that if I tell you,

382
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,980
far more innocent lives

383
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,620
will be lost in vain
than those who perished

384
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,020
in Xiuyu Peony Pavilion.

385
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,150
Shen,

386
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,940
this isn't the place
to discuss such a matter.

387
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,740
Stone is seriously injured now.

388
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,040
Come with me to check on him first.

389
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,350
The outsider doesn't need to
come along, right?

390
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,050
Mr. Shen,

391
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,780
you seem to have some prejudice
against me.

392
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,430
Every bit of my martial arts skill

393
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,080
was taught by Ghostly Peony.

394
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,380
I know

395
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,040
his strength better than anyone.

396
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,440
Since he can defeat Tang Lici and Liu Yan,

397
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,970
with the weakened forces
remaining in the Sword Alliance,

398
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,830
attempting to attack Plum Garden

399
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,830
would be like throwing eggs at a rock.

400
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,820
Shen,

401
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,770
let Miss Xifang

402
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,560
come in and talk properly.

403
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,240
Miss Xifang.

404
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,870
Do you have more information

405
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,520
about Ghostly Peony and the Plum Garden?

406
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,550
Ghostly Peony

407
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,490
feels nothing.

408
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,660
I've been adopted by him for many years,

409
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,190
yet all I've ever seen in him

410
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,100
is

411
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,620
a monster devoid of

412
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,420
any feelings.

413
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,900
My fate

414
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,010
will be

415
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,940
no better than

416
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,770
that of those decayed puppets.

417
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,620
That's also one of the reasons

418
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,220
I defected to your alliance.

419
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,490
I know you all still have doubts about me.

420
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,660
I'll prove my worth

421
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,070
through my actions.

422
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,620
Then isn't Mr. Tang in grave danger?

423
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,140
Master Shao...

424
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,210
Miss Xifang has been very honest.

425
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,400
Master Puzhu, perhaps we should
let her finish.

426
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,820
As for attacking the Plum Garden,

427
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,860
I can only say this:

428
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,140
his every scheme is

429
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,820
meticulously planned,

430
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,790
and every judgment,

431
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,440
utterly rational.

432
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,350
A man like that,

433
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,050
if he's still staying put,

434
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,580
it means

435
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,620
he's certain

436
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,180
he can fend off any invaders.

437
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,680
You think I'd be afraid of him?

438
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,740
This time, I agree.

439
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,690
We must go rescue him.

440
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,260
I don't believe it.

441
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,480
Surely with me,

442
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,350
plus Puzhu,

443
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,530
Shen Langhun, and Chi Yun,

444
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,600
we can do it.

445
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,250
I don't wish to embarrass you,

446
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,820
but I must truthfully tell you this—

447
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,130
you can't.

448
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,140
At least not now,

449
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,070
while all of you are still injured.

450
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,890
Even with Sword Master Shao
and me added in,

451
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,580
it's still impossible.

452
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:06,620
I can give you

453
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,340
the location of the Plum Garden,

454
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,080
but that would only be

455
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,940
sending all of you to your deaths.

456
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,730
What kind of monster is he?

457
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,590
That powerful?

458
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,290
However, everyone can rest assured.

459
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,890
If Ghostly Peony truly wanted to
kill Mr. Tang,

460
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,630
he would have done so long ago.

461
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,090
Then what exactly is his purpose?

462
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,780
Though he's not dead,

463
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,940
he's not exactly alive either.

464
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,140
What do you mean?

465
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,970
Resurrection

466
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,820
requires a body.

467
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,800
Without one,

468
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,140
he cannot truly be resurrected.

469
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,900
He doesn't want to kill Mr. Tang.

470
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,620
He wants to use Mr. Tang's body...

471
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,010
to resurrect Yique Yinyang.

472
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
Where am I?

473
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,620
Are you looking for this?

474
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,870
As expected,

475
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,370
my inner strength has been sealed too.

476
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:15,820
Come out.

477
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,800
Mr. Tang, you refuse to eat...

478
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,760

00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,230
impressive indeed.

ordinary schemes couldn't fool you,

495
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,450

00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,409
break with old words.

571
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,370
Your name will be Tang Lici from now on.

572
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,600
You can't die.

573
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:55,199
Exchange your power with me
using the Rebirth Scroll...

574
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,130
And transfer the evil energy in you

575
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,860
to me.

576
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,100
My body is different.

577
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,050
I can heal myself!

578
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,220
This is the only way.

579
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,340
Mr. Tang.

580
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,180
Good evening.

581
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,390
Leader.

582
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,170
Did you

583
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,960
enjoy performing in the play?

584
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,380
Rather than whether I enjoyed it,

585
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,310
I'd like to know—

586
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,880
how was my acting?

587
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,530
So poor.

588
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,700
They all said I acted very well.

589
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,230
Because they are not human.

590
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,030
And neither are you.

591
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,790
You're just like them—

592
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,970
a puppet.

593
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,220
Yique Yinyang's puppet.

594
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,760
You've found me out.

595
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,010
Let me

596
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,570
take a guess—

597
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,050
the battle on Tiandu Peak

598
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,050
that I experienced

599
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,050
in Inverted Dream

600
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,830
was not the original battle at all.

601
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,700
In the true

602
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,900
original battle,

603
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,940
Yique Yinyang won.

604
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,000
All Seven Masters were killed,

605
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,420
including

606
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,410
Fang Zhou.

607
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,260
Even so,

608
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,090
Yique Yinyang failed

609
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,570
to accomplish

610
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,270
what he truly desired.

611
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,050
Mr. Tang,

612
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,530
why do you think that?

613
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,340
Yique Yinyang, like myself,

614
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,780
is a clever man.

615
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:01,900
And clever men

616
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,220
don't go to great lengths

617
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,550
for useless endeavors.

618
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,490
From what I

619
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,420
witnessed in that Inverted Dream,

620
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,550
with Yique Yinyang's full might,

621
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,090
the Seven Masters

622
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,270
stood no chance of winning.

623
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,450
He had you trick Fang Pingzhai

624
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,010
into creating the Inverted Dream

625
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,380
with Qiaoyi Qiankun.

626
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,670
The real purpose

627
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,940
was to let me

628
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,260
stop his past self

629
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,030
from killing Fang Zhou.

630
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,380
If what he truly wanted to do

631
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,240
had succeeded,

632
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,150
why would he bother

633
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,340
reversing time?

634
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,270
Therefore, that matter

635
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,080
must be very important to him—

636
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,490
so important that he was willing to

637
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,150
abandon his own physical body

638
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,220
to make it happen.

639
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,300
Mr. Tang...

640
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,850
you are really smart.

641
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,300
Then let me continue my guess—

642
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,860
what could Yique Yinyang

643
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,760
truly want to accomplish?

644
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,840
With power rivaling that of the gods,

645
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,300
what could

646
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,030
possibly lie beyond his reach?

647
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,090
He thinks of nothing but killing

648
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,220
and has no weakness.

649
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,340
Why hasn't he achieved

650
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,000
the perfect Tianren body yet?

651
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,490
He must complete his cultivation
as soon as possible

652
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,340
to accomplish our great plan.

653
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,740
Is there a possibility that...

654
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,790
Bai Nanzhu's so-called great plan

655
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,490
and what Yique Yinyang wants to do

656
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,780
are the same thing?

657
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,300
And this matter

658
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,180
requires the Bronze Pillar

659
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,170
and a perfect

660
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,610
Tianren body.

661
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,420
But his path to cultivating a Tianren body

662
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,080
was wrong from the beginning.

663
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,420
When he first arrived in Shenzhou,

664
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,170
his experience in the Gumo State

665
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,220
tainted his body

666
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,450
with malice,

667
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,270
making it impossible
to achieve perfection.

668
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,260
Therefore,

669
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,510
he began scheming against me.

670
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,610
This way,

671
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,260
everything makes sense.

672
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,090
So...

673
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,340
he couldn't let Fang Zhou

674
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,140
die in the battle on Tiandu Peak.

675
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,080
Because...

676
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,290
he needed Fang Zhou, who had a heart
full of great love,

677
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,450
to find me,

678
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,670
bring me back to Zhoudi Tower,

679
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,700
and teach me with devotion.

680
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,570
Then he needed Fang Zhou to die
because of me

681
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,030
so that Fang Zhou's death...

682
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,920
would become an insurmountable nightmare

683
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,440
in my heart,

684
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:36,530
thus

685
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,900
making me stop him from

686
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,790
killing Fang Zhou in the Inverted Dream.

687
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,570
And his ultimate purpose

688
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,610
in all of this...

689
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,940
is to make me

690
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:52,780
walk a path

691
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,650
entirely different from his—

692
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,260
one that fully experiences
the seven emotions

693
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,660
and reaches perfection.

694
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,190
The cause of the past...

695
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,970
is the effect of the present.

696
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,490
And the effect of the present

697
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,680
is also the cause of the past.

698
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,970
What a truly perfect closed loop.

699
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,530
Just now...

700
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,940
I said you were bad at acting

701
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,770
because

702
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,910
in the play at Zhoudi Tower,

703
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,390
there is birth,

704
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:37,850
sickness,

705
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:39,770
and death.

706
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,690
And all of it

707
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,490
causes suffering.

708
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,400
Hatred brings suffering.

709
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,530
Parting from what you love
brings suffering.

710
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,300
Not obtaining what you desire
brings suffering.

711
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,760
But if one has no emotions,

712
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,390
there is no suffering.

713
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,830
And if one doesn't feel suffering,

714
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,590
then naturally...

715
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,910
naturally it cannot be acted out.

716
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,820
Mr. Tang, teach me then.

717
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,340
It seems

718
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,860
you don't have human feelings,

719
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,390
but you already have human curiosity.

720
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,530
Curiosity killed the cat,

721
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,060
and it kills puppets too...

722
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,110
How about...

723
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,260
you and I play

724
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,450
a game?

725
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,010
A game?

726
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,710
Mr. Tang, do you take me

727
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,780
for a child?

728
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,140
When I first came to Shenzhou,

729
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,010
I didn't understand human feelings.

730
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:48,670
So Fang Zhou

731
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,720
taught me
using the Three Character Classic

732
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,950
that children read.

733
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,090
In other words,

734
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,260
I don't know what emotions are,

735
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,890
so you want to teach me through games.

736
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,340
That makes sense.

737
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,340
What game?

738
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,990
Yique Yinyang

739
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,090
set countless traps

740
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,300
for me.

741
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,380
Don't you want to know

742
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,780
how I feel?

743
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,340
You can ask me questions

744
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,220
and pick one

745
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,530
of these masks

746
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:22,740
that you think suits my mood.

747
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,610
Interesting.

748
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,860
Let me ask you, Mr. Tang—

749
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,090
when you learned that everything
you experienced in Shenzhou

750
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,420
was carefully orchestrated by my master,

751
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,130
what did you feel?

752
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,970
I guess...

753
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,010
you felt angry.

754
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,450
Wrong.

755
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,940
I felt joy.

756
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:45,940
Joy?

757
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:46,970
Because

758
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,000
I need to thank Yique Yinyang.

759
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:50,700
If he hadn't

760
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,570
orchestrated everything so meticulously,

761
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,500
how could I have ever met Fang Zhou?

762
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,290
And how could I have lived

763
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,130
those seven beautiful years

764
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,700
in Zhoudi Tower?

765
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,610
Then, how did you feel when you learned

766
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,450
that I deliberately made
Liu Yan return early,

767
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,010
causing you to fail in saving Fang Zhou,

768
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,090
merely to make you into

769
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,650
a suitable vessel

770
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,970
so he could be resurrected
and return to this world?

771
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:09,740
This time,

772
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,190
it must be anger, right?

773
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,000
Leader,

774
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,140
you're wrong again.

775
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:17,940
Yique Yinyang isn't

776
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,340
the only one who wanted me

777
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,140
to become a perfect vessel.

778
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,360
Back in the Tianren Realm,

779
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,080
I'd already gone through it once before.

780
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,260
Now that I've experienced it again,

781
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,010
I only find it laughable.

782
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,500
What about Shei?

783
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,840
Surely, she must've made you angry.
