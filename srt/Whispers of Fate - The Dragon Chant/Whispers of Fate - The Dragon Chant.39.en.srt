[Episode 39]

3
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,840
Former Sword Master
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

4
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,039
Shao Yanping,

5
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,509
dedicated his life

6
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,060
to peace and justice
in the martial arts world.

7
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,340
He was highly respected,

8
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,039
[Wanhua Hall]

9
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,370
a role model for us all.

10
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,550
[In Memory of My Master and Friend,
Shao Yanping]

11
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,590
[In Memory of My Best friend, Chi Yun]

12
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,530
Xue Xianzi,

13
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,000
you know

14
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,360
Snowblown Return cannot hold me.

15
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,940
Little Fox,

16
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,570
we've known each other for years.

17
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,010
I know what you're planning to do.

18
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,910
Master Shao wouldn't want you to go.

19
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,460
Palace Chief,

20
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,920
a letter from the court.

21
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,220
Master Shao was killed by Ghostly Peony.

22
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,560
Tang Lici once claimed

23
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,079
that Ghostly Peony was dead.

24
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,160
But now Ghostly Peony has reappeared,

25
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,560
and Tang Lici is missing.

26
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
It's hard not to suspect

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,710
they are connected.

28
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,910
Moreover, wherever this person goes,

29
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,240
the chaos of the Blood Ghost Pills

30
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,300
not only continues

31
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,560
but grows more turbulent

32
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,020
and spreads even further.

33
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,910
Palace Chief Wanyu
is ordered to investigate thoroughly.

34
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,710
If necessary,

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,960
eliminate traitors

36
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,540
and assist the Princess
in commanding the Sword Alliance.

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,210
Palace Chief, how will you choose?

38
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,950
He's the most formidable opponent.

39
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,560
And I...

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,210
only stand with the victor.

41
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,510
Let's go to
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

42
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,510
to pay respects to

43
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,470
Master Shao.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,280
The court now

45
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,120
already believes

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,280
Xifang Tao's words.

47
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,240
She even spread Shao Yanping's obituary

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,440
throughout jianghu,

49
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,730
claiming that Liu Yan
would be executed at the funeral.

50
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,470
Good people don't live long.

51
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,790
[Wanted]

52
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,190
Just like Head Fang back then,

53
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,750
he died

54
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,400
unexpectedly.

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,910
I heard

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,079
it was Liu Yan.

57
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,470
He used the antidote as bait

58
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,680
to lure Master Shao out,

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,280
and that's how he succeeded.

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,750
But this demon's luck

61
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,880
has finally run out.

62
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,660
Don't worry.

63
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,240
Once Miss Xifang catches him,

64
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,780
she'll definitely avenge Master Shao.

65
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,450
She knows you'll try to save Liu Yan.

66
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,050
I never intended to stop you.

67
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,010
I only hope you can calm down
and think about it.

68
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,420
She's using this as bait

69
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,780
to force you to go there.

70
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,000
If you go,

71
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,090
you'll walk right into her trap.

72
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,780
If I don't go,

73
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,240
Liu Yan

74
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,840
will die too.

75
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,700
Your mind is in such turmoil?

76
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,760
Seems you already know.

77
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,630
Yes.

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,270
Then do you know

79
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,270
why Tang Lici is protecting Liu Yan?

80
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,630
Shao Yanping actually wasn't killed

81
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,230
by Liu Yan.

82
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,530
On the contrary,

83
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,310
he even helped Tang Lici

84
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,380
protect Liu Yan.

85
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,040
It was because he was helping them develop

86
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,170
the antidote for the Blood Ghost Pill.

87
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,750
You're wondering why I'm telling you this.

88
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,720
It's because I'm curious about

89
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,870
how you'll choose.

90
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,970
I'm leaving.

91
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,450
I need to help my friend.

92
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,950
Then let me remind you—

93
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,560
You can leave,

94
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,240
but once you go,

95
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,290
you will never get

96
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,950
this last pearl

97
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,950
and Huiniang's body.

98
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,310
So you're the divine doctor

99
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,070
Master Shao refused to reveal,

100
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,120
aren't you?

101
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,950
I know

102
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,490
Master Shao's death

103
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,680
has nothing to do with you.

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,070
I should have guessed it was you.

105
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,370
Your reputation
as the Physician of Miracle

106
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,680
is well-deserved.

107
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,750
The herbs you added

108
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,300
to the prescription

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,170
neutralized the poison's fierceness
for me.

110
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,000
Come and sit.

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,930
I'll perform acupuncture for you.

112
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,000
I know what you're thinking.

113
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,159
But even if you die,

114
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,480
Tang Lici will still return for

115
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,960
Master Shao's funeral.

116
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,950
Xifang Tao's trap

117
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,830
won't fail just because you die.

118
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,620
So am I supposed to obediently

119
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,160
act as Xifang Tao's bait

120
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,310
and watch Tang Lici

121
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,190
be trapped by her

122
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,680
because of me?

123
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,630
Do you really think
with Mr. Tang's abilities,

124
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,390
there's anything

125
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,360
he doesn't know?

126
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,160
It's just a matter

127
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,720
of whether he wants you to know

128
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,480
or not.

129
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,300
Bait only works

130
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,310
if the prey

131
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,040
doesn't see

132
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,680
the hunter's intention.

133
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,180
If you're smarter than him,

134
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,270
you should come quickly
and let me remove the poison from you.

135
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,360
Don't die

136
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,430
before the antidote

137
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,550
is developed.

138
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,720
Yu Furen, City Lord of Sword King City,
has arrived!

139
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,610
Your Highness.

140
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,070
Except for national mourning,

141
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,750
a princess
should not wear mourning clothes.

142
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,160
Today I am not a princess.

143
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,280
You don't need to protect me.

144
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,020
If Father knows, I will bear

145
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,890
the punishment alone.

146
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,090
I apologize for my disrespect.

147
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,600
Wanyu Yuedan,
Palace Chief of Biluo Palace, has arrived.

148
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,970
Cheng Yunpao, Vice Island Master
of Camellia Island, has arrived.

149
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,200
Puzhu, Pavilion Master
of Tianjing Pavilion, has arrived.

150
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,360
Master Puzhu,

151
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,220
please chant sutras
to guide Master Shao's spirit.

152
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,520
I thought I wouldn't see you.

153
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,750
A person is fearless

154
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,670
when doing what should be done.

155
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,950
Ms. Zhong,

156
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,170
my condolences.

157
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
Tang Lici is extremely clever.

158
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm afraid he won't come.

159
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,600
On such an important day,

160
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,200
how could Mr. Tang,
as the head of the Sword Alliance,

161
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,000
not come?

162
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,550
No matter how important
Tang Lici's business is,

163
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,410
he should come.

164
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,870
This is Master Shao's funeral, after all.

165
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,200
To not come is unreasonable

166
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,260
and inappropriate.

167
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,600
Why didn't he come today?

168
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,390
Exactly.

169
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,600
Master Shao treated him well.

170
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,970
-How could he do this?
-Indeed.

171
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
It's outrageous.

172
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,510
Everyone, please calm down.

173
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
Master Tang is overwhelmed with duties

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,060
and cannot attend.

175
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,060
I apologize

176
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,550
on his behalf.

177
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,120
Everyone,

178
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,960
we are gathered here today

179
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,430
to mourn the leader of the Sword Alliance.

180
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,280
Master Shao was attacked by Ghostly Peony

181
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,800
on his way out

182
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,220
and unfortunately passed away.

183
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,720
It is a great loss
to the martial arts world

184
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,050
and a sorrow to jianghu.

185
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,020
We should carry on Master Shao's will,

186
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,800
eliminate Fengliu Shop,

187
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,060
and kill Ghostly Peony

188
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,630
to avenge Master Shao.

189
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,440
Kill Ghostly Peony

190
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,150
to avenge Master Shao!

191
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,550
Kill Ghostly Peony

192
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,080
to avenge Master Shao!

193
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,200
Kill Ghostly Peony

194
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,020
to avenge Master Shao!

195
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,910
Kill Ghostly Peony

196
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,240
to avenge Master Shao!

197
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,270
With your personality,

198
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,480
if you really had a clear conscience,

199
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,440
you wouldn't feel guilty

200
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,840
or tormented over this.

201
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,370
Making a mistake in a moment
isn't a problem.

202
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,820
But you have to admit it.

203
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,450
Ms. Zhong,

204
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,520
I'll give you one chance.

205
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,180
Use this sword

206
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,740
to kill him,

207
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,940
and I'll let you live.

208
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,240
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,550
I failed to teach you properly.

210
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,720
Master,

211
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,280
it's my own incompetence.

212
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,030
I've failed you.

213
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,940
Time's up.

214
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,010
Seal the coffin.

215
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,010
Wait.

216
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,700
Your Highness.

217
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,300
By protocol,

218
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,600
the coffin should be sealed

219
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,800
by the new leader of the Sword Alliance,

220
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,480
Mr. Tang.

221
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,380
Are we going to let my master

222
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,760
miss the proper time for burial

223
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,560
just for waiting for one person?

224
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,030
He's not coming.

225
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,170
Seal the coffin.

226
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,870
Mr. Tang,

227
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,870

Mr. Tang, you came eventually.

249
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,870
Master Tang,

250
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,600
you're awfully late.

251
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,020
Mr. Tang, you should be able to see

252
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,440
that Master Shao

253
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,410
was first struck in the chest,

254
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,950
then stabbed in the back,

255
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,430
and finally had
his sword-wielding right arm cut off.

256
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,670
Back then,

257
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,330
why did you choose me?

258
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Mr. Tang.

259
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,860
The Central Plains Sword Alliance

260
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,000
will soon welcome a prodigy

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,200
of both wisdom and courage.

262
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,590
Mr. Tang,

263
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,760
how's my preparation

264
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,640
this time?

265
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,630
Your preparation

266
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,890
indeed exceeded my expectations.

267
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,190
Not only was Master Shao

268
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,280
cautious against his enemies,

269
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,690
but he also had the determination
to fight to the death.

270
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,730
The move that truly killed him

271
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,840
was the Rebirth Scroll.

272
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,780
All three Sword Masters
can testify to this.

273
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,670
The wounds from the Rebirth Scroll
are very distinctive

274
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,130
and easily recognizable.

275
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,560
Sword Master.

276
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,550
Now, Liu Yan is incapacitated

277
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,880
and cannot use the Rebirth Scroll.

278
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,570
Therefore,

279
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,260
this wound

280
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,230
must have been caused

281
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,720
either by the resurrected Yique Yinyang

282
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,240
or by...

283
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,660
Mr. Tang.

284
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,150
How is that possible?

285
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,790
Wasn't Yique Yinyang's

286
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,100
resurrection plan

287
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,650
already thwarted long ago?

288
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:49,930
Don't forget,

289
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,140
that's only Tang Lici's

290
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,220
one-sided account.

291
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,000
He also claimed that Ghostly Peony

292
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,460
was already dead.

293
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,190
Master Tang,

294
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,810
won't you explain about the wound

295
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,670
left by the Rebirth Scroll?

296
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,790
It seems

297
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,430
those who choose me

298
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,980
never have much luck.

299
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,150
But...

300
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,470
don't worry.

301
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
I'll make sure the one who killed you

302
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,250
pays a hundredfold.

303
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,230
All Saints Path—

304
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,600
lotus, bloom.

305
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,700
If you hadn't

306
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,319
used the Heaven-Changing Scripture
to block this strike,

307
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,050
you would have died on the spot.

308
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,030
Now,

309
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,540
Miss Xifang, it's your turn

310
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,640
to explain why you know the move

311
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,160
that killed Master Shao.

312
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,180
The Heaven-Changing Scripture
is almost identical

313
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,140
to the Rebirth Scroll?

314
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:42,830
Miss Xifang,

315
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,890
why didn't you mention this earlier?

316
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,500
Could Master Shao's death

317
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,530
be connected to you?

318
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,860
When I was forced
to work for Fengliu Shop,

319
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,220
to gain Ghostly Peony's trust,

320
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,960
I had no choice

321
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,060
but to learn
his Heaven-Changing Scripture.

322
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,480
However,

323
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,750
on the day Master Shao was killed,

324
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,510
I was with the disciples

325
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,230
of Investigation Hall the entire time,

326
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,290
capturing Liu Yan.

327
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,270
That's correct.

328
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,240
Miss Xifang was indeed

329
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,400
with me that day,

330
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,720
discussing how to use

331
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,060
the clues provided by Master Shao

332
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,900
to capture Liu Yan.

333
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,760
We didn't reveal this to everyone

334
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,010
for fear the real killer

335
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,790
might take advantage.

336
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:23,840
Miss,

337
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,070
choose your words carefully.

338
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,600
Everyone, you may not know,

339
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,640
but the claim that Ghostly Peony

340
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,700
killed Master Shao

341
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,260
was just a decoy.

342
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,990
If I had directly said

343
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,830
that Tang Lici was the one

344
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,160
who killed Master Shao,

345
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,700
would he have dared to show up here?

346
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,310
Ghostly Peony

347
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,910
is a puppet of Yique Yinyang.

348
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,090
And Tang Lici is Yique Yinyang.

349
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,220
So it's no wonder
that the Heaven-Changing Scripture

350
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,950
resembles the Rebirth Scroll.

351
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,920
That still doesn't prove

352
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,830
that Master Shao

353
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,690
was killed by the Rebirth Scroll.

354
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,400
Indeed.

355
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,240
Then we must ask

356
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,080
why Mr. Tang,
who knows the Rebirth Scroll,

357
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
frequently left the Sword Alliance

358
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,770
during the election period

359
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,400
to meet with Liu Yan, the head

360
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,330
of Fengliu Shop,

361
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,000
until Master Shao caught them.

362
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,790
Master Shao sensed

363
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,990
he might be silenced,

364
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,670
so he told me

365
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,690
where Liu Yan was.

366
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,720
Someone's breaking in!

367
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
It's Tang Lici!

368
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,130
It's Tang Lici!

369
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,210
Tang Lici is here
to break into the prison!

370
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,440
Notify all checkpoints

371
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,720
to stop Tang Lici!

372
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:27,970
Yan,

373
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,420
I'm here to rescue you.

374
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,200
Yan.

375
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,640
Yan!

376
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,400
You knew it was a trap,

377
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,480
yet you still came to save me?

378
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,400
Enough talk.

379
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,640
Get up!

380
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,370
Let's go.

381
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,040
The Peach of Three Hues!

382
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,400
Tang Lici,

383
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,350
you actually killed

384
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,160
so many Sword Alliance disciples!

385
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,020
Did I kill them,

386
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,250
or was it your arrangement?

387
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,270
Stop using lies to deceive everyone.

388
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,200
Liu Yan is the owner of Fengliu Shop.

389
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,720
By breaking him out in public,

390
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,390
you prove

391
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,960
you're the mastermind

392
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,690
behind the Evil Pill disaster,

393
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,650
the true master of Ghostly Peony.

394
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,310
A good deduction.

395
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,620
He actually admitted it?

396
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,000
Xifang Tao,

397
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,520
you long for freedom,

398
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,070
yet don't even know

399
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,590
what freedom truly is.

400
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,850
You're more like a puppet
than Ghostly Peony.

401
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,720
Do you know

402
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,910
the Heaven-Changing Scripture,
like the Rebirth Scroll,

403
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,680
can absorb another person's power

404
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,920
for one's own use?

405
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,100
He didn't tell you, did he?

406
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,760
How pitiful.

407
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,030
Today,

408
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,950
I, Tang Lici,
will definitely take Liu Yan away.

409
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,970
Those who make way shall live.

410
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,710
Those who block me shall die.

411
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,560
Everyone.

412
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,340
Kill Tang Lici and Liu Yan

413
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,160
to avenge Master Shao!

414
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,190
You're being used
and don't even realize it—

415
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,320
what a disgrace to the Sword Alliance.

416
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,640
This strike

417
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,850
is a lesson I deliver
on Master Shao's behalf.

418
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,400
Even you want to stop me?

419
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,990
This whole matter is highly suspicious.

420
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:45,920
Put down Liu Yan.

421
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,070
We'll vouch for you.

422
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,830
Puzhu,

423
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,640
if anyone alive

424
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,160
can make

425
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,220
the antidote to the Blood Ghost Pill,

426
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,000
it's Liu Yan.

427
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,790
You can choose

428
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,030
to trust me now—

429
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,650
stand with me,

430
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,270
and point your weapon

431
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,020
at Xifang Tao.

432
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,760
Master Puzhu,

433
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,800
Tang Lici has already confessed

434
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,530
that he's the mastermind
behind Fengliu Shop.

435
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,150
Will you choose friendship

436
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,680
over justice?

437
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,720
Mr. Tang,

438
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,620
I am willing to trust you.

439
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,110
But right now, you're still

440
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,170
a Sword Master
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

441
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,500
If you take Liu Yan away,

442
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,350
you'll be condemned by thousands.

443
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,440
Then

444
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,970
let them condemn me.

445
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,270
His internal injuries are flaring up.

446
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,030
Now is the best opportunity.

447
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,280
Everyone, follow me

448
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,830
to kill Tang Lici!

449
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,120
Mr. Tang, be careful!

450
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:02,580
Lici!

451
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,690
I deserve to die!

452
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,180
It's not worth

453
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,990
losing your life to save me!

454
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,480
Whether it's worth it or not

455
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,540
is for me to decide!

456
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,790
Tang Lici,

457
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,200
I'm late.

458
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,320
You're here,

459
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,860
so you're not late.

460
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,400
Miss Hong

461
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,130
has been taken somewhere safe.

462
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,000
Don't worry.

463
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,310
Xifang Tao spread Shao Yanping's obituary

464
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,510
throughout jianghu,

465
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,700
claiming that Liu Yan

466
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,970
would be executed at the funeral.

467
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,300
She's using this as bait

468
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,660
to force you to go there.

469
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,160
Xifang Tao set this trap

470
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,680
just to lure me in.

471
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,680
Liu Yan must have hidden

472
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,610
the antidote formula on Miss Hong.

473
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,960
When I go pay respects to Master Shao,

474
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,000
you can use the chaos

475
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,810
to rescue Miss Hong,

476
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,810
get the antidote,

477
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,830
end the calamity of the Evil Pill,

478
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,170
and restore peace to jianghu.

479
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:15,720
Master.

480
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,030
You...

481
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,070
Go now.

482
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,010
Let's go together.

483
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,920
Don't worry, Master.

484
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,350
I...

485
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,510
will be okay

486
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,940
in the Sword Alliance.

487
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,650
Let's go.

488
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,640
Xue Xianzi,

489
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,270
are you sure you want to go against

490
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,930
your fellow martial artists?

491
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,110
I...

492
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,910
haven't decided yet,

493
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,020
but somehow I feel like laughing.

494
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,410
You doubt
neither the Heaven-Changing Scripture

495
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,040
nor the identity

496
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,710
of the West Palace Chief,

497
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,560
and you're not even wary

498
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,810
of Ghostly Peony's disciple.

499
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,530
You righteous people

500
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,800
actually follow someone like that.

501
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,310
If that brat, Shao Yanping,

502
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,440
were still alive,

503
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,990
seeing the Sword Alliance like this,

504
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,780
he would be terribly disappointed.

505
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,400
Sword Masters,

506
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,630
my master has urgently summoned me back
to Camellia Island.

507
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,300
From now on,

508
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,730
I'm afraid I can no longer
stand with the Sword Alliance.

509
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,570
I'm leaving.

510
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,150
Everyone,

511
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,110
farewell.

512
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,440
Take care.

513
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,560
You just brought me out like this?

514
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,190
Where can we possibly go?

515
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:49,820
I don't know.

516
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,310
I never thought about it.

517
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,160
You're such a fool.

518
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,980
I don't care.

519
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,320
Lici,

520
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,660
I can't go on.

521
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,160
Leave me behind.

522
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,660
If you don't leave now,

523
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,290
you won't escape either.

524
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,000
Liu Yan, master of Fengliu Shop,

525
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,590
I just checked your condition.

526
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,090
You're not seriously hurt.

527
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,520
Stop pretending.

528
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,140
You figured that out?

529
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,350
I'm not from Fengliu Shop.

530
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,990
I'm from Zhoudi Tower.

531
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,220
Now that you mention it,

532
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,540
I miss Fu.

533
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,140
What do you think he's doing now?

534
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,290
Fu has never liked fighting.

535
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,840
He only enjoys cooking.

536
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,270
Perhaps

537
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,720
he's in some restaurant now

538
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,270
working as a chef.

539
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,490
The restaurant he's working in

540
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,210
must be doing great business.

541
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,070
Yeah.

542
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,800
That's exactly what he would do.

543
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,730
Do you think

544
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,270
he'd be angry

545
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,010
if he knew I cut out my heart crystal

546
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,070
to save Senior?

547
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,400
Or maybe

548
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,550
he'd be even angrier at you,

549
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,690
and never make

550
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,260
sour fish soup for you again.

551
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,730
That would be terrible.

552
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,450
I love his noodles the most.

553
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,790
It's been so many years.

554
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,650
I really want to taste them again.

555
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,830
He must hate me

556
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,430
for becoming such a villain.

557
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,400
Yan.

558
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,130
It's all in the past.

559
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,370
Fu has always been soft-hearted.

560
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,880
Even if he's angry,

561
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,510
it's only because

562
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,420
we kept fighting

563
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:00,520
and he wanted to teach us
a lesson on behalf of Senior.

564
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,310
If he sees

565
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,380
that we've made up,

566
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,680
he won't stay mad.

567
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,700
Don't you think so?

568

757
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,740
I didn't expect

758
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,350
I'd run out of the cinnabar
before I got to you.

759
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,240
I'm sorry.

760
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,230
This is all I can do now.

761
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,570
[In Memory of My Old friend, Liu Yan]

762
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,760
Don't blame me.

763
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:52,680
♪ Water polishes the old ruts ♪

764
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,880
I'm sorry.

765
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,870
I was too arrogant.

766
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:55,880
I'm sorry.

767
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,940
I'm the one who caused your deaths.

768
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:04,820
♪ Trapped in the loop of loneliness ♪

769
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,960
I'm useless.

770
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:16,200
♪ Trapped in the loop of loneliness ♪

771
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,960
Yique Yinyang,

772
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:34,330
are you...

773
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:39,980
♪ Destiny entwining my fleeting life,
I can't fight ♪

774
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,700
watching me?

775
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,150
It was Tianren Realm

776
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,630
that abandoned Shenzhou first,

777
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,350
yet now they want Shenzhou

778
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,810
to pay for their folly

779
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,440
and arrogance!

780
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,440
Why?

781
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:52,680
♪ Trapped in the loop of loneliness ♪

782
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,570
By what right?

783
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,110
By what right?

784
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:02,220
♪ Trapped in the loop of loneliness ♪

785
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:07,890
Tang Lici,

786
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,480
why did you come to Shenzhou
in the first place?

787
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,920
If it weren't for you,

788
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,790
everything would be different.

789
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,710
Now,

790
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,560
what else can you do?

791
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,720
You can't do anything.

792
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,670
Why?

793
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,240
The mural in my memory...

794
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,290
is different from the one here now.

795
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,550
Did the mural change on its own,

796
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,480
or...

797
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,360
The Inverted Dream

798
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,550
is a magical artifact
created by Qiaoyi Qiankun,

799
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,190
capable of traveling to the past

800
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,150
and reversing time.

801
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,480
The Inverted Dream

802
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,900
created by Qiaoyi Qiankun

803
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,560
also came from Tianren Realm.

804
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,440
To activate the Inverted Dream,

805
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,070
one must rely on

806
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,600
the power of Tianren Realm.

807
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,590
But the bone-washing silver bracelet

808
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,120
holds only limited energy.

809
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:40,670
Stop!

810
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,700
So...

811
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,270
it only altered part of history.

812
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,220
But after everything I've been through,

813
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,750
I've become a true Tianren.

814
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,670
If I could use more power

815
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,730
from Tianren Realm

816
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,150
to create

817
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,550
a larger Inverted Dream,

818
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,930
then perhaps...

819
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,270
there's still a chance

820
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,560
to turn things around—

821
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,540
and maybe all of you

822
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,870
could come back.
