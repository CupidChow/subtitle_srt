[Whispers of Fate]

2
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,950
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,570
Sir, you're sweating.

4
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,450
Is it because you're exhausted,

5
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,810
or because...

6
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:42,720
you're nervous?

7
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,610
You're pressing on my legs.

8
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,440
You broke your leg?

9
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,170
Why didn't you push me away?

10
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,639
You're injured.

11
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,010
I was afraid of hurting you again.

12
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,290
You don't have to force yourself.

13
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,090
Are we going to starve to death here?

14
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,520
Or...

15
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,980
Master Puzhu, do you think

16
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,150
dying together with me,
the West Palace Chief

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,120
of Fengliu Shop,

18
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,600
would stain your reputation?

19
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,750
I won't die.

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
And neither will you.

21
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,570
I'll go find something to eat.

22
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,280
Master Puzhu,

23
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,170
do you eat meat?

24
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,820
Master Puzhu hasn't returned yet.

25
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,160
The Sword Alliance has lost a major force.

26
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,030
Not just that.

27
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,910
Aside from this map,

28
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,560
which might not even be real,

29
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,710
we know nothing

30
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,610
about this Xiuyu Peony Pavilion.

31
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,360
And they know nothing

32
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
about us either.

33
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,400
They also want to know

34
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,360
how many weapons,

35
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
how many supplies,

36
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,840
and

37
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,760
how many experts we have.

38
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,310
Tomorrow,

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,280
send disciples good at lightness skill

40
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,030
to scout

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,530
and pretend to be alone.

42
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,060
Then have Master Shangguan

43
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,590
lead a team to lie in ambush from behind,

44
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,310
draw out the people of Fengliu Shop,

45
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,840
and capture them for questioning.

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,640
Leave it to me.

47
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,710
Master Pu,

48
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,680
how's the antidote

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,430
I asked you to prepare?

50
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,160
Don't worry.

51
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,190
If I can't make it, I'll never call myself

52
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,520
the Poison Saint again.

53
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,890
Master Shao,

54
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,190
Sword Masters...

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,600
Mr. Tang.

56
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,670
Our ship from Sword King City has arrived.

57
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,840
Everyone,

58
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,920
in this operation against Fengliu Shop,

59
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,630
everyone

60
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,600
must follow the plan.

61
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,510
No unauthorized actions.

62
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,870
No going in alone.

63
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes!

64
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,310
Mr. Yu,

65
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,300
do you have any questions?

66
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,390
No.

67
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,930
Mr. Tang, bad news.

68
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,050
Something's wrong.

69
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,310
Senior Zhong,

70
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,830
can we really do this?

71
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,870
Mr. Tang said

72
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,430
we must not leave the group
without authorization.

73
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,560
But Master also said

74
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,280
someone needs to scout ahead

75
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,040
to verify whether the map is real.

76
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,830
If we can find

77
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,030
useful information,

78
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,310
it will help the Sword Alliance.

79
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,040
Back at Shanfeng Branch,

80
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,390
it was always you leading us.

81
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,250
After you left,

82
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,680
no one ever gave us
important assignments again.

83
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,140
We were almost reduced to doing chores.

84
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,000
When I return to Shanfeng Branch,

85
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,190
I won't let

86
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,250
this happen again.

87
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,040
Let me tell you.

88
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,240
Last time I led a team,

89
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,510
-Hide!
-and caught several of them.

90
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,000
Really?

91
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,659
That's impressive.

92
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,270
We got several boxes of treasures.

93
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,920
I'll take you along next time.

94
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,680
Great.

95
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,610
No problem.

96
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,310
Let's go!

97
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,040
Follow them!

98
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,570
Let's go!

99
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,070
Hurry!

100
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,800
Strange.

101
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,470
They're not moving fast.

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,330
Why can't we catch up with them?

103
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,640
Something's wrong.

104
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,050
Everyone, retreat!

105
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,650
Since you're here already,

106
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,020
why retreat?

107
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,070
It's him?

108
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,780
Everyone, run!

109
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,200
Split up and run in different directions!

110
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,310
Blood Begonias,

111
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,200
bloom.

112
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,420
There's no escape.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,190
He's toying with us.

114
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,510
This has nothing to do with them.

115
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,710
You didn't kill them,

116
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,560
which proves your target is me!

117
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,240
Let them go!

118
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,880
Dr. Liu!

119
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,750
Master,

120
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,040
this is Dr. Liu.

121
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,500
I'm in a good mood today.

122
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,159
If you come over yourself,

123
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,310
I'll let them go.

124
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,480
You, the mighty head of Fengliu Shop,

125
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,890
actually don't keep your word?

126
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,010
Unlike Tang Lici,

127
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,430
I always keep my word.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,070
Seven days after the flowers wither,

129
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,020
the poison will wear off,

130
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,820
and they'll wake up on their own.

131
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:25,820
However,

132
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,190
you...

133
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,870
know me?

134
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,799
Let me formally introduce myself.

135
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,700
My name is Liu Yan.

136
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,360
Senior Zhong!

137
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,360
Senior Zhong!

138
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,460
Senior Zhong!

139
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,390
Zhong!

140
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,360
-Heroine!
-Senior Zhong!

141
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,200
Zhong!

142
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,360
-Ms. Zhong!
-Senior Zhong!

143
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,480
-Search carefully!
-Zhong!

144
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,960
Gu.

145
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,510
Earlier,

146
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,240
a strange thick fog appeared here.

147
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,650
The wild geese wouldn't come near.

148
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,690
One of my disciples

149
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,240
saw from a distance,
riding on a wild goose,

150
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,200
that Ms. Zhong

151
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,470
was coming this way with people.

152
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,080
Gu!

153
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,670
Yu!

154
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,750
Yu.

155
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,920
Master Jiang.

156
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,550
Yu, you're finally here.

157
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,150
We still

158
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,350
haven't found Zhong.

159
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,080
I'm afraid something happened to her.

160
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,950
Don't worry yet.

161
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,270
We'll definitely find her.

162
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's split up and search.

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,530
Alright.

164
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,200
Let's go!

165
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,630
Everyone, spread out

166
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,360
and search carefully!

167
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,720
-Look carefully!
-Zhong!

168
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,520
Senior Zhong!

169
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,200
Follow me this way!

170
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,360
-Senior Zhong! Senior Zhong!
-Zhong!

171
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,630
Senior Zhong!

172
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,120
Senior Zhong!

173
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,150
Senior Zhong!

174
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,550
Senior Zhong!

175
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,630
Senior Zhong!

176
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,030
Zhong!

177
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,790
Zhong!

178
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,840
Zhong!

179
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:47,910
Not her.

180
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,080
Zhong!

181
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,390
Zhong!

182
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,070
There are drag marks here.

183
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,120
-It looks like Fengliu Shop
-Zhong!

184
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,180
dragged them here.

185
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,480
Zhong!

186
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,120
Gu!

187
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,670
Gu!

188
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,440
Zhong!

189
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,150
Zhong's not here!

190
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,050
Don't panic.

191
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,550
Master Jiang.

192
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,810
Look at this.

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,860
Don't touch it.

194
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,770
It should be a curse bug.

195
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,810
Take it back

196
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,170
and have Mr. Tang identify it.

197
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,690
It's Liu Yan!

198
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,260
Liu Yan is skilled at using curse bugs!

199
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,810
So,

200
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:26,920
Ms. Zhong

201
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,920
might have been taken by Liu Yan?

202
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,000
Mr. Tang,

203
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,590
what should we do now?

204
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,190
[Man on earth, good at birth.]

205
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,030
First, call back the search team.

206
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,320
Then how are we supposed
to rescue Ms. Zhong?

207
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,030
Liu Yan only took Ms. Zhong

208
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,200
as a hostage.

209
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,670
He won't kill her now.

210
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,720
Liu Yan uses curse bugs
with deadly precision.

211
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,120
Disciples affected by the Blood Begonias

212
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,270
need 7 days to wake;

213
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,600
if forced awake,

214
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,960
they'll die.

215
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,310
This is a challenge from Liu Yan.

216
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,390
What does it mean?

217
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,800
A life for a life.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,390
Seven days is the deadline.

219
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,720
If we can't rescue Ms. Zhong
within 7 days,

220
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,440
the disciples will survive,

221
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,600
and she will die.

222
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,760
That's right.

223
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,740
Seven days—

224
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,670
that's the challenge I set for them.

225
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,480
I don't understand.

226
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,000
Master, why did you

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,930
give them 7 days?

228
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,900
If we attack first,

229
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,010
the initiative is in their hands.

230
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,830
But by setting a challenge

231
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,860
with a deadline,

232
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,720
people get anxious,

233
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,790
afraid,

234
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,720
and they stall.

235
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,780
For life-and-death matters,

236
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,960
people will wait
until the last moment to decide,

237
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,960
and the initiative will swing back to us.

238
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,790
Seven days

239
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,490
is enough to create cracks among them.

240
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,510
I see.

241
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,360
Whether they decide in the end

242
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,670
to save her or not,

243
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,910
the unity Tang Lici wants

244
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,780
will be broken.

245
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,330
The Sword Alliance's biggest problem

246
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,990
is its internal instability,

247
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,030
with no binding interests
and only empty talk of justice.

248
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,960
We'll start

249
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,360
with their disagreements,

250
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,220
pry them apart,

251
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,450
and let the alliance

252
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,820
collapse from within.

253
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:28,870
Master,

254
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,720
I'm back.

255
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,600
Chunji, you're back.

256
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,760
You did a great job on this recon

257
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,360
of Xiuyu Peony Pavilion.

258
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,030
You made a great contribution
to the Sword Alliance.

259
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,390
Even Mr. Tang says

260
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,200
that without Ms. Zhong,

261
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,150
we'd have had no chance
of winning this battle.

262
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,620
This is simply my duty.

263
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,550
Those 6 Sword Masters,

264
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,790
hearing you faced Liu Yan's brutal torture

265
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,080
with unflinching courage

266
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,000
and defended the Sword Alliance's honor,

267
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,670
were utterly

268
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,840
impressed.

269
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
They all begged me

270
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,390
to immediately restore you

271
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,190
as the Chief of Shanfeng Branch.

272
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,280
Looks like this time,

273
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,150
you finally made it through.

274
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,160
It's been 3 days.

275
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,400
How long can you hold out?

276
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,440
Just...

277
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,480
kill me.

278
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,220
This time,

279
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,510
are you serious?

280
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,040
I don't want to kill you.

281
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,420
I deliberately set a trap to catch you.

282
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,120
If I let you die easily,

283
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,660
what would be the point?

284
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,830
Think about it—

285
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,630
the top heroine among the righteous sects,

286
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,430
Zhong Chunji,

287
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,230
the beloved disciple of Shao Yanping
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

288
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,080
out of selfishness and recklessness,

289
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,920
drags everyone to their deaths

290
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,340
and ends up
the target of the world's scorn.

291
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,270
What a splendid drama.

292
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,270
No.

293
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,300
You won't succeed.

294
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
My master

295
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,010
will surely see through your plot.

296
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,800
He won't...

297
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,440
What?

298
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,670
He won't come to save you?

299
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,510
Wouldn't that be even sadder?

300
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,480
Ms. Zhong,

301
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,330
you truly are
Master Shao's beloved disciple.

302
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,730
You know him well.

303
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,670
The Central Plains Sword Alliance
will surely attack

304
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,930
Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

305
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,730
but a well-prepared attack

306
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,510
is completely different

307
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,870
from a rash one

308
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,700
launched just to save you.

309
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,970
Shao Yanping is a smart man.

310
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,800
Sacrificing your life

311
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,120
to save the Sword Alliance
from major losses

312
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,520
is too good a deal for him.

313
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,910
Anyway,

314
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,800
it's simply because
you're not worth enough.

315
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,320
Tang Lici is involved
in the Zhoudi Tower case,

316
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,390
yet Shao Yanping

317
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,200
showed him mercy

318
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,490
and even honored him as the Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance.

319
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,550
But what about you?

320
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,510
The great heroine Zhong Chunji,

321
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,000
Chief of Shanfeng Branch—

322
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,440
all of these titles

323
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,470
are his reward to you.

324
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,480
None of them

325
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,720
truly belongs to you.

326
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,200
That's why you fight so hard

327
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,000
to defend him,

328
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,150
because you know, without him,

329
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,600
you are nothing.

330
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,750
You...

331
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,730
are too weak.

332
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,200
If you think I'm so worthless,

333
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,920
then why waste your breath?

334
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,030
Kill me already!

335
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,600
I'm standing up for you.

336
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,100
After all you've done
for the Sword Alliance,

337
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,360
they still won't make a single sacrifice

338
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,600
for you.

339
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,830
Who am I, Zhong Chunji,

340
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,270
to make a monster like you

341
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,030
pity me, Master?

342
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,320
In your heart,

343
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,600
there's also a monster.

344
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,280
Otherwise, how would you

345
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,480
have acted on your own

346
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,570
and fallen right into my trap?

347
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,270
I have one as well.

348
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,440
But I've already

349
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,670
let mine out without shame.

350
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,870
While you, Ms. Zhong,

351
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,050
are still putting on a facade.

352
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,270
Ms. Zhong,

353
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,950
you are just an ordinary person.

354
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,510
Why do you hold yourself

355
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,040
to the standards of a saint?

356
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,080
Cry when you want to cry.

357
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,720
Laugh when you want to laugh.

358
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,520
When you're afraid,

359
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,630
allow yourself to be afraid.

360
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,100
And when you want something,

361
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
reach out and take it.

362
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,600
No rush.

363
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,120
There are still 4 days.

364
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,630
Ms. Zhong, if you want to die,

365
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,770
waiting for 4 more days
won't make a difference,

366
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,240
right?

367
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,570
If you survive these 4 days,

368
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll give you a great gift,

369
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,160
a gift that allows you to cast aside

370
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,030
your identity as Shao Yanping's disciple

371
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,920
and still

372
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,960
command respect.

373
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,670
You can take a gamble.

Throw them.

From now on,

419
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,030
when you're feeling down

420
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,920
and want to throw something,

421
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,580
throw these iron chopsticks.

422
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,370
Master Shao,

423
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,340
it's time to go to Wanhua Hall.

424
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,890
Third Brother,

425
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,590
of course we have to fight,

426
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,550
but if we fight now,

427
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,720
we'll fall right into his trap.

428
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,880
Since we're going to fight anyway,

429
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,510
isn't it the same
whether we fight now or later?

430
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,270
If you ask me,

431
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,020
it's all that girl's fault

432
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,490
for acting on her own.

433
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,110
At a time like this,

434
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,110
you're still blaming Ms. Zhong?

435
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,510
Everyone, please calm down.

436
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,770
Let's talk patiently.

437
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,590
Besides,

438
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,680
isn't Ms. Zhong's life

439
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,400
a life?

440
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,330
We still have 4 days.

441
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,410
There's still time to vote.

442
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,050
Right?

443
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,510
We've been arguing for 3 days.

444
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,780
Have we reached an agreement?

445
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,420
Master Shao,

446
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,070
Mr. Tang,

447
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:04,820
you're here.

448
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,410
It's been 3 days.

449
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,110
Three days of waiting—

450
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,180
I understand how you feel.

451
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,360
Chunji was captured,

452
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,960
Master Puzhu is missing,

453
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,550
and the map of the Xiuyu Peony Pavilion—

454
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,110
all show that Fengliu Shop

455
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,310
has already set a trap

456
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,370
and is just waiting for us to fall in.

457
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,640
Zhong Chunji

458
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,720
is my beloved disciple.

459
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,700
But every life

460
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,590
in the Central Plains Sword Alliance

461
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,790
is equally precious.

462
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,830
I...

463
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,830
cannot put everyone at risk

464
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,090
in this circumstance.

465
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,220
Therefore,

466
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,830
I have decided

467
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,930
to postpone our attack
on the Peony Pavilion.

468
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,350
What?

469
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,170
Master Shao,

470
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,850
while we're thinking

471
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,880
how we won't fall into

472
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,110
Liu Yan's trap,

473
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,360
actually,

474
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,920
we are already in it.

475
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,720
Liu Yan

476
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,480
wants to put us in a dilemma;

477
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,030
he wants us...

478
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,930
Isn't that enough?

479
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,160
-To argue endlessly...
-At a time like this,

480
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,960
you are still blaming Ms. Zhong?

481
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,680
And...

482
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,730
tear ourselves apart.

483
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,640
I consider myself the best in the world.

484
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,270
The harder something looks

485
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,400
to have it both ways,

486
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,670
the more determined I am to achieve it.

487
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,950
I will not only attack
Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

488
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,510
but also rescue Ms. Zhong.

489
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,400
Tang Lici,

490
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,030
now is not the time

491
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,360
for you to play the hero.

492
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,160
Don't act impulsively,

493
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,750
Mr. Tang.

494
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,240
I'm not playing the hero

495
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,640
nor acting impulsively.

496
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,800
Master Shao,

497
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,400
since we've decided
to attack Fengliu Shop,

498
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,160
if we allow delays

499
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,590
simply because

500
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,370
the plan is disrupted,

501
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,830
the longer we stall,

502
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,590
the deeper the unrest and suspicion

503
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,590
within the Sword Alliance

504
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,480
will grow.

505
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,310
They seized one chance

506
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,160
against us,

507
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,160
so they'll certainly seize

508
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,000
a second.

509
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,260
This is my first point.

510
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,880
Second,

511
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,650
Ms. Zhong is Master Shao's disciple.

512
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,140
Master Shao worries that if he

513
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,000
lets everyone risk themselves
to rescue her,

514
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,440
he'll put other disciples in danger.

515
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,840
But what if we look at it
from another angle?

516
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,070
Ms. Zhong is also a disciple
of the Sword Alliance

517
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,600
and a major force within it.

518
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,680
If Master Shao won't even rescue

519
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,510
his own disciple,

520
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,240
what kind of a heartless leader

521
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,400
will he appear to be

522
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,270
in the eyes

523
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,800
of the other disciples
in the Sword Alliance?

524
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,200
Third,

525
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,400
even if Liu Yan
has set an inescapable trap,

526
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,160
whether the Sword Alliance takes action
or not,

527
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,760
my friends

528
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,110
and I

529
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,090
will go to Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

530
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,550
to rescue Ms. Zhong—

531
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,550
because

532
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,590
she's one of us.

533
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,830
We are willing to go with you!

534
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,590
Mr. Tang,

535
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,160
thank you.

536
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,920
I can't do it anymore.

537
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,590
That woman is really tough.

538
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,360
I'll work myself to death

539
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,920
before I kill her.

540
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,280
Thank you for your help,
East Palace Chief.

541
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,790
Congratulations, Ms. Zhong.

542
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,930
Master sent me to bring you a gift.

543
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,520
Thank you.

544
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,780
How many days have we been trapped here?

545
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,480
Today is the 6th day.

546
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,070
It's been six days already,

547
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,530
and no one has found us yet.

548
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,890
Let me help you.

549
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,630
Sir, don't be so formal.

550
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,680
Is it good?

551
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,070
That's the last fruit

552
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,550
I could pick.

553
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,000
I can't use my inner strength,

554
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,260
and your leg's broken.

555
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,100
I want to support you
so we can go look for food together.

556
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,750
Please.

557
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,680
These fruits

558
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,030
aren't enough for us.

559
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,550
Besides,

560
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,940
I've grown sick
of eating them these past few days.

561
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,530
Catch a couple of fish.

562
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
We can grill them.

563
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,090
I won't eat them.

564
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,140
Miss Tao, please go ahead.

565
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,110
You...

566
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,060
Fish are lives.

567
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,960
So am I.

568
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,270
If I starve to death

569
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,880
because you don't want to kill them,

570
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,940
wouldn't that mean

571
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,750
I die because of you?

572
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,710
Happy now?

573
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,630
Sir, you're really amusing.

574
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,110
Much more amusing than

575
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,040
when we were chess partners.

576
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,510
Amusing?

577
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,240
You know once I recover,

578
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,570
you'll be the one to die.

579
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,200
You're truly...

580
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,920
amusingly stupid.

581
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,640
You never actually wanted

582
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,240
to kill me.

583
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,180
Instead,
you've been forcing me to kill you.

584
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,920
Why?

585
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,350
Do you know what I like, Sir?

586
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,440
I like watching people fall.

587
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,990
All it takes is a moment's hesitation,

588
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,160
a fleeting thought.

589
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,480
They could've said no,

590
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,500
but they couldn't resist temptation.

591
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,170
And just like that,

592
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,550
they walk to

593
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,110
the cliff's edge,

594
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,090
lose their footing,

595
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,370
and fall into an endless abyss,

596
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,240
never to climb back up,

597
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,590
never to see the sky again.

598
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,030
Don't you think

599
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,480
that's amusing?

600
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,440
Captivating.

601
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,890
Miss Tao, you find this amusing?

602
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,830
Sir, do you think

603
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,490
I deserve to die even more now?

604
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,030
I don't think that

605
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,110
once someone takes a wrong path,

606
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,670
they can't turn back.

607
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,720
Sir, are you saying

608
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,790
I should turn back

609
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,510
before it's too late?

610
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,770
Everyone has desires,

611
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,250
just as the Evil Pill
awakens people's cravings.

612
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,510
It's never too late

613
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,600
to find your way back.

614
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,170
Just turn back,

615
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,230
and you'll see the shore.

616
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:14,950
Everyone,

617
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,870
this attack on Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

618
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,620
will be extremely difficult.

619
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,000
Everyone must hold their positions

620
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,060
and follow orders.

621
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,510
We'll infiltrate

622
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,310
through the northern waterway,

623
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,670
relying primarily
on Master Jiang's Falcon Unit

624
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,130
for overall observation and early warning.

625
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:31,880
Master Shao,

626
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,860
Deputy Lord Yu,

627
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,420
you'll lead the Leopard Unit
as the vanguard,

628
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,310
breaching enemy lines
and clearing obstacles.

629
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,560
Master Cheng, Mr. Gu,

630
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,800
you'll lead the Black Tortoise Unit

631
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,860
forward steadily.

632
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,040
Stay alert.

633
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,910
The six Sword Masters will guard the rear

634
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,110
to prevent ambushes.

635
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,640
All units, keep pace.

636
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,260
If you're blocked, call for support.

637
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:03,560
Lici,

638
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,280
you're always trying to prove

639
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,540
you can do everything,

640
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,120
right?

641
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,540
There's thick fog?

642
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,350
Why is there miasma all of a sudden?

643
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,560
Send the signal.

644
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,520
There's miasma spreading from the north.

645
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,780
All ships, stay close.

646
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,690
Beware of ambushes.

647
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,800
Message from the Falcon Unit.

648
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,060
There's poisonous miasma approaching.

649
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,520
Pass down the order.

650
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,670
All disciples, take your antidote.

651
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,000
Yes.

652
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,130
Did Foxy Tang lie to me?

653
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,040
Is this mission

654
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,370
really that important?

655
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,040
Why do I always feel like

656
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,830
he's doing

657
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,890
something more important than this?

658
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,750
The mission is complete.

659
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440
Where's my stuff?

660
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,960
As long as you give it to me,

661
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,160
reversing fate

662
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,450
or turning back time won't be a problem.

663
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,520
Qiaoyi Qiankun?

664
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,300
How about this?

665
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,030
I'll give you another mission.

666
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,040
Okay.

667
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Why is he here?

668
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,630
And why is he running errands for a kid?

669
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,720
Everyone, be careful.

670
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,580
We've entered the Burial Forest.

671
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,210
What kind of flower is this?

672
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,190
It's Bone-Soaking Lotus,

673
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,650
grown in poisonous water.

674
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,050
Deputy Lord Yu,

675
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,440
tell everyone in the fleet to stay alert

676
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,300
and avoid falling into the water.

677
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,720
What's that?

678
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,930
The lotuses contain Man-eating Curse Bugs.

679
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,980
Stay alert!

680
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,449
Twin Sabers front the precious shrine;

681
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,110
Dragon gleam makes galaxies decline!

682
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,790
The poisonous miasma has cleared.

683
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,840
Form up and scout!

684
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,330
Send the signal!

685
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
Fucui,

686
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,790
Meihua Yishu,

687
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,040
and Kuanglan Wuxing
are stationed in the east.

688
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,320
Three rows, five columns?

689
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,960
Fucui?

690
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,440
There are two human puppets to the east
of the Burial Forest.

691
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,920
Send word to the fleet behind us—

692
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,400
we'll advance on two fronts.

693
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,100
Leopard Unit and I will continue forward.

694
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,840
The six Sword Masters
will land with the Black Tortoise Unit

695
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,000
from the east

696
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,430
to engage Fucui's forces

697
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,360
and hold his troops.

698
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,400
The waterway ahead is blocked.

699
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,010
I'll handle it.

700
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,180
Is that Xiuyu Peony Pavilion?

701
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,790
Thanks to Mr. Tang.

702
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,920
We finally found it.

703
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,520
Yes, thanks to him.

704
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,420
Indeed.

705
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,040
I didn't expect

706
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
we'd find it so smoothly.

707
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,710
Yes.

708
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,000
If Fengliu Shop and the Sword Alliance

709
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,400
don't weaken each other,

710
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,820
how can he, Yique Yinyang,

711
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,480
profit from the chaos?

712
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,140
Deputy Lord Yu,

713
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,080
we are now deep in enemy territory.

714
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,890
Stay focused.

715
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,670
Master,

716
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,560
Tang Lici and the others

717
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,690
have passed the gate

718
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,200
and are about to land.

719
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,070
This is...

720
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,190
a trap waiting for you.

721
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,040
Liu Yan has left Bishang Pavilion?

722
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,230
Nineshot Arbalest?

723
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,110
Dodge!

724
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,200
Master, we can't get close!

725
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,320
Spread out!

726
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,190
Keep the geese low!

727
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,440
Yes!

728
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,920
Circle around the city!

729
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,300
Follow my command!

730
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,840
Signalers, come with me!

731
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,960
Master Jiang and his people encountered

732
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,360
the Nineshot Arbalests.

733
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,730
Liu Yan has left Bishang Pavilion.

734
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,190
He's heading to the Six Sword Masters.

735
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,920
Master Shao,

736
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,910
lead the disciples to intercept Liu Yan.

737
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,870
I will act alone.

738
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,240
Yes!

739
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,700
Why does he want to act alone?

740
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,410
Everyone, stay close later.

741
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,480
Stay fully alert.

742
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,600
I'm going alone.

743
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,010
What do you mean by that?

744
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,960
Why are you going alone?

745
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,340
To save her, of course.

746
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,590
I'm afraid you won't come back.

747
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,260
Deputy Lord Yu,

748
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,220
this path is full of traps.

749
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,250
If you're not afraid of your men

750
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:52,880
dying,

751
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,440
feel free to follow me.

752
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,930
Disciples of Sword King City!

753
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:01,880
Go quickly

754
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,340
to reinforce Master Shao!

755
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:04,880
Yes!

756
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,540
Be careful!

757
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,960
Tai'e Sword!

758
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,760
The wind sweeps over the grass!

759
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,130
Sound Killing Technique?

760
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,830
Lotuses and duckweeds in full bloom;

761
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,420
through shrieks and howls,
moss veils the gloom.

762
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,180
I am Qingchan.

763
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,860
I am Xiaohong.

764
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,320
We're here to welcome the guest

765
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,750
for the Master.

766
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,230
Miss,

767
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,040
I'm afraid you're not qualified

768
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,000
to stop me.

769
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,370
Kill.

770
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,330
Not a step back?

771
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,320
Master Shao, you really are capable.

772
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,120
But if the Tai'e Sword is sealed,

773
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,780
will you still be so relaxed?

774
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,270
You really think you can seal
the Tai'e Sword

775
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,730
with your amateur skills?

776
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,360
You think by sealing the Tai'e Sword

777
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,270
you can win?

778
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,520
You really underestimated the Masters

779
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,920
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance!
