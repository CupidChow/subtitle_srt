[Whispers of Fate]

2
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,920
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,640
What do you think of Wanyu Yuedan

4
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,039
as a person?

5
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,770
A master.

6
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,840
He is not a master

7
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,870
but a ruler.

8
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,220
A ruler?

9
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,960
A ruler of the jianghu

10
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,509
bows to no one

11
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,479
and yields to no threat.

12
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,830
When weak,
he retreats to the ends of the earth.

13
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,420
When strong,
he dominates the world.

14
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,080
Biluo Palace

15
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,760
was destroyed
during the reign of Wanyu Moru.

16
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,000
But it was reborn

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,130
under Wanyu Yuedan.

18
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,360
So you're saying

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,759
both the Central Plains Sword Alliance
and the Fengliu Shop

20
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,389
want to recruit Biluo Palace

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,140
just because Wanyu Yuedan

22
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,400
is formidable?

23
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,860
Not entirely.

24
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,960
Chi Yun.

25
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,870
On your journey from Sword King City

26
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,800
to Biluo Palace,

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,470
have you estimated

28
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,960
how many people work

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,560
at the Fengliu Shop in total?

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,930
Not many, I suppose.

31
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,650
30 or 40?

32
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,470
If Fengliu Shop only had that many people,

33
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,820
how could they
stand against the Sword Alliance?

34
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,079
Fengliu Shop doesn't hire voluntarily—

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,660
they use threats.

36
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
Those assassins from the Fengliu Shop

37
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,450
that you saw on your way,

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
in fact,

39
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,940
are all controlled
by the Blood Ghost Pill.

40
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,150
Based on the ledgers

41
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,880
we examined in Sword King City,

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,280
these people

43
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,430
likely number in the thousands.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
That's right.

45
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,150
When Fengliu Shop

46
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,120
deliberately reveals its strength,

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,750
they will spring up

48
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,590
like mushrooms.

49
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,430
By then, it will be too late

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,750
for the Sword Alliance to prepare.

51
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,750
So this is about preparing in advance?

52
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,870
Those old-fashioned people
at the Sword Alliance

53
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,070
would be that clever?

54
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,240
It seems

55
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,240
that I must pay a visit

56
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,370
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

57
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,240
You...

58
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,750
I'm not going as a criminal.

59
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,910
Then in what capacity?

60
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,710
This

61
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,329
depends on

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,680
how my discussion with Palace Chief Wanyu

63
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,870
turns out.

64
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,630
Why do you keep following me?

65
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
Shen, you've been

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,290
watching me closely since earlier.

67
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,670
If you have something to say,

68
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,550
just say it.

69
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,400
Why did you send Shei away

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,810
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance?

71
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,770
Because her blood is too unusual.

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,850
She doesn't know martial arts.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,280
Having her with us

74
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,210
would only increase the risk.

75
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,360
You're afraid.

76
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,180
What do I have to fear?

77
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:21,750
You once said

78
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,150
you're not a kind person.

79
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,480
Why didn't you keep Shei by your side

80
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,940
to continue treating you?

81
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,360
Instead, you worried about her safety.

82
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,460
Because it wasn't necessary.

83
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,120
Your methods are cunning
and your actions bold.

84
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,570
You've gambled
with the people of Sword King City

85
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,720
and with those
from the Central Plains Sword Alliance

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,850
who hunted you down.

87
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,909
You say you never cared about them,

88
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,360
but you also never let them

89
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,560
suffer any real harm.

90
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,480
So what?

91
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,460
What does that prove?

92
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,420
Those people survived

93
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,250
because their deaths were not necessary.

94
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,040
They happened to survive,

95
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,050
which makes

96
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,430
me look capable.

97
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,140
You don't want Shei to get hurt

98
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,340
or your friends and old acquaintances
to suffer.

99
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,260
Tang Lici,

100
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,650
would you really kill Liu Yan?

101
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,950
You're very perceptive.

102
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,960
You're worried I won't be able to do it.

103
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,650
But I want to ask you, Shen,

104
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,830
would Liu Yan show me any mercy?

105
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,900
Can I

106
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,740
avoid killing him?

107
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,909
Besides...

108
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,740
This is our agreement.

109
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,080
What I truly think

110
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,880
doesn't matter,

111
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,480
does it?

112
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,830
I really don't understand

113
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,430
what Foxy Tang is plotting.

114
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,870
Shei, stop laughing.

115
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,830
Tell me

116
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,190
all the complicated details behind.

117
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,270
You understand him better than any of us.

118
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,270
Mr. Tang

119
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,610
isn't returning to the Sword Alliance
as a criminal.

120
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,050
Perhaps it's because

121
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,600
someone has offered him

122
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,200
a ladder to instant success.

123
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,420
Who is it?

124
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,310
Master Shao

125
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,880
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

126
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,510
During my trip back to
the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

127
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,830
I met Master Shao.

128
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,610
[Tingyun Pavilion]

129
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,560
I discovered that Master Shao

130
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,620
harbors no hostility toward Mr. Tang

131
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,040
and might even admire him.

132
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,920
-Clean up Tingyun Pavilion.
-Yes.

133
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,360
The Sword Alliance issued

134
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,010
the arrest warrant for Mr. Tang

135
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,810
possibly due to circumstances.

136
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,510
And he sent

137
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,240
Master Cheng,

138
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,510
who isn't skilled at reading people,

139
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,310
to negotiate.

140
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,310
This was likely intentional.

141
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,680
If Mr. Tang helps
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

142
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,560
secure Biluo Palace

143
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,680
as a powerful ally,

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,680
naturally, he won't need to

145
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,000
return as a criminal.

146
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,950
He might return

147
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,180
as a guest.

148
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,020
Crane,

149
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,950
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

150
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,990
will welcome an honored guest.

151
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,680
Courtesy. Courtesy.

152
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,000
And if Mr. Tang

153
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,800
can have both the Sword Alliance
and Biluo Palace,

154
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,190
2 powerful weapons

155
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,320
to deal with Liu Yan,

156
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,000
and also be freed
from troublesome pursuit,

157
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,400
why wouldn't he take this opportunity?

158
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,460
Most importantly,

159
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,640
if Biluo Palace

160
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,920
intends to cooperate with
the Sword Alliance,

161
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,110
Liu Yan will certainly appear.

162
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,310
Shei.

163
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,670
Has no one told you

164
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,210
that you're becoming more like Foxy Tang?

165
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,100
You can even guess such thoughts.

166
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,220
Taixiao Hall is restricted.

167
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,880
No entry without permission.

168
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,000
I request to see Palace Chief Wanyu.

169
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,950
No one sees Palace Chief
without a summons.

170
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,300
Stand down.

171
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,600
Steward Bi.

172
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,460
Palace Chief
is at the Divine Inquiry Platform.

173
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,920
Divine Inquiry Platform?

174
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,990
There are no guards there.

175
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,430
But how you get up there

176
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,620
depends on your own abilities.

177
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,830
It seems

178
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,580
that this will be the easiest part

179
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,700
of my journey.

180
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,550
Stars in the vast cosmos,
the mystery of mysteries.

181
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,320
All living beings, filling the heart.

182
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,120
Now,

183
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,180
the sky is dark and unclear.

184
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,710
The path is long and divergent.

185
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,260
May the spirits bless

186
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,050
and stay close to me.

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,790
Why would the bone-washing silver bracelet

188
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,250
resonate with the Divine Inquiry Platform?

189
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,070
Could it be

190
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,360
that this place has some connection

191
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,560
to the Tianren Realm?

192
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,480
Only the Palace Chief of Biluo Palace

193
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,740
can ascend the Divine Inquiry Platform.

194
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,410
Don't you know that, Mr. Tang?

195
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,510
If you didn't want to see me,

196
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,360
you wouldn't have had Steward Bi

197
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,760
tell me about this place.

198
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,580
You're waiting for me.

199
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,720
Shouldn't I be waiting for you?

200
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,370
The one who won the Starry Night
at Zixiao Courtyard

201
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,370
is you, Mr. Tang.

202
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
So this is the Nine Stars Dragon Formation

203
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,750
of Biluo Palace?

204
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Truly marvelous.

205
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,510
Mr. Tang, don't you have anything

206
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,600
to explain?

207
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,730
What would you like me to explain,
Palace Chief?

208
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,270
Since the Divine Inquiry Platform
was built,

209
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,120
it has only resonated

210
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,920
with one other person like this.

211
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,290
I'm afraid I must disappoint you.

212
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,540
I know very little

213
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,560
about Biluo Palace's past.

214
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,770
Biluo Palace was founded by the Luo River,

215
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,860
focusing on astrology and feng shui,

216
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,580
entrusted by the previous dynasty

217
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,200
to guard the dragon veins
as Imperial Preceptor.

218
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,000
My father

219
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,690
devoted his life to understanding

220
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,080
the principles of heaven and earth.

221
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,600
Until he met that person.

222
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,820
That person called himself Ye Mo.

223
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,720
He gave my father

224
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,380
everything he wanted to know.

225
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,270
My father saw

226
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,480
the boundaries of heaven and earth.

227
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,960
Only then did he realize
his life's learning

228
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,620
was merely a drop in the ocean.

229
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,300
There's always something
greater beyond what you know.

230
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,670
If one learns the Dao in the morning,

231
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,000
one can die without regret in the evening.

232
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,390
No one can resist

233
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,390
such temptation.

234
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,080
My father revered Ye Mo as a prophet

235
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,010
and introduced him to the emperor.

236
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,790
Ye Mo used various superhuman powers

237
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,520
to cure the emperor's illness.

238
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,600
He brought rain to drought-stricken lands.

239
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,460
The emperor respected and trusted him,

240
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,240
and appointed him
as the new Imperial Preceptor,

241
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,960
giving him supreme power.

242
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,060
As for what happened next,

243
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,240
you can't say

244
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,590
you don't know, can you?

245
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,790
Yique Yinyang brought chaos to the world.

246
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,720
He falsely accused Biluo Palace
of treason.

247
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,050
The entire Biluo Palace

248
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,700
was forced into exile.

249
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,450
According to my father,

250
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,750
if Ye Mo hadn't failed,

251
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,440
he would have come

252
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,030
to this Divine Inquiry Stone

253
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,000
to use his power

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,970
to complete an even greater conspiracy.

255
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,010
Mr. Tang,

256
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,120
you've come today.

257
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,080
Yes,

258
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,720
I have.

259
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,350
What's your relationship
with Yique Yinyang?

260
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,270
In the past,

261
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,660
I would have said
there was no relationship.

262
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,410
But today,

263
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,200
I believe I have

264
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,060
connections with Yique Yinyang.

265
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,740
But I am definitely not Yique Yinyang.

266
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Then what about
the origin of this silver bracelet?

267
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,870
Perhaps,

268
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,050
it came from my homeland.

269
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,050
I don't have complete memories.

270
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,080
For as long as I can recall,

271
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,280
it's been right there on my hand.

272
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,030
May I ask, Mr. Tang,

273
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,710
where is your homeland?

274
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,700
I have no memory of that place.

275
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,670
In what year?

276
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,580
The year when the 7 masters

277
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,630
of Tiandu Peak

278
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,540
surrounded and tried
to kill Yique Yinyang.

279
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,950
You seem even more suspicious now.

280
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,600
Many people are concerned about

281
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,660
my relationship with Yique Yinyang.

282
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,050
But I believe

283
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,330
what you care about

284
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,700
might be something else.

285
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,840
The ancestors of Biluo Palace

286
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,040
once made a prophecy:

287
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,290
Visitors from beyond Shenzhou

288
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,290
will bring catastrophic disaster.

289
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,850
And this prophecy

290
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,870
ultimately fell

291
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,000
upon Yique Yinyang.

292
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,960
As for what beyond Shenzhou

293
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,750
in this prophecy means,

294
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,410
after years of investigation,

295
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,010
Biluo Palace has developed
some conjectures.

296
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,250
Holy Child,

297
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,830
all the trials you face today

298
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,550
are to achieve

299
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,740
immortal greatness in the future.

300
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,540
I've never heard of this.

301
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,620
Do you believe in fate, Mr. Tang?

302
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,700
I've always respected the lives of others.

303
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,240
What if fate

304
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,150
destines you to take Yique Yinyang's place

305
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,390
and once again bring

306
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,850
catastrophe to Shenzhou?

307
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,730
Then I would have no choice

308
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,100
but to defy fate

309
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,240
and shatter

310
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,570
all the stars in the sky.

311
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,360
It seems you

312
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,840
don't submit to fate either.

313
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,840
If you had submitted,

314
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,360
you would have already accepted

315
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,960
Fengliu Shop's conditions.

316
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,800
You wouldn't have waited for me.

317
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,000
Palace Chief Wanyu,

318
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,430
you're an ambitious person.

319
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,160
Perhaps,

320
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,990
besides ambition,
you have plans for domination.

321
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,850
Since I saw the empty coffin,

322
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,080
I knew

323
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,910
you intended to return to the Central Plains.

324
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,240
This is not surprising.

325
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,600
The Central Plains Sword Alliance

326
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,750
and the Fengliu Shop

327
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,030
both know this.

328
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,390
Otherwise,

329
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,000
they wouldn't try

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,130
to form an alliance with Biluo Palace.

331
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,160
However,

332
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,440
I know something else.

333
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,970
You want not only to return

334
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,010
but also to clear your name.

335
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,850
You want to return with dignity,

336
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,180
regain control of rituals and divination,

337
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,440
and resume the duties of your ancestors.

338
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,200
Because only in this way

339
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,160
can it truly be

340
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,030
a return to your roots.

341
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,880
Palace Chief Wanyu,

342
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,210
you refuse to let Biluo Palace
bear this infamy.

343
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,510
You know the path to clear the name

344
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,670
is fraught with difficulties,

345
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,070
but you still want to try.

346
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,820
Because only by taking this path

347
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,460
can you properly answer to

348
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,910
the former Palace Chief,

349
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,080
those disciples of Biluo Palace
who survived the calamity,

350
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,030
and Biluo Palace

351
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,130
for decades and centuries to come.

352
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,440
The Central Plains Sword Alliance
tempts you with justice;

353
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,440
the Fengliu Shop
promises you the martial arts world.

354
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,750
But none of them are what you truly want.

355
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,250
So you waited for me.

356
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,060
Because you wanted to see

357
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,600
what kind of terms

358
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,670
I could offer you.

359
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,380
If that's the case,

360
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,630
I can tell you

361
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,150
that I can give you

362
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,320
what you desire.

363
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,360
Can you give

364
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,440
what they can't to me?

365
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,400
Palace Chief,

366
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,360
if you're willing to join me

367
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,170
in assisting
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

368
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,900
to eliminate the Fengliu Shop,

369
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,530
I'll promise you

370
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,750
I will definitely help Biluo Palace

371
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,060
reclaim the position of Imperial Preceptor

372
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,550
and restore its former glory.

373
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,480
Why should I believe you?

374
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,630
Because you are like me,

375
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,180
unwilling to accept fate.

376
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,840
Then what about the coffin

377
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,650
and an explanation

378
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,850
you owe Biluo Palace?

379
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,670
One day,

380
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,910
I will return the Immortal Crystal Coffin,

381
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,770
and afterward,

382
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,710
I will submit to whatever you decide.

383
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,040
Whatever I decide?

384
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Of course.

385
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,240
You've made a dangerous promise.

386
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,440
I

387
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
await your response, Palace Chief.

388
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,550
Biluo Palace has chosen

389
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,369
to ally with
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

390
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,829
to fight against
the Fengliu Shop together.

391
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,370
Great.

392
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,130
Foxy Tang is still reliable.

393
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,400
How do you plan to deal with

394
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,300
the people from the Fengliu Shop?

395
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,920
In a conflict between two sides,
envoys are not to be harmed.

396
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,860
Palace Chief has decided
to let them leave.

397
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,860
What kind of envoys are they anyway?

398
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,680
They clearly came here

399
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,540
to hunt us down.

400
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,700
Foxy Tang,

401
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,880
you just fight your way out

402
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,960
and kill those so-called

403
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,070
East and West Palace Chiefs

404
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,000
to make the Fengliu Shop
suffer a heavy blow.

405
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,110
Since Palace Chief invited them

406
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,440
as guests to the palace,

407
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,830
Biluo Palace

408
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,720
has the responsibility

409
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,250
for ensuring their safety.

410
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,270
If Palace Chief cooperated

411
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,530
with the Fengliu Shop,

412
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,350
he would also
ensure the safety of you all.

413
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,830
So,

414
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,200
we're just letting them go like this?

415
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,920
Chi Yun.

416
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,520
Calm down.

417
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,930
Let's follow Palace Chief Wanyu's orders.

418
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,780
Besides,

419
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,880
Liu Yan hasn't appeared yet.

420
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,470
Liu Yan?

421
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,790
Right.

422
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,750
Liu Yan.

423
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,320
The master of the Fengliu Shop,

424
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,510
Liu Yan.

425
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,270
You think

426
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,590
the Fengliu Shop will strike first?

427
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,830
Biluo Palace is Gui Fusheng's masterpiece.

428
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,590
It has the celestial mountain defense
outside

429
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,830
and the Nine Stars Dragon Formation

430
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,210
Palace Chief deployed inside.

431
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,070
It's easy to defend and hard to attack.

432
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,800
You can rest assured, Mr. Tang.

433
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,740
Palace Chief.

434
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,330
What did Mr. Tang mean

435
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,190
by his words just now?

436
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,270
Perhaps,

437
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,920
we'll have the answer soon.

438
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,930
Thank you, Palace Chief Wanyu.

439
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,480
From now on, we are allies.

440
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,030
I believe the ancestors of Biluo Palace...

441
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,890
Master Cheng, no need to thank me.

442
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,030
I chose to ally with the Sword Alliance,

443
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,370
not because of the Sword Alliance,

444
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,770
but because of Tang Lici.

445
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,720
What I do

446
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,270
is not just for justice.

447
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,450
It's also because Tang Lici

448
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,030
has something I need.

449
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,790
Mr. Tang!

450
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,500
My power has only recovered halfway.

451
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,760
Yan,

452
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,570
are we really going to fight this time?

453
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,610
Why did we even enter Biluo Palace?

454
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,000
Now we've completely

455
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,070
disgraced the Fengliu Shop!

456
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,030
We almost lost our lives there!

457
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,210
Even though we didn't form an alliance,

458
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,400
being able to buy

459
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,790
these 2 days for Master

460
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,270
makes it worthwhile.

461
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,400
What does that mean?

462
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,600
Wanyu Yuedan is truly a person of honor.

463
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,770
In this case,

464
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,170
we'll also be courteous
before resorting to force.

465
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,210
After I've waited so long,

466
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:51,000
the show is finally beginning.

467
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,740
[Nine Qilin Transformations]

468
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,830
Nine Qilin Transformations!

469
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,630
This is going to be interesting!

470
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,400
Gui Fusheng!

471
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,680
I'm going to destroy

472
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,510
all the works

473
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,370
you left behind!

474
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,770
What is that?

475
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:36,720
Demon!

476
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,300
Quick, sound the alarm!

477
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,640
Master has invited Qiaoyi Qiankun!

478
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,070
He wants us to buy time

479
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,590
while he gets hit first!

480
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,830
Fucui.

481
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,850
Using phrases randomly

482
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,880
doesn't make you

483
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,000
look any smarter.

484
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,300
Everyone, listen to my orders.

485
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,950
Return to Biluo Palace.

486
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,210
Yes!

487
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,810
What is that thing?

488
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,870
Palace Chief.

489
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,440
Fengliu Shop has launched an attack.

490
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,170
Leading them

491
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,130
is a strange war chariot.

492
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:26,930
Mr. Tang.

493
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,880
Fengliu Shop is attacking.

494
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,720
They've reportedly brought

495
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,880
something very strange.

496
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,240
Like a vehicle but not quite.

497
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,030
The driver...

498
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:36,030
Fourth-ranked member
among the Seven Flower Cloud Travelers

499
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,350
and the second greatest puppetry artist
in the world,

500
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,830
Qiaoyi Qiankun.

501
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,000
Yes.

502
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,200
Hurry to Taixiao Hall.

503
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,400
I'll go find Palace Chief Wanyu.

504
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,900
Yu.

505
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,070
Let's go help at Taixiao Hall too.

506
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,720
Relay my orders.

507
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,400
Today's battle

508
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,410
is for justice in the jianghu.

509
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,480
For future generations,

510
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,880
we must do our utmost
to leave a viable path.

511
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,480
With the might from this battle,
Biluo Palace

512
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,410
will return to the imperial court.

513
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,310
Yes.

514
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,920
You also anticipated

515
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,720
that Fengliu Shop would attack.

516
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,580
Indeed.

517
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,190
What will you do?

518
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,590
Fight to the death.

519
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,520
Master Cheng.

520
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,790
Biluo Palace won't be an outlaw
in the jianghu,

521
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,030
a source of conflict
in the martial arts world,

522
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,550
or a spreader of harmful words.

523
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,270
Biluo Palace

524
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,880
seeks to return to its roots,

525
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,550
back to the imperial court,
back to the Luo River.

526
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,290
Kill.

527
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,010
The Wanyu clan
was expelled from Central Plains

528
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,670
all because of Yique Yinyang.

529
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,070
So in this battle, no matter

530
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,130
how great the cost,

531
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,170
I must fight,

532
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,660
and I must win.

533
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,180
Although Biluo Palace
is as solid as a fortress

534
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,980
and can withstand some attacks,

535
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,510
the Nine Qilin Transformations

536
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,930
brought by Qiaoyi Qiankun

537
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,090
worries me greatly.

538
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,490
If the battle becomes desperate,

539
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,210
I ask for your help, Mr. Tang.

540
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,670
Entrusting me with this important task.

541
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,680
Aren't you afraid I might actually be

542
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,720
Yique Yinyang?

543
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,460
I am indeed concerned.

544
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,750
But this time,

545
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,240
besides trusting you unconditionally,

546
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,900
I seem to have no other choice.

547
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,250
What do you need me to do?

548
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,560
The gate has been breached!

549
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,660
Fall back to Taixiao Hall!

550
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:47,940
Your life is mine!

551
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,520
Retreat!

552
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,280
Think you can escape?

553
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,970
They've destroyed the Sky Chain.

554
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,100
We can't get across.

555
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,670
Qiaoyi Qiankun,

556
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,910
it's your turn to act.

557
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,470
Attack.

558
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,610
The time has come.

559
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,010
Activate the formation!

560
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,850
[Nine Stars Dragon Formation]

561
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,070
Biluo Palace still has

562
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,160
such a useful tool.

563
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,480
Within the Nine Stars Dragon Formation,
we're invincible.

564
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,280
All Biluo Palace disciples
will fight this battle

565
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,040
to return to Central Plains!

566
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,750
The Nine Stars Dragon Formation

567
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,140
is Biluo Palace's secret technique.

568
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,160
Activated by
Palace Chief's Star-Averting Dance,

569
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,280
it harnesses the energy
stored in the divine stone

570
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,960
to create

571
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,420
an impenetrable barrier.

572
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,020
That monster can't break through.

573
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,150
We can have them trapped like rats

574
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,480
with nowhere to escape.

575
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,850
Once we kill the 5 demons
of the Fengliu Shop,

576
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,570
Liu Yan will surely retreat.

577
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,510
This is bad.

578
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,200
The barrier can block projectiles,

579
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,330
but not sound waves.

580
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,270
The formation's structure
resembles a horn,

581
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,310
channeling

582
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,570
Liu Yan's sound waves.

583
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,640
Master has come to assist.

584
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,070
Everyone, take your pills!

585
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,200
Crush Biluo Palace!

586
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,160
Evil Pill.

587
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,730
If we continue fighting like this,
we'll surely lose.

588
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,840
Why can't I get through?

589
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,470
Shen, what should we do?

590
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,040
Master has joined the battle!

591
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,140
Press the advantage!

592
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,510
Take Taixiao Hall!

593
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,860
You're coming.

594
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,460
I'm coming.

595
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:08,980
Liu Yan,

596
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,510
this time,

597
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,060
I won't let you escape.

598
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,660
This Tang Lici

599
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,820
is truly a nuisance!

600
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,240
Foxy Tang.

601
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,190
You're the reliable one.

602
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,200
Wait.

603
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,730
Where has that witch Xifang Tao gone?

604
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,640
This is the node

605
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,070
of the Nine Stars Dragon Formation.

606
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,470
Once you charge through,

607
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,310
Biluo Palace

608
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,940
will certainly
activate the Nine Stars Dragon Formation.

609
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,110
It's Gui Fusheng's masterpiece,

610
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,110
capable of repelling any attack.

611
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,400
It's supported by 3 formation eyes,

612
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,240
with nodes that constantly shift position.

613
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,480
But the barrier at the nodes

614
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,550
is relatively fragile.

615
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,510
This is the backdoor

616
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,360
the puppetry artist deliberately left.

617
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,520
The people of Biluo Palace
surely don't know about this.

618
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,680
However, these nodes

619
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,240
are invisible from outside the formation.

620
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,410
I need you

621
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,970
to find these 3 nodes for me.

622
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,020
Found it!

623
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,750
Found it!

624
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,830
I've found it!

625
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,790
Nine Qilin breaks Nine Dragon.

626
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,590
Gui Fusheng, watch carefully

627
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,640
how I break

628
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,570
your Nine Stars Dragon Formation!

629
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,480
Stars in the vast cosmos!

630
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,440
What the hell?

631
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,240
That's the formation node

632
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
of the Nine Stars Dragon Formation.

633
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,670
Seems like a pillar is missing.

634
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,280
Is that a problem?

635
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,510
Someone is marking the nodes

636
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,570
for the Nine Qilin Transformations.

637
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,000
It's Xifang Tao.

638
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,150
Stop her!

639
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,409
You're not going anywhere!

640
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:32,969
The second node.

641
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,370
Over there!

642
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,820
The third one.

643
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,240
You're too late.

644
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,150
The Nine Stars Dragon Formation
has been broken.

645
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,200
Break.

646
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:20,970
Lici.

647
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,150
Do you see now?

648
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,920
Wherever you appear,

649
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,980
disaster follows.

650
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,790
Another city

651
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,330
will be sacrificed because of you.

652
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
It's not over yet.

653
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,250
The mystery of mysteries!

654
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,070
The Divine Inquiry Platform
has been awakened.

655
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,030
Master.

656
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,510
I believe you are not Yique Yinyang.

657
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,710
You two might share the same origin.

658
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,670
But I'm willing to bet

659
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,270
that you're not the evil one.

660
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,190
Though Biluo Palace
was built by Gui Fusheng,

661
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,590
the Star-Averting Dance

662
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,960
is the key to activating the divine stone.

663
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,090
Time is running out.

664
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,720
I'll teach it to you now.

665
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,850
Stars in the vast cosmos,

666
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,540
the mystery of mysteries!

667
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,390
Oh no!

668
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,270
It's the Sky-Fallen Stone!

669
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,810
The Nine Qilin Transformations is ruined.

670
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,140
Let's retreat quickly.

671
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,840
The chain is still there, right?

672
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,090

blooms on Qingshan Cliff

706
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,360
and atop Mount Mengxue.

707
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,760
It blossoms when the moon rises

708
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,190
and withers at sunrise,

709
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,670
like a dream,

710
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,480
a soul,

711
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,400
and blood.

712
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,280
Like our

713
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,550
false friendship.

714
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,190
Yan.

715
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,360
You falsely accused me
of being Yique Yinyang,

716
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,490
watching me being hunted by everyone.

717
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,770
Are you happy about it?

718
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:13,710
Of course.

719
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,800
This is the happiest thing

720
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,320
for me in these 4 years.

721
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,850
Watching your lies being exposed.

722
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,400
Letting everyone

723
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,960
see your true face.

724
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,670
Lici, look.

725
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,340
I wasn't wrong.
