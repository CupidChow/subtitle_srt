00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,030
who were away on missions

193
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,430
were brutally killed by the Fengliu Shop.

194
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,090
More than 10 have been killed.

195
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,430
I'll go back and practice as well.

196
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,060
Alright.

197
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,910
This killing method

198
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,280
doesn't seem like Fengliu Shop's work,

199
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,420
but more like an assassin's technique.

200
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,020
Sixth Sword Master, well...

201
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,790
Unable to confront us directly,

202
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,760
they've resorted to assassination.

203
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,930
This is outrageous.

204
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,650
Send a message to Master Shao immediately.

205
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,180
Yes!

206
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,780
It's a trap.

207
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,320
Exactly.

208
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,970
They deliberately chose
this moment to strike—

209
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,180
it's a trap meant

210
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,100
to provoke us.

211
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,630
I'm afraid their hidden agenda

212
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,050
is more complex than it seems.

213
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,520
Also,

214
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,860
there are some rumors

215
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,120
circulating within the Sword Alliance.

216
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,580
However,

217
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,270
I'm already tracking down

218
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,800
the source of those rumors.

219
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,210
Master Shao, do you know...

220
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,510
a fortune-teller has joined

221
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,770
the alliance recently, and he's

222
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,470
-doing odd jobs in the Service Hall?
-After Mr. Tang came here,

223
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,200
though your basic needs
are well provided for...

224
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,200
have your lives...

225
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,460
truly gotten better?

226
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,580
Fengliu Shop keeps attacking

227
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,590
you alliance disciples.

228
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,920
Are you just going to swallow this insult?

229
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,880
Perhaps Mr. Tang is

230
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,310
making careful plans.

231
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,220
Plans?

232
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,390
What kind of plans?

233
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,940
That we don't know.

234
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,100
But I believe Mr. Tang

235
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,080
certainly won't stand by and do nothing.

236
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,780
Indeed.

237
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,310
Since he keeps saying

238
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,550
he wants to eliminate Fengliu Shop,

239
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,980
why does he only teach you

240
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,580
lightness skills for escape

241
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,330
and sword formations
that merely delay enemies?

242
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,890
No matter how well-coordinated
your sword formations are,

243
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,860
can they allow you to take the initiative

244
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,460
and eliminate Fengliu Shop?

245
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,480
Or can they protect you

246
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,230
from enemy ambushes when you're alone?

247
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,180
That makes some sense.

248
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,640
Indeed.

249
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,730
I can't dispute that.

250
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,570
I've heard about it.

251
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:51,910
What?

252
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,210
Is there something wrong with him?

253
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,050
A serious one.

254
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,910
Then...

255
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,040
I'll have someone

256
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,170
bring him to see you?

257
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,370
No rush.

258
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,300
When Chi Yun returns,

259
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,710
I'll find him myself.

260
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,270
I hear it.

261
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,810
Someone is calling my name.

262
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,650
Are you

263
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,740
really

264
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,080
desperately

265
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,710
in need of me right now?

266
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,550
The capable bear more work.

267
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,630
I guess I'll have to do you a favor

268
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,230
and run this errand for you, Foxy Tang.

269
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,890
You seem quite happy about it.

270
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,220
I just find it strange—

271
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,220
since Mr. Tang has
unmatched martial arts skills,

272
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,750
why doesn't he teach those skills

273
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,060
to each one of us?

274
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,220
If we all improve even a little,

275
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,100
when the final battle
with Fengliu Shop comes,

276
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,180
each of us could

277
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,580
contribute more, right?

278
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:55,980
Mr. Tang probably

279
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,310
wouldn't need that extra help, would he?

280
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,390
Am I right?

281
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,060
-Yes.
-Yeah.

282
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,460
That's right.

283
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,180
Indeed.

284
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,440
Well, Mr. Tang is so confident

285
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,910
that he's staking everything

286
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,910
on himself alone.

287
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,580
What if

288
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,630
he never actually intended to

289
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,350
destroy Fengliu Shop in the first place?

290
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,080
Wouldn't we all be doomed then?

291
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,670
Use your brains, guys.

292
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,550
How impressive

293
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,810
that you possess such insight, Mr. Fang.

294
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,070
Mr. Tang.

295
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,100
-Mr. Tang
-Mr. Tang.

296
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,820
Mr. Tang.

297
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,700
Mr. Tang.

298
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,150
With everyone watching,

299
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,700
surely you wouldn't kill me

300
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,940
over a few unpleasant words,

301
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,270
would you?

302
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,460
Let's go. Let's go.

303
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,860
-Let's go.
-We should go.

304
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,870
Here to greet me?

305
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,770
[Master of Fate; Divine Fortune Teller]

306
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,340
Mr. Fang, it seems

307
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,670
you still don't enjoy

308
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,600
your duties at the Sword Alliance.

309
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,450
Not at all.

310
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,450
I love the Sword Alliance,

311
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,380
and the disciples here love me too.

312
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,200
Mr. Tang, though you appear calm
on the surface,

313
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,100
you must be

314
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,630
seething inside.

315
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,110
But if those disciples

316
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,370
were to see you kill me in rage,

317
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,950
how would you resolve that situation?

318
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,010
What are they talking about?

319
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,730
Mr. Fang, you're so good at
fortune-telling,

320
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,700
yet you can't divine

321
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,360
whether I will kill you or not?

322
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,710
How interesting, Mr. Tang.

323
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,030
The last time

324
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,430
you came to Shisan Tower,

325
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,820
you were indifferent to everything.

326
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,480
I never expected
that in such a short time,

327
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,610
everything would change completely.

328
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,060
It seems that when people have something

329
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,310
to protect,

330
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,620
they become like dogs

331
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,940
on a leash.

332
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,830
Don't you...

333
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,150
have something

334
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,340
you want to protect,

335
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,700
Chai Xijin?

336
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,340
Lici,

337
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,220
the person you inquired about,

338
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,030
is the sixth prince
of the former dynasty, Chai Xijin.

339
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,290
He was still young when the kingdom fell.

340
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,030
Fortunately, with the help of
loyal ministers,

341
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,040
he became the master
of Fallen Shisan Tower,

342
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,770
rising to power in the jianghu.

343
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,740
The sixth prince of the former dynasty,

344
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,700
Chai Xijin.

345
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,460
Back then,

346
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,980
when I exchanged the Jeweled Relic Stupa

347
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,150
for Chi Yun,

348
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,180
I'd already taken notice.

349
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,860
Plus, with Shen's

350
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,590
Seven-Treasure Jade Hairpin,

351
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,120
the items you requested

352
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,870
were both palace treasures.

353
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,750
Ordinary folks

354
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,430
in the jianghu

355
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,790
wouldn't even know what they are.

356
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,030
However,

357
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,430
I am...

358
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,630
the godson of Minister Tang,

359
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,940
so I can access

360
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,940
some secret palace documents.

361
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,460
I didn't expect to slip up so soon

362
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,630
and give you leverage

363
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,670
against me.

364
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,030
Chai Xijin...

365
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,589
Such a nostalgic name.

366
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,599
Only what is lost...

367
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,970
can truly stir nostalgia.

368
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,780
From the Fallen Shisan Tower

369
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,390
to here,
at the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

370
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,940
your desire for and pursuit of

371
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,200
the Rebirth Scroll...

372
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,340
have been extraordinary.

373
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,390
Is the Rebirth Scroll

374
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,120
really so important

375
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,640
to you

376
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,470
that it's worth obtaining

377
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,840
by any means necessary?

378
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:44,810
Of course.

379
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,190
The Rebirth Scroll is now

380
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,510
the ultimate martial art,

381
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,170
transcending all other arts.

382
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,050
You yourself have relied on it

383
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,640
to become nearly invincible in the world.

384
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,970
Who wouldn't desire it?

385
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:55,900
But that's also

386
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,560
Yique Yinyang's martial art.

387
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,500
Yique Yinyang caused
your dynasty's downfall.

388
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,110
Why would you want to learn
his martial art?

389
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,690
You're such a nag.

390
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,780
Master Liu from Fengliu Shop

391
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,760
wouldn't ask so many questions.

392
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,800
Imagine if people knew

393
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,300
that Shisan Tower actually

394
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,120
belongs to a prince of the former dynasty

395
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,250
and that this prince

396
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,310
is colluding with Fengliu Shop,

397
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,310
which holds the Blood Ghost Pill...

398
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,200
they...

399
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,190
What are they talking about?

400
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,920
I don't know.

401
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,250
I can't hear either.

402
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,620
They'd rather leave Fengliu Shop alone

403
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,730
and wipe out your Shisan Tower first.

404
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,690
Chief Fang,

405
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,640
you should understand

406
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,710
that you're only safe

407
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,350
in the darkness.

408
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,140
Mr. Tang.

409
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,540
You just said the most dangerous thing.

410
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:53,820
Dangerous?

411
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,710
Your methods against me

412
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
are no different.

413
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,510
But

414
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,710
judging from your expression now,

415
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,860
it seems my threat

416
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,660
carries more weight.

417
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,270
Chief Fang,

418
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,470
you've had your fun.

419
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,030
Won't you leave now?

420
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,030
But if I obtain

421
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,820
the eternal Rebirth Scroll,

422
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,140
I'll gain

423
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,230
a mysterious

424
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,100
and powerful body like yours.

425
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,680
I'll obtain the path

426
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,110
from human to god.

427
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,620
I want to obtain

428
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,590
the path

429
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,280
from human to god.

430
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,550
Work with me.

431
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,240
You want to become a god?

432
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,060
If you don't,

433
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,300
that's your problem.

434
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,750
Fang Pingzhai, Chief of

435
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,410
Fallen Shisan Tower, is here.

436
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,310
He's the Chief of Shisan Tower?

437
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,250
The Chief has another identity,

438
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,310
which is...

439
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,030
Fine.

440
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,420
You win.

441
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,520
I'll leave.

442
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,100
Sorry to have troubled you
these past few days,

443
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,210
and thanks for your hospitality.

444
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,210
I, Fang Pingzhai, never owe favors.

445
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,860
Before I leave,

446
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,420
I'll give you all a special gift

447
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,820
to express my gratitude!

448
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,310
Is he for real?

449
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,380
Follow him.

450
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,270
For how long?

451
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,950
Until you feel that
if you don't come back,

452
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,740
he'll bring disaster upon the world.

453
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,910
The key is to find out

454
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,650
what his true purpose is.

455
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,940
That important?

456
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,010
You can count on me.

457
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,660
The Peony Pavilion!

458
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,520
The one we've been searching for!

459
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,550
It really is.

460
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,140
Isn't Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

461
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,070
the headquarters of Fengliu Shop?

462
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,190
This map is so detailed.

463
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,390
It doesn't look fake.

464
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,360
It even shows the corridors.

465
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,480
Is this real or fake?

466
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,740
Now wiping them out will be child's play!

467
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,790
When was this map put up?

468
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,860
Turns out the headquarters of Fengliu Shop

469
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,230
has been hidden
in the misty marshlands all along.

470
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,910
Jiangnan's waters are
full of isolated islands.

471
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,110
No wonder we couldn't find it anywhere.

472
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,580
Sword Master, please

473
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,750
send orders to all disciples immediately

474
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,150
to attack the Xiuyu Peony Pavilion
at once.

475
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,080
Since the Peony Pavilion is

476
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,270
the headquarters of Fengliu Shop,

477
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,340
it must be full of traps and mechanisms.

478
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,550
Whether we can trust this map

479
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,610
remains to be seen.

480
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,900
We should first send someone

481
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,370
to infiltrate and investigate

482
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,510
to avoid falling into the enemy's trap.

483
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,710
Traps and mechanisms are mere trickery.

484
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,580
Once our forces are assembled,

485
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,550
brute force will overcome any trick!

486
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,750
Whatever traps they set,

487
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,620
we'll crush them all!

488
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,550
With Mr. Tang

489
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,980
and so many experts from our alliance,

490
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,950
plus backing from the imperial court

491
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,950
and Biluo Palace,

492
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,140
there's no need to hold back!

493
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,710
Our alliance is at its strongest

494
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,710
with high morale.

495
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,440
If not now, when?

496
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,750
Master Cheng,

497
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,750
what do you think?

498
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,060
Evil must be thoroughly eliminated
sooner rather than later.

499
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,190
I have no objection.

500
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,260
-Please issue the order, Sword Master.
-Please issue the order, Sword Master.

501
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,140
Relay my command:

502
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,360
assemble the disciples from all halls

503
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,940
and prepare for battle!

504
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,740
Mr. Tang,

505
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,140
what do you think about that map?

506
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,820
How much can it be trusted?

507
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,240
At this point,

508
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,380
with everyone's blood running hot,

509
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,620
does it even matter
whether it's real or fake?

510
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,420
That's true.

511
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,030
But the alliance still needs time to
come together.

512
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,520
Whoever posted this map

513
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,550
deliberately wants to deny us that time.

514
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,750
I'm worried another faction

515
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,420
is entering the game,

516
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,240
determined to disrupt
the peace of the jianghu.

517
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,440
What matters most now

518
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,780
is how to win the battle
against the Peony Pavilion.

519
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,700
After the battle,

520
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,510
I'll

521
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,140
personally resolve

522
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,010
this matter.

523
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,900
Master,

524
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,420
I have some thoughts

525
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,340
about the coming battle

526
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,200
that I'd like to discuss with you.

527
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,720
Chunji,

528
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,720
didn't I tell you to go back?

529
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,640
When will we attack Fengliu Shop?

530
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,040
I want to be in the vanguard,

531
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,700
charging into battle for you!

532
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,550
I'm already asleep.

533
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,390
Let's discuss it tomorrow.

534
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,270
Master Shao,

535
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,510
I'll

536
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,510
take my leave now.

537
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,660
Mr. Tang,

538
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,380
please help me talk some sense into

539
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,380
that troublesome disciple of mine.

540
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,680
Earlier, Mr. Tang,

541
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,530
you told me to wait
until the final battle.

542
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,080
I can't wait any longer.

543
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,820
Ms. Zhong,

544
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,580
you've always been a strong-willed person.

545
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,100
Yes.

546
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,340
I'm very strong-willed.

547
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,700
Why should anyone admit defeat?

548
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,360
But strong-willed people

549
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,550
often have...

550
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,140
fragile hearts.

551
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,320
The most strong-willed person I know

552
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,070
seems to be you, Mr. Tang.

553
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,000
Therefore,

554
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,320
I

555
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,480
can understand how you feel.

556
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:30,950
I

557
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,360
just want to remind you:

558
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,650
the closer you are to your goal,

559
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,090
the calmer you must stay.

560
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,850
To lose patience

561
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,080
is often to lose one's way,

562
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,240
and you may

563
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,490
be exploited by enemies

564
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,860
or even

565
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,270
fall into their traps.

566
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,660
I understand.

567
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:59,710
Then I'll...

568
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,580
go back and think carefully about

569
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,510
the battle plan.

570
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,140
Goodbye.

571
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,640
Goodbye.

572
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,070
What's wrong, Master Puzhu?

573
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,750
We're approaching the outpost.

574
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,410
We must proceed with caution.

575
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,340
I'll scout ahead first.

576
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,790
You all remain here for now.

577
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,190
Thank you, Master Puzhu.

578
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,230
Before I return,

579
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,300
don't make any rash moves.

580
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,390
Understood.

581
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,620
Rest in place!

582
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,230
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

583
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,780
Come on, let's go sit over there.

584
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,440
Alright, let's go.

585
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,100
Come on, let's sit over there.

586
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,230
My friend,

587
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,910
it's been a long time.

588
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:42,970
You...

589
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,100
I'm not wearing a veil,

590
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,930
and you don't recognize me anymore?

591
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,530
My friend,

592
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,750
I

593
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,340
came to play chess with you.

594
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,050
Whether you wear a veil or not,

595
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,020
I've

596
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,390
never truly seen you clearly.

597
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,910
For instance, right now,

598
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,220
should I address you as Miss Tao

599
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,260
or as "The Peach of Three Hues,"

600
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,230
Xifang Tao?

601
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,430
The Peach of Three Hues

602
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:14,630
is me.

603
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,340
Miss Tao

604
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,330
is also me.

605
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,550
Isn't it said

606
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,470
that all that has form is false?

607
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,500
Sir, you've studied
the Buddhist scriptures deeply,

608
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,700
so why cling to forms?

609
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:29,840
Sir,

610
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:30,960
please.

611
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,030
For today's game,

612
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,760
let's play blindfolded chess
with this endgame.

613
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:43,990
What do you think?

614
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,350
Let it be so.

615
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,140
This string of beads of mine

616
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,340
has exactly 13 beads.

617
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,660
So, Sir,

618
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,720
I shall play only 13 moves.

619
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,850
In that case...

620
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,670
I'll make the first move.

621
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,870
Let me borrow your prayer bead.

622
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,030
All this time, I've been wondering

623
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,090
whether I should consider you
a chess companion

624
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,090
or an opponent.

625
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,320
It's time to decide now.

626
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,670
Light Technique—

627
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,640
Stars Scattered Across the Sky!

628
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,350
I've played chess with you
for three years.

629
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,640
I remember every move

630
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,510
you ever made.

631
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,420
There are several positions

632
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,140
where you never placed your pieces,

633
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,420
even though, according to chess theory,

634
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,350
you should have.

635
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,500
My friend,

636
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,150
are you deliberately letting me win?

637
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,660
I guess

638
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,930
those positions

639
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,550
are the formation cores

640
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,280
that trigger
the Stars Scattered Across the Sky!

641
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,030
Oh no.

642
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,440
Deputy Lord Yu,

643
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,510
what should we do now?

644
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,470
To force Master Puzhu to use

645
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,950
the Stars Scattered Across the Sky,

646
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,240
that person must be an expert.

647
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,560
Master Puzhu is in danger.

648
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,580
Follow me to aid him!

649
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,780
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

650
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,290
You're trying to lure them

651
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,760
into coming to the rescue?

652
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,140
That's right.

653
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,110
I can't be certain I'll defeat you,

654
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,780
but severely wounding the elites
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

655
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,780
is much easier.

656
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,460
Oh no, it's a trap.

657
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,760
This is Fengliu Shop's poisonous mist.

658
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,020
Everyone, be careful!

659
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,690
Because of your one careless move,

660
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,920
an entire squad will be sacrificed.

661
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,740
Do you feel any remorse?

662
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,310
This poisonous mist suppresses
inner strength.

663
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,770
I must get them out of here.

664
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,850
Light Technique—

665
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,740
Verbal Dharma.

666
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,240
You'd give up your protective prayer beads

667
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,370
just to save others.

668
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,890
You're still as compassionate as ever.

669
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,230
These are Master Puzhu's prayer beads.

670
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,270
They can guide us

671
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,200
out of this mist!

672
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:13,900
Then...

673
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,200
let's retreat now.

674
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,180
Master Puzhu,

675
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,250
please be careful!

676
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,470
Stay alert

677
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,790
and retreat immediately!

678
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,450
-Yes!
-Yes!

679
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,260
Your Fengliu Shop is doomed,

680
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,520
and you've got nowhere to run.

681
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,050
Why create more bloodshed?

682
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,800
The Peach of Three Hues—

683
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,990
Boundless Peach Blossoms!

684
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,350
Lion's Roar.

685
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,810
Not only will I create bloodshed,

686
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,630
but I'll also make you

687
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,340
create bloodshed.

688
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,140
I

689
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,490
will never let you die.

690
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,820
You are truly interesting, Sir.

691
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,100
We've been walking from dawn till dusk.

692
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,360
We finally made it out.

693
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,030
Indeed.

694
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:26,950
If it weren't for

695
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,380
Master Puzhu's prayer beads,

696
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,060
our losses

697
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,590
would have been much worse.

698
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,140
You all head back to camp first.

699
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,580
I'm going back for Master Puzhu.

700
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,310
You mustn't.

701
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,420
Deputy Lord Yu,

702
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,640
it's too dangerous to go back now.

703
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,310
-Yes.
-Yes!

704
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:39,660
You mustn't.

705
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,140
It's far too dangerous!

706
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,870
Listen to me!

707
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,560
Not repaying kindness

708
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,990
violates the ancestral teachings
of Sword King City.

709
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,230
You should go back quickly.

710
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:45,690
Well...

711
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,880
This is an order.

712
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,860
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

713
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,140
Yu Furen,

714
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,470
you've truly disappointed me.

715
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,239
Who's there?

716
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,389
Is it really you?

717
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,050
You're not dead?

718
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,739
Yes, I died.

719
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:48,540
But Fengliu Shop has turned me into
a human puppet.

720
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,460
So...

721
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,860
I came back to life.

722
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,790
So

723
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,230
it's true that you've been

724
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,430
working for Fengliu Shop all this time.

725
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,150
Then

726
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,660
you don't deserve to
return to Sword King City now.

727
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,460
Don't be so harsh.

728
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,820
Fengliu Shop and I

729
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,280
are just using each other.

730
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,670
When did you

731
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,400
start taking those Evil Pills?

732
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,960
Who cares about something like that?

733
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,310
I care!

734
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,230
I want to know—

735
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,340
when did

736
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,340
the hero of Sword King City

737
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,500
become a monster?

738
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:33,940
And when

739
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,710
did I

740
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,490
start stubbornly believing in you

741
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,550
and miss the chance to bring you back?

742
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,380
You're still as naive as ever.

743
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,930
There are no heroes who don't pay a price.

744
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,940
As for you,

745
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,270
you trusted the wrong person before,

746
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,270
and you're still doing the same now!

747
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,520
Come back to the Sword Alliance with me
to face justice!

748
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,310
You're no match for me.

749
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,900
Why risk your life fighting me?

750
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,080
It's a worthless life anyway.

751
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,540
Risking it...

752
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,310
What's there to regret?

753
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,540
Come on!

754
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,590
You shouldn't die here.

755
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,630
Go back to Sword King City and learn

756
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,230
how to be a good city lord

757
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,820
to protect Sword King City's
century-old legacy.

758
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,220
Don't you find your words

759
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,310
laughable?

760
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,710
If Sword King City

761
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,190
truly mattered to you,

762
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,560
how could you have ended up
where you are today?

763
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,000
I just wanted to be a hero.

764
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,900
But when ordinary people try to be heroes,

765
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,230
they must pay a price.

766
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,930
This price is something

767
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,980
you'll have to bear sooner or later.

768
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,230
A hero?

769
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,090
A hero who risks his life
for Fengliu Shop?

770
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,020
Yu Qifeng,

771
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,360
I won't believe

772
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,770
a single word you say anymore.

773
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,640
Whether you believe it or not
doesn't matter.

774
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,790
But your price

775
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,990
is already on its way.

776
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,460
The person you trust now

777
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,590
has already decided that fate for you.

778
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:40,860
Who?

779
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,590
Tang Lici?

780
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,170
I never trusted him.

781
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,500
You don't trust him, yet you

782
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,630
obey his every word,

783
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,670
allowing him to command you.

784
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,380
You lead the people of Sword King City

785
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,710
to fight his battles!

786
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,910
I never did it for him.

787
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,240
I did it to destroy Fengliu Shop!

788
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,860
His methods may be questionable,

789
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,990
but they often work.

790
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,230
With him in the Sword Alliance,

791
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,660
we can eliminate evil forces sooner.

792
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,980
If Fengliu Shop and the Sword Alliance

793
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,210
don't destroy each other,

794
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,990
how could he, as Yique Yinyang,

795
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,830
reap the benefits?

796
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,530
Yique Yinyang is dead.

797
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:11,940
Fengliu Shop

798
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,460
deliberately framed him

799
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,460
to provoke conflict in the jianghu...

800
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,230
Is Fengliu Shop intentionally framing him,

801
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,520
or are you people from the Sword Alliance
deceiving yourselves?

802
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,950
Do you know how he obtained

803
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,080
his Rebirth Scroll?

804
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,460
Have you seen
his golden eyes and forehead mark?

805
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,860
He has so many secrets,

806
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,440
yet why does everyone
in the Sword Alliance

807
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,050
choose to turn a blind eye?

808
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,230
I haven't!

809
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,110
I just...

810
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:32,990
I just...

811
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,420
Everyone has

812
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,480
their own secrets.

813
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,670
I'm also waiting for an opportunity.

814
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,190
I'm afraid some secrets

815
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,720
are too much for you to bear.

816
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,600
Shao Yanping has grown senile.

817
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,820
If he wants to stake the fate
of the entire alliance,

818
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,690
I can't stop him.

819
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,950
But you're different.

820
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,230
You're the next lord of Sword King City.

821
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,110
Who you trust

822
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,050
determines the city's fate.

823
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:54,940
Furen,

824
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,520
my life is already ruined,

825
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,160
but your life has just begun.

826
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,820
Don't let your life

827
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,590
and Sword King City's century-old legacy

828
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,920
become the price of your misplaced trust!

829
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,800
No matter what,

830
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,060
you must provide evidence.

831
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,630
Come back to the alliance with me

832
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,760
and confront Tang Lici face-to-face.

833
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,390
So you're saying

834
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,380
that Master Puzhu

835
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,750
fell into the trap set by

836
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,830
the West Palace Chief of Fengliu Shop.

837
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,760
After getting separated from you
in the mist,

838
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,460
there's been no trace of him since?

839
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:26,940
Yes.

840
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
It's all my fault.

841
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,760
Before Master Puzhu left,

842
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,020
he clearly instructed me

843
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,070
not to act rashly.

844
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,270
But I still acted recklessly.

845
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,440
That enchantress is full of tricks.

846
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,540
It's no surprise

847
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,090
that you fell into her trap.

848
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,270
Unfortunately, after we entered the mist,

849
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,310
we couldn't tell which way to go

850
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,390
and didn't know

851
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,630
where Master Puzhu had gone
while chasing Xifang Tao.

852
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,090
But I imagine Master Puzhu

853
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:49,980
must have had some other method

854
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,020
to find his way.

855
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,890
Otherwise,

856
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,070
he wouldn't have given this prayer bead

857
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,590
to us.

858
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,210
Let me see this prayer bead.

859
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,120
After you fought your way out,

860
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,270
did you encounter

861
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,000
anyone else?

862
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:41,740
No.

863
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,010
I can tell

864
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,690
he's hiding something.

865
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,420
Indeed.

866
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,710
Then, who do you think

867
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,640
he encountered?

868
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,540
It takes the one who started it to end it.

869
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,450
To unravel Commander Yu's inner conflict,

870
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,780
we can only wait and see.

871
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,190
The same goes

872
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,820
for Master Puzhu.

873
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,330
What do you mean?

874
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,340
There was a note

875
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,000
at Master Puzhu's place

876
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,310
saying

877
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,650
that his chess companion of many years

878
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,750
is the West Palace Chief of Fengliu Shop,

879
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,820
Xifang Tao.

880
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,020
Master Puzhu

881
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,680
is not a gullible man.

882
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,150
For them to become friends,

883
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,410
there must be a reason.

884
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:23,810
Perhaps...

885
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,360
because they've known each other
for a long time...

886
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,460
things

887
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,630
won't reach

888
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,940
the worst outcome.

889
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,580
On the contrary...

890
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,880
it may help Puzhu overcome
his karmic obstacles.

891
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,050
You actually used your remaining strength
to save me.

892
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,760
Master Puzhu,

893
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,440
what are you really thinking?

894
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,310
I said

895
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,430
I'd never let you die because of me.

896
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,590
You won't kill me,

897
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,340
but I'll kill you.

898
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,200
You're badly injured now.

899
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,120
Don't act recklessly.

900
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,980
I know how badly I'm injured.

901
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,900
Messenger geese.

902
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:30,870
Master Puzhu,

903
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,940
why don't you ask

904
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,340
the Yanmen Sect for help?

905
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,440
They can't hear us.

906
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,690
The terrain here is unique—

907
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,260
wide at the bottom, narrow at the top,

908
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,810
and surrounded by steep cliffs.

909
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,470
It wouldn't be easy to find us.

910
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,230
You're injured now.

911
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,280
It's impossible for you to leave.

912
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,820
It seems I

913
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,670
have fallen into your hands.

914
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,540
Master Puzhu,

915
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,540
the fact that you still had strength left
to save me...

916
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,150
means that this place

917
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,500
can't trap you at all.

918
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:19,550
Sir,

919
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,510
why don't you leave?

920
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,830
West Palace Chief, since you're awake,

921
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:25,670
please get up.

922
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,530
"West Palace Chief"?

923
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:44,770
Sir, you're sweating.

924
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,610
Is it because you're exhausted,

925
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,860
or because...

926
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,790
you're nervous?

927
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,410
You're pressing on my legs.
