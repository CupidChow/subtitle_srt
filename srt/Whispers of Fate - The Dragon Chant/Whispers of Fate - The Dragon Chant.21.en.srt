Aren't you scared at all?

00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,070
Lici, are you really that silly?

Don't you even understand fear?

7
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,280
Forget it. You wouldn't understand anyway.

8
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,740
But there is a kind of sound

9
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,940
that you can feel
even if you don't understand.

10
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,780
What is this?

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,830
Can I try too?

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,560

Here.

14
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,600

It's a real treasure,

a flute that's very difficult to master.

22
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,290

has made thorough preparations.

enabling it to amass sufficient fame,
fortune, and influence.

Let's investigate this Zhoudi Tower,

108
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,330
and we'll find out.

to ask the puppetry master

Qiaoyi Qiankun to investigate.

00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,510

00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,770
by using up a Sky-Fallen Stone fragment.

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,270
He can't continue his research.

117
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,820
Now, apart from the Biluo Palace,

118
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,880
only Puti Valley
possesses Sky-Fallen Stones.

119
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,000
If you give him another one,

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,930
he'll be eternally grateful to you

121
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,360
and willing to do anything.

122
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,800
You're right.

thank you, Master Puzhu.

128
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,110
I am willing to cooperate

129
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,750
because the Sword Alliance truly

130
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,809
needs Mr. Tang now.

131
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,240
Yielding to circumstances

132
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,150
doesn't mean

133
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,549
I agree with

134
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,679

your approval?

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,630
Using money to buy loyalty

140
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,460

141
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,710

142
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,120

to risk their lives fighting evil.

144
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,320
Is that fair?

145
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,370
Using profit as bait

146
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,630

The Evil Pill spreads its poison

148
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,770
precisely because of human greed

149
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,700
and delusions of instant success.

150
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,690
Pursuing benefits and avoiding harm

151
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,900
is human nature.

152
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,910
Isn't it a bit harsh

153
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,240
to hold ordinary people

154
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,480
to a sage's standard?

155
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,200
This is what they call,
"With great rewards

156
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,130
come brave men."

157
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,550
After the news has gotten out,

158
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,910
many sects want to join

159
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,030
the Sword Alliance's campaign
against the Fengliu Shop.

160
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,720
Moreover,

161
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,480
with the court
and the Biluo Palace's support,

162
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,080
the entire Sword Alliance's morale
has soared.

163
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,010
I think we should

all Fengliu Shop strongholds.

what's your opinion?

170
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,140
Eliminating evil completely
is indeed my wish.

171
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,410
But...

172
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,280
Do we have to meet here?

173
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,510
It's so dark here,

174
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,600
making us look like

175
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,660

176
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,850

179

With enemies at our doorstep,

180
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,100
if the Sword Alliance
needs anything in the future,

181
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,760
just send someone to inform me.

182
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,380
I will go to Wanhua Hall

183
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,840
to discuss matters with you.

184
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,390
Great.

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,930
I never expected

186
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,690
Master Puzhu to be

187
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,180
someone who knows how to be flexible.

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,490
To raid Fengliu Shop's strongholds,

189
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,620
I'll lead by example

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,250
and go ahead first.

191
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,750
Perfect.

192
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,550
Deputy Lord Yu

193
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,870
has just arrived at the Sword Alliance
with his people.

194
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,870
I'll go with you to see him.

195
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,360
Master Puzhu,

196
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,450
is it really so unbearable for you

197
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,790
to work alongside me?

198
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,910
I've heard

199
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,920
that the disciples
of the Tianjing Pavilion

200
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,200
must practice meditation and tolerance.

201
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,670
How is it

202
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,040
that you don't need to practice these?

203
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,520
Farewell. Farewell.

204
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,570
I wish you good luck on your journey.

205
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,020
If Master Cheng

206
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,600
also wants to talk about

207
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,190
approval

208
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,410
or other clichés,

209
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,750
I already know it.

210
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,000
Perhaps you do have the skills

211
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,870
to fight against the Fengliu Shop.

212
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,390
But with your personality,

213
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,790
you can't inherit
the Seven‑String True Tune

214
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,790
of Fang Zhou.

215
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,080
Fang Zhou

216
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,610
was a man of integrity,

217
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,120
but in the end,

218
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,240
apart from people's respect,

219
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,410
what else did he get?

220
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,120
Asking such a question shows

221
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,250
you don't understand
Fang Zhou well enough.

222
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,400
I don't want to be Fang Zhou.

223
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,290
You can't be him either.

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
You're suspected of being Yique Yinyang.

225
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,790
Though after the battle at Biluo Palace,

226
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,690
this suspicion was temporarily dispelled,

227
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,620
but with your methods and actions,

228
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,030
no one can guarantee

229
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,750
that you won't become the next

230
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,750
Yique Yinyang.

231
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,080
You are a threat

232
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,770
to the Sword Alliance.

233
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,270
Tang Lici.

234
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,560
I'll be watching you.

235
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,970
You asked me before

236
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,000
if I've ever killed the wrong person
with my sword.

237
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,860
Perhaps I have,

238
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,920
but I have no regrets.

239
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,370
For all my mistakes,

240
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,390
I will atone in hell.

241
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,410
Why are you laughing?

242
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,630
Master Cheng, your words

243
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,870
sound so resolute.

244
00:12:59,390 --> 00:12:59,870
Have you

245
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,930
moved yourself with your own speech?

246
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,920
However,

247
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,560
your desire to atone is one-sided.

248
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,250
Have you considered

249
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,160
whether those souls in hell

250
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,870
are willing to give you

251
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,270
a chance for redemption?

252
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,360
Mr. Tang.

253
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,330
Master Shao, you haven't slept all night.

254
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,690
The turmoil in the jianghu hasn't settled,

255
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,620
making it impossible to rest easy.

256
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,800
Forgive my boldness,

257
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,490
are you and the owner of the Fengliu Shop
Liu Yan

258
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,210
disciples of the same master?

259
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,780
Chief Fang Zhou of Zhoudi Tower

260
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,720
was our senior.

261
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,150
Chief Fang Zhou of Zhoudi Tower

262
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,410
was a man of principle.

263
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,570
My master Jiangnan Feng and he

264
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,010
once fought fiercely at Tiandu Peak,

265
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,510
together resisting
Yique Yinyang's rebellion.

266
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,970
Mr. Tang,
since you've inherited his legacy

267
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,660
and are willing to join us,

268
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,760
you must also have the desire
to help the world.

269
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,120
But my purpose

270
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,120
has never been peace in the jianghu.

271
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,720
That's not contradictory.

272
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,790
Didn't you once tell

273
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,080
Master Puzhu

274
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,790
that even those with different paths
can work together?

275
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,720
As long as our current goals align,

276
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,480
why not journey together for a while?

277
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,150
Rest assured,
since we're traveling together,

278
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,120
I will handle

279
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,310
all Sword Alliance matters properly.

280
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,240
However,

281
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,150
my methods in the future

282
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,550
may be even more unacceptable
to ordinary people.

283
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,080
You

284
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,940
might not have peace and quiet
for some time.

285
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,280
Everyone,

286
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,630
don't be hasty!

287
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,320
Let's talk things through slowly!

288
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,960
Tang Lici!

289
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,280
Take it easy. Calm down.

290
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,060
Let's talk this through.

291
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,970
Sword Masters.

292
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,510
What's the matter?

293
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,800
You've made a mistake in this decree.

294
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,190
I'm in charge of the Service Hall,

295
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,720
not the Investigation Hall.

296
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,450
And mine too.

297
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,170
If you transfer me elsewhere,

298
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,230
what will happen to my cases
at the Investigation Hall?

299
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,950
Whatever you have received

300
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,000
is what you should follow.

301
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,510
You don't understand the Sword Alliance,

302
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,000
so please stop messing things up.

303
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,910
If you turn

304
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,750
the Sword Alliance into chaos

305
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,790
and then just walk away,

306
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,250
what are we supposed to do?

307
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,080
Mr. Tang,

308
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,640
even though you were

309
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,120
invited by
our Ancestor's divine revelation,

310
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,320
you still

311
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,520
can't be so arbitrary

312
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,790
and autocratic.

313
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,920
Master Jiang,

314
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,870
during your supervision of disciples,

315
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,440
their efficiency was poor,

316
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,790
and complaints were widespread.

317
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,920
The reason for this,

318
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
in my opinion,

319
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,620
is that you prioritized
personal relationships

320
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,080
and lacked decisiveness.

321
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,540
Master Shangguan,

322
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,040
you were responsible
for the Sword Alliance's finances,

323
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,290
yet for all these years,

324
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,580
the Sword Alliance
has been operating at a loss,

325
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,580
due to your poor management skills.

326
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,360
Master Pu,

327
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,320
as for your Investigation Hall,

328
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,080
30 cold cases in the jianghu

329
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,980
show absolutely no progress in a year.

330
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,030
The Sword Alliance's reputation

331
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,430
has greatly diminished.

332
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,650
It's because you

333
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,170
failed to investigate even minor issues.

334
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,980
That's just empty talk.

335
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,790
The Sword Alliance's dossiers
for the past decade

336
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,520
are all here.

337
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,870
Every word I've said

338
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,390
is backed by evidence.

339
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,910
He's gone through 10 years of records?

340
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,510
Doesn't this man ever sleep?

341
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,920
I know.

342
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,130
You've all done your best.

343
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,840
However,

344
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,320
some matters,

345
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,310
like opposing the Fengliu Shop,

346
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,790
aren't just about effort

347
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,550
or determination to succeed.

348
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,550
Let's try this arrangement
for half a month.

349
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,550
Whether it works or is appropriate

350
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,910
will become clear

351
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,720
after that time.

352
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,970
What if your arrangement
proves even worse?

353
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I will step down

354
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,310
and leave the Sword Alliance.

355
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,569
That's not necessary.

356
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,800
Really not necessary.

357
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,160
You said it yourself.

358
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,060
Well then,

359
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,069
let's follow Mr. Tang's arrangement

360
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,730
and give it a try.

361
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,990
It's only half a month.

362
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,010
The time will pass quickly.

363
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,680
Fine.

364
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,000
Since I've come to the Sword Alliance,

365
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,420
I won't be leaving again.

366
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,620
[Fallen Shisan Tower]

367
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,790
Master.

368
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,340
We found that Tang Lici

369
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,030
has taken over the Sword Alliance.

370
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,290
He's gathering forces

371
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,650
to fight against the Fengliu Shop.

372
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,440
Also,

373
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,750
the item you requested

374
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,920
is ready.

375
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,750
Tang Lici.

376
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,440
I know how to get

377
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,040
the Rebirth Scroll from you.

378
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
I'll go to the Sword Alliance now

379
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,950
to bring you a special gift.

380
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,050
Let's go. Let's go.

381
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,750
Fan.

382
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,750
Are you also here
to join the Sword Alliance

383
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,070
to fight against the Fengliu Shop?

384
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,590
Yes.

385
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,720
There are so many martial artists

386
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,520
coming today.

387
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,590
This time we'll surely succeed.

388
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,210
This time we can definitely
stand against the Fengliu Shop.

389
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,200
He's blocked the road again.

390
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,880
Such a troublemaker.

391
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,350
Indeed.

392
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,480
You two can't even catch

393
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,340
a single child?

394
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,730
Stop, stop!

395
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,880
Stop, stop!

396
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,610
Leave this to me.

397
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,800
This is called martial arts.

398
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,860
You've built so many stone fortresses.

399
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,920
Are you trying to hide inside them
to protect yourself?

400
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,920
But

401
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,290
stones can't protect you.

402
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,690
You need to protect them instead.

403
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,050
I want to teach him to read first,

404
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,850
then teach him our martial arts.

405
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,270
One day,

406
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,400
you will use them

407
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,270
to protect what matters to you.

408
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,390
I can teach you martial arts.

409
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,170
With martial arts,

410
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,150
in the future,

411
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,630
you'll be able to protect these stones.

412
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,930
However,

413
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,920
you must promise me.

414
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,080
You can only stack stones here.

415
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,610
You can't block other people's paths.

416
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,150
You don't understand anything.

417
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,400
Then I'll teach you
the "Three Character Classic" first.

418
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,880
Men.

419
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,750
On.

420
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,750
Earth.

421
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,350
Good.

422
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,160
At.

423
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,010
Today I'll teach you
to recognize characters.

424
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,720
It reads "Man on earth, good at birth."

425
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,720
It means

426
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,850
when we are born,

427
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,830
we are all good people.

428
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,440
The reason some people become bad later

429
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,730
is that they are influenced by bad things.

430
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,830
So, Lici,

431
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,990
you must believe that in your heart,

432
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,950
there is always love.

433
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,110
Man on earth.

434
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,440
Man on earth.

435
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,680
Good at birth.

436
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
Good at birth.

437
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,960
Lici,

438
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,100
you're learning very well.

439
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,200
Lici,

440
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,770
resist the urge

441
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,500
to knock over this sandcastle.

442
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,090
People do bad things

443
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,830
because they're influenced by bad things.

444
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,490
That's why they do bad things.

445
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,240
Understand?

446
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,270
Tang Lici.

447
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,440
Damn the Central Plains Sword Alliance!

448
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,270
We've had several

449
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,200
of our strongholds raided!

450
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,800
And you just wait here
without doing anything!

451
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,000
East Palace Chief.

452
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,910
When will you understand

453
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,270
that anger solves nothing?

454
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,310
Am I angry?

455
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,880
Am I that angry?

456
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,370
Where is Master?

457
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,640
Where has Master gone at a time like this?

458
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,700
Is our Fengliu Shop

459
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,720
just going to be bullied like this?

460
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,360
If you don't want to wait
for Master to return,

461
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,200
you can go face them yourself.

462
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,680
Fine, I'll go!

463
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,910
If I go,

464
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,350
what about you?

465
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,270
I'll stay here

466
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,950
waiting for Master to return.

467
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,750
Give me a break.

468
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,070
Don't think that if Master and I died,

469
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,750
you could become the new Master

470
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,400
and be equal to Leader.

471
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,160
Keep dreaming!

472
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,670
What's all this noise about?

473
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,110
Greetings, Master.

474
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,770
Greetings, Master.

475
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:56,740
Fucui.

476
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,790
You thought I was dead just now,

477
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,780
didn't you?

478
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,550
No, no, no.

479
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:03,920
Not at all.

480
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,190
I just feel

481
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,550
that the Central Plains Sword Alliance

482
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,030
is taking a mile when given an inch.

483
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,290
They're going too far.

484
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,000
I was just upset for a moment.

485
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,640
Fucui actually managed to say

486
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,930
2 idioms in one breath.

487
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,660
I guess pressure does
bring out quick thinking.

488
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,480
Xifang Tao!

489
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,710
You...

490
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,880
Master.

491
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,320
Since Tang Lici

492
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,830
became the Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance,

493
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,510
he's raided our several

494
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,680
hidden places!

495
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,620
This time's loss is much greater

496
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,290
than that in Sword King City!

497
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,160
We can't just sit and wait for death.

498
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,360
We need to fight back!

499
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,530
What's the rush?

500
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,420
Hearts that can be bought with money

501
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,970
can just as easily be torn apart
by other means.

502
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,970
They've overestimated themselves

503
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,460
and also underestimated me

504
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,890
and the Fengliu Shop.

505
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,550
Take this

506
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,740
to mobilize our people.

507
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,000
Master.

508
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,030
Chunji, you're back.

509
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,330
Let me have a look at you.

510
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,520
Very good.

511
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,280
Very good.

512
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,430
Chunji, your leadership of the disciples

513
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,750
in raiding

514
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,880
the Fengliu Shop's strongholds

515
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,210
is extremely well done.

516
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,660
Thank you for your hard work.

517
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,920
This is simply my duty.

518
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,270
However, Master,

519
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,430
recently,

520
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,340
the Sword Alliance's reputation
has grown tremendously.

521
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,560
Every day, there are many new people

522
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,960
in the martial arts world joining us.

523
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,880
These newcomers

524
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
don't understand the rules
of the Sword Alliance yet.

525
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,030
They need someone

526
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,510
to guide and lead them.

527
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,590
So can I...

528
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,160
It's time to return
to the Shanfeng Branch.

529
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,680
Yes.

530
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,650
Now everyone knows

531
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,140
that Mr. Tang is innocent.

532
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,600
So what I did back then

533
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,860
wasn't really wrong, was it?

534
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,830
Have you forgotten?

535
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,230
Didn't I tell you before?

536
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,590
I punished you because you

537
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,610
released a suspect without permission.

538
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,700
That wasn't releasing a suspect at all.

539
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,970
It was clearly some Sword Masters

540
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:15,880
trying to take advantage

541
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,080
to replace me with their own disciples.

542
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,480
Some things

543
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,880
are better left understood

544
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,790
but unspoken.

545
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,920
Alright.

546
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,350
Chunji,

547
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,750
the position of Shanfeng Branch Chief

548
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,880
is still vacant now.

549
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,240
As long as you take it step by step

550
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,580
and remain steady and reliable,

551
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,240
what's meant to be yours will be yours.

552
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
It's just not the right time yet.

553
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,070
Yes, yes.

554
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,570
I understand, Master.

555
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,340
I'm leaving.

556
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,540
I'm leaving.

557
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,530
Such a troublesome one.

558
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,970
Good. Next.

559
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,550
Thank you. Next.

560
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
What's your name?

561
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,720
How many people have come today?

562
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,750
Zhong.

563
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,760
You're back.

564
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,000
Ms. Zhong.

565
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,520
Today, we've had

566
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,070
160 people join

567
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,480
the Sword Alliance.

568
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,260
Including those still in line,

569
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,540
there are 200 more.

570
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
You can leave.

571
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,640
Our Sword Alliance

572
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,170
welcomes talented people,

573
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,830
but we don't accept just anyone

574
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,690
looking for free food and drinks.

575
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,810
That's not quite right.

576
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,610
I may be a nobody,

577
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,260
but I never cheat for food.

578
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,720
No sect, no martial arts skills.

579
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,690
[Master of Fate]
[Divine Fortune Teller]

580
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,110
If you don't mooch around
and cheat for a living,

581
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,240
what else can you do?

582
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,970
You really don't recognize me?

583
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,320
Should we know you?

584
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,640
Are we supposed to?

585
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
No, no.

586
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,410
Good.

587
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,060
Since we're strangers,

588
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,710
let me tell your fortune.

589
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,450
What's going on?

590
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,230
Senior Zhong.

591
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,550
He's a jianghu con artist.

592
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,680
We'll handle it right away.

593
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,080
Got it!

594
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,240
Li Dayou, 18 years old.

595
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,050
Born in the Year of the Pig.

596
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,110
Wrong.

597
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,680
His surname is Zhang.

598
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,480
Wait.

599
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,700
My birth father's surname was indeed Li.

600
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,750
It was after my mother remarried

601
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,440
that I changed my surname.

602
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,640
How did you know that?

603
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,350
I also know

604
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,210
you had good luck with money today,

605
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,400
but unfortunately,

606
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,030
you lost it all at once.

607
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,270
Wrong.

608
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,000
He made a mistake this morning

609
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,640
and was just fined a month's salary.

610
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
I did find a money pouch.

611
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,960
It's worth more than my monthly salary.

612
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,830
It was you!

613
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,960
So my money pouch

614
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,030
was picked up by you.

615
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,550
Give it back to me now.

616
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,590
I found this.

617
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,550
How can you prove it's yours?

618
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,150
What disgraceful behavior.

619
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,360
I've heard

620
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,400
that the Sword Alliance has welcomed

621
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,060
a Guest of Honor surnamed Tang

622
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,110
and issued a notice.

623
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,200
It states that anyone with a skill,

624
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,330
of good character,

625
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,270
and willing to

626
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,310
resist the Fengliu Shop

627
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,030
and contribute to the cause

628
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,260
can join the Sword Alliance.

629
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,160
Tell me,

630
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,510
I've traveled

631
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,550
over mountains and ridges to get here.

632
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,480
Doesn't that count for something?

633
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,750
The Sword Alliance's announcement
is certainly valid.

634
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,200
Please state your name first.

635
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,130
Thank you, Miss.

636
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,110
My name is Fang Zhou.

637
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,970
Pleased to meet you.

638
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
What's your name?

639
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,920
Fang Zhou.

640
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,790
Fang as in square.

641
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,680
Zhou as in boat.

642
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,510
Do you know

643
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,270
Head Fang of Zhoudi Tower

644
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,880
had the same name?

645
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,000
Well,

646
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,810
there's nothing I can do about it.

647
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,410
My parents gave me this name.

648
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,590
It's my honor
to share the same pronunciation

649
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,070
as Head Fang's name.

650
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,000
Surely Head Fang was generous enough

651
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,750
to tolerate someone like me.

652
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,550
Besides,

653
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,200
Head Fang's "Zhou" means

654
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,350
encompassing the world,

655
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,460
while my "Zhou" is just

656
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,110
a lonely boat drifting

657
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,790
in this vast universe.

658
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,440
Even so,

659
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,630
I kindly advise you

660
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,360
if you meet Mr. Tang,

661
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,560
you'd better

662
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,830
not mention your name.

663
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,550
Why?

664
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,850
Just because my name is also Fang Zhou?

665
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,920
There are countless people
with the same name.

666
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,070
Besides me, there must be

667
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,750
thousands of other Fang Zhous.

668
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,720
Are you saying

669
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,850
Mr. Tang can't stand to see any of them?

670
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,600
Is he really that arbitrary
and domineering?

671
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,510
Yeah.

672
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,160
That's too domineering.

673
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,310
That's so unreasonable.

674
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,160
How is Mr. Tang being arbitrary
and domineering?

675
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,830
You don't know him,

676
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,230
so don't speak nonsense.

677
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,690
This is indeed my fault.

678
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,960
I apologize to you, Miss.

679
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,780
Alright, alright.

680
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,110
We don't stand on ceremony
at the Sword Alliance.

681
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,110
Go get your disciple uniform first.

682
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,400
Thank you very much, Miss.

683
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,030
Don't go! Read my fortune!

684
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,750
Tell my fortune!

685
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,480
Don't rush. Don't rush.

686
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,480
One at a time.

687
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,590
Good.

688
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,790
Obviously,

689
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,850
this is a diagram of human meridians.

690
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,740
So today,

691
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,890
I'll be explaining to everyone

692
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,590
how the modified version

693
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,640
of the Blood Ghost Pill
from the Fengliu Shop

694
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,300
causes harm to the human body.

695
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,070
Of course,
my explanation might be insufficient.

696
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,530
Shen will fill in the gaps.

697
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,180
What's the difference

698
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,590
between the current Blood Ghost Pill

699
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,960
and the poison pill
spread by the Jile Sect

700
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,220
from over a decade ago?

701
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,070
The former is more potent,
and its toxicity is more concealed.

702
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,920
The one who refined the poison pill
is not anyone else

703
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,680
but the current Master

704
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,000
of the Fengliu Shop, Liu Yan.

705
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,960
Fine, fine.

706
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,620
The underworld is giving a lesson
to the upright people.

707
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,070
Indeed, when you live long enough,

708
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,400
you'll see everything.

709
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,590
Among these people,

710
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,240
only Chi Yun and Shen Langhun

711
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,830
fought against people

712
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,960
who took the new Evil Pill.

713
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,490
The poison pill he modified

714
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,550
can make the user's power

715
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,790
increase more than tenfold.

716
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,880
You sneaky fox,

717
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,970
always appearing out of nowhere.

718
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,480
I heard

719
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,200
a fortune teller
joined the Sword Alliance.

720
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,000
Why don't you go see him?

721
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,790
A fortune teller?

722
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,720
I saw you and Shei

723
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,790
whispering by the stream.

724
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,110
I'm saying you should go see him too,

725
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,640
to see if someone as ice-cold as you

726
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,900
can turn into a softie.

727
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,830
It's over. It's over.

728
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,270
It's all over. It's all over.

729
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
You'll soon face a bloody disaster.

730
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,200
How can I avoid it?
Do you have any magic charms?

731
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,000
Magic charms?

732
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,310
Of course not.

733
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,030
Just don't go outside,

734
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,090
and you'll be fine.

735
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,400
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

736
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,530
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

737
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,880
That won't work.

738
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,310
We have to get up at dawn

739
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,880
to practice sword formations.

740
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,750
This was arranged

741
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,880
by Mr. Tang.

742
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,510
He makes you get up at dawn?

743
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,640
-Yes.
-That's right.

744
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,340
Yes.

745
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,990
What is Mr. Tang thinking?

746
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,740
What's on Mr. Tang's mind?

747
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
How would ordinary disciples like us

748
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,960
know?

749
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,310
Could you decipher this for us?

750
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:53,370
Yes.

751
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,070
Please do us a favor.

752
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,830
Please.

753
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,680
Let me try.

754
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,880
If you want to know what's on my mind,

755
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,550
why don't you ask me directly?

756
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,940
-Mr. Tang.
-Mr. Tang.

757
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,230
You haven't paid yet.

758
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,380
Interesting.

759
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,510
Welcome.

760
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,830
Would you like your future read

761
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,430
or your lifespan predicted?

762
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,940
My surname is Fang,
courtesy name Pingzhai,

763
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,790
and nickname Carefree.

764
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,100
So Mr. Carefree Fang,

765
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,290
your profession is fortune-telling?

766
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,320
Just a humble skill.

767
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,000
It's not even one-tenth

768
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,200
of what I've learned.

769
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,910
By the way,

770
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,730
let me formally introduce myself.

771
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,310
My surname is Fang, given name Zhou,

772
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,870
and courtesy name Pingzhai.

773
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,720
Pleased to meet you.

774
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,000
What did you say your name is?

775
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,520
I am

776
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,270
Fang Zhou.

777
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,150
You don't stay in Fallen Shisan Tower.

778
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,710
Why have you come to the Sword Alliance?

779
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,389
You know,
the Sword Alliance is open to all.

780
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,790
If you can come

781
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,190
and Shen can come,

782
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,760
why can't I come?

783
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,630
I also wish to follow the righteous path.

784
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,480
What do you want?

785
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,710
Mr. Tang,

786
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,880
you have a supreme martial art technique

787
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,880
called the Rebirth Scroll.

788
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,070
Endless Secrets of Heaven and Earth,

789
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,280
Liuli Rebirth Scroll.

790
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,080
You've given yourself away.

791
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,320
Chief Fang.

792
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,320
Fallen Shisan Tower.

793
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,840
Chief Fang of Dieban Chonghua.

794
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,540
What do you want with the Rebirth Scroll?

795
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,030
You claim to join the righteous path,

796
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:19,880
yet you're here for

797
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,120
Yique Yinyang's martial arts technique.

798
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,560
I've been exposed.

799
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,150
Why don't you just play along with me

800
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,840
for a while?

801
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,780
But come to think of it,

802
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,760
you possess
Yique Yinyang's martial arts technique,

803
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
and you've become

804
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,890
a Guest of Honor of the Sword Alliance.

805
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,540
Is there a problem?

806
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,300
Forget it.

807
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,320
Since the Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance can't offer it,

808
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,800
I'd like to see

809
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,320
whether Master Liu
from the Fengliu Shop will give it to me.

810
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,380
Stay away from him.

811
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,150
Otherwise,

812
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,760
I'll make sure

813
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,340
you'll get it but won't live to use it.

814
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,360
Mr. Tang, I've read your fortune.

815
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,450
The results are surprising.

816
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,340
You're not a human of this world

817
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,480
but a fox demon.

818
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,090
Then you should also know

819
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,030
that fox demons excel at

820
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,200
gutting humans

821
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,150
and digging out their hearts

822
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,930
to examine them closely

823
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,910
to see if they're loyal or treacherous.

824
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,690
Why is it you again?

825
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,230
We hired you

826
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,630
not to deceive others.

827
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,280
Mr. Tang,

828
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,000
did he

829
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,050
tell you any nonsense?

830
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,190
Ms. Zhong,

831
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,600
long time no see.

832
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,210
Long time no see.

833
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,570
Don't worry, Miss.

834
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,880
Mr. Tang

835
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,950
has found me a good job.

836
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,880
I won't be fortune-telling anymore.

837
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,680
That's right.

838
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,380
A job very suitable for Mr. Fang.

839
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,800
During your time working
at the Service Hall,

840
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,760
I hope you

841
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,030
can think carefully

842
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,490
whether you want to be honest

843
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,600
with me or not.

844
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,190
You want me to do odd jobs?

845
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,190
Do them properly.

846
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,440
When did you return, Ms. Zhong?

847
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,690
About 2 days ago.

848
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,710
Master said you were busy.

849
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,920
If I hadn't seen you
while passing by just now,

850
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,880
I wouldn't have come to bother you again.

851
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,080
Even if we hadn't met,

852
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,810
I would come looking for you anyway.

853
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:04,960
I heard

854
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,530
that you lost your position

855
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,520
as Branch Chief
of the Shanfeng Branch because of me.

856
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,800
I lost my position

857
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,280
because someone else wanted it.

858
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,000
Mr. Tang, you don't need

859
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,930
to take everything upon yourself.

860
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,960
I just

861
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,800
feel it's unfair.

862
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,790
There's no such thing as fair or unfair.

863
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,670
It has always been about

864
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,530
whether others choose you or not.

865
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,630
I think

866
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,150
Master Shao must

867
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,680
have his own difficulties.

868
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,960
Ms. Zhong.

869
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,180
Come with me to a place.

870
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,120
Let's go.

871
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,920
The food is ready.

872
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,050
And the wine is here.

873
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,190
Did you twist your ankle, Miss Shei?

874
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:55,920
Take it easy.

875
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,320
Ms. Zhong.

876
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,230

Why are you so late?

880
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,590
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

881
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,590
Shen and I finished our lessons ages ago.

882
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,430
Those Sword Masters
kept asking us questions.

883
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,270
They asked me.

884
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,150
You couldn't explain it clearly.

885
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:24,630
Ms. Zhong,

886
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:25,980
please sit down.

887

Everyone, let's have a toast.

942
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:03,700
♪ The northern wind hums by my ear ♪

943
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,130
Cheers.

944
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:08,180
♪ Stirring waves between your brows ♪

945
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,960
♪ The flowers scatter in June ♪

946
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,240
♪ I'd rather jump into your soil ♪

947
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:19,880
Ms. Zhong.

948
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,250
Are you unhappy?

949
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,190
No.

950
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,000
I just feel

951
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,330
that it feels like ages

952
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,320
since I last saw everyone.

953
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,150
The last time we went to Sword King City

954
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,480
seems like it happened in a previous life.

955
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,670
I'd like to toast everyone.

956
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,830
No matter how much time passes,

957
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,690
we should always drink together.

958
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,290
You always know what to say.

959
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:13,530
You seem very happy tonight, Ms. Zhong.

960
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,180
Why is it you again?

961
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,710
Do you need something?

962
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,760
I asked you first.

963
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,840
So you should answer me first.

964
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,430
Of course I'm happy.

965
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:23,960
Your turn.

966
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,440
I don't have anything specific.

967
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:25,880
Why?

968
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,490
Can't I chat with you without a reason?

969
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,790
You're so strange.

970
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,760
If you came to the Sword Alliance

971
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,090
with other intentions,

972
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,250
I suggest

973
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,420
you leave now.

974
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,970
You're quite perceptive.

975
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,230
Fine.

976
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,390
I'll tell you.

977
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,480
I came to the Sword Alliance

978
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,960
to see

979
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,110
the true face of the fox demon.

980
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,590
Why?

981
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:53,820
Why?

982
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:55,760
Because...

983
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,290
Mr. Tang is indeed detestable and hateful,

984
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,960
but I must admit

985
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,000
that he does have a captivating charm.

986
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,150
It makes one unable to resist

987
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,000
falling deeply for him.

988
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,280
You dare to provoke Mr. Tang?

989
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,510
Aren't you afraid
that you'll bring disaster upon yourself?

990
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,880
It's the danger that makes it attractive.

991
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:19,880
You

992
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,210
understand this feeling best, don't you?

993
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,240
What are you talking about?

994
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,280
What I want to say is,

995
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,960
to get his attention,

996
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,520
you can't follow the ordinary path.

997
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,760
You need to be the most special person.

998
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,920
Don't let yourself need him;

999
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,690
make him need you instead.

1000
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,300
What's between Mr. Tang and me

1001
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,480
is none of your business.

1002
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,510
To be honest,

1003
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,240
I've read your fortune too.

1004
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,840
Your destiny shows weak family bonds

1005
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:57,510
and no power or wealth.

1006
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,630
What others are born with,

1007
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,230
you must fight desperately to obtain—

1008
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,630
only then might you stand a slim chance
of getting it.

1009
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:05,490
If you miss just one opportunity,

1010
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,320
you'll lose everything.

1011
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,440
Mr. Fang, do you think

1012
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,260
I would believe your words?

1013
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,170
It doesn't matter if you don't.

1014
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,230
But if I were you,

1015
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,440
with such a fate,

1016
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,480
I would contentedly

1017
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,880
be an ordinary disciple

1018
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,320
and marry a simple, honest man.

1019
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,370
Why struggle for more?

1020
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,320
What if I insist on struggling?

1021
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,960
Then I can help you.

1022
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,320
I don't need it.

1023
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,920
Think carefully,

1024
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,170
Ms. Zhong.

1025
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,770
A letter from Shisan Tower.

1026
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,650
The Peach of Three Hues in Pink Attire.

1027
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,190
She is Xifang Tao.

1028
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,350
Hand it to Godfather personally.

1029
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,370
Bring back his reply.

1030
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:57,020
Aren't you going
to ask what this is about?

1031
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,080
I don't have Chi Yun's curiosity.

1032
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,630
The more you know,

1033
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,090
the sooner you die.

1034
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,210
Sometimes,

1035
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,320
the more you know,

1036
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,280
the better your chances.

1037
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,320
Fang Pingzhai,

1038
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,000
your true identity

1039
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,480
is about to be revealed.
