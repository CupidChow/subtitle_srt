[Episode 16]

3
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,640
To refine the Mystical Frost

4
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,000
to such an extent...

5
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,350
Palace Chief Wanyu

6
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,710
is really something.

7
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,680
Don't move.

8
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,310
Plucking a lone withering plum blossom
while drunk...

9
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,570
Such sword essence...

10
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,330
is quite interesting.

11
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,740
There are also traps here.

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,919
We'll meet stronger Mystical Frost

13
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,050
as we go further.

14
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,240
This wall of ice

15
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,710
is actually air

16
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,570
condensed by the Mystical Frost.

17
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
In return, this ice wall

18
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,520
prevents the cold air from dissipating,

19
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,829
and thus makes this place

20
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,290
even more bone-chilling.

21
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,380
Palace Chief Wanyu's design

22
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,190
is indeed quite ingenious.

23
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,520
That is to say,
if we break this wall of ice,

24
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,440
the Mystical Frost you mentioned

25
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,520
will be emitted.

26
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,480
But if we don't break it,

27
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,570
we'll be trapped here till we die.

28
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,780
Bixiao Pearl is on you.

29
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,520
As long as you're not injured,

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,240
such coldness can't threaten your life.

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,840
But what about you, Mr. Tang?

32
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,240
Just take care of yourself.

33
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,260
Take the pearl

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,600
and step back.

35
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,880
When too much edge is revelaed,

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,060
one become brittle and break easily.

37
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,120
The ice sword formed by sword essence

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,410
is precisely the most vulnerable part

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,680
of this ice wall.

40
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,130
The last one.

41
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,360
So this is what you meant by

42
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,290
Mystical Frost.

43
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,010
Mr. Tang!

44
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,640
Stay back.

45
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,750
Just one move away from triumph.

46
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,080
But it's fine.

47
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,990
Consider it as

48
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,320
paying you back.

49
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,600

51

What should I do?

52
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,440
What should I do?

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,230
yet he still dares to come here.

191
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,030
Palace Chief,

192
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,760
please give your orders.

193
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,670
[Taixiao Hall of Biluo Palace]

194
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,150
Aren't you going to knock, sir?

195
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,750
I am Tang Lici,

196
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,400
Master of Wanqiao Chamber.

197
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,510
Of course

198
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,250
I wait for them to come out and greet me.

199
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,270
Tang Lici.

200
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,260
You're truly audacious,

201
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,390
daring to return here to meet your end.

202
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,450
Steward Bi.

203
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,130
Long time no see.

204
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,000
I, Tang Lici,

205
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,600
request an audience with the chief
of Biluo Palace.

206
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,460
The Palace Chief wants to see you.

207
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,050
Mr. Tang.

208
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,240
Chi and Shen

209
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,830
are still freezing outside.

210
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,830
Shouldn't we ask the Palace Chief
to let them in first?

211
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,920
Biluo Palace doesn't welcome outsiders.

212
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,120
Chi Yun and the others

213
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,140
might have to

214
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,120
endure the cold a bit longer.

215
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,010
But don't worry.

216
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
Their martial skills are profound.

217
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,730
If the Biluo Palace

218
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,550
doesn't welcome outsiders,

219
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,440
we...

220
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,180
You are criminals.

221
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,910
Biluo Palace is untainted
by the mundane world.

222
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,240
Please change your clothes first.

223
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,170
The Palace Chief

224
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,360
will personally interrogate both of you.

225
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,040
This way.

226
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,200
I, Tang Lici,

227
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,620
pay my respects to Palace Chief Wanyu.

228
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,750
I, Shei,

229
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,430
pay my respects to the Palace Chief.

230
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,620
You seem surprised.

231
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,810
What surprises you more now is

232
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,630
how I could know this.

233
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,940
I just didn't expect that...

234
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,480
That the Chief of Biluo Palace

235
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,340
would be blind.

236
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,480
I apologize.

237
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,120
Don't feel sorry for me.

238
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,800
I'm used to it.

239
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,430
I've been blind since childhood

240
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,550
but mastered a unique skill.

241
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,760
I cannot see objects

242
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,780
but I can perceive energy.

243
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,870
I can also sense

244
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,320
subtle changes in light.

245
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,320
Most remarkably,

246
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,060
I can sense others' emotional states,

247
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,840
doubt,

248
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,940
suspicion,

249
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,050
and fear.

250
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,670
Any intense emotions,

251
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,000
I can feel them all.

252
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,320
You have a gentle
and straightforward nature.

253
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
So naturally,

254
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,000
I can easily read you.

255
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,440
Right now,

256
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,040
you should be more concerned

257
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,960
about your friend.

258
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,660
You knew I would certainly see you.

259
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,840
Of course.

260
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,550
Four years ago,

261
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,080
the Immortal Crystal Coffin
of the former Palace Chief

262
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,240
was stolen by me.

263
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,230
If you don't see me,

264
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,520
how will you recover the coffin?

265
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,240
Even the mighty Yique Yinyang

266
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,100
can face moments of desperation.

267
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,480
You want to return the coffin

268
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,880
in exchange for Biluo Palace's protection.

269
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,380
Biluo Palace's intelligence

270
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,840
travels remarkably fast.

271
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,950
I have several friends

272
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,310
waiting outside.

273
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,270
I request that the Palace Chief

274
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,730
allow them to enter first.

275
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,400
Everyone knows

276
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,950
Biluo Palace doesn't welcome outsiders.

277
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,440
Stealing the former Palace Chief's coffin

278
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,720
is already a deadly offence.

279
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,520
Yet you still want to negotiate
with Biluo Palace?

280
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,350
Don't you

281
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,880
want to properly

282
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,830
bury your father?

283
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
You dare threaten the Palace Chief?

284
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,510
Biluo Palace

285
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,600
never welcomes outsiders.

286
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,830
I'm afraid even if we wait here

287
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,290
for three days and nights,

288
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,780
they still won't open the door.

289
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,460
Has Tang Lici really died,

290
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,110
or was he swept away

291
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,600
by the Celestial River glacier

292
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,800
and couldn't return?

293
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,110
I've been saying all along

294
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,970
that we should look for Foxy Tang.

295
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,480
Master Cheng,

296
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,070
I'll be taking my leave now.

297
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,010
Where are you going to find him?

298
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,550
Along the lower reaches, of course.

299
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,070
Chi.

300
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,520
-Junior.
-How about...

301
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,810
What did you just call him?

302
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,490
Bandit Chi.

303
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,350
Let's stay here for the night.

304
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,750
If Thief Tang hasn't returned
by tomorrow,

305
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,310
we can look for him then.

306
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,280
Very good.

307
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,920
Go over there and recite

308
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,850
Rule number 11 of Camellia Island.

309
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,030
Recite it 20 times.

310
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,800
Say it out loud.

311
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,310
Senior.

312
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,030
30 times.

313
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,000
Rule number 11 of Camellia Island.

314
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,920
Good and evil cannot coexist.

315
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,580
One must maintain integrity.

316
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,650
If encountered...

317
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,240
Encountered...

318
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,310
Yu Furen?

319
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,020
What are you saying?

320
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,720
Senior.

321
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,300
Someone's coming.

322
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,280
Master Cheng.

323
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,210
Yique Yinyang's accomplice?

324
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,830
Where is the criminal, Tang Lici?

325
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,070
He fell into the Celestial River

326
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,240
and disappeared without a trace.

327
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,490
The water of Celestial River
is freezing cold,

328
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,210
making it impossible to search underwater.

329
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,400
If you can't find

330
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,750
who you're looking for here,

331
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,790
you might as well go down the mountain

332
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,880
and search along the river.

333
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,940
If that's the case,

334
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,350
why are you still lingering here,
Island Master?

335
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,550
I'm here to visit the Chief
of Biluo Palace.

336
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,160
Then why are those two

337
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,620
also standing guard here?

338
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,460
Everyone.

339
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,880
The Yique Yinyang, Tang Lici,

340
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,740
have vanished.

341
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,790
Why don't we

342
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,930
stay where we are

343
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,020
and take a rest?

344
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,350
Keep Master Cheng company

345
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,750
and wait here for a while.

346
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,350
Biluo Palace has at least

347
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,550
fifty-three methods

348
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,160
to make you surrender the crystal coffin.

349
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,340
I don't think

350
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,810
you can last until the sixth one.

351
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,280
Palace Chief may have ten thousand ways

352
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,240
to kill me.

353
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,030
But among them,

354
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,290
there is absolutely no method

355
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,060
that will allow your father

356
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,480
to rest in peace.

357
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,600
You're truly capable.

358
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,640
Four years ago,

359
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,710
you stole the crystal coffin
from Biluo Palace.

360
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,480
Now even the Mystical Frost of Mount Maoya

361
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,610
cannot contain you.

362
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,880
However,

363
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,030
do you think I would believe

364
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,720
a fugitive hunted by

365
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,980
everyone in the world?

366
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
Outside these walls,

367
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,790
there is the Master of Camellia Island

368
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,000
from the Sword Alliance, Cheng Yunpao,

369
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,200
who is hunting for me.

370
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Even though Biluo Palace remains secluded
from the world

371
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,180
and stays neutral among the good and evil,

372
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,880
regardless of whether you intend

373
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,240
to protect me

374
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,510
or punish me,

375
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,350
shouldn't you

376
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,590
first give the Sword Alliance

377
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,520
an explanation?

378
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,240
You're negotiating with me now?

379
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,030
I only hope

380
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,200
you can make a decision quickly,
Palace Chief.

381
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,860
Because...

382
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,310
Time is running out.

383
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,520
The Sword Alliance and Fengliu Shop

384
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,000
have encountered each other
at the entrance of Biluo Palace.

385
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,310
I'm afraid

386
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,240
your days of staying out of jianghu

387
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,850
are coming to an end.

388
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,740
You're Xifang Tao,

389
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,350
from Fengliu Shop.

390
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,830
Master Cheng,

391
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,990
you still remember me?

392
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,510
May I ask if Mr. Tang

393
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,200
has already entered Biluo Palace?

394
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,730
Why waste so many words on him?

395
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,720
Central Plains Sword Alliance.

396
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,590
Kill them all!

397
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,170
Comes ashore once every ten years,

398
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,630
the camellias enter reincarnation.

399
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,620
Who am I fighting against?

400
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,000
What are you all standing there for?

401
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,680
Kill them!

402
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,270
Fucui.

403
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,670
A single tune can halt the killing.

404
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,880
Do you dare to attack?

405
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,590
If we show

406
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,320
even a hint of fighting spirit,

407
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,200
this peaceful melody

408
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
will transform into Sound Killing.

409
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,000
Tang Lici.

410
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,510
So you are here after all.

411
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,240
Foxy Tang.

412
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,850
You didn't freeze to death?

413
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,980
You even got inside?

414
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,400
Well, that's great.

415
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,030
Quick, ask the Palace Chief
to open the gate

416
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,830
and let us in.

417
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,660
Biluo Palace has formed an alliance
with Tang Lici.

418
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,660
What should we do?

419
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,020
Biluo Palace has always remained neutral.

420
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,510
We cannot allow conflict to happen
in front of us

421
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,140
and just stand by doing nothing.

422
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,590
You deliberately brought both forces

423
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,550
to Biluo Palace.

424
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,400
Then you openly helped the Sword Alliance
with your qin music.

425
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,240
This way, Fengliu Shop

426
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,310
will surely believe
that I have allied with you

427
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,920
and the Sword Alliance.

428
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,750
So you can naturally force me

429
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,480
to get involved in this matter.

430
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,030
By order of the Palace Chief,

431
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,160
Master Cheng and other member

432
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,960
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

433
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,090
are invited as guests to Biluo Palace.

434
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,480
Is Biluo Palace

435
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,510
trying to go against

436
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,280
the Fengliu Shop?

437
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,340
I advise you.

438
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,240
Before making any threats,

439
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,240
first consider your own abilities.

440
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,090
Beneath the Celestial River,

441
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,110
there are plenty of corpses.

442
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,680
Bastard!

443
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,480
Stay if you dare!

444
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,450
Just wait.

445
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,350
You still owe me two slaps.

446
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:12,920
Yu.

447
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,920
Come inside with us.

448
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,460
Tang Lici.

449
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,960
For the murder of my master,

450
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,220
we will never coexist.

451
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,000
I, Yu Furen,

452
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,040
would rather die than accept charity.

453
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,000
Today,

454
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,970
even if it costs my life,

455
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,270
Sword King City will stand in the way

456
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,200
of Fengliu Shop.

457
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,680
Do you know how much
your martial arts skills

458
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,280
are inferior to Tang Lici's?

459
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,300
Someone who truly wants revenge

460
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
will endure pain,

461
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,880
live like an insect,

462
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,040
crawl through the mud,

463
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,410
and squirm to survive,

464
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,480
to look for a chance
to crawl into the elephant's ear

465
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,800
and give it a fatal blow.

466
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,430
At least

467
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,820
make your enemies suffer.

468
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,840
Shen is doing this for your own good.

469
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,770
Let's go inside.

470
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,400
No need.

471
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,580
Yu.

472
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,410
Wait for me.

473
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,160
Miss Xifang.

474
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,480
In this situation,

475
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,160
would you prefer to leave on your own,

476
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,960
or shall I escort you out myself?

477
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,040
Mr. Tang.

478
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,280
Since our hasty parting last time,

479
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,680
I have missed you dearly.

480
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,720
I wonder if Mr. Tang

481
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,050
stills remember me?

482
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,880
Miss Xifang.

483
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,020
You left a deep impression on me

484
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,110
and made me think of you constantly.

485
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,110
I dare not forget.

486
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,800
Mr. Tang, you have extraordinary talents.

487
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,830
You've even managed

488
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,790
to make Biluo Palace,
which never welcomes outsiders,

489
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,250
made an exception for you.

490
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,850
I dare to ask.

491
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,080
Is your request for us to leave

492
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,540
Palace Chief Wanyu's intention?

493
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,280
What do you want to say?

494
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,350
I am the Palace Chief of the West Palace
of Fengliu Shop,

495
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,190
Xifang Tao.

496
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,320
This is Fucui, the Palace Chief
of the East Palace.

497
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,780
On behalf of Fengliu Shop,

498
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,690
we request an audience
with Palace Chief Wanyu.

499
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,410
We kindly ask Palace Chief Wanyu

500
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,140
to make an exception for us too.

501
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,440
You are quite graceful.

502
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,680
To refuse you

503
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,380
would seem discourteous.

504
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,770
However, the rules of Biluo Palace

505
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,030
must still be observed.

506
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,920
Of course.

507
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,610
No fighting within the palace.

508
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,480
Violators will be imprisoned.

509
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,160
Killers will be executed.

510
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,140
I'll remember that.

511
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,610
This way, Miss.

512
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,830
Mr. Tang.

513
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,390
Do you think

514
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
you can really manipulate

515
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,790
my thoughts?

516
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,710
How can you, Palace Chief Wanyu,

517
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,440
be under my control?

518
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,440
A worthy opponent

519
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,430
makes the game interesting,

520
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,650
don't you agree?

521
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,750
This is the Xuantian Rope

522
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,480
that leads to the Biluo Palace.

523
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,700
If you fall from the cliff,

524
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,350
there's no chance of survival.

525
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,360
Those who lack confidence
in their lightness skills,

526
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,020
please wait at the front hall.

527
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,790
What was your purpose

528
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,480
in telling me all those things

529
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,590
just now?

530
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:54,920
Because...

531
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,980
I like the fire of hatred in your eyes.

532
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,130
It is just like mine.

533
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:16,870
Everyone.

534
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
This way, please.

535
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,030
Why are these scoundrels

536
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,830
also allowed into Biluo Palace?

537
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,940
The Palace Chief has invited them as well,

538
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,670
so they are just like all of you,

539
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,050
guests of Biluo Palace.

540
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,570
It's getting late.

541
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,160
I invite you all to stay
at the Zixiao Courtyard

542
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,960
for the night.

543
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,920
The fellow jianghu members

544
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,980
who couldn't cross the Xuantian Rope

545
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,240
have been accommodated in shelters
in the city.

546
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,200
Regarding tonight's rules,

547
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,600
I will only say this once,

548
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,330
so please listen carefully.

549
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,120
One.

550
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,920
No killing is allowed within Biluo Palace.

551
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,850
If anyone kills,

552
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,070
it will be considered an offense
against Biluo Palace.

553
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,330
They will be executed.

554
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,790
Two.

555
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,440
Tonight, there will be people

556
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,030
patrolling in the Zixiao Courtyard.

557
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,750
During the patrol,

558
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,440
no fighting should be discovered.

559
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,300
If discovered,

560
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,160
you will be imprisoned.

561
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:02,950
Three.

562
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,950
Early tomorrow morning,

563
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,830
the Palace Chief will meet

564
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,290
with one person among you.

565
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,530
Who will the Palace Chief meet?

566
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,480
Who will it be?

567
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,610
The Palace Chief will decide tomorrow.

568
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,330
Fighting is forbidden in the palace.

569
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,000
But throwing a punch is fine, right?

570
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,460
If you lay hands on people,

571
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,180
you must repay double.

572
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,270
If I slap him once,

573
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,780
and get two slaps in return,

574
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,510
is that fine?

575
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,440
That's two slaps already.

576
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,370
No more hitting.

577
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,870
Chi, are you alright?

578
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
That slap just now

579
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,660
was what you owed me.

580
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,750
What are you trying to prove?

581
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,590
Biluo Palace remains untainted
by worldly dust.

582
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,810
Before entering the palace,

583
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,410
please change your clothes.

584
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,150
Male guests, please follow me.

585
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,310
Miss,

586
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,460
female guests are to head this way
for clothes changing.

587
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,830
Yu, let's go.

588
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,290
This is your residence.

589
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,650
Where are our other companions?

590
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,070
I'm only responsible for guiding you here.

591
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,400
Each room is arranged for two people only.

592
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,550
Why?

593
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,480
Steward Bi instructed us

594
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,360
to arrange everyone this way.

595
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,050
Wait for me in the room.

596
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,390
I'll go find the others.

597
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,780
Thank you for escorting us, Steward.

598
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,740
Where are the others?

599
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,680
They have seven people

600
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,910
while you only have five.

601
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,310
This seems unfair to you.

602
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,400
Hence, Young Master asked me
to deliver a few words.

603
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:01,810
Wanyu Yuedan.

604
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,000
If you have something to say,
come out and say it yourself.

605
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,640
Sending a servant to deliver messages?

606
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,700
Are you looking down on the Fengliu Shop?

607
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,160
Because of your rudeness,

608
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,960
I'll withhold some information.

609
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,350
You!

610
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,410
Cui,

611
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,300
could you please be more respectful?

612
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,120
I apologize.

613
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,570
What did you want to tell us, Steward?

614
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,270
The Palace Chief doesn't just
look at results,

615
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,640
but also at your performance.

616
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,070
You two

617
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,570
should find your companions quickly.

618
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,750
Thank you, Palace Chief, for the advice.

619
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,410
Although it's missing a line,

620
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,000
it's sufficient.

621
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,370
No, what do you mean?

622
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,420
Have you forgotten

623
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,110
that we came here

624
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,260
to kill Tang Lici and his people?

625
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,000
Outside the city,

626
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,110
your hesitation was tolerable.

627
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,570
But now,

628
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,030
we've entered Biluo Palace.

629
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,350
No,

630
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,320
can't you tell?

631
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,920
Tang Lici and Wanyu Yuedan

632
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,380
are all working together.

633
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,020
What are we doing here?

634
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,740
To die?

635
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,470
Fucui.

636
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,280
Who told you

637
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,070
that Tang Lici

638
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,560
and Wanyu Yuedan are allies?

639
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,600
How are they not allies?

640
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,190
The two of them

641
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,710
were standing together on the city wall.

642
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,860
They even let them in.

643
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,320
If they truly were allies,

644
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,510
why did

645
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:16,960
Wanyu Yuedan

646
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,320
let us in?

647
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,389
Oh, Fucui.

648
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,030
Haven't you realized

649
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,440
Tang Lici's plot yet?

650
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,400
Plot?

651
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,920
Impossible.

652
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,550
There's no plot.

653
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,360
Wanyu Yuedan opened the gates

654
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,230
just to help Tang Lici

655
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,360
and his people.

656
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,400
If Palace Chief Wanyu

657
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,000
had saved Chi and the others,

658
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,440
why did he

659
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,670
separate us?

660
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:03,850
Perhaps

661
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,590
he doesn't want to be manipulated by me.

662
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,620
Mr. Tang,

663
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,930
you're being too reckless.

664
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,000
What?

665
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,330
Aren't you used to it yet?

666
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,070
Then

667
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,580
what should we do next?

668
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,830
Let's wait for Chi Yun and Shen Langhun

669
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,910
to find us first.

670
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,220
There are many rooms here.

671
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,330
Not only do they all look the same,

672
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,330
but they're scattered everywhere.

673
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,650
Can Chi Yun

674
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,140
and the others find us?

675
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,730
Shen Langhun

676
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,860
is an expert at stealth and searching.

677
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,840
In Sword King City,

678
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,300
he can move around freely.

679
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,760
They could possibly

680
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,000
be at our door already.

681
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,440
Look.

682
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,200
I'm right, aren't I?

683
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,880
Foxy Tang.

684
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,550
What do we need to do now?

685
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,920
What's even going on?

686
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,420
Before we do anything,

687
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,320
keep this safe first.

688
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,960
What is this?

689
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,040
Jade Toad Scar-Soothing Gel.

690
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,070
For external use.

691
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,440
Good brother.

692
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:35,900
The story

693
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:36,960
goes back to

694
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
after the battle at Sword King City.

695
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,190
After I took Yu Qifeng's

696
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,840
Westwind Slashing Wildfire attack,

697
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,240
Master Puzhu rescued me.

698
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:45,940
It was just at

699
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,000
that bamboo house where you found me.

700
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,130
What kind of agreement?

701
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,490
Biluo Palace.

702
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,170
As long as you let me take my leave,

703
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,010
I, Tang,

704
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:58,870
would find a way

705
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,670
to introduce the Sword Alliance

706
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,340
to form an alliance with Biluo Palace

707
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,600
against Fengliu Shop.

708
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,540
Years ago, the Sword Alliance

709
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,080
have sent people to contact them,

710
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,140
but they all returned empty-handed,

711
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,690
not even getting to meet

712
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,850
Palace Chief Wanyu.

713
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,740
How will you make the introduction?

714
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,600
Four years ago,

715
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,630
I stole the Immortal Crystal Coffin

716
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,540
of the former Palace Chief

717
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,830
from the Biluo Palace.

718
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,210
If Palace Chief Wanyu

719
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,570
wants to retrieve his ancestor's coffin,

720
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,840
he'll have no choice

721
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,920
but to see me.

722
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,520
Fengliu Shop has deep connections

723
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,560
and many spies.

724
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,280
If the news of the Sword Alliance

725
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,000
planning to unite

726
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,730
with Biluo Palace were to leak,

727
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,270
Fengliu Shop would certainly intervene.

728
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,450
They might even

729
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,630
send people

730
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,800
to beat us to it

731
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,360
and try to form an alliance with them.

732
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,150
I am now

733
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,080
a suspect in Yique Yinyang's case.

734
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,670
The Sword Alliance

735
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,800
can take this chance

736
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,650
of me heading to the Biluo Palace

737
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,520
to send envoys

738
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,390
pretending to pursue me.

739
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,030
This will

740
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,010
throw others off the scent.

741
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,800
Once I reach the Biluo Palace,

742
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,320
I, Tang,

743
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,110
will find a way to introduce the Emissary

744
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,760
to Palace Chief Wanyu.

745
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,210
At that time,

746
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,070
it will depend on

747
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,320
whether the Sword Alliance has a way

748
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,790
to convince Palace Chief Wanyu

749
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,990
to join forces against Fengliu Shop.

750
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,800
That's right.

751
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,550
For all these years, Biluo Palace

752
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,070
has avoided all contact
with people of the jianghu.

753
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,960
I see they've been living

754
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,820
quite the life.

755
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,230
How can you be so sure

756
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,570
they'll cooperate with the Sword Alliance?

757
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,550
Because

758
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,760
the former Palace Chief's
Immortal Crystal Coffin

759
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,510
is empty.

760
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,410
What?

761
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,090
As per your instructions, Palace Chief,

762
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,760
the guests have been settled,
two per room,

763
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,550
throughout the Zixiao Courtyard.

764
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,680
We will not be buried

765
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,840
until we return to our homeland.

766
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,990
The Wanyu lineage

767
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,230
must returning to the Central Plains.

768
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,030
Palace Chief.

769
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,540
Yique Yinyang is dead.

770
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,900
The former dynasty has fallen.

771
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,490
The Wanyu lineage
returning to the Central Plains

772
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,090
is just a matter of decision.

773
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,640
As for whether we'll cooperate
with Fengliu Shop

774
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,440
or ally with the Sword Alliance,

775
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,970
that depends on their performance.

776
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,690
As heaven moves, the stars follow,

777
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,360
like shadows following form.

778
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,730
When you found the coffin was empty,

779
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,800
you guessed

780
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,280
the former Palace Chief

781
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,940
wanted to return to his roots.

782
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,560
After meeting Palace Chief Wanyu,

783
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,010
I became even more certain

784
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,090
of my suspicions.

785
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,440
Don't you

786
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,530
want to

787
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,230
bury your father?

788
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,440
You're even trying to threaten me?

789
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,480
Hey, Foxy Tang,

790
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,760
what's going on

791
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,110
in that head of yours?

792
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,960
How can you come up

793
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,560
with such convoluted ideas?

794
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,990
It's just that

795
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,750
the path back to the Central Plains

796
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,540
isn't limited to just one route.

797
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,840
But Wanyu Yuedan
has brought Fengliu Shop

798
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,300
into Biluo Palace as well.

799
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,360
Does he want to work with Fengliu Shop?

800
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,370
Winners become kings, losers are outlaws.

801
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,360
Rather than joining the side
that will fail,

802
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,090
Why don't you

803
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,860
bet on the right winner?

804
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,400
Biluo Palace

805
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,510
has always been strictly managed

806
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,610
and doesn't allow outsiders in.

807
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,800
What does he want to do here?

808
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,550
And how can he guarantee

809
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,110
that Biluo Palace

810
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,090
will welcome him with open doors?

811
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,480
And why did Cheng Yunpao

812
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,320
come after him?

813
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,000
Should we notify

814
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,530
that stubborn Cheng Yunpao

815
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,030
to pull some strings

816
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,960
or do something?

817
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,000
So, Senior

818
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,010
didn't come to arrest Mr. Tang?

819
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,010
To prevent leaks,

820
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,580
only the Sword Master,

821
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,380
Master Puzhu,

822
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,580
and I know about this.

823
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,360
You're too honest.

824
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,390
I was afraid you'll give us away.

825
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,510
Then why did you

826
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,980
try to capture Mr. Tang outside the city?

827
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:18,880
With him captured,

828
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,440
we could bring him to Biluo Palace

829
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,700
and use him as leverage

830
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,110
to gain an audience
with Palace Chief Wanyu.

831
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:24,670
This way,

832
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,070
it would be more legitimate.

833
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,850
Then why would Mr. Tang run away?

834
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:28,710
Did he even run?

835
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,750
He was just traveling with me.

836
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,420
Cheng Yunpao's goal

837
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,930
was never Tang Lici at all.

838
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,590
Tang Lici was just a pretext,

839
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,990
providing a pathway

840
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,290
while he sneaks in unnoticed.

841
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,820
Allowing Cheng Yunpao into Biluo Palace.

842
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:44,940
is the real objective.
