[Whispers of Fate]

2
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,940
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,480
Someone has been there

4
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:31,950
and

5
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,479
come back alive.

6
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,120
Who?

7
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,680
No need to say any more.

8
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,600
I know the answer.

9
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,259
Why did you go to Biluo Palace?

10
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,890
To steal something.

11
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,810
You stole from Biluo Palace?

12
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,490
What did you steal?

13
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,120
A coffin.

14
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,750
Why would you steal a coffin?

15
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,960
I needed it for myself.

16
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,200
Where is the coffin you stole?

17
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,030
Tell me about it.

18
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,690
I can put you in it when you die.

19
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,460
To reach Biluo Palace,

20
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,560
we'll have to take
either the western or the southern route.

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,810
There are pursuers on the southern route.

22
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,470
They won't make it easy for us.

23
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,170
It's not a tough choice, is it?

24
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,120
Let's just take the western route.

25
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,310
That's a dead end.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,520
Why?

27
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,540
Because of the Bone Desert.

28
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,630
Foxy Tang,

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,310
didn't you say
the western route was a dead end?

30
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,170
Why are we still heading this way?

31
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,680
Down the cliff near Biluo Palace,

32
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,800
there's a hidden cave

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,430
leading straight

34
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,230
to Taixiao Hall of Biluo Palace.

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,079
Only I know

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,820
how to navigate this path.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
Why do those in Fengliu Shop

38
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,840
know

39
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,540
your final destination is Biluo Palace?

40
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,700
How may I address you?

41
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,100
Ghostly Peony.

42
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,770
Hope to see you again.

43
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,000
Goodbye,

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,030
Mr. Foxy Tang.

45
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,020
How much do you know

46
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,720
about Biluo Palace?

47
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,270
I've heard something about it.

48
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,400
The palace chief is surnamed "Wanyu."

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,780
He keeps a low profile,

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,170
but never misses a target
when he strikes.

51
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,680
He's an exceptionally
intelligent and resourceful

52
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,540
man of mystery.

53
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,630
What about you, Shen?

54
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,840
Shisan Tower got

55
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,880
more detailed information than that.

56
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,680
Biluo Palace
was originally located in Luoshui,

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,420
and had no dealings
with the central martial arts world.

58
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,510
In the reign of the former emperor,

59
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,050
the Wanyu clan
was the most prominent family

60
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,110
beneath the royalty.

61
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,120
They excelled in astronomy and geography,

62
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,340
with unmatched skills to perform prayers
and rites to avert the evil.

63
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,960
They were highly valued
by the previous emperor.

64
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,030
For 200 years,

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,360
they occupied the position
of Imperial Preceptor.

66
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,870
The imperial favor they received

67
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,079
was unparalleled in history.

68
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,000
Wasn't the previous Imperial Preceptor

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,960
Yique Yinyang?

70
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,430
Thirty years ago,

71
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,350
the then Imperial Preceptor Wanyu Moru

72
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,030
recommended to the late emperor

73
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,120
a young man

74
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,340
with extraordinary talents,

75
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,910
saying that this person

76
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,280
had a brilliant governing mind

77
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,910
and could bring peace and prosperity
to the country.

78
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,680
This young man

79
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,480
said his name was Yique Yinyang.

80
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,150
He was not only skilled in martial arts,

81
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,310
but also eloquent, articulate,

82
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,030
and adept at inducing hallucinations

83
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,560
to bewitch people's minds.

84
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,330
The former emperor
followed his every word.

85
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,750
It took him less than a year

86
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,680
to win over the late emperor's heart.

87
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,630
But shockingly,

88
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,720
after gaining trust,

89
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,829
Yique Yinyang framed Wanyu Moru,

90
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,360
his referrer, for treason.

91
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,120
He not only replaced the latter
as the Imperial Preceptor,

92
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,630
but also acted perversely,

93
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,480
as he abetted the former emperor

94
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,350
into pursuing immortality.

95
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,710
In addition, he adopted many children,

96
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,600
and secretly trained them

97
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,100
to be his followers.

98
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,560
Of course,

99
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,600
among all the crimes

100
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,060
Yique Yinyang committed,

101
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,250
that was the most insignificant one.

102
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
Upon becoming the Imperial Preceptor,

103
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,490
Yique Yinyang had even greater power.

104
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,130
He released Evil Pills,

105
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,480
killed the innocent,

106
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,210
and eliminated his opponents.

107
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,870
He also collected treasures everywhere

108
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,750
and built four Sky-Ascending Pillars

109
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,000
with blood and flesh.

110
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,380
He was an unscrupulous
squanderer and evildoer

111
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,510
who plunged the country into chaos.

112
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,600
I do know

113
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,010
that Yique Yinyang built

114
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,630
four Sky-Ascending Pillars.

115
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,560
From my perspective,

116
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,360
those are just

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,200
ordinary bronze pillars, aren't they?

118
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,070
Perhaps...

119
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,770
he did intend to ascend the sky.

120
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,560
For what?

121
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,220
A chat with immortals?

122
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,960
Possibly.

123
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,160
So,

124
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,560
Wanyu Moru

125
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,800
left Jiangnan

126
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,270
in despair,

127
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,580
and built a new Biluo Palace here.

128
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,560
I've noticed...

129
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,440
that sometimes,

130
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,000
you're quite smart.

131
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,560
And I've noticed that you're irritating

132
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,620
in most of the time.

133
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,240
Being condemned

134
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,480
for recommending Yique Yinyang,

135
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,680
Biluo Palace decided

136
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,159
to stay clear of jianghu.

137
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,390
It thus became
the most mysterious organization

138
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,850
in the martial arts world.

139
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,750
Wait a minute.

140
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,210
Yique Yinyang and Biluo Palace
are enemies.

141
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,360
You've been framed

142
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,830
for have connections with Yique Yinyang.

143
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,960
You've also stolen from Biluo Palace.

144
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,720
Isn't going there equal to

145
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,180
getting yourself killed?

146
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,270
Chi Yun,

147
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,280
has it never occurred to you

148
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,650
that perhaps...

149
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,040
I really am Yique Yinyang?

150
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,360
Anyway,

151
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,580
you can't be Yique Yinyang,

152
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,710
who brought disasters to the country.

153
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,310
Besides,

154
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,680
those golden eyes
and forehead mark of yours

155
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
look pretty nice.

156
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,270
What exactly did you

157
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,870
make this walking stick for?

158
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,670
I'm injured.

159
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,270
To cross the Bone Desert,

160
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,490
I need a walking stick for support.

161
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,830
After all that careful selection,

162
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,270
you had me cut down this tree.

163
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,430
Then you just spent half a day

164
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,960
making this walking stick?

165
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,680
You even carved patterns on it.

166
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,010
How is a plain old branch

167
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:49,920
good enough for me,

168
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,650
the master of Wanqiao Chamber?

169
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,230
Let's eat.

170
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,220
I'm hungry.

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,730
Bixiao Pearl is really useful.

172
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,120
It surely is.

173
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,810
[Plum Garden]

174
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,330
I feel like I can smell the spring breeze.

175
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,080
Right.

176
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,240
This is where Leader lives,

177
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,170
the Plum Garden.

178
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,070
Don't go away!

179
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,960
Stop chasing.

180
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,970
The Leader is right ahead.

181
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,760
That's your new toy?

182
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,690
Many people keep pets.

183
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,070
They say

184
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,430
pets are like family members

185
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,720
that can bring comfort.

186
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,740
I'd like to give it a try

187
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,150
and to know how it actually feels.

188
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,270
Pets are good.

189
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,200
When you show care for them,

190
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,340
they won't hurt you.

191
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,800
So, it's safe to be around pets.

192
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,430
They are perfect
for those afraid of getting hurt.

193
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,950
Now, I don't think that statement

194
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,950
is entirely true.

195
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,310
Have you given it a name, Leader?

196
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,300
Without a name,

197
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,030
it's just a random cat you feed.

198
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,630
It has nothing to do with you.

199
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,470
You're right.

200
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,390
I should give it a name.

201
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,800
I'm Xiaohong. Greetings, Leader.

202
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,440
Today, I came here

203
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,660
to borrow a person from you, Leader.

204
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,600
Who do you want to ask for help?

205
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,440
I know Qiaoyi Qiankun

206
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,150
lives here.

207
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,150
In the Craftsmen's Scroll,

208
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,510
he's the second-ranking

209
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,630
builder, mechanism master,

210
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,830
and puppetry artist.

211
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,120
This Plum Garden

212
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,550
and Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

213
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,220
were both built by him.

214
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,030
Knowing that much about him

215
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,120
doesn't mean
you can persuade him to help you.

216
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,380
He's right in the back.

217
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,140
However,
he has a rather peculiar personality.

218
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,950
He doesn't respond to my orders.

219
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,390
Xiaohong,

220
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,920
you stay here.

221
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,460
As you command.

222
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,390
You've sewn the Thousand Curse Needle

223
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,250
into your meridians to refine it.

224
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
You must hate the guts

225
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,660
of the person you want to kill, right?

226
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,870
Qiaoyi Qiankun,

227
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,230
I need you to do something for me.

228
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,490
Hasn't Leader told you

229
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,910
even he doesn't get to boss me around?

230
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,240
Who do you think you are?

231
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,600
I know

232
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,630
you traded the favor of building

233
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,670
Xiuyu Peony Pavilion and the Plum Garden

234
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,840
for Fengliu Shop killing

235
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,600
Gui Fusheng,

236
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
who ranked top

237
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,400
in the Craftsmen's Scroll.

238
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,430
That's right!

239
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,670
So, now, I am

240
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,390
the best puppetry artist in the world.

241
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,120
I want nothing

242
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,360
but puppetry skills.

243
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,840
Do you know anything about puppetry?

244
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,900
If not, just scram!

245
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,510
I'm indeed ignorant of puppetry.

246
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,630
But I know

247
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,960
that in the Craftsmen's Scroll

248
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,190
about mechanisms and puppetry,

249
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,620
you can only rank second.

250
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,200
What did you just say?

251
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,160
Even though Gui Fusheng is dead,

252
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,080
you're still the second-ranking craftsman.

253
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
Do you know

254
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,380
that in this place,

255
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,120
I can end your life anytime?

256
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,870
This place

257
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,790
is surrounded by magnets.

258
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,920
With just a slight movement of my finger,

259
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,910
the Thousand Curse Needle inside you

260
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,710
will pierce through your brain.

261
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,440
Enough!

262
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,270
Stop it!

263
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:25,870
Killing you

264
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,000
is a piece of cake.

265
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,960
I already

266
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,120
told you to stop.

267
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,550
I know you're obsessed with puppetry art,

268
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,790
and that you plan to hole up here

269
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,630
to build something

270
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,910
better than Gui Fusheng's works.

271
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,860
Unfortunately,

272
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,200
you will never surpass him.

273
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,240
Be it 10 years,

274
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,550
20 years, or 30 years,

275
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,520
you'll be forever below him.

276
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,350
If that weren't true,

277
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,820
why would you have had him killed?

278
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,480
Yes.

279
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,240
I truly can't defeat him.

280
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,570
That's why I killed him.

281
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,080
Qiaoyi Qiankun,

282
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,240
I like you.

283
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,510
Too bad that nobody recognizes you

284
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,770
as the best craftsman.

285
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,960
I know how to make you

286
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,270
the No.1 artist in real sense.

287
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,400
Want to hear my idea?

288
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,510
What is it?

289
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,460
Destroy all his works,

290
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,390
and you'll be the best craftsman!

291
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,270
Gui Fusheng created many works.

292
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,440
The most special of all

293
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,030
is Biluo Palace.

294
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,600
Though I just ate,

295
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,870
I'm hungry again now.

296
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,000
Actually, I'm not really hungry.

297
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,330
I just feel like a snack.

298
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,270
I wish Shei were here.

299
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,270
She can make a feast

300
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,050
out of a few scorpions.

301
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,080
I wonder how she's doing

302
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,340
in the Sword Alliance.

303
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,560
Would she be bullied?

304
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,930
Don't worry.

305
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,200
Master Shao wouldn't give her a hard time.

306
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
I hope so.

307
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,630
But at least please believe

308
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,790
that I'll never harm you,

309
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:47,960
alright?

310
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,870
I wonder

311
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,980
how Mr. Tang is doing now.

312
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,520
Master Puzhu,

313
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,800
long time no see.

314
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,240
Master Cheng,

315
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,580
it's been a while.

316
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,940
How has Island Master Wei been?

317
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,520
My master is doing great.

318
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,360
Enough for the pleasantries.

319
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,790
Let's focus on the important matters.

320
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,480
First,

321
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,070
we need to destroy
the bases of Fengliu Shop.

322
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,000
Miss Shei

323
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,150
wrote down all the suspicious

324
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,750
imperial transport hubs

325
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,630
in the Sword King City in this ledger,

326
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,840
and handed it to the Sword Alliance,
so they could be properly dealt with.

327
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,670
As we all know,

328
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,720
there are many great fighters
in Fengliu Shop.

329
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,520
One is Liu Yan.

330
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,080
Another one claims to be

331
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,550
the chief of the West Palace,

332
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,550
named Xifang Tao.

333
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,630
Xifang Tao?

334
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,870
Tender though she seems,

335
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,240
she's an impressive martial fighter.

336
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,390
Plus, now, even Kuanglan Wuxing

337
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,150
has fallen into the control
of Fengliu Shop,

338
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,390
and been turned into a human puppet.

339
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,750
You mean one of the Seven Masters
on Tiandu Peak,

340
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,750
Kuanglan Wuxing?

341
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,200
It seems

342
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,150
Fengliu Shop is stronger

343
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,010
than expected.

344
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,740
There is something off

345
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,000
with this matter.

346
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,800
That's right.

347
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,900
So, to make sure all goes well,

348
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,790
we need Master Puzhu's help

349
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,550
to wipe out

350
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,600
Fengliu Shop.

351
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,600
As for the second matter,

352
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Master Cheng needs to

353
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,860
handle it personally.

354
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,440
Tang Lici has amazing martial skills.

355
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,970
Although he's injured now,

356
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,870
ordinary martial fighters
are no match for him.

357
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,600
It was you who lost track of him.

358
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,540
So, the task of catching Tang Lici

359
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,120
is yours now.

360
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,600
Given Tang Lici's elusive whereabouts,

361
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
I'm afraid it's highly inefficient

362
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,450
for me to hunt after him.

363
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,120
Isn't it more practical to assign me

364
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,250
to crack down on Fengliu Shop's bases?

365
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,240
Island Master Cheng, how can we

366
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,790
trouble you to run around?

367
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,200
I know exactly

368
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,080
where to catch Tang Lici.

369
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,360
Now that the Sword Alliance knows

370
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,790
Tang Lici's whereabouts,

371
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,320
why issue an arrest warrant

372
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,960
and look everywhere for him?

373
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,760
This is Tai'e Sword.

374
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,170
It's a gift from my mentor Jiangnan Feng.

375
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,960
It's the treasure
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

376
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,290
It's used to slay demons

377
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,670
and the crooked.

378
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,350
Evildoers would tremble in the face of it.

379
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,450
Please take it, Island Master Cheng.

380
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,000
Sword Master, stop joking around.

381
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,390
Tai'e Sword is valuable and precious.

382
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,270
It's the status symbol

383
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,070
of the Sword Alliance's master.

384
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,800
I only have two hands.

385
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,580
How am I supposed to use

386
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,590
a third sword?

387
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,120
Tang Lici has excellent martial skills.

388
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,790
Master Cheng,

389
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,550
please carry Tai'e Sword

390
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,950
with you for protection.

391
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,320
Maybe it will come in handy.

392
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,870
But this sword is really too...

393
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,200
I'll also have someone

394
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,240
assist you.

395
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,569
Master Shao, it seems you've devised

396
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,079
quite an elaborate plan.

397
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,460
About Tang Lici...

398
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,480
Master Shao said

399
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,750
he'd send someone to assist me

400
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,079
in capturing Tang Lici.

401
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,829
I thought it'd be
some mysterious martial master.

402
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:26,829
Master Shao's jokes

403
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,000
are going too far.

404
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,350
Why are there

405
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,290
so many people along the road?

406
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,790
Everyone in the martial arts world

407
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,120
wants to catch Tang Lici

408
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,110
for the glory

409
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,750
of capturing Yique Yinyang alive.

410
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,920
With so many people
hunting after Mr. Tang,

411
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,400
can he still remain at large?

412
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,510
The southern route is the only road
leading to Biluo Palace.

413
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,270
That's why we've met

414
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,670
so many people on the way.

415
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,720
If we go faster,

416
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,950
we can intercept him.

417
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,010
Isn't there another road?

418
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
The western route

419
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,450
leads to death.

420
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,960
May I ask if you are Master Cheng?

421
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,550
Commander Yu.

422
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,920
I am Yu Furen.

423
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,340
We finally met, Yu Furen.

424
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,920
Why aren't you in the Sword King City

425
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,110
cleaning up the mess?

426
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,070
The Sword King died an unjust death.

427
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,960
I've heard

428
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,560
that Yique Yinyang Tang Lici

429
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,160
is fleeing to Biluo Palace.

430
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,760
I must avenge the Sword King.

431
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,750
Did you summon

432
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,010
these jianghu heroes?

433
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,750
I didn't need to summon them.

434
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,110
Just like me,
these fellows from the martial arts world

435
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,440
are seeking justice for the Sword King.

436
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,970
Mr. Yu, have you considered

437
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,840
why Mr. Tang's whereabouts

438
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,520
would be suddenly disclosed?

439
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,720
Could it be possible

440
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,030
that Fengliu Shop

441
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,010
deliberately spread the information?

442
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,440
Why are you bringing her along,
Master Cheng?

443
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,110
Do you know

444
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,640
that this young lady

445
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,200
is an aide to Yique Yinyang?

446
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,270
Is

447
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,510
the Sword Alliance trying to shield

448
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,370
Yique Yinyang?

449
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,830
Commander Yu,

450
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,620
why give a lady a hard time?

451
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,400
I thought

452
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,460
you were different from your master.

453
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,110
As a witness, her presence justifies

454
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,270
the capture of Tang Lici.

455
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,550
That's why I'm bringing her along.

456
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,350
Master Cheng,

457
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,000
do you mean you're also

458
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,400
heading to Biluo Palace?

459
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:58,920
Yes.

460
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,110
In that case, why don't we go together?

461
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,240
I'm not used to that.

462
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:02,800
Goodbye.

463
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,840
Senior!

464
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,910
It's that way.

465
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,490
Let's go.

466
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,780
Move, guys.

467
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:30,780
[Bone Desert]

468
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,480
It's so hot here.

469
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,920
How much longer do we have to walk?

470
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,900
We'll arrive in just a moment.

471
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,680
You said the same thing earlier.

472
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,350
At this rate,

473
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,960
we might die here.

474
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,780
We've arrived.

475
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:45,970
Seriously?

476
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,730
There's nothing but sand here.

477
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,960
Are you delirious from the heat?

478
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,700
This is my ride in the desert.

479
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,000
It was this ship

480
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
that took me to Biluo Palace.

481
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,930
Can I have a try?

482
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,640
Keep your hands to yourself.

483
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,310
Don't touch

484
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,310
anything inside.

485
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,150
That's the Rock Armor Deity.

486
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,640
He's good at attacking
those intruding into

487
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,170
the Bone Desert with rocks.

488
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,000
Don't worry.

489
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,480
I'll go say hello.

490
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,550
He'll let us through.

491
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,210
What? You two know each other?

492
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,830
Foxy Tang, let me play with it.

493
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,590
Just for a bit.

494
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,270
Chi Yun,

495
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,010
hands off!

496
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,720
Do you two both think

497
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,400
that I broke that flying ship?

498
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,240
Even if you hadn't,
the fault was partly yours.

499
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,510
To look on the bright side,

500
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,960
we've set foot on the glaziers,

501
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,790
which means we're closer
to the destination.

502
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,050
Shen always knows the right thing to say.

503
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,920
How beautiful.

504
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,590
Tang Lici,

505
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,660
how dare you come to Biluo Palace again?

506
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,170
Let's go.

507
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,640
What a world of ice and snow.

508
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,070
if it weren't for Bixiao Pearl,

509
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,370
which I got from you, Shen,

510
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,570
I'd be freezing here.

511
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,920
I don't like this place.

512
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,240
Why?

513
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,790
There are no shadows.

514
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,920
Without shadows,

515
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,070
one cannot hide.

516
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,960
Shen, your Shadow Concealment Technique

517
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,620
is better than that, isn't it?

518
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,830
What...

519
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,110
is going on?

520
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,920
It seems

521
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,900
we need to wait for a while.

522
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,790
For what?

523
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,750
The ice is moving.

524
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,280
T-these ice fragments

525
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,210
are gathering!

526
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,550
The Celestial River

527
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,830
is home to the ice
that wouldn't melt in 10 thousand years.

528
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,560
The ice river beneath your feet

529
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,400
is formed by

530
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,810
these pieces of ice joining together.

531
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,960
They move across the river's surface.

532
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,290
Once every three months, for just one day,

533
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,210
these ice fragments
would gather on the river

534
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,790
to form a pathway.

535
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,200
This is why you didn't hurry on the way.

536
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,480
Even if we had arrived earlier,

537
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,440
we would have to wait

538
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,400
for the ice to gather,

539
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,330
or we couldn't reach Biluo Palace.

540
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,680
It's not that complicated, is it?

541
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,340
Why don't we

542
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,390
just step on these ice pieces

543
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,720
and hop across?

544
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,360
I advise you not to do that.

545
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,920
These ice fragments

546
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,270
cannot bear much weight

547
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,590
before they become a whole.

548
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,350
The water of Celestial River
is bone-chillingly cold.

549
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,880
The coldness kills
when it enters one's body.

550
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,080
Even I would suffer

551
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,920
from such coldness.

552
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,500
How much longer do we have to wait?

553
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,960
Be patient, Shen.

554
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,590
Tang Lici,

555
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,910
come back with me to the Sword Alliance
for a trial.

556
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,640
Master Cheng, you managed to get here

557
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
so soon though you got lost halfway.

558
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,170
How impressive.

559
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,070
Your wounds haven't healed.

560
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,270
You shouldn't fight.

561
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,880
Okay.

562
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,350
Chi Yun.

563
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,040
You'll deal with Master Cheng.

564
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,720
Me?

565
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,000
Yes,

566
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,640
you.

567
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,880
Shen,

568
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,240
take it back.

569
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,030
Don't you go away!

570
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,690
Master Cheng,

571
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,480
save it.

572
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,880
These ice floes on the Celestial River
have just gathered.

573
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,720
It will take at least

574
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,750
fifteen minutes

575
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,240
for them to become strong enough

576
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
to withstand your immense inner strength.

577
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,670
Chi Yun is known as the Cloud.

578
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,110
Only he has the lightness skill

579
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,200
to safely move

580
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,190
on this dangerous ice surface.

581
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,270
Therefore,

582
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,640
during these 15 minutes,

583
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,960
Chi Yun

584
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,230
would be invincible.

585
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,630
That's right.

586
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,650
This is how good I really am.

587
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,430
He gets cocky easily.

588
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,450
Let me try again.

589
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,530
Is that all you've got?

590
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,210
I don't think it's working.

591
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,400
How arrogant of you.

592
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,720
A word of caution, Master Cheng.

593
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,960
If you use your special technique here,

594
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,030
I'm afraid you'll fall

595
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,830
into the icy river immediately.

596
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,440
Senior!

597
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,780
Senior, calm down!

598
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,110
Senior!

599
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,540
They're right.

600
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,770
Don't risk your life.

601
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,080
Impressive.

602
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,120
Let's see how far

603
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,150
you can go in just 15 minutes.

604
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,590
Master Cheng,

605
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,360
Biluo Palace is nearby.

606
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,200
Why don't

607
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,960
we go there together?

608
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,210
What do you say?

609
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,830
Senior,

610
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,440
shall we set off

611
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:10,790
too?

612
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,750
I need a break.

613
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,250
Let's go.

614
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,200
Foxy Tang,

615
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,070
how come the ground

616
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,670
doesn't feel safe to step on?

617
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,160
It feels like I'm floating.

618
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,200
You've been here before, right?

619
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,660
Was it the same in the past?

620
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,500
What happened?

621
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,600
Why did they suddenly stop?

622
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,160
Foxy Tang!

623
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,350
Stay back.

624
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,750
The chief of Biluo Palace

625
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,150
just wants to say hi to me.

626
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,270
Shen,

627
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,840
give me Bixiao Pearl.

628
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,070
Trust me.

629
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,350
I can handle this.

630
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,680
Master Cheng,

631
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,640
I'm afraid

632
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,240
we'll have to part here.

633
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:41,790
Careful!

634
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,440
Miss Shei!

635
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Mr. Tang!

636
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,350
Shei!

637
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,630
Palace Chief,

638
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,410
should we kill Tang Lici?

639
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:29,970
No need.

640
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,300
I'd like to know what he'll do

641
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,020
this time,

642
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,420
provided that he can get in here alive.

643
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,640
This is Mr. Tang's Bixiao Pearl.

644
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,260
Why is it...

645
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,160
Mr. Tang...

646
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,720
Mr. Tang?

647
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,160
Mr. Tang?

648
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,510
Mr. Tang?

649
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,550
You mean

650
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,790
this big hole

651
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,400
is a trap?

652
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,400
Tang Lici once stole

653
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,270
from Biluo Palace.

654
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,790
Palace Chief Wanyu
would definitely tighten security.

655
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,190
But...

656
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,830
isn't it equal to digging a big hole

657
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,160
right before his house?

658
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,510
Sometimes the simplest defense

659
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,640
is the best defense,

660
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,030
especially against a smart man

661
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:16,890
like Tang Lici.

662
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,790
It's extremely cold here.

663
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,920
He who can manage to get up from the water

664
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,830
would suffer
a severe power decrease.

665
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,490
This is bad.

666
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,440
Look,

667
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,480
the ice fragments
are about to cover the Celestial River.

668
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,440
Mr. Tang and Miss Shei

669
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,570
haven't come up yet.

670
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,990
What should we do now?

671
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,200
Stop looking.

672
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,120
Even if you go down there,
you can't save them.

673
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,920
You think we need you to tell us that?

674
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,120
You should go with me.

675
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:40,880
Where to?

676
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,040
Biluo Palace.

677
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,050
Fine. We'll go with you.

678
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,160
Shen!

679
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,260
If Tang Lici escapes danger,

680
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,550
he will go there too.

681
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,320
Let's go.

682
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,000
Mr. Tang!

683
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,380
Don't go any further.

684
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,510
Mr. Tang!

685
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,780
Mr. Tang, your arm...

686
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,170
This is the Icy Flamy Begonia.

687
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,620
It's a precious plant for healing,

688
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,400
and also a kind of

689
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,130
poisonous flower containing
the coldness of the earth and heaven.

690
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,620
If one touches the flowers by accident

691
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,790
or makes

692
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,710
a loud sound around them,

693
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,440
they'll grow and break.

694
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,050
Then the harmful coldness

695
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,909
will penetrate into one's marrow

696
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,360
and end a life instantly.

697
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,070
I was worried about you, Mr. Tang.

698
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,320
That was why...

699
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:17,550
Shei.

700
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,790
Did you come down here

701
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,170
in the hope of saving me?

702
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,710
Mr. Tang,

703
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,150
why would you ask?

704
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,590
Look around first

705
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,719
before you continue

706
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,159
answering questions with questions.

707
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,760
As you can see,

708
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,590
even with the Rebirth Scroll,

709
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,760
I can't bear many

710
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,739
of these coldness strikes.

711
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,239
The most poisonous things in the world

712
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,030
usually

713
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,400
wear beautiful and delicate

714
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,960
disguises,

715
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,180
and launch a fatal strike

716
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,920
when one is off guard.

717
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
Isn't that right,

718
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,760
Miss Shei?

719
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,070
Mr. Tang,

720
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,920
what do you mean?

721
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,450
You knew perfectly well

722
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,020
that it was a death trap

723
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,780
down the Celestial River.

724
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,170
Yet you still followed me

725
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,960
and resolutely came down here.

726
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,690
Were you being foolish,

727
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,440
or...

728
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,360
did you already know

729
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,730
I fell into the Celestial River

730
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,920
on purpose?

731
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:41,960
You were sure

732
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,190
that I'd protect you.

733
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,510
You wished

734
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,550
to gain my trust and affection

735
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,770
with that act of yours.

736
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,690
Speaking of which,

737
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
this kind of thing

738
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,270
has happened more than once.

739
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,250
Did you have the same idea

740
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,670
when you saved me last time?

741
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,320
Your blood

742
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,030
can save me.

743
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,120
I have been to many places

744
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,880
and heard many stories,

745
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,480
but I've never seen

746
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,760
such a bond

747
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,160
between two people.

748
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,350
This looks so much like Liu Yan's style.

749
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,430
He'd go to extraordinary lengths

750
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,890
to send me the medicine

751
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,520
that only works on me.

752
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,150
Miss Shei,

753
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,850
what's your real identity?

754
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,400
Why would you

755
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,370
have done what you did to me?

756
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Think carefully before you answer.

757
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,760
I...

758
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,390
only wanted to save your life.

759
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,220
There was no other reason.

760
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,720
I just wanted to save you.

761
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,000
That was it.

762
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,070
Miss Shei,

763
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,060
congratulations.

764
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,180
You've escaped death once again.

765
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,550
How have you been?

766
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,000
Palace Chief Wanyu.

767
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,550
How are you?

768
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,800
Here we meet again, my enemy.

769
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,930
I've only wished all the worst for you.

770
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,070
Like harming me with this trick?

771
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,230
The power of mystical ice

772
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,630
can kill you

773
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,690
through a tiny cut.

774
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,000
If you win,

775
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,450
perhaps I'll meet you.

776
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,670
If you lose,

777
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,610
this young lady beside you

778
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,290
will absolutely meet the Grim Reaper.

779
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,370
Is that so?

780
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,600
Let's make a bet then.

781
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,120
We'll find out

782
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,080
whether or not I can take her

783
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,080
away from this place alive.

784
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,630
Mr. Tang,

785
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,340
we've walked for an hour.

786
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,540
Shall we take a break?

787
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,760
It's truly getting colder and colder.

788
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,420
We'd better

789
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,470
find an exit as soon as possible.

790
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,320
Mr. Tang.

791
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,720
Bixiao Pearl.

792
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,710
Bixiao Pearl is merely strong enough

793
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,570
to protect you.

794
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,530
We'll die

795
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,280
if we both rely on it.

796
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:18,610
And your death

797
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,960
means my defeat.

798
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,340
I hate to be a loser.

799
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,340
But what about your safety?

800
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,400
Mr. Tang!

801
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Your blood can keep me alive, right?

802
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,350
This is Biluo Palace.

803
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,920
We're finally here.

804
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,850
Let's go inside.

805
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,540
It's cold out here.

806
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,590
I am a guest member
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

807
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,400
and the second master of Camellia Island,

808
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,200
Cheng Yunpao.

809
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,810
I'm requesting an audience
with the chief of Biluo Palace.

810
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,550
Why is there no response?

811
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,920
I am Cheng Yunpao.

812
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,570
I'm asking to meet
the chief of Biluo Palace, Mr. Wanyu.

813
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,740
Is there nobody in Biluo Palace?

814
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,070
Just barge in.

815
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,440
That is extremely

816
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,300
rude behavior.

817
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:38,960
Come on.

818
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,590
Shen and I came here to seek refuge.

819
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,710
We're asking for shelter,

820
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,970
so we have to be polite.

821
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,340
But you're here for a manhunt.

822
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,440
Why don't you just get in there

823
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,410
and ask for your target?

824
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,610
I don't need to explain anything to you.

825
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,920
What is there to do then?

826
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,410
Just wait a bit longer.

827
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,920
More waiting?

828
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,480
To refine the power of mystical ice

829
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,880
to such an extent...

830
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,230
Palace Chief Wanyu

831
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,590
is really something.

832
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,620
Don't move.

833
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:51,160
Plucking a lone withering plum blossom
while drunk...

834
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,420
Such sword essence...

835
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,140
is quite interesting.

836
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,570
There are also traps here.

837
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,000
We'll meet stronger power of mystical ice

838
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,930
as we go further.

839
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,140
This wall of ice

840
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,550
is actually air

841
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,710
condensed by the power of mystical ice.

842
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,650
In return, this ice wall

843
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,360
prevents the cold air from dissipating,

844
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,700
and thus makes this place

845
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,160
even more bone-chilling.

846
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,270
Palace Chief Wanyu's design

847
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,070
is indeed quite ingenious.

848
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,400
That is to say,
if we break this wall of ice,

849
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,480
the power of mystical ice you mentioned

850
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
will be emitted.

851
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,330
But if we don't break it,

852
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,530
we'll be trapped here till we die.

853
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,660
Bixiao Pearl is on you.

854
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,400
As long as you're not injured,

855
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,110
such coldness can't threaten your life.

856
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,710
But what about you, Mr. Tang?

857
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,630
Just take care of yourself.
