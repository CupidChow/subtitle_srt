[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,950
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,220
I have to go save him!

4
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,160
It's no use going now.

5
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,350
Yu Qifeng

6
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,200
has descended into complete madness.

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,070
Only Tang Lici can stop him.

8
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,320
Now that the Tianyan Sword Wall
has collapsed,

9
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,450
Sword King City is in imminent danger.

10
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,340
This is all too coincidental.

11
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
At this moment,

12
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,460
we can only trust Tang Lici.

13
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,060
Besides...

14
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,240
we have more important things

15
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,990
to do.

16
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,579
I'll go take care of the south!

17
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,070
Senior!

18
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,079
Haven't you already settled your score

19
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,940
with Foxy Tang?

20
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,560
Now I owe him again!

21
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,170
Forget it, forget it.

22
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,770
Let's not talk about it.

23
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,370
What can I say?
I'm handsome and kind-hearted.

24
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,520
Mom!

25
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,470
Xiaobao!

26
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,000
Mom!

27
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,079
Xiaobao!

28
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,520
Mom!

29
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,590
Mom!

30
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,150
Watch out!

31
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,900
Shen?

32
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:35,560
Mom...

33
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,230
Quick, get to the ferry

34
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,190
and protect your wife.

35
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,520
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

36
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,800
Xiaobao.

37
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,770
Xiaobao, are you all right?

38
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,310
Come here. It's okay. Don't be afraid.

39
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,870
-Thank you so much!
-Thank you so much!

40
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,280
Hurry!

41
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,950
Everyone, head to the ferry!

42
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,190
Hurry!

43
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,840
You're here.

44
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,370
Let's go!

45
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,120
Take the people to the dock!

46
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,710
Keep up!

47
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,910
Follow me! Let's head to the dock!

48
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,800
Go to the ferry!

49
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,260
Hurry!

50
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,030
Those in the back,

51
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,680
keep up!

52
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,590
Move, move! Quickly!

53
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,190
Everyone, head to the ferry!

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,630
Run!

55
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,750
Go!

56
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,839
Go to the dock!

57
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,720
Thank you.

58
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,480
Are you okay?

59
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,360
Thanks.

60
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,350
At a time like this,
you're still worried about luggage?

61
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,150
Quick, get everyone to the dock!

62
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,090
Are you alright?

63
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,480
I'm fine.

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,280
Go to the dock!

65
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,480
To the ferry!

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,530
This way!

67
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,420
Hurry up, hurry up!

68
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,240
Quick, save them! Hurry!

69
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:51,720
Hurry!

70
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,330
Hurry to the ferry!

71
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,800
Hurry up! Keep close!

72
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,240
Come on.

73
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,640
Hurry!

74
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,120
Get up here quickly!

75
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,800
Little fox,

76
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,970
I've truly gone all out this time.

77
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,190
What a good man I am.

78
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,780
Everyone, keep up.

79
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,750
Get on the boat quickly!

80
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,120
Be careful! Be careful!

81
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,810
Those at the back, stay close! This way!

82
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,360
Hurry! Hurry!

83
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,580
This way!

84
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,640
Get on the boat now!

85
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:21,560
Good.

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,740
Hurry, get onto the boat!

87
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,560
From here on,

88
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,040
you should be able to manage on your own.

89
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,370
Everyone, keep up!

90
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,830
Keep up with those in front!

91
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,490
Be careful!

92
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,570
Commander.

93
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,310
Are there any more boats?

94
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,720
We've called for all available boats
in the area,

95
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,710
but there are too many people.

96
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,830
Requisition

97
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,750
every available boat

98
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,810
from all the docks!

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,240
Yes, sir!

100
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,900
Go quickly!

101
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,600
Father!

102
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,390
Little girl,

103
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,000
where are your parents?

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,800
Come this way! This way!

105
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,530
I don't know.

106
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,840
Don't be afraid.

107
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,170
I'll help you find them.

108
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,950
Whose child is this?

109
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,830
My child, hero.

110
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,000
Quick, take her!

111
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,580
Everyone, board in order!

112
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,920
Quick, quick, quick!

113
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,800
This way!

114
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,590
So many civilians.

115
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,590
How can we manage?

116
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,120
Until they cross the river,

117
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,920
none of them is safe.

118
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,450
This way!

119
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,370
Hurry up! Move!

120
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,000
Yu Qifeng,

121
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,160
Liu Yan

122
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,820
has completely deceived you.

123
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,300
According to his plan,

124
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,630
whether I live or die,

125
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,180
you'll never be able to leave this place.

126
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,900
He's triggered an avalanche.

127
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,850
Sword King City

128
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,240
is about to be destroyed!

129
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,960
Compared to killing you,

130
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,030
Sword King City is

131
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,180
a small price to pay!

132
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,000
Tang Lici!

133
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,930
My martial arts are unmatched!

134
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,530
What does it matter
if Sword King City is destroyed?

135
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,090
The whole world is mine!

136
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,920
But you...

137
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,010
look at those people below!

138
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,390
If you hadn't insisted on

139
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,050
investigating Sword King City,

140
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,910
none of this would have happened!

141
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,660
And those people

142
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,240
wouldn't have died!

143
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,630
That's right.

144
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,720
You've been injured
by the Thirty-Three Heavenly Demon Dance,

145
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,390
and now you must face

146
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,270
Yu Qifeng, who's given his all,

147
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,040
while innocent people

148
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,170
continue to suffer in Sword King City.

149
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,080
Tang Lici...

150
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,640
They all died because of you.

151
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,950
It was you.

152
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,510
You were the one who caused their deaths!

153
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,070
You caused their deaths!

154
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,630
Yu Qifeng,

155
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,840
I like your reasoning.

156
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,440
Because with it,

157
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,360
I can kill you

158
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,760
with a clear conscience.

159
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,480
Why?

160
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,320
I've given everything I have,

161
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,780
yet I still can't beat you.

162
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,840
Yu Qifeng,

163
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,020
the pill Liu Yan gave you

164
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,460
has turned you into a drug vessel.

165
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,150
All the toxic blood in your body

166
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,560
will keep you alive

167
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,730
until the pill's effects wear off.

168
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,070
But that's all it can do.

169
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,910
You're right.

170
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,440
Tang Lici!

171
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,750
I

172
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,610
have one more move.

173
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,310
Refusing to change until the bitter end.

174
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,030
Everyone, be careful! Run!

175
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,120
The Westwind Slashing Wildfire,

176
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,980
born from devouring Yu Xuanqing—

177
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,880
the sword technique used to

178
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,610
fiercely battle Yique Yinyang
on Tiandu Peak...

179
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,320
This time, Yu Qifeng

180
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,510
has finally impressed me.

181
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,570
And it's worth it...

182
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,240
With the Sword Phoenix's power,

183
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,790
this unstoppable technique—

184
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,450
Westwind Slashing Wildfire—

185
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,870
I'll let you taste it first!

186
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,020
Die!

187
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,830
Tang Lici is doomed this time.

188
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,840
Chi,

189
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,820
the Tianyan Sword Wall
is about to collapse.

190
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,200
Run!

191
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,370
Get on the boat!

192
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,520
Hurry, hurry!

193
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,510
Get on the boat!

194
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,910
Be careful! Be careful!

195
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,840
Hurry up, hurry up!

196
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,600
Run faster!

197
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,660
Hurry up! Hurry up!

198
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,080
I've mastered it!

199
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,790
Ancestors,

200
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,240
did you see that?

201
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,510
I, Yu Qifeng, can split mountains
and shatter stone!

202
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,270
I'm invincible!

203
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Light Technique—

204
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,360
Heavenly Sacred Light.

205
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,110
Puzhu is here.

206
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,270
Looks like he wasn't

207
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,670
truly driven away by you.

208
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,950
The jianghu will become interesting
from now on.

209
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,170
The rocks are blocked.

210
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,590
Does it have to be this dramatic?

211
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,480
Puzhu helped.

212
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,910
He thinks he can hold back

213
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,640
the rain of fire all by himself?

214
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,609
He's being naive.

215
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,770
None of these people

216
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,900
will make it across the river.

217
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,930
Master, you were right indeed.

218
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,829
Wherever Tang Lici goes,

219
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,000
disaster follows.

220
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,020
The Wild Goose Formation.

221
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,350
Don't push!

222
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,510
One at a time!

223
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,640
Mr. Chi, Miss Zhong.

224
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,110
Master Jiang.

225
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,590
Jiang, why are you here?

226
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,420
I received a message from my benefactor

227
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,690
saying that help was needed
in Sword King City.

228
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,920
Let's get the people
across the river first.

229
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,270
Okay.

230
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,970
Send the signal quickly.

231
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,830
Hurry and save the people!

232
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,270
Line up!

233
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,960
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

234
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,270
Move!

235
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:02,680
Hurry!

236
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,270
Everyone, stay calm!

237
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,350
Master Jiang from the Yanmen Sect

238
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,410
has come to help us!

239
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,320
Hurry!

240
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,190
Everything you have

241
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,640
comes from me.

242
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,460
Therefore, you belong to me.

243
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,470
What's happening?

244
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,160
What's happening?

245
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,980
Offer your life to me as a sacrifice,

246
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,570
become a demon,

247
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,550
and thus achieve true compassion.

248
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,660
The Black Tuli is the product

249
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,010
of Yique Yinyang's concentrated energy.

250
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,590
Who would have thought that a mortal
could unleash something

251
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,390
so spectacular by absorbing it?

252
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,450
I am the true No. 1 in the world!

253
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,440
None of you will

254
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,830
leave Sword King City alive!

255
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,560
What is that?

256
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,440
Tang Lici,

257
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,210
have you forgotten our wager?

258
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,740
What on earth are you doing?

259
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:31,770
This is...

260
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,230
Master.

261
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,240
Yu Qifeng...

262
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,110
You've destroyed Sword King City's legacy
of generations,

263
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,640
all for your own delusions.

264
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,170
Was it worth it?

265
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,530
Why aren't you dead yet?

266
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,850
Who are you really?

267
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,390
Golden eyes

268
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,790
and a flame mark on his forehead...

269
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,720
Yique Yinyang?

270
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,270
That's right.

271
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
Tang Lici

272
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,660
has always been the successor
of Yique Yinyang.

273
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,350
Yu Xuanqing, the legendary hero

274
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,790
of Sword King City,
fought against Yique Yinyang.

275
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,920
Yet as a descendant of Sword King City,

276
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,590
you've taken the wrong path,

277
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,160
obsessed with being No. 1

278
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,320
and craving fame and fortune.

279
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Why?

280
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,730
Why can't I kill you?

281
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,830
You're a monster.

282
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,240
Monster!

283
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,500

-It's stopped!
-We're saved!

313
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,070
We're saved!

314
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,750
You did it.

315
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,240
Tang Lici,

316
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,170
the secret you've been carefully hiding—

317
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,810
why not let the whole world

318
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,080
enjoy it together?

319
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,960
What's going on?

320
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,160
He has golden eyes and the forehead mark!

321
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,680
Yique Yinyang?

322
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,400
Didn't only Yique Yinyang

323
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:56,920
have those marks?

324
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,450
Yique Yinyang has revived?

325
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,030
Mr. Tang is Yique Yinyang?

326
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,880
Tang Lici...

327
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,400
Yan...

328
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,830
So

329
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,250
this was your true purpose all along.

330
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,790
[One day later]

331
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,380
Be careful.

332
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,600
Slow down.

333
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,850
Master.

334
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,670
Sword Master.

335
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:10,750
Chunji,

336
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,770
how did Sword King City

337
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,050
end up like this?

338
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,170
Sword King Yu

339
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,200
attempted to

340
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,970
silence everyone to conceal his collusion

341
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,030
with Fengliu Shop,

342
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,390
which led to the city's destruction.

343
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,200
Fortunately, Mr. Tang was there.

344
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,610
Though there were injuries,

345
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,480
no one died.

346
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,510
But why are people saying

347
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,310
that Tang Lici is Yique Yinyang?

348
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,400
This matter is still under investigation.

349
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,090
However...

350
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,310
Yu Qifeng

351
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,040
was indeed the main culprit.

352
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,340
Do you have evidence

353
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,360
of his collusion with Fengliu Shop?

354
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,310
The evidence was destroyed.

355
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,160
But Gu Xitan and I

356
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,090
can both testify

357
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:44,800
that Yu Qifeng

358
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,020
was definitely connected to Fengliu Shop.

359
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,530
That's right.

360
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,920
We examined
all the imperial transport ledgers,

361
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,750
and the accounts

362
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,060
were indeed suspicious.

363
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,320
Where are the ledgers?

364
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,380
They were burned.

365
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,250
So there's no evidence then.

366
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,510
Without evidence,

367
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,060
we can only rely on
corrupt officials to handle it.

368
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,360
Why can we only rely on corrupt officials?

369
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,360
They can extract false confessions
through torture.

370
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,610
Master Shao.

371
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:15,860
Master Xiao.

372
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:16,960
Master Ji.

373
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,230
I'm Yu Furen.

374
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,750
Master Shao, I heard you've arrived at
Sword King City.

375
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,330
I was occupied with
handling my master's funeral,

376
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,790
so I couldn't welcome you in time.

377
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,300
Please forgive me, Sword Master Shao.

378
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,100
Commander Yu,

379
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,270
I'm deeply sorry

380
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,570
for the City Lord's death.

381
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,450
Sword Master Shao,

382
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,790
may I say something?

383
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,330
Please go ahead.

384
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,940
Today, I've

385
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,920
led all disciples of Sword King City

386
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,990
in wearing mourning clothes
for the Yu family,

387
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,280
and even more so
for the entire martial arts world.

388
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,210
The death of Sword King City's Lord

389
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,130
and such a tragedy within our city

390
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,280
were all caused by Tang Lici alone.

391
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,540
I beseech you, Sword Master Shao,

392
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,310
to severely punish this villain.

393
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,020
What nonsense are you talking about?

394
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,920
If Sword King Yu

395
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,980
hadn't colluded with Fengliu Shop

396
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,060
-to sell the Blood Ghost Pill...
-Shut up!

397
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,750
Everyone knew
Sword King Yu's swordsmanship was

398
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,210
profound and mysterious.

399
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,050
Why would he need to rely on
such heretical methods?

400
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:07,680
But that night,

401
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,920
at the Qiongtai Banquet,

402
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,440
we saw with our own eyes
when those people revealed themselves.

403
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,160
And we've

404
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,000
already given that list

405
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,930
to Master Puzhu.

406
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,270
May I ask, Mr. Gu,

407
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,260
where is the evidence?

408
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,720
As for Master Puzhu,

409
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,960
he has long since sided

410
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,790
with Tang Lici

411
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,910
and lost his impartiality.

412
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,110
Did you ever consider

413
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,040
that perhaps Sword King Yu believed

414
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,720
you had been bewitched

415
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,750
by Tang Lici,

416
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,270
which is why he risked his life

417
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,310
to protect the city?

418
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,110
Did you ever give him

419
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,240
a chance to explain?

420
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,030
Then may I ask, did Sword King Yu

421
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,720
ever give us a chance to explain?

422
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,880
If he were truly innocent,

423
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,620
why would Mr. Tang

424
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,880
have targeted him specifically?

425
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,920
That's because Tang Lici is

426
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,250
Yique Yinyang himself!

427
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,920
He wants to use

428
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,400
Sword King City's imperial transport route

429
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,720
to distribute the Blood Ghost Pill!

430
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,330
Yu Furen,

431
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,550
either you have ulterior motives,

432
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,030
or you're deceiving yourself!

433
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,550
Chunji.

434
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,250
Tang Lici has golden eyes
and the forehead mark!

435
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,680
The entire city saw it

436
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,030
with their own eyes!

437
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,760
Ten years ago,

438
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,350
Yique Yinyang wreaked havoc
in the jianghu,

439
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,880
causing untold suffering!

440
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,480
Now,

441
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,230
he has committed such evil acts again.

442
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,240
Should the Central Plains Sword Alliance

443
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,480
take responsibility

444
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,930
and issue a warrant for Tang Lici?

445
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,680
Or perhaps

446
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,000
you've already been in cahoots

447
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,130
with Yique Yinyang!

448
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,690
What are you talking about?

449
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,350
Whether Tang Lici is Yique Yinyang

450
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,800
has yet to be proven.

451
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,830
As for the Sword King City case,

452
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,630
there are still many questions.

453
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,750
Regarding these two matters,

454
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,410
I'll investigate thoroughly

455
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,480
and give both of you

456
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,240
and the world an explanation.

457
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,030
For now, there's a more pressing matter.

458
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,360
The city lies in ruins
and must be rebuilt.

459
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,510
I want to appoint you as acting City Lord

460
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,130
to temporarily oversee city affairs.

461
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,270
Sword Master Shao,

462
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,230
I'm still young and inexperienced,

463
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,690
unfit for such a position.

464
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
That's exactly why I've chosen you.

465
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,970
Only those who dare to
be different in youth

466
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,730
can reach new heights.

467
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,380
But don't worry,

468
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,090
I'll assign another one

469
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,640
to govern alongside you.

470
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,540
May I ask, Sword Master Shao,

471
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,010
who that person will be?

472
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,360
He should be arriving soon,

473
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,580
if all goes well.

474
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,260
[Camellia Island]

475
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,280
Quick, quick, quick! Kneel!

476
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,070
This is Camellia Island,

477
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,790
where the remnants of the Jile Sect
and followers

478
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,650
of Yique Yinyang are imprisoned!

479
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:34,940
Sir, you saw

480
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,790
my golden eyes and forehead mark,

481
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,900
yet you didn't kill me.

482
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,430
Why did you save me instead?

483
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,600
After that great battle,

484
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,710
I went up the mountain to find you.

485
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,430
Within 500 zhang

486
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,400
of where Yu Qifeng died, nothing grows.

487
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,520
The poison has penetrated 10 zhang
into the ground,

488
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,960
and its toxicity is
extraordinarily severe.

489
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,570
It was you.

490
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,440
You contained that poisonous mist

491
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,170
within that 500-zhang radius,

492
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,310
preventing it from
spreading down the mountain

493
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,680
and harming innocent people.

494
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,740
I've been constantly thinking about

495
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,920
our wager—

496
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,040
using my own methods to solve it

497
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,170
without harming any innocent person.

498
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,030
You still dare to mention our wager?

499
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,430
You overdrew your power.

500
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,130
Your self-healing ability is
weakening as well.

501
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,110
Moreover,

502
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,500
the heart crystal inside you

503
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,480
is continuously

504
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,070
draining your vital essence.

505
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,930
If not removed,

506
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,410
you won't live out the year.

507
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,920
Thank you, sir,

508
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,200
for your help.

509
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,600
Tang Lici,

510
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,310
come back with me to the Sword Alliance

511
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,510
to explain what happened to Master Shao

512
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,620
and to account for your connection
to the Zhoudi Tower massacre

513
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,020
and your relationship with Yique Yinyang.

514
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,920
Sir, the wager we agreed upon is

515
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,680
that as long as you

516
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,730
intervene in Sword King City's affairs,

517
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,900
you lose.

518
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,590
Conversely,

519
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,510
if within the time limit,

520
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,400
I

521
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,130
fail to deliver evidence to you

522
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,350
or harm

523
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,200
any innocent person

524
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,700
in the process of pursuing Yu Qifeng,

525
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,240
then I lose.

526
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,920
Then what of
your "not harming the innocent"?

527
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,110
Sword King City lies in ruins,

528
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,510
and the Sword Wall has collapsed.

529
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,840
If I hadn't intervened,

530
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,880
how many civilians would have suffered?

531
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,480
Indeed.

532
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,490
You intervened.

533
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,590
Doesn't that violate

534
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,920
our original agreement

535
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,370
that you would never interfere

536
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,200
in Sword King City's affairs?

537
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,840
But have you ever considered

538
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,200
what would've happened
if I hadn't intervened...

539
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,400
I was betting that...

540
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,930
you would definitely step in.

541
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,510
So from the very beginning,

542
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,840
you had already decided

543
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
to include me in your calculations.

544
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,050
That was your own choice, sir.

545
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,470
If it weren't for you,

546
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,020
Yu Qifeng would have died

547
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,050
at the Qiongtai Banquet then and there,

548
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,790
and none of these subsequent troubles

549
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,990
would have occurred.

550
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,120
But if you want to break our agreement,

551
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,880
there's nothing I can do about it.

552
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,410
However,

553
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,400
if you truly believe

554
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,270
I was wrong,

555
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,550
why did you save me?

556
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,110
Tang Lici,

557
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,300
you take risks at every turn.

558
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,920
Do you really think

559
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,920
you have everything under control?

560
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,510
Did it ever occur to you that

561
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,030
if even the slightest thing
hadn't gone your way,

562
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,890
how many people

563
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,400
would have died because of your gamble?

564
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,490
The fact is, no one did.

565
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,230
If that day ever comes...

566
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,230
you won't be able to pay the price.

567
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,750
To be honest,

568
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,240
I don't even care.

569
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,680
Tang Lici.

570
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,090
Sir, let me ask you—

571
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,220
weren't those

572
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,790
who died

573
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,550
from the Evil Pill's poison

574
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,610
innocent victims?

575
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,360
Weren't those who died
because of Fengliu Shop

576
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,560
innocent?

577
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,000
Chi Yun,

578
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,780
Shen Langhun,

579
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,640
Zhong Chunji, Gu Xitan,

580
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,680
and Shei—

581
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,560
they risked their lives

582
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,050
to fight against Yu Qifeng

583
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,110
and Fengliu Shop.

584
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,930
Aren't they innocent?

585
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,520
In the battle at Tiandu Peak,

586
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,000
more than half of the Seven Masters

587
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,330
were injured or killed.

588
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,250
Fang Zhou

589
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,600
was severely wounded because of it.

590
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,000
Should their sacrifices

591
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,960
be taken for granted?

592
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,180
They were heroes.

593
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,500
They chose to stand against evil.

594
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,180
But once I take action,

595
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,030
it won't be

596
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,420
just heroes who perish.

597
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,810
I cannot agree with your thinking.

598
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,230
Is that so?

599
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,360
Then please allow me

600
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,840
to decline your invitation.

601
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:01,880
I...

602
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,440
will never go to
the Sword Alliance with you.

603
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,110
I'm afraid...

604
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,640
that's not up to you.

605
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,200
My rival—

606
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,550
the very one the Sword Alliance

607
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,960
has been painstakingly searching for,

608
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,420
the owner of Fengliu Shop—

609
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,030
why would he

610
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,200
reveal my golden eyes and forehead mark

611
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,030
to everyone?

612
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,840
Master Puzhu, you're clever,

613
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,530
so surely you understand.

614
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,750
They want to use the Sword Alliance

615
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,640
to restrain me

616
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,530
and ruin my reputation.

617
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,450
If I were to follow you back now,

618
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,720
wouldn't I be

619
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,520
playing right into their hands?

620
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,590
How about

621
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,070
we

622
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,790
make another wager?

623
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,310
What wager?

624
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,489
With my current strength,

625
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,150
I'm no match for Tang Lici

626
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,230
or Puzhu.

627
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,560
Master...

628
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,710
I'll definitely avenge you.

629
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:26,570
Father.

630
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,630
Tang Lici!

631
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,480
What are you doing here?

632
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,310
Commander Yu.

633
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,239
Tang Lici's accomplice...

634
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,540
Given what lies between us,

635
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,920
I don't see the need to explain.

636
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,719
Commander Yu!

637
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,620
Move aside.

638
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,900
Please hear me out.

639
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,550
After Sword King Yu's death,

640
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,880
Madam Bai disappeared.

641
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,469
I heard she has no parents

642
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,960
and was taken as a concubine

643
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,000
by Sword King Yu solely for her beauty.

644
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,280
Regarding Sword King Yu,

645
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,840
I think...

646
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,480
Mr. Gu!

647
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,840
Yique Yinyang has reappeared
in the jianghu.

648
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,800
With such important matters at hand,
you pay them no mind

649
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,510
and instead concern yourself

650
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,760
with my master's private life?

651
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,360
This isn't just

652
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,320
your master's private life,

653
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,120
Commander Yu.

654
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,150
Why don't you think about it?

655
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,510
Madam Bai's background is unknown,

656
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,190
and now she's disappeared without reason.

657
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,800
Is there truly nothing suspicious
about that?

658
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,150
Could she be a pawn sent by Fengliu Shop

659
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,590
to control Sword King Yu?

660
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,880
Perhaps she was afraid
Fengliu Shop would be implicated,

661
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,590
so she burned

662
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,650
the accounts we were investigating.

663
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,510
Absurd.

664
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,960
Your vital energy is severely damaged,
your power has diminished,

665
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,930
and your self-healing ability
has been affected.

666
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,190
Take care of yourself.

667
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,440
The world beyond these walls

668
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,500
doesn't favor you.

669
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,760
Once you leave here,

670
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,040
I won't be able to protect you.

671
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,310
Thank you for your concern, sir.

672
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,590
Lici.

673
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:39,800
Lici.

674
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,070
Who are you?

675
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,520
He's discovered you. He's discovered you.

676
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,960
No, I don't want to.

677
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,630
No, I don't want to!

678
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,360
Tang Lici,

679
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,370
look at those people below!

680
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,510
If it weren't for you

681
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,150
insisting on
investigating Sword King City,

682
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,010
none of this would have happened!

683
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,070
Those people wouldn't have died!

684
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,960
Tang Lici,

685
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,840
you can't save anyone!

686
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,030
Tang Lici,

687
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,400
if not for you,
Fang Zhou wouldn't have died!

688
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,030
Lici,

689
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,190
don't reveal your golden eyes
and forehead mark.

690
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,920
Fang Zhou...

691
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,280
I'm sorry.

692
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,550
I didn't do as you said.

693
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,040
No one will die because of me.

694
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,290
If I can save them...

695
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,240
I can save you.

696
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:43,760
Here.

697
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,030
Thank you.

698
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,800
Next.

699
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Thank you so much.

700
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,880
Thanks.

701
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,400
Have some.

702
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,450
I never expected

703
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,080
that order in Sword King City

704
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,480
would actually

705
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,880
be restored

706
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,160
in such a short time.

707
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,610
It's truly remarkable.

708
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,110
Master.

709
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,920
Then I should

710
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,380
introduce someone to you.

711
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,030
Who?

712
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,280
Miss, where is Dr. Liu?

713
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,540
Divine Doctor Liu is over there
treating patients' hands.

714
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,360
Could you check on me?

715
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,960
It's done.

716
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,370
Please sit down first.

717
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,580
That's him.

718
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,590
Him?

719
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,180
That young man in white

720
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,110
not only treated

721
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:45,880
the injured

722
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,190
but also gathered everyone
to set up shelters

723
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,550
and collected and distributed food

724
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,670
so that no one would go hungry.

725
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,400
That's good.

726
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,800
Dr. Liu!

727
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,200
Avoid water for three days.

728
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,070
Everyone, please wait a moment!

729
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,230
-You attend to your business first.
-Alright, alright.

730
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,290
Alright, alright.

731
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:10,920
Master,

732
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,510
this is Dr. Liu.

733
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,360
Dr. Liu,

734
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,720
thanks to your help,

735
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,920
the people here

736
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,580
can still receive treatment.

737
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,090
I've only made a small contribution.

738
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,360
Master Shao, the martial arts world today

739
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,480
remains at peace precisely

740
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,630
because of your wise governance.

741
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,400
We've finally enjoyed

742
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,800
nearly 10 years of peace.

743
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,800
This is by no means my effort alone.

744
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,320
Many

745
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,070
talented heroes like yourself

746
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,170
have also contributed.

747
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,840
I'm afraid

748
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,570
those days of peace

749
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,240
are coming to an end.

750
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,190
Dr. Liu, you're worried

751
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,190
that the Blood Ghost Pill

752
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,210
will harm the martial arts world again?

753
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:48,610
Yes.

754
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,920
But not only that.

755
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,150
All healers know

756
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,800
we must treat the root cause
of an illness.

757
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,130
Without Yique Yinyang,

758
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,210
there would be no Blood Ghost Pill.

759
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,400
Master Shao, I'm sure

760
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,630
you know the calamity

761
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,360
Yique Yinyang

762
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,900
caused ten years ago better than I do.

763
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,670
The reason he

764
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,800
was able to gather

765
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,400
so many followers so quickly

766
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,360
was not merely the court's favor

767
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,230
but, more importantly,

768
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,710
his deceptive nature.

769
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,710
He killed with one hand
while saving with the other,

770
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,030
winning people's hearts

771
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,560
while deceiving the world.

772
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,550
Now look at Tang Lici.

773
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,610
He uses the court's name as protection

774
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,370
and commits heinous crimes

775
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,280
under the pretense of justice.

776
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,370
Yique Yinyang is indeed dead,

777
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,400
but Tang Lici's current methods

778
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,630
are identical to those

779
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,630
of Yique Yinyang.

780
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,760
Not to mention,

781
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,000
he revealed his golden eyes
and forehead mark.

782
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,710
Even if he isn't

783
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,840
Yique Yinyang himself resurrected,

784
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,770
he must be deeply connected to him.

785
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,530
Master Shao.

786
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,110
To address the root of this problem,

787
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,190
I earnestly request that you

788
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,140
issue an arrest warrant
throughout the jianghu

789
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,660
to apprehend Tang Lici.

790
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,880
Dr. Liu, what you've said
is merely speculation.

791
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,150
A few connections

792
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,880
cannot make a conclusive case.

793
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,510
If we rashly issue an arrest warrant
throughout the jianghu,

794
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,840
people might become even more unsettled.

795
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Indeed, Dr. Liu.

796
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,110
Sword Master Shao, you believe

797
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,570
Tang Lici is a good person?

798
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,110
I truly do not wish to pass judgment

799
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,510
on someone I've never met

800
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,000
without proper cause.

801
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Master Shao.

802
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,320
Please hear what this old woman
has to say.

803
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,550
Madam, who are you?

804
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,590
My son was Qin Kunwu.

805
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,670
Mr. Qin was a hero

806
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,590
who fought against
the Jile Sect rebellion.

807
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,230
Mr. Qin was truly a righteous man.

808
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,840
Indeed.

809
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,930
Mr. Qin had a heart for the people.

810
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,670
I deeply admire him.

811
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,560
Back then,

812
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,630
if he hadn't sacrificed his own life

813
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,000
to hold back Yique Yinyang

814
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,320
at the Battle of Tiandu Peak,

815
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,510
we might never have succeeded in
killing him.

816
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,000
Yes.

817
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,510
Kunwu was my only son.

818
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,920
The night before
the Battle of Tiandu Peak,

819
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,320
he stood outside my room,

820
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,080
hesitating for a long time.

821
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,800
I asked him

822
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,590
why he wouldn't come in.

823
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:18,840
He said

824
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,150
he couldn't face me.

825
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,920
He couldn't bear to leave me alone,

826
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,190
but for the sake of
the entire martial arts world

827
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,710
and its sliver of hope,

828
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,150
he had to risk his life.

829
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,110
And he did it.

830
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:35,880
I was

831
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,950
very proud.

832
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,510
The peace in the martial arts world

833
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,670
was bought with my son's life,

834
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,480
as well as the lives

835
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,340
of many heroes!

836
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,230
Master Shao,

837
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,550
I want to ask you:

838
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,190
doesn't the worth

839
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,800
of all those lives

840
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,190
outweigh that of one Tang Lici?

841
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,280
Must we really wait

842
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,440
until Yique Yinyang makes a comeback

843
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,410
before sacrificing

844
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,510
countless more lives to fight back?

845
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,000
-Issue a warrant for Tang Lici!
-Issue a warrant for Tang Lici!

846
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
-Kill Yique Yinyang!
-Kill Yique Yinyang!

847
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,520
-Issue a warrant for Tang Lici!
-Issue a warrant for Tang Lici!

848
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,400
-Kill Yique Yinyang!
-Kill Yique Yinyang!

849
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,070
-Issue a warrant for Tang Lici!
-Issue a warrant for Tang Lici!

850
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,470
-Kill Yique Yinyang!
-Kill Yique Yinyang!

851
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,280
-Issue a warrant for Tang Lici!
-Issue a warrant for Tang Lici!

852
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,480
-Kill Yique Yinyang!
-Kill Yique Yinyang!

853
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,190
-Issue a warrant for Tang Lici!
-Issue a warrant for Tang Lici!

854
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,440
-Kill Yique Yinyang!
-Kill Yique Yinyang!

855
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,190
Everyone!

856
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,670
I, Shao, hereby order

857
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,710
the arrest of Tang Lici.

858
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,000
If necessary...

859
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
kill without mercy!

860
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,480
-Good!
-Yeah!

861
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,280
-Good!
-Good!

862
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,400
-Good!
-Yeah!

863
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,070
-Good!
-Good!
