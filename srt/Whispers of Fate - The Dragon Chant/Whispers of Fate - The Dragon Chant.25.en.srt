[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,900
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,480
Miss Tao.

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,259
Why did you join the Fengliu Shop?

5
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,200
Miss Tao's talent, appearance,

6
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:40,810
wisdom,

7
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,620
and martial skills

8
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,220
are all top-tier in this era.

9
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,340
Why did you join the Fengliu Shop?

10
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,120
Sir, are you trying

11
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,520
to compliment my beauty?

12
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,759
You certainly possess

13
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,960
beauty to be proud of.

14
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,400
But that is not my question.

15
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,950
After being friends for so many years,

16
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,900
you've only now decided
to have a heart-to-heart with me.

17
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,790
But if you want to know

18
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,120
someone else's secret,

19
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,310
shouldn't you

20
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,840
reveal your own first?

21
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,630
I was, in fact,

22
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,110
the crown prince of the former dynasty.

23
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,650
The current emperor

24
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,000
is my cousin.

25
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,710
You were the crown prince
of the former dynasty?

26
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,120
The chaos caused by Yique Yinyang

27
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,520
began because my father trusted traitors.

28
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,500
Though I was the crown prince,

29
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,180
I failed to stop my father.

30
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,670
I could only watch helplessly

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,020
as people suffered terribly.

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,970
Hundreds of thousands of lives were lost.

33
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,560
Even if only a fraction of the blame
were mine,

34
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,090
I could never atone for it.

35
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,520
That is why

36
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,180
I joined the Tianjing Pavilion
for cultivation.

37
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,290
Then you have even more reason to kill me.

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,640
Only by killing me
can you save more people.

39
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,900
You are using your life as bait

40
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,870
just to see me

41
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,630
fall from grace?

42
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,520
For someone like you,

43
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,260
with such an unyielding will,

44
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,370
the sound of your collapse

45
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,640
will surely be clear and resounding.

46
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,360
While cultivating
in the Tianjing Pavilion,

47
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,280
because I regretted my own

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,079
inability to save those people,

49
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,520
my inner demon ran wild,

50
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,490
and I almost lost control.

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,260
It was my master who told me

52
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,190
that every person

53
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,120
should have

54
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,380
a chance to start anew.

55
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,150
I am,

56
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,190
among all those still living,

57
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,610
the one who deserves death the most.

58
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,520
If I don't die,

59
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,560
then others certainly shouldn't.

60
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,210
If I cannot forgive others,

61
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,710
I certainly cannot forgive myself.

62
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,690
You always wear that bracelet.

63
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,230
Perhaps there's still goodness in you.

64
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,400
Master Puzhu,

65
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,519
what's inside these beads

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
is deadly poison—

67
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,800
cinnabar.

68
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,050
It can be poison,

69
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,130
but it can also be medicine.

70
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,730
It all depends on your intention.

71
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,810
What are you doing?

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If you died here,

73
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,800
I'd be responsible for your death.

74
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,960
My legs are injured,

75
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,630
but my inner energy remains.

76
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,000
If I heal your wounds,

77
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,980
you can escape.

78
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,180
Don't forget,

79
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,560
I'm the West Palace Chief
of the Fengliu Shop.

80
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,420
I'm not trying to convert anyone.

81
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,290
I just don't want
any more blood on my hands.

82
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,720
If you commit evil again,

83
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,580
others will surely deal with you.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,800
But by then,

85
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,480
it may no longer be

86
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,140
something I can intervene in.

87
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,190
In the battle at the Peony Pavilion,

88
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,050
Xifang Tao did not show up either.

89
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,190
Either she and Master Puzhu

90
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,510
are still

91
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,420
locked in combat,

92
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,800
or

93
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,320
they've made peace.

94
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,920
Although we still

95
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,840
haven't found Master Puzhu,

96
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,870
in my view,

97
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,680
he and Xifang Tao

98
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,450
should both still be alive.

99
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,210
You fought in such a fierce battle.

100
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,670
Why didn't anyone call me?

101
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,480
How's the task

102
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,680
I asked you to do?

103
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,630
You won't believe it!

104
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,600
I'm telling you,

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,000
good thing I went myself.

106
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,970
We'll talk about it later.

107
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,580
I'll take my leave now.

108
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,220
Let's go.

109
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,000
My journey

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,920
can only be described

111
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,560
as legendary.

112
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,310
I've been through endless hardship,

113
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,680
dealing with all kinds of creatures,

114
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,940
to complete your task.

115
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,659
Let's just say—

116
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,220
my brains saved me.

117
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,390
I'm lucky to be alive to report back.

118
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,750
Guess who I ran into

119
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,600
at the Fallen Shisan Tower?

120
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,720
Qiaoyi Qiankun.

121
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,870
How did you know?

122
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,020
Were you secretly tailing me?

123
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,320
Wait.

124
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,340
Weren't you busy fighting
at the Peony Pavilion?

125
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,070
Fang Pingzhai has always been
full of wild ideas.

126
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,630
In this world, the only person

127
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,270
willing to daydream like him

128
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,310
must be

129
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,240
the equally crazy Qiaoyi Qiankun.

130
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,160
Whether it's Fang Pingzhai

131
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,390
or Qiaoyi Qiankun,

132
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,910
to the Fengliu Shop,

133
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,030
the two of them

134
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,780
are, at best, outside helpers.

135
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,190
The one truly pulling the strings
behind all this

136
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,520
is likely someone else.

137
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,680
You have a point.

138
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,490
Then I bet you don't know

139
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,490
who brought Qiaoyi Qiankun there.

140
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,870
A child.

141
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,120
The task is done.

142
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,590
Where's the thing I want?

143
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,159
As long as you hand it over,

144
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,560
things like defying fate

145
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,830
or turning back time won't be a problem.

146
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,070
Qiaoyi Qiankun seemed to have

147
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,930
just rushed over from somewhere.

148
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,000
I followed them to the Shisan Tower

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,430
and overheard them talking.

150
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,159
I didn't understand

151
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,110
what they were saying,

152
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,680
but I could tell

153
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,080
it wasn't anything good.

154
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,310
Something about miracles,

155
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,159
turning things upside down,

156
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,159
and defying fate.

157
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,870
Also,

158
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:49,870
that child was able to make

159
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,240
Qiaoyi Qiankun take him so seriously,

160
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,570
which is quite strange.

161
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,230
But you were right about one thing—

162
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,960
Fang Pingzhai really is crazy.

163
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,270
Behind Liu Yan,

164
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,930
there is indeed someone else.

165
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,750
He's so foolish to be manipulated

166
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,410
and yet think he's in control.

167
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,510
Mr. Yu?

168
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,480
I…

169
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,840
have something
to discuss with Mr. Tang privately.

170
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,590
Since when did you two

171
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,440
become so close?

172
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,549
What secret can't I hear?

173
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,169
Fine, talk all you want.

174
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,169
I'm going to eat.

175
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,169
Shei made dinner.

176
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,030
Come back soon.

177
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,010
Got it.

178
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,650
What is it you want to discuss, Mr. Yu?

179
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,030
Why…

180
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,800
didn't you expose me?

181
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,930
What do you mean?

182
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
Back at Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

183
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,200
I stabbed you.

184
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,030
I hated you for using Sword King City.

185
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,430
I had always doubted you.

186
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,870
I wanted revenge.

187
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,320
You knew that.

188
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,320
You only wanted

189
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,520
revenge, that's all.

190
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,010
If I were you,

191
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,150
I'd want revenge too.

192
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,240
In the jianghu,

193
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,630
revenge knows no right or wrong.

194
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,600
Tang Lici.

195
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,910
You keep showing kindness

196
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,200
to an enemy.

197
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,370
What is it you really want?

198
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,510
In the jianghu,

199
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,080
I have more enemies

200
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,550
than fish in a river.

201
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,080
Why would I

202
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,540
show kindness to an enemy?

203
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,930
If your heart were truly set,

204
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,590
if revenge was all you wanted,

205
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,600
then why,

206
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,870
after that strike,

207
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,600
did you stop?

208
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,120
And why didn't you join the Fengliu Shop

209
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,550
with Yu Qifeng?

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,260
Instead, you came back

211
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,960
to the Sword Alliance.

212
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,480
Mr. Yu.

213
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,120
That sword strike of yours

214
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,480
meant nothing

215
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,750
to me.

216
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,610
The Yanhuang Sword?

217
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,080
How did it

218
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,750
end up with you?

219
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,720
Back at Sword King City,

220
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,150
thanks to this sword,

221
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,700
the poisonous creature could be

222
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,360
suppressed within 500 zhang.

223
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,010
The city was thus saved
from complete ruin.

224
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,360
You truly do not need to credit me

225
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,690
with that achievement.

226
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,150
But…

227
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,420
if you cannot unleash this sword's power,

228
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,870
then you don't

229
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,000
even have the right

230
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,550
to speak of forgiving me.

231
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,010
Mr. Tang, you're here.

232
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,790
Master Shao, you wished to see me.

233
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,520
Is there something important?

234
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,200
Sit.

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,750
It's just the two of us here.

236
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,510
Here.

237
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,940
No need to keep up the act.

238
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,240
This…

239
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,600
That blood you swallowed back
in the Wanhua Hall—

240
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,830
you can spit it out now.

241
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,710
I just did.

242
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,390
I'm not that fragile.

243
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,640
Thank you.

244
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
This battle has

245
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,680
greatly weakened the Sword Alliance.

246
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,840
The Fengliu Shop

247
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,320
suffered heavy losses too.

248
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,250
They'll have to lie low for a while.

249
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,480
So, right now, there's something else

250
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,000
that's far more important.

251
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,720
Mr. Tang,

252
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,510
the injuries you got at Biluo Palace

253
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,030
haven't fully healed, have they?

254
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,960
At the Peony Pavilion this time,

255
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,480
you were hurt again.

256
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,480
That's why

257
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,960
finding a great physician

258
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,670
to restore your strength

259
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,220
is of utmost importance.

260
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,150
After all, the peace of the jianghu

261
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,820
rests entirely on you.

262
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,910
I

263
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,270
can't possibly carry such a burden.

264
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,840
Mr. Tang,

265
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,370
you may not
have come for peace in the jianghu,

266
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,840
but I'll hand over Liu Yan

267
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,120
for you to deal with.

268
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,810
As expected,

269
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,480
Master Shao, you know well

270
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,720
how to negotiate.

271
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,000
You flatter me.

272
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,280
Mr. Tang, focus on healing.

273
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
As for the Sword Alliance's affairs,

274
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,460
leave them to me

275
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,120
and the other sword masters.

276
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,670
However,

277
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,880
great physicians mostly

278
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,430
live in seclusion.

279
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,320
Even if I want to find one,

280
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,510
there's nowhere to start looking.

281
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,720
Don't worry about that.

282
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,920
From what I've heard,

283
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
within our Sword Alliance,

284
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,440
there's actually someone

285
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,630
who's an old friend
of the incredible physician Shui Duopo.

286
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,670
If we can invite her

287
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,870
to the Sword Alliance,

288
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,550
that would be ideal.

289
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,260
The mountain wind's a bit chilly tonight.

290
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,240
Have I

291
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,280
caught a cold?

292
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,270
Master Shao.

293
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,170
Mr. Tang.

294
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,630
-Master Shao.
-Master Shao.

295
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,830
-Mr. Tang.
-Mr. Tang.

296
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,980
Chang,

297
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,030
you've been practicing well lately.

298
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,030
I just saw you practicing.

299
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,240
You need to raise your arm

300
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,360
to make your punch more powerful.

301
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,080
Am I right?

302
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,630
Qi, you've grown taller.

303
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,780
Almost as tall
as your third senior brother.

304
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,720
Bao,

305
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,510
yesterday I saw you

306
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,240
throw away the green vegetables

307
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,100
from your meal.

308
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,720
Don't think I didn't notice.

309
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,120
So Master Shao,
you found me out after all.

310
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,080
Of course I did.

311
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,640
You really do
notice everything, Master Shao.

312
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,080
We'll head to bed then.

313
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,100
Go on, go to bed.

314
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,790
Let's go.

315
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,150
Young people these days

316
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,950
really should get out more

317
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,920
and spend some time with friends

318
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,610
instead of staying cooped up inside.

319
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,670
Chunji,

320
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,870
the kitchen made roast chicken tonight.

321
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,670
It smells amazing.

322
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,550
Have you eaten?

323
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,260
You need to eat something.

324
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,700
That's how your wounds will heal faster.

325
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,870
Master,

326
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,410
I've already eaten.

327
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,360
Chunji.

328
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,790
What happened at the Peony Pavilion
wasn't your fault.

329
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,600
Master,

330
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,030
I'm tired.

331
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,320
Alright.

332
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,540
Get some rest then.

333
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,440
So,

334
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,910
your worry

335
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,720
is about Ms. Zhong.

336
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,080
I knew you'd figure it out.

337
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,870
That's why you deliberately

338
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,050
brought me here.

339
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,840
You saw it too.

340
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Chunji has locked herself up

341
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,910
in her room,

342
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,120
not eating or drinking,

343
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,190
and not speaking to the other disciples.

344
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,270
Everyone's already

345
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,080
stopped blaming her.

346
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,550
But she just can't get over

347
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,950
that hurdle in her heart.

348
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,590
She won't forgive herself.

349
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,510
Mr. Tang,

350
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,480
she…

351
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,840
You…

352
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,390
Don't worry, Master Shao.

353
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,360
I understand.

354
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,090
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

355
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,180
Why did they even save her?

356
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,000
She's the one who caused all this!

357
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,240
What can we do?

358
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,200
She is

359
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,000
Master Shao's disciple after all.

360
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,750
If we'd followed

361
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,110
Mr. Tang's original plan,

362
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,270
the Peony Pavilion battle

363
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,200
wouldn't have cost
the Sword Alliance so dearly.

364
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,270
Yet she still wants
to return to Shanfeng Branch.

365
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,270
Delusional!

366
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,630
Yes, delusional!

367
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,480
Delusional!

368
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,000
Stop blaming me.

369
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,200
Why save her at all?

370
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,160
She's the one who caused it!

371
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,750
Stop blaming me!

372
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,480
Just leave it at the door.

373
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,270
Ms. Zhong.

374
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,040
Mr. Tang.

375
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,290
Do you have a moment?

376
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,170
Please, come in.

377
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,440
Mr. Tang,

378
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,370
you saved me at the Peony Pavilion.

379
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,750
I should have properly

380
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,950
thanked you for that.

381
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,920
But right now,

382
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,320
I really don't know how to face…

383
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,790
face you.

384
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,680
Because of me,

385
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,240
the Peony Pavilion battle

386
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,550
caused heavy losses.

387
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,310
All of this…

388
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,400
The losses

389
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,730
we suffered in that battle…

390
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,640
if someone must

391
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,370
take responsibility for them,

392
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,640
it should be me, as the one

393
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,070
who led the charge.

394
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,030
Ms. Zhong,

395
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,400
you don't have to

396
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,730
shoulder all the blame.

397
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,310
Besides,

398
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,110
when we decided
to attack Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

399
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,310
everyone in the Sword Alliance
was excited.

400
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,830
No one objected.

401
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,550
Mr. Tang, you're always like this.

402
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,110
Your words of comfort

403
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,100
won't make me feel any better.

404
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,480
I did not

405
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,030
come here

406
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,200
to comfort you.

407
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,440
I came because

408
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,550
the Sword Alliance
is in need of talented people.

409
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,810
We need you, Ms. Zhong.

410
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,310
I'll be leaving tomorrow,

411
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,000
and I'd like to go

412
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,480
with peace of mind.

413
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,550
I believe

414
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,510
Master Shao feels the same.

415
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,480
Do you really think…

416
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,470
the Sword Alliance still needs me?

417
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,200
Ms. Zhong, you hadn't made

418
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,930
any major mistakes in the past,

419
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,150
so you'd never learned from one.

420
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,550
I do have some experience.

421
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,750
I once

422
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,270
took a wrong step…

423
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,680
and caused

424
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,030
irreparable regret.

425
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,280
All I could do was bear the mistake,

426
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,450
walking through darkness,

427
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,270
one step at a time.

428
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,330
Because there was no other choice.

429
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,270
But

430
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,800
if you let that consume you,

431
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,720
that would be the true betrayal

432
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,960
of the dead.

433
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,400
So,

434
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,160
the more you carry,

435
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,760
the more you must move forward.

436
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,680
Carrying such a heavy burden,

437
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,930
won't one easily stumble

438
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,630
and be laughed at?

439
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,850
If you stumble, get back up.

440
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,140
If people laugh at you,

441
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,880
let them.

442
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,080
When the light finally shines through,

443
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,790
all those past hardships

444
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,690
will be nothing

445
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,960
but a little frost on your journey.

446
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,550
But who can truly do that?

447
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,190
Who can do it?

448
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,340
The Ms. Zhong I once knew—

449
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,440
she surely could.

450
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,920
It's late.

451
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,160
I'll

452
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,710
take my leave now.

453
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,730
Thank you,

454
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,950
Mr. Tang.

455
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,590
Those bastards from the Sword Alliance

456
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,110
really destroyed
most of the Peony Pavilion.

457
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,000
Damn them.

458
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,410
You blind animal!

459
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,350
Fucui,

460
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,200
how dare you!

461
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,010
Greetings, Leader.

462
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,310
Every plant in the Plum Garden

463
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,560
is not to be touched.

464
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,530
Even plucking a single leaf

465
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,160
will cost you your life.

466
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,960
Yes.

467
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Bai Suche,

468
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,550
the Black Tulili I asked you to gather—

469
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,410
how is it going?

470
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,450
It's done.

471
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,400
I went out and came back,

472
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,440
and you still haven't made up your mind?

473
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,040
Only patience wins the game.

474
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,830
Hurry up.

475
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,700
Stop complaining.

476
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,720
Master, you left behind
this unfinished game.

477
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,270
Leader, you once said

478
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,400
the Fengliu Shop
doesn't belong to me alone.

479
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,300
Leader, you must

480
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,560
also bear your share of responsibility.

481
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,280
You're right.

482
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,720
At this very moment,

483
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,820
you still have the mood to play Go?

484
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,020
The Peony Pavilion may be destroyed,

485
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,290
but the Sword Alliance

486
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,440
has also suffered greatly.

487
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,240
Both sides need time to recover.

488
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,160
So we'll withdraw our forces for now

489
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,760
to rest and regain strength.

490
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,970
This is a game of strategy.

491
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,460
The Go game is the same.

492
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,570
The pleasure of the game lies in

493
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,760
the moment the winner is revealed.

494
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,270
Some win

495
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,720
by sheer luck;

496
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,400
others

497
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,160
by careful calculation.

498
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,870
Some will even pay any price,

499
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,010
losing everything they have,

500
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,160
yet still claim

501
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
the art of the game

502
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,290
is to play moderately for amusement.

503
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,750
Without the desire to win,

504
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,320
one can avoid obsession.

505
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,100
Without the desire to win,

506
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,400
you'll never win.

507
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,960
Without obsession,

508
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,760
one cannot achieve greatness.

509
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,750
Look,

510
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,930
you've lost.

511
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,110
This is the thrill of victory

512
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,910
and the sting of defeat?

513
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,510
How come I've lost

514
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,600
but don't feel upset?

515
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,090
Please, Master, focus on healing.

516
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,720
She's one of the Fengliu Shop's
key fighters.

517
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,780
The defeated soldiers you brought back

518
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,310
are nowhere near her worth.

519
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,080
Did Xifang Tao run away?

520
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,680
Should we call her Xifang Fled now?

521
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,720
That joke

522
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,780
isn't funny at all.

523
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,550
No one…

524
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,200
can escape the grasp of the Fengliu Shop.

525
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,240
Palace Chief,

526
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,050
you're leaving so soon?

527
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,880
Why don't you stay a few more days?

528
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,510
I hadn't left Biluo Palace

529
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,370
for a long time.

530
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,730
Being out for so long this time—

531
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,530
I'm still not used to it.

532
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,110
The battle at the Peony Pavilion

533
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,310
was a narrow victory.

534
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,650
Everyone in the Sword Alliance

535
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,320
owes thanks to Biluo Palace

536
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,970
for stepping in to help.

537
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,590
However,

538
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,310
I imagine what concerns you most now

539
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,400
is not that,

540
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,030
but rather

541
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,080
the court's attitude toward Biluo Palace.

542
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,960
Of course,

543
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,200
that concerns me.

544
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,590
But

545
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,450
what interests me even more

546
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,840
is your change, Mr. Tang.

547
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,770
In just a few short days,

548
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,830
your heart has changed completely.

549
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,750
The Mr. Tang standing before me now

550
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,410
seems more willing to open up.

551
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,280
Palace Chief,

552
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,660
peering into someone's heart

553
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,440
isn't exactly a good habit.

554
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,880
I've already sent a message
to my godfather

555
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,110
to inform His Majesty

556
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,410
of Biluo Palace's contributions.

557
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,430
Thank you.

558
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,640
That was our agreement.

559
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,370
"Poor teaching"

560
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,310
"reflects the teacher's laziness."

561
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,810
"If a child doesn't study,"

562
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:48,870
"it is not proper."

563
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,960
"If one doesn't learn when young,"

564
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,560
"what will they do when old?"

565
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,740
"If jade is uncut,"

566
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,270
"it cannot become a useful vessel."

567
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,470
"If you don't learn,"

568
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,630
"you won't know..."

569
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,010
"Righteousness."

570
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,030
"If you don't learn,"

571
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,240
"you won't know righteousness."

572
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
You forgot again?

573
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,510
"If you don't learn,"

574
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,790
"you won't know righteousness."

575
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,640
"As someone's child…"

576
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,170
It seems what I was curious about

577
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,700
has already been answered.

578
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,300
Foxy Tang still hasn't returned.

579
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,560
Your change, Mr. Tang,

580
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,680
is because of them.

581
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,200
Are we eating or not?

582
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,590
No.

583
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,270
Master hasn't returned.

584
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,600
No one is allowed to eat.

585
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,110
Shei's cooking is excellent.

586
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,240
Palace Chief Wanyu,

587
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,160
why not stay

588
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,290
and have a simple meal before leaving?

589
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,550
No, thank you.

590
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,680
Mr. Tang,

591
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,440
I believe we will

592
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,970
have a chance to meet again.

593
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,920
You've finally returned!

594
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,880
Sit.

595
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,070
We've been waiting for ages.

596
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,600
I'm practically starving.

597
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,880
Starving?

598
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,880
I don't mean to blame you,

599
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,480
but how could you fight

600
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,750
such a world-shaking battle

601
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,160
without me?

602
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,180
Weren't you starving?

603
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:19,960
What?

604
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,000
Not starving anymore?

605
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,070
It's all your fault!

606
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,240
Why did you have to send me

607
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,880
to keep a lookout at that exact time?

608
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,510
We're done!

609
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,590
It's over between us…

610
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,450
for 30 minutes.

611
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,110
Senior Xue Xianzi is here.

612
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,270
Senior,

613
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,050
why do you keep popping up unexpectedly?

614
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,480
Master Shao said

615
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,530
only you know the way there.

616
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,730
They're… they're my chopsticks.

617
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,920
What way?

618
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,830
It's 30 minutes already?

619
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,960
Don't be a busybody.

620
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,750
Where exactly are you going?

621
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,790
To go sightseeing,

622
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,960
eat good food, and drink fine wine.

623
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,360
And we're not taking you.

624
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,720
Shei's cooking is still so good.

625
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,400
Senior...

626
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,900
Little fox,

627
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,040
now you know to call me Senior.

628
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,050
What do you mean, "Master Shao said"

629
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,420
"I know the way there"?

630
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,880
Truth is,

631
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,640
only I know the way there.

632
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,530
I wanted to ask, did you

633
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,510
pay back the interest

634
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,000
on the money you owe me from last month?

635
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
What interest?

636
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,860
What monthly interest?

637
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,590
I don't know.

638
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,810
If you can't pay back the money,

639
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,740
what will you offer as collateral?

640
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,070
Alright.

641
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,800
Aren't you going
to Shui Duopo for treatment?

642
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,560
It's such a joyous thing.

643
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
Talking about money ruins the mood.

644
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,200
Shui Duopo, the incredible physician?

645
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,070
You're finally going

646
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,600
to treat your old injuries.

647
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,680
You must take me with you this time.

648
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,880
Master.

649
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,080
I want to go too.

650
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,640
The journey is long.

651
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,090
You'd better not come.

652
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,070
I am going.

653
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,030
When you went to the Peony Pavilion,

654
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,890
Stone was very worried about you.

655
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,510
Was Stone the only one worried about him?

656
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,370
Besides Stone,

657
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,460
no one else was worried about him?

658
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:18,880
Little fox.

659
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,730
How does it feel to have someone

660
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,720
worry about you?

661
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,680
Ever felt it before?

662
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,810
Then let's go together.

663
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,350
Go eat.

664
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,110
Chi Yun.

665
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,510
Have another one.

666
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,400
Shen.

667
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,790
Eat.

668
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,480
Try this.

669
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,420
Try it.

670
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,410
Delicious.

671
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,310
Palace Chief, you're not in a hurry.

672
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,160
Why not stay

673
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,420
and dine with Mr. Tang?

674
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,890
Did you notice?

675
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,100
He's clearly in unbearable pain,

676
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,240
yet he keeps pretending to be fine.

677
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,480
You're talking about Mr. Tang?

678
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,420
But what does that have to do

679
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,420
with my question?

680
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,220
If I stayed any longer,

681
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,590
I wouldn't be able
to resist advising him again.

682
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,010
But he dislikes it when others

683
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,240
try to read his heart.

684
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,160
So,

685
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:43,930
let's go.

686
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,480
My wound is healing so slowly.

687
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,230
Mr. Tang,

688
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,310
you're a monster too.

689
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,440
You should understand—

690
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,020
to monsters like us,

691
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,640
redemption means everything.

692
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,409
"Men at their birth"

693
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,580
"are naturally good."

694
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,230
Even monsters

695
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,650
have other choices in life.

696
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,929
Power Transformation Technique?

697
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,110
Yique Yinyang,

698
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,300
this is how you tricked Fang Zhou,

699
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,070
using the rest of his life

700
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,860
to help you practice
the Rebirth Scroll, right?

701
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,800
"Joy, anger,"

702
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,270
"sorrow, fear,"

703
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,280
"love, hate, and desire"

704
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
"are the seven emotions of humans."

705
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,190
Lici,

706
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,110
they're just ordinary people of Shenzhou.

707
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,770
They have all seven emotions.

708
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,930
They may grow angry because of this

709
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,330
and misunderstand you.

710
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,610
But I believed in you.

711
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,000
Doesn't that prove

712
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,070
our seven years of friendship
at Zhoudi Tower

713
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,550
were real after all?

714
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,740
But the truth is,
those seven years at Zhoudi Tower

715
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,840
were built entirely on lies!

716
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,280
Here.

717
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,400
Eat more.

718
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,840
You eat so much, yet never grow bigger.

719
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,890
Foxy Tang is always punctual.

720
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,930
Didn't we agree to leave at dawn?

721
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,110
It's almost sunrise now,

722
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,730
and he's still not here.

723
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,440
He's here.

724
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,110
[Tingyun Pavilion]

725
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,030
I felt relaxed,

726
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,070
so I

727
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,760
slept in a little.

728
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,070
Mr. Tang,

729
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,630
your hair…

730
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Everyone's here.

731
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,530
Here is the map.

732
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,510
You can go on your own.

733
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,360
As for me…

734
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,440
You…

735
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,370
Little fox,

736
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,880
what happened to you?

737
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,080
Why is your hair grey?

738
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,880
Isn't this normal?

739
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,380
Yours is all white, Elder.

740
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,140
Knock it off.

741
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,750
I'm over 300 years old.

742
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,760
Paying one's debts
is only right and proper.

743
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,960
Since I owe you money,

744
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,230
I'll

745
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,830
escort you all the way there.

746
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:11,710
Shei and Stone

747
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,110
are waiting at the mountain gate.

748
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,640
Let's go.

749
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,530
Let's go, guys.

750
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,050
Master Shao,

751
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,920
farewell.

752
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,230
Let's go.

753
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,110
Master Jiang?

754
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,750
What brings you here?

755
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:07,800
Chunji,

756
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,440
are you feeling better?

757
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,510
I came on behalf of other sword masters

758
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,950
to check on you.

759
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,440
Chunji,

760
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,480
why are you still here?

761
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,030
Why not return to your room
at Shanfeng Branch?

762
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,920
I'm no longer

763
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,400
the chief of Shanfeng Branch.

764
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,190
Nonsense.

765
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,070
You've done so much

766
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,400
for the Sword Alliance.

767
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,960
In the Xiuyu Peony Pavilion battle,

768
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,280
you led from the front

769
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,590
and risked your life
to save the disciples.

770
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,510
If anyone dares say

771
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,960
you're not the chief of Shanfeng Branch,

772
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,490
I'll be the first to object!

773
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,070
This room's far too small.

774
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,000
How can you recover properly here?

775
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,030
Go back to your room at Shanfeng Branch

776
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,290
and recover properly.

777
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,960
Come in!

778
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,280
Help move Ms. Zhong's belongings.

779
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,940
-Yes.
-Yes.

780
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,160
Careful, slow down.

781
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,800
Master Jiang.

782
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,230
What's going on?

783
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,680
You've always been Branch Chief Zhong.

784
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,840
In my heart, you always will be.

785
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,110
[Mount Baojing]

786
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,290
What kind of cursed weather is this?

787
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,840
Compared to my Snow-Return Storm,

788
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,800
it still falls a bit short.

789
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,230
Looks like

790
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,630
this snow won't stop

791
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,440
anytime soon.

792
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,190
Good thing we left Shei and Stone

793
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,390
at the cave entrance.

794
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,770
With snow this heavy,

795
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
we might not find

796
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,890
a passable path.

797
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,760
Wait.

798
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,510
These black stones

799
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,710
look weird to you too?

800
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,320
I found them

801
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,960
exactly the same

802
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,160
as what I saw just now.

803
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,400
You don't know the way

804
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,480
and are leading us around
in circles, right?

805
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,800
Nonsense!

806
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,400
How could I not know the way?

807
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:00,880
Around here,

808
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,880
these black stones are everywhere.

809
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,200
They're not stones?

810
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,150
More accurately,

811
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,920
they're bricks from an ancient city wall.

812
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,740
What kind of wall brick

813
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,880
crumbles so easily?

814
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,670
It was scorched brittle by fire.

815
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,800
What kind of fire could be that intense

816
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,960
to make solid bricks brittle?

817
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,550
Besides,

818
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,440
this is the middle of nowhere.

819
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,630
It doesn't look like
there was a city here.

820
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,230
There was.

821
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,380
There used to be a small kingdom here

822
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,490
called Gumo State.

823
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,210
Gumo State?

824
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Never heard of it.

825
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,670
I have.

826
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,670
Intelligence gathering
is the Shisan Tower's specialty.

827
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,760
Gumo State was only about

828
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,760
the size of a city.

829
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,130
A plague swept through.

830
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,510
To stop its spread,

831
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,630
the king gathered the bodies
and burned them.

832
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,710
But accidentally,

833
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,800
it set the whole city ablaze.

834
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,920
By dawn, the entire city was gone.

835
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,030
Still the same question:

836
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,090
what kind of fire could be so powerful

837
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,760
as to burn down an entire city?

838
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,020
So there's another version of the story:

839
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,630
the king of Gumo State angered the gods,

840
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,330
who first sent a plague

841
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,710
and then divine fire.

842
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,360
Divine fire?

843
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,190
Wait.

844
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,440
Why is that physician living

845
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,290
in a place like this?

846
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,440
Let's keep moving forward.

847
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,000
Senior.

848
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,400
Chunji.

849
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,510
Look,

850
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,000
these are all herbs

851
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,590
for strengthening the body
and boosting energy.

852
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,440
We're all family in the Sword Alliance.

853
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,630
If you ever need more,

854
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,070
just tell me.

855
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,980
I'll get them for you right away.

856
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,590
If your room isn't clean enough,

857
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,550
call your fellow disciples to clean it up.

858
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,920
Don't you think

859
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,770
that Master sacrificed

860
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,030
many people from the Alliance to save me?

861
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,030
Of course not.

862
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,620
Though Master Shao

863
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,900
hesitated at first,

864
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,110
Mr. Tang

865
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,360
spoke passionately,

866
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,590
saying you are

867
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,250
a role model for all disciples

868
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,780
and must not be abandoned.

869
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,400
Otherwise, it'd demoralize everyone.

870
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,000
And it's just as well—

871
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,230
we should let the Fengliu Shop see

872
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,090
how united the Sword Alliance is.

873
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,360
We stand with Mr. Tang.

874
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
We'll fight Fengliu Shop to the end.

875
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:37,760
Chunji,

876
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,480
those foolish words you just said—

877
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,630
who did you hear them from?
