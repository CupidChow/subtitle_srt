[Whispers of Fate]

2
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,880
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,120
Your stomachache...

4
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,740
Does Liu Yan know about it?

5
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,700
He doesn't trust me.

6
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,150
You're truly insane.

7
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,740
Insane?

8
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,350
Maybe I am.

9
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,420
But I thought

10
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,740
you would understand me, Shen.

11
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,640
Even if God

12
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,000
wants Fang Zhou to die,

13
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,800
I won't allow it.

14
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,210
If I don't allow it,

15
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,680
neither God

16
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,820
nor ghosts can make it.

17
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,480
I can do anything.

18
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,190
So you stole the Immortal Crystal Coffin

19
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,310
from Biluo Palace

20
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,770
just to preserve his body.

21
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,910
But a few days ago,

22
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,230
Liu Yan and I went to Zhoudi Tower

23
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,190
only to find Fang Zhou's body missing.

24
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,050
Ghostly Peony?

25
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,120
That's not the whole story.

26
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,050
Why did you take his body away?

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,560
Why didn't you tell us?

28
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,810
Bringing Fang Zhou back to life is

29
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,340
the most important secret.

30
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,510
Except for Shui Duopo and Liu Yan,

31
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,190
I haven't told anyone else about it.

32
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,520
I'm asking why you

33
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,840
stole his body for no reason,

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,240
and why you hid it from us!

35
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,250
I told you it's a secret.

36
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,280
Tang Lici,

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,730
bringing Fang Zhou back to life

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
means you'll have to die.

39
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,150
Right?

40
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,090
Am I right?

41
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,150
Shen.

42
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,150
Not until this moment

43
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,560
did I understand

44
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,510
how insanely accurate

45
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,710
an assassin's gut feeling can be.

46
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,510
No, no.

47
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,070
Wait.

48
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,690
Who said you could die?

49
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,360
I'm your bodyguard.

50
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,100
What will I do if you die?

51
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,790
It's my own choice to seek death.

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,700
It has nothing to do with you guys.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How can it have nothing to do with us?

54
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,400
Are we not your friends?

55
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,800
Like Shei,

56
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,880
Zhong Chunji,

57
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,350
Gu Xitan, and the others.

58
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,940
We'll be heartbroken if you die.

59
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,340
Is Fang Zhou your only friend?

60
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,750
What about us?

61
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,640
You are my friends.

62
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,770
But Fang Zhou is different from you.

63
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,070
Why?

64
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,920
Because he is Fang Zhou.

65
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,350
I see you as my best friend,

66
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,370
Tang Lici.

67
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,870
Is it worth it?

68
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,390
Shen, you are the last person

69
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,590
to ask that question.

70
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,600
But at least you should

71
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,480
give us a chance

72
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,800
to help our friend.

73
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
Damn fox.

74
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,000
What does he mean, Fang Zhou is

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,040
different from me?

76
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,440
But...

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,430
What's...

78
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,070
What's

79
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,600
the difference between us?

80
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,540
Don't touch me.

81
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,850
It's not my concern even if he dies.

82
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,940
You're terrible at lying.

83
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,160
Let's go back

84
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,240
with him.

85
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,790
Do you like your title as Princess?

86
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,120
Liu Yan.

87
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
If you call out,

88
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,000
you might no longer be able

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,260
to be Princess Lang Ya.

90
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,300
It's good that you came out for a walk.

91
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,090
I didn't have to break in,

92
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,890
which spared me a lot of trouble.

93
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
What are you up to?

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,720
Do you like the gift I gave you?

95
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,840
The butterfly tattoo.

96
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,850
You want to threaten me?

97
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,560
But Mother has already

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,920
recognized me

99
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,040
as Princess Lang Ya.

100
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,280
Of course,

101
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,200
every piece of information about you

102
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,260
matches Princess Lang Ya perfectly.

103
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,920
Even your butterfly tattoo is

104
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,040
almost identical

105
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,870
to the Princess's tattoo.

106
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:35,750
Right?

107
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,990
It's been more than a decade.

108
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,550
Even with the best memory,

109
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,560
the Queen herself, who made

110
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,870
the tattoo back then,

111
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,870
would hardly remember
all the details now, right?

112
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,510
However,

113
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,600
based on one last detail,

114
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,560
I could perhaps prove

115
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,600
that you are

116
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,120
not the Princess.

117
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,250
The crime of deceiving the Emperor,

118
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,920
plus your cooperation

119
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,360
with the Fengliu Shop.

120
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,870
When I accepted this role back then,

121
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,040
I already anticipated
that this day would come.

122
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,840
Do not think that you can use this

123
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,600
to threaten me to set Tang Lici up.

124
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,750
Threaten you?

125
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:26,950
No.

126
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,950
I'm not trying to threaten you.

127
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,950
I want to help you.

128
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,120
Help me?

129
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,480
Help you get him.

130
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,409
I have no idea what you're talking about.

131
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,150
He is the immensely wealthy Master

132
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,440
of Wanqiao Chamber,

133
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,200
Mister Fox of unrivaled wits.

134
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
He's handsome, mysterious,

135
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,680
unmatched in martial arts,

136
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,240
and extremely charming.

137
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,770
That day at Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

138
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,110
when you were on the brink
of breaking down,

139
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,440
he was the one who swooped in
and saved you.

140
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,270
Don't you

141
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,150
want to make him yours?

142
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,320
The Thousand Curse Needle.

143
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,150
I spent three years

144
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,120
refining it inside my body.

145
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,190
It works the same as a curse bug,

146
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,590
one that feeds

147
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,950
on my flesh and blood.

148
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,000
As long as you pierce it

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,260
into Tang Lici's body,

150
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,030
it will destroy

151
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,930
his cultivation of the Rebirth Scroll,

152
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,440
making him a weakling.

153
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,370
If you want something,

154
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,960
you've got to fight for it by yourself.

155
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,630
Others won't help you get them.

156
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,870
Just like you became
the Shanfeng Branch Chief

157
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,730
through someone else's charity.

158
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,670
But it was your own choice

159
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,270
that made you the nobler princess,

160
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,410
right?

161
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,870
Mother.

162
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,600
Good girl.

163
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,910
It's the most foolish decision to put

164
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,840
your fate in someone else's hands.

165
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,440
You can have Tang Lici,

166
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,100
although he doesn't love you.

167
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,300
Just like you could become a princess

168
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,790
even though you're not a real one.

169
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,160
Don't try to manipulate me.

170
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,010
Your Highness,

171
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,240
you just let your happiness

172
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,510
slip away.

173
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,920
Your Highness.

174
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,080
What is it?

175
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,000
Master Puzhu wants to see you,

176
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,870
saying that there's been a turn
in the battle at Tongsha River.

177
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,550
I see.

178
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,080
You may go first.

179
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,760
Understood.

180
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,210
Master!

181
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,390
Master,

182
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,790
Mr. Tang and his crew have departed.

183
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,320
Okay.

184
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,640
Master Jiang,

185
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,550
Chi Yun and I,

186
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,840
along with Shen Langhun,

187
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,670
have ridden the wild geese

188
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,670
to Puti Valley, deep in the Qin Mountains.

189
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,390
Puti Valley is in the back mountain.

190
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,200
Yique Yinyang

191
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,480
has built

192
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,390
a gigantic underground labyrinth there.

193
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,000
Only by passing through the labyrinth

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,060
can we find the Sky-reaching Pillar.

195
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,460
The three of us will take separate paths.

196
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,720
If the path leads
to the Sky-reaching Pillar,

197
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,050
we'll climb it carefully.

198
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,250
If we reach a dead end,

199
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,120
we'll return
to the starting point immediately

200
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,960
to support those who haven't come back.

201
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,150
At the banks of Tongsha River,

202
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,360
it's on you, Master Jiang,

203
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,220
to hold the fort

204
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,210
until
General Yuchi's reinforcements arrive.

205
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,910
Head Fang was

206
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,420
the pillar of the martial arts world.

207
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
No one is allowed

208
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,020
to desecrate his body.

209
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,100
Guys, heed my command!

210
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,980
-Yes!
-Yes!

211
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,010
The Yanmen Sect

212
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,500
must defend the Tongsha River

213
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,120
and wait for the arrival

214
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,400
of Mr. Tang's reinforcements!

215
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,140
-Yes!
-Yes!

216
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,480
Why does this Sky-reaching Pillar

217
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,510
look so similar

218
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,790
to the Mystic Tree

219
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,930
supporting the Tianren Realm?

220
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,610
What was Yique Yinyang's purpose

221
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,030
in making this?

222
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,690
This is my first time seeing it.

223
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,240
So this is what Yique Yinyang made.

224
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,440
He emptied all the distinguished families

225
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,240
in the Shu territory and Qianyun

226
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,510
and spent years

227
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,240
sacrificing millions of lives

228
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,790
to build this bronze tree.

229
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,940
[Sky-reaching Pillar]

230
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,910
Can't use the red silk here.

231
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,750
Looks like

232
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,960
something's off about this place.

233
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,960
No one can stop me from climbing up

234
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,420
the Sky-reaching Pillar.

235
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,390
What is this?

236
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,150
It hurts just to touch it.

237
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,680
How long will it take to climb this?

238
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,720
Is Fang Zhou's body

239
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,650
really up there?

240
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,670
Master Jiang.

241
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,530
Your Highness.

242
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,750
I heard they went to Puti Valley.

243
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,200
Yes.

244
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,640
How long ago?

245
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,530
An hour ago.

246
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,570
Master Jiang,

247
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,390
please lend me one of your wild geese.

248
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,440
I want to go help them.

249
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,240
Well...

250
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,600
I'll set off immediately.

251
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,240
Yuchi Hu,

252
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,510
you stay here

253
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,440
and assist Master Jiang as ordered.

254
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,570
Yes, Your Highness.

255
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,870
It took me great effort

256
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,870
just to climb up there.

257
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,070
Yet there was nothing.

258
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,800
That one on my path is also fake.

259
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,270
So Foxy Tang's got

260
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,240
the real one?

261
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,470
We need to help him.

262
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,560
Fang Zhou,

263
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,770
I'm here to save you.

264
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,240
Nice to see you again,

265
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,470
Holy Son,

266
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,760
Ajibanr Tang Jia.

267
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,360
Tuo Dragon.

268
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,770
You thought that by escaping to Shenzhou,

269
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,240
your fate

270
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,720
could just be changed?

271
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,830
If fate cannot be avoided,

272
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,310
then what is my fate

273
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,110
supposed to be?

274
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,590
I was born

275
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,680
to be locked up in the tower.

276
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,990
You deceived and trained me

277
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,820
to be
the so-called Tianren (celestial being).

278
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,400
Holy Son.

279
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,550
It's time for you to go slay demons.

280
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,350
Everyone is waiting

281
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,300
for you to save them.

282
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,100
And in the end,

283
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,900
I was supposed to die for you all

284
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,870
as a pitiful sacrifice

285
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,790
for Bai Nanzhu's wild desire
for immortality?

286
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,110
Whoever tries to change fate will be

287
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,590
bound by it!

288
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,350
Fang Zhou is dead.

289
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,960
You can't save him!

290
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,510
No,

291
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,800
Fang Zhou isn't dead yet.

292
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
I can save him.

293
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,270
And only I can save him.

294
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,920

doesn't that mean
you can finally have him?

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,400
you won't have to suffer so much.

381
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,320
You...

382
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:32,300
Everyone has feelings.

383
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,440
When you care,

384
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
you will be influenced by feelings.

385
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,020
No one can stay calm forever

386
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,240
unless they're

387
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,200
a puppet

388
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,030
like me.

389
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,200
I have no name.

390
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,350
I can neither cry nor laugh.

391
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,310
So emotions can never control me.

392
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,560
I'm not afraid of death either.

393
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,700
I'm the puppeteer behind the scenes.

394
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,800
Foxy Tang!

395
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,190
Foxy Tang.

396
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,300
Foxy Tang!

397
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,080
Why are you here?

398
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,030
Master Jiang told me

399
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,440
that you came to the Sky-reaching Pillar.

400
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,510
I was worried,

401
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,980
so I came as well.

402
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,030
What did you do to him?

403
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,310
I don't remember.

404
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,740
When I saw Mr. Tang,

405
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,030
my body was out of control,

406
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,260
and I stabbed him.

407
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,270
Someone must have used

408
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,800
some sort of evil curse bug.

409
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,520
Shen,

410
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,550
Foxy Tang is badly injured.

411
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,550
What should we do?

412
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,040
Let's return to the Sword Alliance

413
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,440
to meet Shui Duopo first.

414
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,210
Master Jiang,

415
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,500
that monster is way too powerful!

416
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,940
We can't hold on anymore!

417
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,820
Deploy the formation.
Defend the Tongsha River at all costs!

418
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,440
Yes!

419
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,790
Let me see

420
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,720
whether your Yanmen disciples
die out first

421
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,520
or I run out of ammunition first.

422
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,390
[Wanhua Hall]

423
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,449
This old Jiang's stubbornness is

424
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,889
really no joke.

425
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,590
Foxy Tang,

426
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:13,360
if you don't come back soon,

427
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,480
it'll be done for.

428
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,670
After days of fierce battle
at Tongsha River,

429
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,050
the Yanmen Sect has suffered great losses.

430
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,730
Our Yanmen fellows, who were
ready

431
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:21,880
to sacrifice themselves,

432
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,000
blocked the Fengliu Shop's attacks

433
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,030
for us.

434
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,760
It's because of their sacrifice

435
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,620
that we can still stand here today

436
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,489
and continue fighting
against the Fengliu Shop.

437
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,850
But now I want to tell you all

438
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
that if anyone wants to leave,

439
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,139
you may feel free to go.

440
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,719
It would also be a way

441
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:45,070
to preserve strength
for the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

442
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,360
Fengliu Shop is awash with great fighters.

443
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,630
Even Master Puzhu

444
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,110
and I are wounded.

445
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,000
Our odds

446
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,719
of winning are probably...

447
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,000
Master Shao,

448
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,230
there's nothing else to consider.

449
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,190
If we can't kill Liu Yan,

450
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,760
the worst case is
that we die trying. So what?

451
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,560
That's right.

452
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,550
If we shrink like cowards today,

453
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,250
how can we hold our heads up again?

454
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:05,780
Exactly.

455
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,070
I agree as well.

456
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,470
This is the first time
I've heard you curse.

457
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,760
Sword Master,

458
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,660
please command us
to prepare for battle immediately.

459
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,190
We'd like to follow Master Jiang's example

460
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,450
and fight to the death!

461
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,040
We'd like to follow Master Jiang's example

462
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,990
and fight to the death.

463
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,100
Fight to the death!

464
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,920
We'd like to follow Master Jiang's example

465
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,320
and fight to the death!

466
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,710
We'd like to follow Master Jiang's example

467
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,150
and fight to the death!

468
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,800
Good!

469
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,800
Very good.

470
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,550
After the battle at Tongsha River,

471
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,510
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

472
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,440
can still preserve some strength.

473
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,880
Palace Chief Wanyu is currently
meeting with His Majesty.

474
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,760
Now we just wait for the imperial court

475
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,800
and Biluo Palace to send reinforcements.

476
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,190
I hope you, all Sword Masters,

477
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,070
can hold on

478
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,350
until reinforcements arrive.

479
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,480
Radiant sunlight
shines upon our sharp swords!

480
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,510
Even in death, a hero's spirit endures!

481
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:07,840
Today,

482
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,510
the Central Plains Sword Alliance
vows to fight the Fengliu Shop

483
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,960
to the death!

484
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,840
Radiant sunlight

485
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,590
shines upon our sharp swords!

486
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,880
Even in death,

487
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,430
a hero's spirit endures!

488
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,150
Radiant sunlight

489
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,800
shines upon our sharp swords!

490
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,280
Even in death,

491
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,760
a hero's spirit endures!

492
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,920
The Central Plains Sword Alliance was
originally established

493
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,850
to break down background barriers

494
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
and uphold justice across the land.

495
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,670
I never expected

496
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,920
that in my lifetime,

497
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,030
I would witness the martial arts world
of the Central Plains

498
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,760
pulling together for one goal.

499
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,330
Even if I

500
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,840
die on Mount Cloud today,

501
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,800
I will have

502
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,010
no regrets in this life.

503
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,540
Activate the formation!

504
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,320
Shao Yanping has actually

505
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,960
activated
the Grand Mountain-Guarding Formation.

506
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,590
If we let them delay for one more day

507
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,270
and the imperial court's reinforcements
arrive,

508
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,360
I'm afraid we will return

509
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,760
empty-handed this time.

510
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,230
Master.

511
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,400
The child curse bug is born
upon the mother curse bug's death.

512
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,840
Zhong Chunji did help us in the end.

513
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
Tell Qiaoyi Qiankun

514
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,710
not to waste ammunition for now.

515
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,970
Ask him to hold the pass

516
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,290
and wait for my command.

517
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,520
Keep Tang Lici alive.

518
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,150
I want to kill him myself.

519
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,000
Yes.

520
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,280
Liu Yan has entered the Grand Formation.

521
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,230
Go ask Master Shao for help now!

522
00:37:59,230 --> 00:37:59,880
Let's go!

523
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,760
Hurry!

524
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,350
Move quickly!

525
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,080
Get going!

526
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,680
I've heard a lot
about Mount Cloud's magnificence

527
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,070
and splendor.

528
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,360
But seeing

529
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,550
these plain white banners today,

530
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,350
I feel they are

531
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
quite filthy.

532
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,150
The courtyard is full of white banners,

533
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,760
hung in honor of those who died fighting

534
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,960
for our Sword Alliance.

535
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,590
Master Liu, please mind your words.

536
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,250
With Tang Lici at Mount Cloud,

537
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,650
isn't it filthy enough?

538
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,150
You want Tang Lici?

539
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,360
Too bad.

540
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,030
He hasn't returned

541
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,440
ever since he left

542
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,960
the Tongsha River.

543
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,390
You're lying.

544
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,760
The Fengliu Shop's forces are

545
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,620
just 5 kilometers away from here.

546
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,050
Hand over Tang Lici,

547
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,650
and I can spare your lives.

548
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,710
Trading one man's life for the lives

549
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,760
of numerous heroic fighters

550
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,920
at Mount Cloud,

551
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,300
isn't that worth it?

552
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,400
Sacrificing for one man's life is

553
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,130
not worth it.

554
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,350
But if it's
for the meaning of righteousness,

555
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,650
even sacrificing
100,000 lives wouldn't be enough.

556
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,840
Protecting the one

557
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,360
who murdered the Seven‑String True Tune

558
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,950
and is suspected of being Yique Yinyang,

559
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,110
is it what you call righteousness?

560
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,760
Tang Lici is not at the Sword Alliance.

561
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
But even if he were,

562
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,420
I still wouldn't hand him over to you.

563
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,340
I refuse

564
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,880
because this is someone you want,

565
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,030
someone wanted by the Fengliu Shop,

566
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,030
which has committed countless crimes

567
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,630
and slaughtered innocents.

568
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,500
Whoever the Fengliu Shop wants,

569
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,190
whether he's a Tang, a Zhao,

570
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,190
a Gao, or a Song,

571
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,550
whether he's a martial artist or not,

572
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,510
the Central Plains Sword Alliance
will protect them.

573
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,440
Because the word "righteousness"

574
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,040
means reaching out to others.

575
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,500
The word "righteousness"

576
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,640
means eliminating evil.

577
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,030
Because the word "righteousness"
means that we must stand tall

578
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,760
and never yield to villainy!

579
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,000
Those words of yours

580
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
have wiped out
so many people's chances to survive.

581
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,550
Sacrifice hundreds of lives

582
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,320
for the sake of one person.

583
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,190
You're a group of good-for-nothings

584
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,030
fooled by Tang Lici.

585
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,320
Master Shao,

586
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,950
you think I didn't expect that you would

587
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,300
activate
the Grand Mountain-Guarding Formation?

588
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,740
I've got you more

589
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,110
than just the Nine Qilin Transformations

590
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,040
repaired by the Sky-Fallen Stone.

591
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,720
The Shattering Karma-Sea!

592
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,480
Raging Thunder!

593
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,110
Unable to tell loyalty from treachery,

594
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,400
right from wrong,

595
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,320
you've brought

596
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,150
all of this upon yourselves!

597
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,820
Pass on my command.

598
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,700
Go all out to attack the mountain!

599
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,360
Cross the river!

600
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,800
Charge!

601
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,510
Hold the Tongsha River!

602
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,150
Kill!

603
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,510
What is that?

604
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Trying to escape?

605
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,350
Master,

606
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,620
I've found the person you are after.

607
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,390
Tang Lici, do you think you can escape?

608
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,530
Master Shao.

609
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,570
How is it going?

610
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,080
As you expected,

611
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,970
Liu Yan indeed

612
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,500
went after Mr. Tang's ship.

613
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
At least we've got rid of

614
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,190
one of the Fengliu Shop's

615
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,720
most formidable fighters.

616
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,800
Next, we will

617
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,420
have to fight on our own.

618
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,760
As long as we hold out until tomorrow,

619
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,780
reinforcements will arrive.

620
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,050
Just not sure how long

621
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,240
they can hold him off on the ship.

622
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,850
That's what happened.

623
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,350
Ms. Zhong doesn't remember anything.

624
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,000
We had no choice but to come

625
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,070
and ask you to check on him.

626
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,030
How is he now?

627
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,770
The poison affecting him is really weird.

628
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,630
I can't work out

629
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,090
a better solution for now.

630
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,630
Meanwhile, that heart crystal is

631
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,360
also consuming his life force.

632
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,480
If we take it out,

633
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,610
I might be able to extend his life a bit.

634
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,340
He wouldn't agree to that.

635
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,050
Senior,

636
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,630
don't waste time.

637
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,030
Let's remove the heart crystal
to save him.

638
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,880
You think I want to waste time?

639
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,670
It's not hard to remove the heart crystal.

640
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,280
But to force all the poison in his body

641
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,230
into Fang Zhou's heart crystal
in his abdomen

642
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,230
requires his willing cooperation.

643
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,810
Unless he's willing to do it,

644
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,070
no one can force it.

645
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,190
Let's wait until he wakes up.

646
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,070
-Master Shao. -Master Shao.
-Master Shao.

647
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,540
Chunji told me

648
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,730
that she...

649
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,170
Master Shao,

650
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,840
please don't blame Ms. Zhong.

651
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
She was also manipulated by Liu Yan.

652
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,030
Everyone, things have come to this point.

653
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,760
I've got a nice plan up my sleeve

654
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,840
that needs help from you two.

655
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,980
Where is Tang Lici?

656
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,150
Tell him to come out and see me.
