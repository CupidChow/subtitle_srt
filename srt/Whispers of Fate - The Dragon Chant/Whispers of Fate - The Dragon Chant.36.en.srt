[Whispers of Fate]

2
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,940
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,310
Why did you

4
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,910
join the Sword Alliance?

5
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,950
Did Ghostly Peony send you here?

6
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,370
Mr. Tang, you jest.

7
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,789
Why mention

8
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,070
the deceased?

9
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,789
What was Ghostly Peony

10
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:45,950
to you?

11
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,150
Enemy,

12
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,570
benefactor,

13
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,070
master,

14
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,900
and mortal foe.

15
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,000
So complicated.

16
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,190
I wish I'd been the one who killed him.

17
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,500
How can you prove your innocence?

18
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,170
The innocent need no defense.

19
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,070
That saying

20
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,510
doesn't apply to you.

21
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,880
Miss, you attacked so suddenly—

22
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,340
what exactly do you want?

23
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,520
Just showing concern for a fellow member.

24
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,090
After today's test,

25
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,940
I can see that your power

26
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,680
has indeed fully recovered.

27
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,310
This is truly fortunate
for the Sword Alliance.

28
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,710
Then you should also know

29
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,390
that since I am

30
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,020
competing for Sword Master,

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,720
I'll

32
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,720
stop at nothing to succeed.

33
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,210
It's getting late.

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,470
I

35
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,250
won't keep you any longer.

36
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,310
Her cultivation technique

37
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,370
can actually affect my Tianren body.

38
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,480
Saving Chi Yun

39
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,090
cannot be delayed any longer.

40
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,850
But now

41
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,870
the Sword Alliance is in chaos.

42
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,520
Now, the poison pill crisis
has resurfaced.

43
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,630
What the alliance needs

44
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,680
is someone who can properly handle

45
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
it.

46
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,520
Mr. Tang, your martial arts skills

47
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,050
are unmatched in the world.

48
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,750
But in this matter,

49
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,850
you're still

50
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,900
no match for me.

51
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,960
There is another person
in the Sword Alliance.

52
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,570
She is perfect for this.

53
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,630
Enchantress, still trying to escape?

54
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,630
Stop right there!

55
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,740
I'll try this way, then.

56
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,920
Master Cheng.

57
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,790
You're in quite a hurry.

58
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,040
Where are you heading?

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,720
I just ran into

60
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,950
an enchantress from Fengliu Shop.

61
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,630
I saw her

62
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,830
running down the mountain.

63
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,430
But after chasing her for a while,

64
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,430
she disappeared.

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,980
Down the mountain?

66
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,310
But this isn't the path down the mountain.

67
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,130
She must have gone far by now.

68
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,210
Tomorrow I'll inform the Service Hall

69
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,000
to assign a disciple

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,800
to assist you personally, Master Cheng.

71
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,659
How about that?

72
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,510
Trying to win me over, are you?

73
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,040
Mr. Tang,

74
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,310
I didn’t expect you to start using

75
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,570
Xifang Tao's methods.

76
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,390
But any kindness from either of you

77
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,320
is unnecessary.

78
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,000
The vote in my hand

79
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,250
won't go to anyone,

80
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,690
including myself.

81
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,750
Don't worry, Master Cheng.

82
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,600
I

83
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,530
am not here to ask for your vote,

84
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,860
but for another matter.

85
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,670
Camellia Island has been imprisoning

86
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,510
many followers of Yique Yinyang.

87
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,050
Even after more than 10 years,

88
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,250
they're still alive.

89
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,190
So, Master Cheng,

90
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,920
you must be well-versed

91
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,600
in treating poisoned people.

92
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,810
To establish her image, Xifang Tao is

93
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,270
ruthless in dealing with those

94
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,600
who have taken the poison pill.

95
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,800
I don't want to see them die needlessly.

96
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,510
Young Lord Yu

97
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,180
has already returned to Sword King City.

98
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,980
I hope

99
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,310
you

100
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,270
can help

101
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,050
and work with Young Lord Yu

102
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,310
to establish a shelter in Sword King City

103
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,840
for those who are poisoned.

104
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,159
The old, weak, sick, and disabled

105
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,560
can all take refuge there

106
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,210
and find temporary safety.

107
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,460
Once the antidote is developed,

108
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,070
I'll

109
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,390
send it to Sword King City as well.

110
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,520
There's an antidote

111
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,650
for the poison pill?

112
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,710
There will be one in the future.

113
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:45,750
Mr. Tang.

114
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,830
You never used to

115
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,760
explain so much.

116
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,610
Because...

117
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,770
I've discovered

118
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,630
that not being misunderstood

119
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,800
by people like you

120
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,180
is actually a good thing.

121
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,870
With your experience

122
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,220
and Sword King City's help,

123
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,480
those who are poisoned

124
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,640
will be safe for now.

125
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,480
After I ask Senior Shui Duopo

126
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,610
to create the antidote,

127
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,870
I'll immediately set out to find Chi Yun.

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,560
The person Cheng Yunpao was chasing

129
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,360
was you.

130
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,370
This can heal your internal injuries.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,800
You came here—

132
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,240
did something happen to Liu Yan?

133
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,050
He's gone.

134
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,560
Ever since we escaped

135
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,040
from Shen Langhun...

136
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,240
he's become a completely different person.

137
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,270
We hid in

138
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,470
a thatched cottage in the countryside.

139
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,120
He spent day and night

140
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,650
immersed in medical texts.

141
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:10,820
Yan.

142
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,510
The meal is ready.

143
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,800
Why don't you try

144
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,700
a fruit first?

145
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,520
Let's eat.

146
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,760
Let's eat.

147
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,190
Master.

148
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,720
I heard Tang Lici

149
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,159
destroyed the Plum Garden

150
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,890
and eliminated Ghostly Peony.

151
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,590
It's not safe outside now.

152
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,480
We should stay here

153
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,600
and hide for a while.

154
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,860
Once your wounds heal,

155
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:58,750
I believe

156
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,390
we'll

157
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,560
rise again one day.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,730
Ghostly Peony deserved to die.

159
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,960
Don't call me "Master" anymore.

160
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,170
The Master of Fengliu Shop is dead.

161
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,080
From now on, I'm just Liu Yan.

162
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,650
I asked him what exactly he wanted to do.

163
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,520
He only said he was wrong.

164
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,990
You told him

165
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,850
that his life...

166
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,170
Your life is mine to take.

167
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,980
Now I want you to live.

168
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,600
Live and slowly

169
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
atone for all the evil

170
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,750
you've done.

171
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,310
He said only by developing

172
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,070
the antidote

173
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,770
would he have the courage
to face Fang Zhou.

174
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,270
Until this morning...

175
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,669
I heard

176
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,150
that the Sword Alliance has issued

177
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,950
a warrant for a man named Liu Yan.

178
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,720
They say he created

179
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,919
the Blood Ghost Pill.

180
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,000
The two of us rarely

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,750
leave home,

182
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,150
so I don't know much about
what's happening outside.

183
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,720
Then...

184
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,910
did they mention

185
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,240
what Liu Yan looks like?

186
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,680
They didn't give a clear description.

187
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,720
But there are

188
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,600
wanted posters everywhere.

189
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,200
I can't read,

190
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,540
so I only know what others have told me.

191
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,600
They say a new wave of the poison scourge
has begun

192
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,480
and that the notorious Liu Yan is
behind it once again.

193
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,550
The Central Plains Sword Alliance's

194
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,630
heroine, Xifang—or something like that—

195
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,030
is calling on everyone
to actively provide leads.

196
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,510
Miss.

197
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,320
You're educated.

198
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,440
Why don't you come with me
to check it out?

199
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,900
Come on.

200
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,550
Let's go.

201
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,480
I was worried he'd act impulsively

202
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,900
and seek revenge against Xifang Tao,

203
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,120
so I came here.

204
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,280
At this moment,

205
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,220
he wouldn't come here.

206
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,110
Then where would he go?

207
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Heartbreak Grass,

208
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,790
Wanli Weed,

209
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,150
and Midday Moon Herb...

210
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,720
Herbs...

211
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,600
I need herbs!

212
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,000
Look!

213
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,390
Isn't that the notorious leader
of Fengliu Shop,

214
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:37,870
Liu Yan?

215
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,720
That's right!

216
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,810
I'd recognize him
even if he turned to ashes!

217
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,310
Get him!

218
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:46,870
Liu Yan!

219
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,240
You've brought chaos to the world
with your heinous deeds!

220
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,720
How dare you show your face?

221
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,240
Fengliu Shop massacred
my entire Ziyang Sect—

222
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,170
only I survived!

223
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,840
My master and elder brother

224
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,720
were brutally killed by you
in Bohai County!

225
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,000
The disciples of Jianchi Sect
and Badao Manor

226
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,390
had their powers drained by Yu Qifeng—

227
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,790
all because of you!

228
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
The Sword Alliance has issued

229
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,960
a warrant for a man named Liu Yan.

230
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,120
They say he created

231
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,320
the Blood Ghost Pill.

232
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,340
It was me.

233
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,080
They say a new wave of the poison scourge
has begun...

234
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,610
It was me!

235
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,360
And that the notorious Liu Yan is
behind it once again.

236
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,440
Still me...

237
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:16,870
You will

238
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,750
die here tonight!

239
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,720
Kill him!

240
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,630
Anyone who stops me from finding the herbs

241
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,750
deserves to die!

242
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,570
You brought this upon yourselves!

243
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,530
No!

244
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,000
Run...

245
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,270
Let's go.

246
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,010
All of you, get out of here.

247
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,730
I don't want to hurt you...

248
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,750
He's gone mad.

249
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,600
He's gone mad!

250
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,910
Please cherish your hands.

251
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,580
They're very precious to me.

252
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,990
My hands are for healing and saving lives,

253
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,770
not for killing!

254
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,270
Look.

255
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,240
He's about to die from the poison!

256
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,150
Serves him right!

257
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,810
-He deserves to die!
-Indeed!

258
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,480
Yes!

259
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,270
Why are you all still standing here?

260
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,070
If I explode from the poison,

261
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,630
none of you will survive...

262
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,150
He's dead?

263
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,390
Now that he's dead,

264
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,110
his body won't explode, right?

265
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,240
Let's take his body

266
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,320
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

267
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,720
I heard there's a bounty.

268
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:38,920
Let's go!

269
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,120
Yan.

270
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:49,840
Yan!

271
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,150
Yan, wake up,

272
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,910
Yan.

273
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,200
He took the Blood Ghost Pill.

274
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
He's testing the poison on himself.

275
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,200
Yan.

276
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,100
Liu Yan.

277
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,320
The very thing

278
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,270
you created nearly killed you.

279
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,550
Tell me, aren't you

280
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,210
the biggest fool in the world?

281
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,840
Master,

282
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,180
don't leave me alone.

283
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,250
Get off him first.

284
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,210
Heartbreak Grass,

285
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,360
Wanli Weed,

286
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,200
and Midday Moon Herb...

287
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,240
I have all those

288
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,200
in my room.

289
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,240
Quick!

290
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,000
Catch him!

291
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,720
Hurry!

292
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,250
Get him!

293
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,880
Quick!

294
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,870
Yan,

295
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,870
run!

296
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,700
Don't let Yique Yinyang's men catch you!

297
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,440
Run!

298
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,730
That silhouette...

299
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,910
How did I...

300
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,240
Yan.

301
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,440
Are you going out to collect herbs?

302
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,000
Come on.

303
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,470

I should wake up now.

348
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,590
You're awake?

349
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
You took too many Blood Ghost Pills.

350
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,600
Testing poison on yourself—

351
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,800
aren't you afraid...

352
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,150
the poison will kill you

353
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,270
before you even manage to

354
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,390
develop an antidote?

355
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,270
If you die,

356
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,240
no one can undo the disaster
you've caused.

357
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,920
Have you ever thought about

358
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,140
how this would end?

359
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:26,109
You were wounded
by my Thousand Curse Needle.

360
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,840
All your organs are damaged,
leaving your qi and blood in disarray.

361
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,200
Have you thought about your own ending?

362
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,640
It has nothing to do with you.

363
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
The Blood Ghost Pill

364
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,000
is the evil thing I created,

365
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,440
and so is the Thousand Curse Needle.

366
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,400
How can it have nothing to do with me?

367
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,060
Take away the Rebirth Scroll.

368
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,940
The sins I cannot atone for—

369
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,140
at least you can atone for them.

370
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,050
If I take the Rebirth Scroll away,

371
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,460
you'll die.

372
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,760
Sit up properly.

373
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,550
You must stay alive.

374
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,350
From now on, the herbs you need

375
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,580
to develop the antidote

376
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,110
will be delivered regularly.

377
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,000
Right now, all the sects in the jianghu

378
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,130
are hunting for you.

379
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,120
Hide here and stay safe.

380
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,720
I used to think you were clever,

381
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,720
just a bit unhinged.

382
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,690
But now I see

383
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,160
you're not only a madman

384
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,720
but also a fool.

385
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,550
Everyone wants me dead,

386
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,240
yet here you are,
shielding me at great risk

387
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,970
to yourself.

388
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,000
Aren't you afraid you’ll

389
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,790
end up standing alone

390
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,990
against the entire martial arts world?

391
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,160
I don't care.

392
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,590
Yes.

393
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,170
You don't care about anything.

394
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,930
You don't care about your own life,

395
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,960
so what right do you have to arrange
other people's lives?

396
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,160
What makes you think you

397
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,110
can control everything

398
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,510
and bear all burdens?

399
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,750
Because I'm Tang Lici!

400
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,420
You haven't eaten all day.

401
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,810
I made something tasty.

402
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,310
It's just a bit burnt.

403
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,550
Mr. Tang, won't you stay for dinner?

404
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,350
No thanks.

405
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,570
Take good care of my senior.

406
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,550
Every evening after dinner,

407
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,980
give him one of the pills

408
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,350
I left for him.

409
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,920
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

410
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,960
What?

411
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,240
You find him very likable

412
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,150
and responsible, don't you?

413
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,190
I'm laughing because you two

414
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,000
are actually very similar deep down.

415
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,530
Why is it that when you meet,

416
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,080
you can't say a single nice word
to each other?

417
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,370
I'm nothing like him.

418
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,310
Time to eat.

419
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,990
I'll take

420
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,970
this medicine before meals.

421
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,250
Why did you save me?

422
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,160
Delicate as a lotus on the outside,
strong as jade within—

423
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,270
that is the daughter of the Bai family.

424
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,000
So how could I let your life be wasted?

425
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,160
Fengliu Shop is full of hidden talents.

426
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,680
Who is controlling the situation,

427
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,550
and who is

428
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,080
the hidden player pulling the strings—

429
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,940
outsiders have no way of knowing.

430
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,590
You want me

431
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,360
to assume a new identity

432
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,000
and infiltrate Fengliu Shop

433
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,840
to avenge my whole family?

434
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,750
Isn't that

435
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,400
what you wanted, miss?

436
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,160
Mr. Tang, I've discovered

437
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,960
that West Wind Garden is an abandoned
breeding ground

438
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,550
for curse bugs used by Yique Yinyang

439
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,480
and is also Fengliu Shop's

440
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,080
last remaining stronghold.

441
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,960
Little Fox,

442
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,310
why have you been

443
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,510
acting so mysteriously

444
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,440
since you returned from the bronze tree?

445
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,160
That old fellow Puzhu has been waiting
for you

446
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,030
at Wenxin Lake for days,

447
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,790
but you never showed up.

448
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,480
Do you know that?

449
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,350
Luckily, I'm smart enough.

450
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,280
I found you here.

451
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,920
Though you're competing for
the Sword Master position

452
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
to help out

453
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,030
that old man Shao Yanping,

454
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,550
since you're participating,

455
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,150
we should take it seriously.

456
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,550
Look at Xifang Tao.

457
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,590
She's been bustling about
enthusiastically

458
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,780
every day at the Sword Alliance,

459
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,070
instructing disciples in their practice,

460
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,110
sharing secret manuals,

461
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,590
and even donating

462
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,780
the spoils from raiding Fengliu Shop.

463
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,640
That boy Jiang Wenbo

464
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,440
is absolutely smitten with her.

465
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,480
That's nice.

466
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,720
Little Fox,

467
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,170
let me tell you,

468
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,510
I'm now

469
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,830
an Elder.

470
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,880
I have

471
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,750
10 votes.

472
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,030
Given our relationship,

473
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,690
1,000 taels

474
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,310
per vote.

475
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,140
How many do you want to buy?

476
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,680
None.

477
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,590
Well, if you lose,

478
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,790
don't be too upset.

479
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,550
You wouldn't even

480
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,440
spend this little money.

481
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,000
Even with Zhao Quanyang's blessing,

482
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,200
it's no surprise you won't get elected.

483
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,830
The election is imminent,

484
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,110
and I still don't know

485
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,840
what Xifang Tao is really up to.

486
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,680
There's still been no news from Chi Yun.

487
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,720
Mr. Tang,

488
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,100
I'll enter the West Wind Garden.

489
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,730
[West Wind Garden]

490
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,160
Also,

491
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,880
on my way to the West Wind Garden,

492
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
I ran into Chi Yun.

493
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,680
The remaining members of the Fengliu Shop

494
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,330
are hiding in the West Wind Garden,

495
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,510
continuing to produce the poison pill,

496
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,240
attempting to make a comeback.

497
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,960
The surrounding area is
extremely dangerous.

498
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,790
After you receive

499
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,000
this lead about Chi Yun,

500
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I hope you'll come and look for him
as soon as possible.

501
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,880
Bai Suche,

502
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,750
you've got guts.

503
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,110
You dared betray me

504
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:26,960
right in front of the Leader.

505
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,220
Now I can't explain myself to the Leader.

506
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,870
Why don't you come with me

507
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,110
to see what's actually hidden

508
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,440
in the Leader's garden?

509
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,510
Fine!

510
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,530
I'll go with you!

511
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,920
After knowing me for so long,

512
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,120
you still don't know I'm invulnerable?

513
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,830
You're finally here!

514
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,970
Dare to attack my woman?

515
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,460
You deserve to die.

516
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,370
The red lotus blooms for sinful karma,

517
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,830
bringing salvation to the living,
the dead,

518
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,790
and lost souls!

519
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,190
He actually followed me.

520
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,810
Are you alright?

521
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,410
What's going on?

522
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,170
It's dangerous.

523
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,510
Let's get out of here.

524
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,270
We've fallen into a trap.

525
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,720
Why are there so many poisoned people?

526
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,160
I'll clear a path for you.

527
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,890
You go first!

528
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,900
Save your strength!

529
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,960
Protect yourself!

530
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,200

Zhong Chunji

534
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,010
gave me a bolt of heavenly silk.

535
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,440
Have it made into robes
and embroidered with gold thread,

536
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,240
and they'll become the most beautiful

537
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,510
wedding garments in the world.

538
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,270
And a pair of matching bracelets

539
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,070
that allow the wearers
to sense each other.

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,170
If I can't make it out this time,

these will be your wedding gifts.

What do you mean?

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,070
You want me to marry someone else

If you can't

548
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,400
walk out of here alive with me,

549
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,200
I'll burn that stupid fabric
and those bracelets!

00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,880
remember something?

570
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,480
Why did you come?

571
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,030
Why didn't you leave?

572
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,840
I dragged you into this.

573
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,040
How long has Chi Yun been poisoned?

574
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,000
Three days and three nights.

575
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,510
This is

576
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,840
where Ghostly Peony refined his poisons,

577
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,090
and it's also the most venomous place
in the world.

578
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,110
The strong survive

579
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,030
by tearing at the flesh and blood
of the weak.

580
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,760
It's like...

581
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,750
It's like a...

582
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,750
An arena for the poisoned.

583
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,160
Yes.

584
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,310
Chi Yun has been infected

585
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,710
by their poisonous blood

586
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,480
and has become the most powerful
Poison King in the world.

587
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,440
If he wakes up,

588
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,290
he'll lose his mind.

589
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,000
Moreover,

590
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,030
this trap seems

591
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,160
to have been set specifically for him.

592
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,040
Mr. Tang, your blood can
neutralize the poison?

593
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,970
It can only suppress
the poison temporarily.

594
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,860
However...

595
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,430
I'll think of other methods.

596
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,480
Mr. Tang.

597
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,080
Thank you.

598
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,110
No, don't...

599
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,160
don't just stare at me like that.

600
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,020
Say something.

601
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,760
What should I remember?

602
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,400
This Worry-Relieving Pill

603
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,440
can make him temporarily forget

604
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,970
his most painful memories.

605
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,330
He'll forget me.

606
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,730
Don't let him see my face either.

607
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,710
It'll trigger his poison attack.

608
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,590
Yesterday, you were

609
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,450
drunk at the foot of the mountain.

610
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,480
That's it?

611
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:34,790
Yes.

612
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,320
That's all.

613
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,480
Foxy Tang.

614
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,160
This is the first time I've caught you

615
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,960
lying to me.

616
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,560
You're hiding something from me, right?

617
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,640
Tell me.

618
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,550
Am I dying from some incurable illness,

619
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:58,590
or

620
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,820
is it a hidden internal injury?

621
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,490
Chi Yun.

622
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,610
After you got drunk last night,

623
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,690
you were poisoned.

624
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,480
I knew it.

625
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,300
Which bastard did this to me?

626
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,300
I'll go after him!

627
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,560
That person is already dead.

628
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,750
You should return to Mount Cloud
for a few days.

629
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,960
Remember,

630
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,840
meditate more

631
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,469
and get plenty of rest.

632
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,320
Wait for me to detoxify you.

633
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,280
Got it.

634
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,770
With you around,

635
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,889
there's no poison you can't cure.

636
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,440
You're right.

637
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,239
There's no poison I can't cure.

638
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,500
Although...

639
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,449
this time will be a bit more troublesome.

640
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,420
Chi Yun's poison can't be suppressed
much longer.

641
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,510
I must find a way

642
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,110
to help Liu Yan accelerate

643
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,970
the development of the antidote.

644
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,530
I observe strict religious precepts.

645
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,030
I'm afraid I can't accept

646
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,270
your food and wine.

647
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,550
Perhaps you should offer them to the souls

648
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,680
of the Ranqing Sect who died unjustly.

649
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Our paths differ.

650
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,280
But we can still work together.

651
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,110
Sir, you saw

652
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,940
my golden eyes and forehead mark,

653
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,030
yet you didn't kill me.

654
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,560
Why did you save me instead?

655
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,240
After that great battle,

656
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,670
I went up the mountain to find you.

657
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,800
Within 500 zhang

658
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,790
of where Yu Qifeng died, nothing grows.

659
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,380
The poison has penetrated 10 zhang
into the ground,

660
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,000
and its toxicity is
extraordinarily severe.

661
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,600
It was you.

662
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:50,960
You contained that poisonous mist

663
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,690
within that 500-zhang radius,

664
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,930
preventing it from
spreading down the mountain

665
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,590
and harming innocent people.

666
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,930
So you're

667
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,570
concerned about me?

668
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,220
But perhaps...

669
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,400
I need this obsession

670
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,360
so I won't be

671
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,700
a wandering ghost.

672
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,250
Mr. Tang.

673
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,360
So you've been waiting for Mr. Tang.

674
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:37,440
Unfortunately, he's been quite busy
these days.

675
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,810
You shouldn't be here.

676
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,230
Now that my master is gone,

677
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,000
there is no "should"

678
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,930
or "shouldn't."

679
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,480
If I hadn't come here,

680
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,800
I wouldn't have gotten to see you.

681
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,510
You've had

682
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,350
many things to handle recently.

683
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,860
Sir, you're not being honest.

684
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,120
It's not that I'm busy—

685
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,120
it's that you've been avoiding me.

686
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,740
News came from Tianjing Pavilion

687
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,020
that the Pavilion Master is gravely ill

688
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,590
and has summoned me back at once.

689
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,510
Master Shao says

690
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,360
I save others but do not care for them,

691
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,530
yet he doesn't know that I help others
to help myself.

692
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,000
I cannot let go of worldly attachments,

693
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,550
so my master only accepted me

694
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,710
as a lay disciple.

695
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,170
This time,

696
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,460
I'll take over Tianjing Pavilion...

697
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,080
and never return to
the secular world again.

698
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,770
You chose Mr. Tang.

699
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,530
I cannot decide
which of the three of you...

700
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,360
is most fit to be the Sword Master.

701
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,850
I abstain

702
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,010
from voting.

703
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,670
Your leaving...

704
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,720
hurts me much more

705
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,890
than losing your vote.

706
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,770

despite everything.

750
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,030

like Xifang Tao, they

755
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,250
don't want

756
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,280
the Evil Pill crisis to end quickly.

757
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,360
But there's no need to worry.

758
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,730
I've asked Master Cheng

759
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,150
to relocate all the poisoned victims

760
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,480
to Sword King City.

761
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,800
Once the antidote is developed,

762
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,590
their plot

763
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,880
will collapse on its own.

764
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,420
However, Senior Shui says

765
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,480
that the Blood Ghost Pill is
extremely complex.

766
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,360
The antidote's development

767
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,360
might still be far from completion.

768
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,070
With only one Physician of Miracle,

769
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,670
progress is naturally slow.

770
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,800
But if...

771
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,570
Master Shao.

772
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,050
This is a list of medicinal herbs.

773
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,030
Master Shao, I'd like to trouble you

774
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,510
to deliver the herbs on the list

775
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,880
to the marked location

776
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,080
on the back of the map.

777
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,320
There's

778
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,610
also a divine physician there.

779
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,280
Rest assured.

780
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,640
I'll take care of it.

781
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,210
Master Shao,

782
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,430
aren't you going to ask me

783
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,760
who these ingredients

784
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,630
are for?

785
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,000
I've never studied medicine.

786
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,320
Even if you told me,
I wouldn't understand,

787
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,120
so I won't ask.

788
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,710
But rest assured,

789
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,210
this old man can still handle tasks

790
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,630
like running errands
and delivering messages.

791
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,030
They're for that person.

792
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,680
He's...

793
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,890
staying there.

794
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,260
Is that place...

795
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,630
safe enough?

796
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,400
If Xifang Tao

797
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,230
seizes the Sword Master position,

798
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,030
then there will be

799
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,830
no safe place left under heaven.

800
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,480
While you've been busy,

801
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,340
she hasn't been idle for a moment—

802
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,140
seeking support everywhere.

803
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,840
I think I just heard

804
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,260
that she went to see Chunji again.

805
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:18,630
Anyway,

806
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,700
I can rest easy knowing

807
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,790
this matter is in your hands.

808
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,280
I'm leaving.

809
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,510
You always come and go in such a hurry.

810
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,770
At least finish your tea before leaving.

811
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,320
I forgot

812
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,150
that you don't like Master Cheng's tea.

813
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,810
Let me get you something else.

814
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,710
It's fine.

815
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,480
Many things

816
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,520
you don't like at first,

817
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,760
but as you keep trying them,

818
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,820
you get used to them

819
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,490
and eventually come to like them.

820
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,110
You

821
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,680
shouldn't force yourself.

822
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,450
Master Shao, rest assured,

823
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,280
I have

824
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,060
always been the one...

825
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,810
forcing others.

826
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,830
That's right.

827
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,490
What are you looking at, Your Highness?

828
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,070
I'm looking at

829
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,000
the scenery my master saw that day.

830
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,590
I want to know

831
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,890
what Mount Cloud looks like

832
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,630
in my master's eyes.

833
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,070
Xifang Tao

834
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,930
requests an audience with the Princess.

835
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,690
What a beautifully vivid butterfly.

836
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,170
It's a pity that...

837
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,710
it's only an ornament,

838
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,840
made by human hands,

839
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,160
unable to spread its wings and fly.

840
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,160
Do you like it, Miss Xifang?

841
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,670
I do.

842
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,330
It's yours then.

843
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,150
I prefer

844
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,510
the one on you.

845
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,010
After all,

846
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,710
who doesn't enjoy

847
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,970
having something to manipulate at will?

848
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,690
How dare you!

849
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,630
Your Highness should keep your voice down.

850
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,850
After all, if anyone hears

851
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:38,690
this,

852
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,270
you won't survive.

853
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,050
Are you wondering

854
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,840
how I knew about it even though I wasn't

855
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,420
at the Peony Pavilion that day?

856
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,610
Like Liu Yan, you're

857
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,860
trying to use it to threaten me?

858
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,710
Threaten?

859
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:04,670
No.

860
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,170
I'm offering you a deal.

861
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,520
You can continue being a princess,

862
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,190
and I'll become the Sword Master.

863
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,720
If we two women join forces,

864
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,840
both the imperial court

865
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,760
and the jianghu

866
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,510
will be under our control.

867
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,760
Wouldn't that be

868
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:25,510
a wonderful world?
