[Zhoudi Tower]

4
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,470
Lici, what are you doing?

5
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,280
The Three Character Classic?

6
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,120
Fang Zhou asked you to transcribe it?

7
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Indeed.

8
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,920
You are supposed

9
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,250
to study this properly.

10
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,070
[Fang Zhou]

11
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,010
Why did you write this?

12
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,000
Fang Zhou

13
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,190
asked me

14
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,079
to write the name.

15
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,120
He meant for you to write

16
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,280
your own name.

17
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,370
Silly boy.

18
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:22,980
Come on,

19
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,980
give me the pen.

20
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,840
Tang,

21
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,470
Li,

22
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,030
Ci.

23
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,030
But there are only

24
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,000
two names on it.

25
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,960
For fairness,

26
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,920
let's add the others as well.

27
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:50,570
[Liu Yan]

28
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,079
Fu,

29
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:53,910
come here.

30
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,380
Hurry up.

31
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,310
Give me your hand.

32
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,130
[Fu Zhumei]

33
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,930
You came all this way
to find the Physician of Miracle

34
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,460
only to end up like this.

35
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:55,770
What?

36
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,190
You can't trick me out of

37
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,210
the other half of the Rebirth Scroll,

38
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,270
so you're anxious?

39
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,680
What a pity

40
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,990
that you've run into me again.

41
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,710
Once I'm here,

42
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,590
you just can't escape.

43
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,000
There's a barrier here.

44
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,680
We both have our strength

45
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,480
reduced to less than 30 percent.

46
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,160
Just now,

47
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,800
it was because you

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,190
fell into this barrier

49
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,070
that the Floating Red Worm Silk

50
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,550
slipped off you.

51
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,310
You can't kill me now.

52
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,810
You can only stay here and listen to me.

53
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,540
Listen to your gibberish?

54
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,090
You'll have to listen anyway.

55
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,480
Were it not for you,

56
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,000
I wouldn't have fallen down here.

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,870
Are you saying

58
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,550
that I got you into danger?

59
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,159
Liu Yan,

60
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,920
do you really think

61
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,600
that our seven years of friendship were

62
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,830
something I faked

63
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,250
day after day?

64
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,310
For others,

65
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,680
it might be impossible.

66
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,160
But for you,

67
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,870
Tang Lici,

68
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,970
it might not be so difficult.

69
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,510
Perhaps I could pull it off now,

70
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,100
but the old me

71
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,150
definitely couldn't.

72
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,430
Given the ceaseless strong winds here,

73
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,800
there must be a vortex

74
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,880
below the abyss.

75
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,990
With just one person's strength,

76
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,430
neither of us can

77
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,310
get out of here.

78
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,560
So...

79
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,810
What trick are you playing this time?

80
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,550
I'll dive into the vortex

81
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,950
and block it
with sound waves from my flute.

82
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,170
The strong winds will stop temporarily.

83
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,360
If we're lucky,

84
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,780
this pulling force

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,950
will cease.

86
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,850
And you can go up.

87
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,390
Can this really work?

88
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,480
Not sure.

89
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,510
But we can only try this way.

90
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,280
I can only block the vortex for a moment.

91
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,940
When it's done,

92
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,540
we both need to move quickly.

93
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,080
Infused with inner strength,
the Floating Red Worm Silk

94
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,710
can extend

95
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,320
to 166 meters at most.

96
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,350
After I block the vortex,

97
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,810
I'll shake the red silk.

98
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,690
At that moment,

99
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,390
you should use the same force

100
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,000
to shake the other end of the silk.

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,630
Our combined forces will hit
the bottom of the cliff.

102
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,950
Then, with the counterforce
of the Sound Killing Technique,

103
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,280
you can escape from here

104
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,130
and pull me out as well.

105
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,600
Should I repeat that?

106
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,909
Do you even know what you're saying?

107
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,040
Don't bother.

108
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,420
I'm injured

109
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,070
and can only use Sound Killing once.

110
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,670
Seize the chance on your own.

111
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,310
Wait!

112
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,430
Found it.

113
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,460
White Dragon Dance of Supreme Energy.

114
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,520
The flute sound is weak.

115
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,760
He's more severely injured than I thought.

116
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,870
Yan,

117
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,000
Zhoudi Tower once had a duet

118
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,680
that could multiply

119
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,010
the powers of both players temporarily.

120
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,600
Trust.

121
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,700
As long as there's mutual trust,

122
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,620
the melody
can just greatly boost our powers.

123
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,980
That melody is called

124
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,370
Clear Rivers, Calm Seas,

125
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,300
Peaceful World.

126
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,840
Liu Yan,

127
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,610
meet me at the Zhoudi Tower
in half a month.

128
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,750
Tang Lici!

129
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,440
Tang Lici!

130
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,240
Tang Lici!

131
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,660
Master!

132
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,510
I don't have time to mess with you today.

133
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,240
Get lost!

134
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,670
Where is Tang Lici?

135
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,330
I also want to know where he is!

136
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,440
Right,

137
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,300
the Zhoudi Tower.

138
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,730
[Time-Space Rift, Mount Baojing]

139
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,910
Gumo State was only

140
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,910
the size of a city.

141
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,440
To stop the plague from spreading,

142
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,670
the King gathered the bodies
and burned them.

143
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,560
In a single night,

144
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,160
the entire city burned down.

145
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,480
Gumo State?

146
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:04,810
It seems

147
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,940
that I'm at the ruins of Gumo State.

148
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,340
But why do these murals

149
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,890
give off a vibe of the Tianren Realm?

150
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,990
Over five decades ago,

151
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,670
I broke through the Void

152
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,270
and left the Tianren Realm.

153
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,310
But I was attacked

154
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,640
by a Tuo Dragon
surviving at the Void's edge,

155
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,170
which severely injured me.

156
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,130
In my haste,

157
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,890
I landed in Gumo State in Shenzhou.

158
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,330
It was exactly where

159
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,630
I met

160
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,960
this state's princess.

161
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,960
Who's there?

162
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,450
Why are you lying on the altar?

163
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,550
Who are you?

164
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,020
Can you hear me?

165
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,750
What happened to you?

166
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
There are wounds all over your body.

167
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,860
Your wounds

168
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,170
healed on their own!

169
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,810
Are you a deity from heaven?

170
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,080
This is my first time

171
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,000
seeing a deity.

172
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,580
Just like

173
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,720
the legends say.

174
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,440
What's your name?

175
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,150
My name is

176
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,030
Ye Mo.

177
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,030
Ye Mo?

178
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,890
The King of Gumo State believed
my appearance

179
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,910
meant he had received

180
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,170
the gods' protection.

181
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,630
He begged me to stay.

182
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,030
Princess Xi Ya
stayed by my side all the time

183
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,790
and told me

184
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,750
many things about Shenzhou.

185
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,320
Those were

186
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,520
my happiest moments.

187
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,870
I was so happy

188
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,440
that I almost forgot

189
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,000
why I came here.

190
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,270
This is Gumo State's sacred relic

191
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,960
passed down through generations.

192
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,820
They say it also fell from heaven.

193
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,530
I'll give it to you as a token.

194
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,160
But the good times didn't last.

195
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,320
Gumo State was struck

196
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,120
by a once-in-a-century plague.

197
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,190
Countless people suffered and died.

198
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,670
State Deity, please use your magic
to save our people.

199
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,480
What can I do to eliminate the plague?

200
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,440
State Deity,

201
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,160
the Ancestor of Gumo State

202
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,560
built this altar here

203
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,790
because this place

204
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,990
connects to the state's every ley line.

205
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,670
The Ancestor's prophecy said

206
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,180
that after the altar was completed,

207
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,380
an immortal would descend from heaven.

208
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,370
If the state faced danger,

209
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,990
he would use the Heaven-Halo Technique

210
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,550
to absorb all the miasma

211
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,350
hidden in the state's ley lines.

212
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,070
Heaven-Halo Technique?

213
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,960
With this altar,

214
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,950
you can guide the ley line energy

215
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,950
through your self-healing body

216
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,210
to purify the miasma.

217
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,300
I was a bit confused back then.

218
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,670
How did the King know

219
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,070
the secret technique of the Tianren Realm?

220
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,200
But I was so focused on saving people

221
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,260
that I didn't think too much about it.

222
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,480
I only realized later

223
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,120
that he was

224
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,480
up to something else.

225
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,670
He's invaded my mind?

226
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,840
The secret scroll does tell the truth.

227
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,460
The Heaven-Halo Technique can
make energy channels vibrate,

228
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,300
allowing

229
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,330
the casters' minds to be exchanged.

230
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,860
This is a way to obtain the divine body
to become a god.

231
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,670
The Tianren Realm had taken

232
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,870
so many people's luck

233
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,910
to ascend to heaven from Gumo State.

234
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,870
Now it's just karma coming full circle.

235
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,200
The plague is raging now.

236
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,120
If you do this,

237
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,920
what about those common people?

238
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,750
You're too naive.

239
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,670
The plague isn't real.

240
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,440
Everyone's been lying to you.

241
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,640
I've broken free from control?

242
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,750
The remaining Tianren Realm power

243
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,610
in the bracelet

244
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,330
helped stabilize my energy channels.

245
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,260
Get out!

246
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,270
The State Deity killed the King!

247
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,360
Catch him quickly!

248
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,600
Get him!

249
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,730
Our ascension plan failed!

250
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,510
He's trying to prevent us all

251
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,720
from ascending to heaven.

252
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,440
He's the one who made us

253
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,700
unable to become gods!

254
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,030
Only by burning him to death

255
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,830
can we prevent his revenge on us!

256
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,790
The fire burned for three whole days.

257
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,440
My body festered and healed
over and over again.

258
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,800
At that moment, I realized

259
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,270
that places outside the Tianren Realm are

260
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,000
crawling with worthless,

261
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,790
inferior, and foolish beings.

262
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,069
They shouldn't exist.

263
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,880
Only through slaughter

264
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,170
can they be completely purified.

265
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,310
This is true compassion.

266
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,920
Ye Mo! Ye Mo!

267
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,680
I came too late.

268
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,680
How hypocritical.

269
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,130
You're just utilizing me,

270
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,750
like your father did.

271
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,930
That's not true.

272
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,070
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,720
I really didn't know

274
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,320
this was my father's scheme.

275
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,780
You wanted me
to open the Heaven Halo

276
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,110
to purify the ley lines.

277
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,920
Fine then.

278
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,920
I know what to do now.

279
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,600
What needs
to be purified isn't the plague,

280
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,350
but their sins.

281
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,570
Heaven being centered,

282
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,120
stars align.

283
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,260
Earth being centered,

284
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,810
yin and yang harmonize.

285
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,530
From now on, I shall be called

286
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,180
Yique Yinyang.

287
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,380
Holy Son of the Tianren Realm,

288
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,030
have you

289
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,880
seen clearly?

290
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,880
Someday,

291
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,020
you'll also need to make a choice,

292
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,470
just like I did back then.

293
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,870
He deliberately

294
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,460
left these things for me

295
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,430
to see.

296
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,200
But how did he know

297
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,070
that I would come to Shenzhou

298
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,470
and that I'm the Holy Son?

299
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,920
Could it be

300
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,370
that Yique Yinyang is still alive?

301
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,830
He's been watching me all along?

302
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,320
Didn't expect this child

303
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,270
to actually

304
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,200
bring back the Glowing Meteorite.

305
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,920
We've got the medicine,

306
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,640
but the patient is missing.

307
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,370
Where on earth did Foxy Tang go?

308
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,450
Never mind,

309
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,490
I'll go find him.

310
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,880
Mr. Tang.

311
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,180
Chi Yun,

312
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,680
when will you learn

313
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,720
to be patient?

314
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,960
I was worried about you.

315
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,750
I'm fine.

316
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,310
Senior,

317
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,300
may I have a word with you?

318
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,590
Senior, may I ask

319
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,530
about your relationship
with Yique Yinyang?

320
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,880
In a time-space rift

321
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,240
at Mount Baojing,

322
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,550
I saw a memory fragment

323
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,550
of Yique Yinyang.

324
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,020
You've met Yique Yinyang before.

325
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,350
I am a personal maid

326
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,350
of Princess Xi Ya.

327
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,200
Let me guess.

328
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,000
Earlier, you were

329
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,260
hiding things from me,

330
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,960
but now you're being frank.

331
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,260
Tianren Realm?

332
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,830
What place is that?

333
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,910
I've never heard of it.

334
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,050
It's because

335
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,740
you once planned to trap me

336
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,380
in the time-space rift at Mount Baojing,

337
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,440
but unexpectedly,

338
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,300
I made it back.

339
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,640
You're quite smart.

340
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,960
And perceptive too.

341
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,240
Not only did you make it back alive,

342
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,410
but you even managed

343
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,310
to get the Glowing Meteorite.

344
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,160
Then, Senior, you can

345
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,290
start saving me now.

346
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,000
I

347
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
won't save you.

348
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,030
I only said this could

349
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,920
serve as an ingredient for your medicine.

350
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,650
Never did I say I would save you.

351
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,260
I saw with my own eyes

352
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,370
how the Princess's compassion

353
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,110
allowed Yique Yinyang

354
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,680
to bring disaster upon the world.

355
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,350
You and he share the same origin.

356
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,270
Even if right now,

357
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,860
you still have some good intentions,

358
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,520
there's no guarantee that you won't be

359
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,210
consumed by evil thoughts someday,

360
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,270
turning into a second Yique Yinyang.

361
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,190
I won't let this happen.

362
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,850
Moreover,

363
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,970
you did hesitate between saving others

364
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,160
and saving yourself,

365
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,510
didn't you?

366
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,720
Can't believe

367
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,880
the world is so absurd

368
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,110
that it is even wrong for a person to try

369
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,240
to save his own life.

370
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,960
As the Physician of Miracle,

371
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,270
you must've seen countless beings

372
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,130
struggling on the brink of death.

373
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,810
I believe

374
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,750
the desire to survive is

375
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,120
a human instinct.

376
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,030
Or is it

377
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,060
that everyone has the right to live

378
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,590
except for me?

379
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,160
Not just you,

380
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,260
even I have asked myself

381
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,740
whether I deserve

382
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,940
to live in this world.

383
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,960
But not until I saw

384
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,440
those memory fragments

385
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,510
did I realize

386
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,290
how terribly wrong I was.

387
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,640
I should survive.

388
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,090
Even

389
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,750
Ye Mo back then

390
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,020
deserved to survive, too.

391
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,610
Yique Yinyang summoned heavenly fire

392
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,450
and slaughtered the Gumo State.

393
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,130
Are you trying to defend him?

394
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,850
I'm just thinking

395
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,120
how lucky I am compared to Ye Mo.

396
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,270
Ye Mo

397
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,800
descended upon Gumo State,

398
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,270
so Yique Yinyang

399
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,930
came into being in this world.

400
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,070
And I was fortunate enough

401
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,330
that Fang Zhou took me in at Zhoudi Tower.

402
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,940
That's why even now,

403
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,350
I can still be Tang Lici.

404
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,830
You're simply trying to say

405
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,720
that you're not like him.

406
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,570
But they didn't deserve to die, right?

407
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,490
Yet they were indeed

408
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,070
the ones who created Yique Yinyang.

409
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,930
But you feel compassion for them.

410
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,390
What about Fang Zhou?

411
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,440
What do you mean?

412
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,760
Senior,

413
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,160
even if you still think

414
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,960
that I deserve to die,

415
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,800
Fang Zhou's heart crystal is

416
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,840
inside my body now.

417
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
If you kill me,

418
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,000
you'll be killing

419
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,200
the world's most honorable gentleman,

420
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,050
the Seven‑String True Tune,

421
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,050
Fang Zhou.

422
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,870
Come here in three days

423
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
for the medicine.

424
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,190
Ms. Zhong, this way,

425
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,720
please.

426
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,640
What's this?

427
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,360
The Princess's swaddling clothes
from when she was little.

428
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,640
Her Highness has kept them all these years

429
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,700
to comfort her longing for her child.

430
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,200
Her Highness misses her daughter dearly

431
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,550
and has already come here.

432
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,280
Ms. Zhong, please get changed.

433
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,120
Miss,

434
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,530
these ornaments...

435
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Are they all

436
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,680
for me to wear?

437
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,970
Ms. Zhong, compared to your noble status,

438
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,350
these items to be used on you are

439
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,410
nothing precious.

440
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,370
Let me dress your hair.

441
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,670
Your Highness.

442
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:27,860
My child!

443
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,200
My child.

444
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,780
Your Highness.

445
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,590
My child!

446
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,210
I've finally found you.

447
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,970
I've missed you so much.

448
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,400
My child.

449
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,240
You've suffered so much.

450
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,460
Your father and I have failed you.

451
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,380
Don't worry.

452
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,350
From now on, I will

453
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,480
do everything to protect you,

454
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,230
love you,

455
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,640
and give you everything you want.

456
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,150
Mother.

457
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,680
Good girl.

458
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
The medicine is ready.

459
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,110
There are three pills in total.

460
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,070
Each one can extend your life once.

461
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,640
Take it,

462
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,000
and your martial powers will be restored

463
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,140
as if nothing happened.

464
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,200
Your hair will also turn black again.

465
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,070
But there are only three pills.

466
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,150
Once you consume them all,

467
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,680
no one can save you anymore.

468
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,510
I understand.

469
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,610
I have one more condition.

470
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,850
Please go ahead, Senior.

471
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,440
I want to go with you
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

472
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,130
I must

473
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,870
keep an eye on my patient.

474
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,880
That's great.

475
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,760
The Sword Alliance

476
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,060
will give you the warmest welcome.

477
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,440
I'm back!

478
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,270
Come on,

479
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,240
come welcome me.

480
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,180
Where is everyone?

481
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,480
Where are they?

482
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:57,850
Senior, this way.

483
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,710
Here they come.

484
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,840
Master Shao,

485
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,750
Mr. Tang has brought

486
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,480
the Physician of Miracle back.

487
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,890
So you're that...

488
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,960
This is the Physician of Miracle,

489
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,680
Shui Duopo.

490
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,030
So you're the renowned Senior Shui Duopo.

491
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,030
My apologies.

492
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,870
Look at yourself.

493
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,710
How can you call me "Senior"?

494
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:25,950
It's okay.

495
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,460
With your leg in such a terrible state,

496
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,920
just skip the formalities

497
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,790
and sit down.

498
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,010
Sit down, please.

499
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,750
Is Mr. Tang fully recovered?

500
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,950
He's doing very well.

501
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,830
Then, Miss Shui,

502
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,820
please check on Master Puzhu.

503
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,650
Don't worry.

504
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,640
As long as his leg is still attached,

505
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,700
I can fix it anyway.

506
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,630
Thank you, Senior Shui.

507
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,150
By the way, Master Shao,

508
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,310
Mr. Tang has already set off

509
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,240
for Wanhua Hall.

510
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,280
Then let's go to Wanhua Hall

511
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,430
and leave Miss Shui to the treatment.

512
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,060
Please.

513
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,690
Liu Yan,

514
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,670
I'll send you up first with the red silk.

515
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,330
Otherwise,

516
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,310
both of us

517
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,350
will die here.

518
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,530
Do you really think

519
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,030
that our seven years of friendship were

520
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,310
something I faked

521
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,440
day after day?

522
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,240
If what Tang Lici said is true,

523
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,880
then what's the point

524
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,280
of everything I've done?

525
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,880
Master!

526
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,030
Master!

527
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,550
I've been refining
these Thousand Curse Needles every day,

528
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,880
but what's the point?

529
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,660
Master, what are you saying?

530
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,460
What's wrong?

531
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,000
While you were

532
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,760
looking for Senior Shui Duopo,

533
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,470
we found out

534
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,730
that the person behind the Fengliu Shop is

535
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,990
called Ghostly Peony.

536
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,720
What?

537
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:06,980
You know him?

538
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,780
I once ran into him

539
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,890
in Sanqin.

540
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,640
How may I address you?

541
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,610
Ghostly Peony.

542
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,970
When I was trying to kill Yu Qifeng

543
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,380
at Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

544
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,790
a teenage boy

545
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,700
came out of nowhere and rescued Yu Qifeng.

546
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,810
You acted on impulse

547
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,540
and nearly ruined everything.

548
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,770
He sounded

549
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,680
exactly like Ghostly Peony,

550
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,200
yet his physique

551
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,090
didn't seem human.

552
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,310
Perhaps

553
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
it was a puppet.

554
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,710
When Chi Yun chased Fang Pingzhai

555
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,780
to Buhuan Tower,

556
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,480
he also found a puppet

557
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,360
giving orders to Qiaoyi Qiankun.

558
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,000
According to the captured disciples
of Fengliu Shop,

559
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,190
they often saw Liu Yan

560
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,440
having secret talks
with an opera performer.

561
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,320
They heard Liu Yan call this person

562
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,030
Leader.

563
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:09,520
An opera performer?

564
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:12,670
Godfather,

565
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,840
Liu Yan's been
acting weird since he returned

566
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,969
from Mount Baojing.

567
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,620
Judging by his expression,

568
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,620
something's off.

569
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:37,770
Did I scare you?

570
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,710
No.

571
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,100
This isn't fun.

572
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,489
Is Liu Yan

573
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,739
going to leave?

574
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,560
Why is he leaving all of a sudden?

575
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,050
He wants to get rid of my surveillance.

576
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,320
Why does he want to get rid

577
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,580
of your surveillance?

578
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,360
What is he planning?

579
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,290
Every time he meets with Tang Lici,

580
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,760
he gets a bit weirder.

581
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,840
It seems

582
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,940
that I need to move up my plan.

583
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,260
Fang Pingzhai!

584
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,520
I've finished making the things

585
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,180
that Fang Pingzhai asked for.

586
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,560
Sword Master Shao Yanping
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

587
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,290
and Guest of Honor, Tang Lici,
please receive the imperial decree.

588
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,740
I, Tang Lici...

589
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,350
-I, Shao Yanping, receive the decree.
-Receive the decree.

590
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,910
By heaven's will

591
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,440
and sacred rites,

592
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,760
here's the imperial decree.

593
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,280
His Majesty's daughter,
Princess Lang Ya, was

594
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,610
lost in chaos
like a pearl covered in dust.

595
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,900
Fortunately, with heaven's blessing

596
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,700
and the help
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

597
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,720
we were reunited.

598
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,140
Sword Master Shao Yanping
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

599
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,740
nurtured the Princess
with great dedication.

600
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,750
He is hereby granted 500 taels of gold,

601
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,980
a bushel of pearls,

602
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,940
and the right to enter court
without bowing

603
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,270
or handing in his sword.

604
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,060
He is bestowed the title,
"Imperial Princess's Preceptor."

605
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,190
Tang Lici, Master of Wanqiao Chamber,

606
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,930
saved the Princess.

607
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,460
He is appointed
as the Court Gentleman for Consultation.

608
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,330
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

609
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,190
Master Shao.

610
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,220
Everyone, please rise.

611
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:30,780
Master Shao.

612
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,330
Yes.

613
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,140
This time,

614
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,960
His Majesty is so pleased to have

615
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,490
his beloved daughter back.

616
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,770
These are exceptional rewards
for the Sword Alliance.

617
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:41,430
As you know,

618
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,370
according to our agreement,

619
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,880
the court and jianghu
do not interfere with each other.

620
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,340
So in the future, it will still be that

621
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,550
jianghu matters are
only settled in the jianghu.

622
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,550
But rest assured.

623
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,900
This time, the court

624
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,830
will send more forces to assist you

625
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,710
in destroying the Fengliu Shop.

626
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,240
However,

627
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,060
we still need to rely

628
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,470
on the power
of your Central Plains Sword Alliance.

629
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,400
I understand.

630
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,990
Everyone,

631
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,970
out of deep concern about the Princess,

632
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,970
His Majesty has specially sent
the imperial palace's top martial artist,

633
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,040
General Yuchi, to assist you.

634
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,330
I've met with you all before.

635
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,460
My mission is to protect the Princess.

636
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,370
Though I'm in the Sword Alliance,

637
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,160
I only obey

638
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,650
the Princess's commands.

639
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,700
That won't do.

640
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,140
You also need to listen
to my master and Mr. Tang.

641
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,610
Master.

642
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,030
I have something to tell you.

643
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,140
Mind the etiquette.

644
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,880
I almost forgot

645
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,480
that you're a princess now.

646
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,460
So, would you like

647
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,980
to find a better master?

648
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,580
How could I ever
think of changing my master?

649
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,580
Look at you.

650
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,010
Don't be shy.

651
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,000
You used to be so unruly and carefree.

652
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,200
I'm just teasing you.

653
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,540
Can't you tell that?

654
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:51,760
Your joke isn't

655
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,510
funny at all.

656
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,840
By the way, Master,

657
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,280
I've already informed His Majesty

658
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,880
that I'll continue serving

659
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,960
as the Shanfeng Branch Chief

660
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
to assist you at the Sword Alliance.

661
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,670
Why?

662
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,870
I won't forget your kindness

663
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,030
in raising me.

664
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,200
The Sword Alliance needs people now.

665
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,440
How could I leave?

666
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,150
Great.

667
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,740
I'm so happy.

668
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,800
I can finally be

669
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,060
of help to you, Master.

670
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:24,820
Come here.

671
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,010
Godfather.

672
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,450
Where is Palace Chief Wanyu?

673
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,310
He has already returned to Biluo Palace.

674
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,840
His Majesty heard

675
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,220
that Biluo Palace

676
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,450
played a crucial role

677
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,220
in rescuing the Princess.

678
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,880
Therefore,

679
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,180
he's been appointed as Chief Diviner
of the Imperial Observatory

680
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,610
and summoned to the capital
to meet His Majesty immediately.

681
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,610
Lici, you know,

682
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,010
I originally planned
to slack off and deliver

683
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:49,900
all the imperial decrees

684
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,160
at the Sword Alliance.

685
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,410
Now I'll have to ask you to pass on

686
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,430
the message to him.

687
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:53,910
Okay.

688
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:55,700
Lici.

689
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,700
The person
you asked me to investigate last time is

690
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,410
a prince from the previous dynasty.

691
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,530
If you know them,

692
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,380
don't get too deeply involved.

693
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,690
I see, Godfather.

694
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,930
You've always been prudent
in handling things.

695
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,740
I'm just giving you a small heads-up.

696
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,670
I can rest at ease

697
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,340
so long as you're aware of it.

698
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:13,970
Okay.

699
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,130
Mr. Tang.

700
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,180
Thank you.

701
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,010
If you hadn't written
to the Empress's father,

702
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,660
I couldn't have been

703
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,270
found by my mother

704
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,160
and become a princess.

705
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,460
Princess,

706
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,330
please don't mention it.

707
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,150
No need for formalities, Mr. Tang.

708
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,300
To be honest,

709
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,450
finding the lost imperial scion was

710
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,340
what I should do.

711
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,050
I feel

712
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,030
so happy for you.

713
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,530
It's been a while

714
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,590
since I had your dumplings last time.

715
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,970
You must be tired from your journey.

716
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,500
You're looking better now.

717
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:03,930
You too.

718
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,000
By the way,

719
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,190
where is Mr. Tang?

720
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,820
Mr. Tang is escorting Minister Tang
down the mountain.

721
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,750
Long time no see.

722
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,180
I've missed you all so much.

723
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,380
I've missed you, too.

724
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,220
Chi, Shen,

725
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,050
look who's here.

726
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,740
Seeing you in this outfit,

727
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,840
I'm really not used to it.

728
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,740
Not just you,

729
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,180
even I'm not quite used to it myself.

730
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,090
These clothes look really beautiful.

731
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:29,700
From now on,

732
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,090
you should always dress like this.

733
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,700
Really?

734
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,340
Beautiful.

735
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,220
Thank you, Stone.

736
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:39,570
By the way,

737
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,490
during your visit to the imperial palace,

738
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:43,180
didn't the Emperor give you

739
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,700
any rewards?

740
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,990
Now that you mention it...

741
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,320
I have a gift

742
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
for Shen.

743
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:51,610
Me?

744
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,530
Violet Jade?

745
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,580
What's that?

746
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,960
The jade
from the Seven-Treasure Jade Hairpin.

747
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,220
I know Shen

748
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,260
has been looking for it all these years.

749
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,180
As it happens,

750
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,180
I heard it was taken back

751
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,570
to the imperial palace two years ago.

752
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,090
So

753
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,820
I asked my father for it.

754
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,530
Thank you.

755
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,610
It's so sweet of you, Princess.

756
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,610
Don't mention it.

757
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,740
Shen, you're so lucky.

758
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,440
Such a treasure...

759
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,830
Such a treasure is too good

760
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,210
for someone like you.

761
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,090
While someone like me is

762
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,380
still empty-handed. It's not good, is it?

763
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,380
What do you think?

764
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,940
What should I say?

765
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,900
I mean,

766
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:46,610
Princess, you've come from afar

767
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,570
and must be very tired.

768
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:50,740
Is there more?

769
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:52,660
Well,

770
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,610
I brought you a bolt

771
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,010
of deep red celestial silk,

772
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,860
plus a pair of matching bracelets.

773
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,650
Don't say I'm playing favorites.

774
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,850
I'm not a princess.

775
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,110
Why did you bring these for me?

776
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,220
The celestial silk is

777
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,900
made by the imperial palace's craftsmen.

778
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,070
Embroidered with gold thread,

779
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:06,990
it'll make

780
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,850
the most amazing wedding dress
in the world.

781
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,290
As for these matching bracelets,

782
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,820
if worn by a married couple,

783
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,460
they respond to each other
when they're close.

784
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,130
Give one of them to Miss Bai.

785
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,660
She'll definitely like it.

786
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,780
You truly are

787
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:19,670
my best friend.

788
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,730
I forgot you're a princess now.

789
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,870
I also brought gifts for Miss Shei,

790
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,090
Stone, Mr. Tang,

791
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,210
and Gu Xitan.

792
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,540
Thank you, Princess.

793
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,740
Where is Gu Xitan?

794
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,740
What are you doing?

795
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,030
Why don't you go in?

796
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:49,860
Senior.

797
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,390
Why do I feel

798
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,960
that Zhong has changed

799
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,780
since she came back?

800
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,650
She's now a princess.

801
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,740
Aren't you happy?

802
00:43:59,090 --> 00:43:59,740
No.

803
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,510
Of course I'm happy.

804
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,570
Before Zhong joined the Sword Alliance,

805
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,630
she suffered a lot.

806
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,740
Now she has not only found

807
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,570
her parents

808
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,340
but also become a princess

809
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,400
loved by everyone.

810
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:11,490
Someone as strong-willed as her

811
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,820
has finally stepped into a bright future.

812
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,550
How could I not be happy for her?

813
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,020
But

814
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,100
she's drifting away from me.
