00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,079
(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,149
(The guardians of child actors were present at the filming.)

10
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:48,178
- Let's go! Pass it to me! - Here.

11
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:50,019
(Episode 5)

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,349
- Hurry! - Stop him!

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,189
- Block him. - Block him.

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,358
(Kim Seung Ju)

15
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,059
- Take it. - Hey, kick it.

16
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,758
- Get his left side! - Hey.

17
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,028
- Block him. - Block him.

18
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:00,190
- Go to his left side. - Stop him.

19
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:02,399
- Block it. - Shoot!

20
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:09,068
- Let's go. - Nice.

21
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,339
Let's go.

22
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:11,940
- Let's go. - Let's go.

23
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,220
Class President, read the passage.

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,588
"I think that there are too many problems..."

25
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:26,619
"with artificial intelligence."

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,958
"First of all, a near-future fear is that..."

27
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,390
"we are starting to create machines..."

28
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,599
- Look at your book. - "that can make decisions..."

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
"like humans."

30
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,030
"However, we cannot trust such machines."

31
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,369
Stop looking at him. Look at your book.

32
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,270
What's going on between them?

33
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,780
Be quiet.

34
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:51,250
Choi Eom Ji. Do you like him?

35
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,208
- What? - What's going on with her?

36
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:55,678
- What is it? - No.

37
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,648
If you don't like him, why are you staring at him?

38
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,448
There must be a reason you were staring at him...

39
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:01,859
instead of looking at your book.

40
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,990
- What is it, Choi Eom Ji? - Hey, Choi Eom Ji.

41
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,758
Answer me.

42
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,499
You got this, Choi Eom Ji. Go for it.

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,660
I like her.

44
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,829
- What? - What?

45
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,370
- What just happened? - What is it?

46
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,038
- Oh, my! - What?

47
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,310
- What's going on? - Seriously?

48
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:22,940
Be quiet.

49
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:29,620
Why are you leaving already?

50
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:33,220
I came by to see your face briefly.

51
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:34,960
I have class early tomorrow. I have to get going.

52
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:49,370
You can't go back to Seoul.

53
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,380
If you leave today, you won't come back.

54
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,079
What did you say? You said you killed Choi Eom Ji.

55
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,889
Why are you saying something different now?

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,259
Look.

57
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:11,590
Look at this.

58
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,229
You remember these shoes, right?

59
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:19,799
Why was there so much blood? What did you stab her with?

60
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,069
Did you prepare your criminal tool beforehand?

61
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,310
No.

62
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,239
I didn't kill her.

63
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,519
Mr. Kim Do Ha. Wake up.

64
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,620
- Mr. Kim Do Ha. - It wasn't...

65
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,759
What did you say?

66
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,759
I didn't...

67
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,940
kill her.

68
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:09,419
I can hear his lies.

69
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:18,859
I...

70
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,829
(Dream Villa)

71
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,859
Gosh.

72
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,569
What about Syaon?

73
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,770
She's not dead.

74
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,979
You saw her leave safely.

75
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,109
You even had a nightmare about it.

76
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,289
Besides, Syaon wasn't going to kill herself.

77
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:46,549
Don't worry.

78
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:08,340
Wait...

79
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:32,030
What? You're burning up.

80
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:35,600
Do you have fever reducers at home?

81
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,510
I don't need them.

82
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,479
But...

83
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,149
(Bandage, Ointment, Cooling patch)

84
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,178
I confirmed that he was just a regular guy.

85
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:50,520
Is this really necessary?

86
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,020
(Tenol)

87
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,789
But he's sick. Not helping him would be too mean, right?

88
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,299
Okay. Fine.

89
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,059
I'll be back.

90
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,530
I brought some medicine.

91
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,999
I'm coming in.

92
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:01,989
What...

93
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:09,599
Mr. Kim,

94
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,669
wake up and take some medicine before you go to sleep.

95
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:25,179
I'll leave it here.

96
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,289
(Sleep inducers)

97
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:33,890
He took sleep inducers?

98
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,470
Gosh, this is really iffy.

99
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,710
Gosh.

100
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,119
Hot water.

101
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,119
Wait, no.

102
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:11,629
His head is burning up. So should I soak it with cold water?

103
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,669
Gosh.

104
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:03,009
What am I doing right now?

105
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,509
I don't even know him that well.

106
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,519
My arm hurts. Can you let me go?

107
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,350
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:51,889
Sorry...

109
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:56,930
Did he just answer me? What is this?

110
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:46,609
You only have ten minutes.

111
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,300
What is this?

112
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:47,340
I was going to leave after giving you the medicine.

113
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,639
You seemed really sick. So I took care of you for a bit.

114
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,479
Did I open the door for you?

115
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,290
Not exactly. It wasn't closed completely.

116
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,859
I see.

117
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,599
How are you feeling?

118
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,739
Did the fever go away?

119
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,009
Ms. Mok.

120
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,409
Yes.

121
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:29,649
Don't worry about me now.

122
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:34,889
What?

123
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Just treat me...

124
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,529
as if I don't exist.

125
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,569
Do you think that I slept here...

126
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,499
to seduce you or something?

127
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,810
No.

128
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,139
Then why?

129
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:02,979
I see. It's because I found out that you're Kim Do Ha.

130
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,619
But isn't that just one of many jobs people can have?

131
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:08,219
I'm not that interested in celebrities.

132
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,560
- So... - I got it.

133
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,790
Please leave now.

134
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:25,570
Okay. Sure.

135
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,940
Actually, I'm done with you too.

136
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,180
I'm glad the timing all worked out.

137
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:33,850
Bye.

138
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:46,560
He's ridiculous.

139
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:48,799
What? "Don't worry about me?"

140
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,358
Treat him as if he doesn't exist?

141
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,970
That's what he told me!

142
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:03,210
Whatever. He's not the one either.

143
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,190
(For flu, chills, fever, runny nose, and cough)

144
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:38,609
Deuk Chan.

145
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,680
(CEO Jo Deuk Chan)

146
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:44,079
Deuk Chan. Tell Do Ha to move somewhere else.

147
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,549
Or get him a hotel.

148
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,850
I just don't want him to stay in that house.

149
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:49,589
How could you be so brazen...

150
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,759
after the stunt you pulled yesterday?

151
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,128
A strange woman lives next door from Do Ha.

152
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:56,159
She even knew his name and drove his car for him.

153
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,868
If you let Do Ha continue to live there,

154
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,599
I'll go to him every day.

155
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,498
The alley in front of his house will be full of reporters.

156
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:05,840
Hey, Sa Ji On!

157
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,749
Don't yell at me. That's scary.

158
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,749
Do you know how scary Do Ha was yesterday?

159
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:18,989
But...

160
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,759
I was really happy to see him even if he was angry at me.

161
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:26,589
I was scared,

162
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,159
but seeing his angry face made me feel better.

163
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,560
Ji On. What you're doing right now...

164
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,060
isn't helping your case.

165
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,759
You're acting just like Do Ha's old girlfriend.

166
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,359
How is that not helpful?

167
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,628
Do Ha can't move on and meet other women...

168
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:07,430
because he's still hung up on her. Isn't that it?

169
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:10,139
What do you know about her?

170
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:15,070
That she looked like me. That's why I said it.

171
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:19,279
It's true that he hasn't gotten over her.

172
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,379
But he doesn't miss her or anything.

173
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,850
Anyway, that's enough.

174
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,790
If love was one-sided...

175
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,190
Yes. You should meet and date all of your fans.

176
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,820
Ridiculous.

177
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,200
It's up to you.

178
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,330
Okay. I'll ring it up.

179
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,600
You only have one stamp left for a coupon.

180
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,469
- Come again. - Bye.

181
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,710
Thank you.

182
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,909
Decaffeinated coffee is the way to go.

183
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,420
It's nice and strong. I love it.

184
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,119
What's strong?

185
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,489
- The caffeine? - "Deep."

186
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:03,089
It means this coffee has depth.

187
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,019
Gosh, don't you know that?

188
00:17:05,229 --> 00:17:08,600
So when I get tired like this, I always drink decaf coffee.

189
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:11,300
It's shocking that you actually said that to me.

190
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,500
Right.

191
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,069
You said the spirit didn't help you when you were with this guy.

192
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,469
What happened with him?

193
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:18,510
It was nothing...

194
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:20,810
because the spirit did show up.

195
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:25,179
That's more fascinating.

196
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,909
It means that guy wasn't lying the whole time you were together.

197
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,550
Forget it. I'm not interested anymore.

198
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:35,149
What did he lie about?

199
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,128
You know, he was talking in his sleep.

200
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:41,159
You slept with him?

201
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,300
No. Not like that.

202
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,599
I just overheard it.

203
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,669
She overheard it?

204
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,669
She overheard him talk in his sleep?

205
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,609
Then he lied when he was dreaming.

206
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:58,209
Could he be hiding something...

207
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:00,850
deep down in his subconscious?

208
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,419
Whatever.

209
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,230
Wash the dishes.

210
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:17,060
(Dream Villa)

211
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,830
Hey.

212
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,039
This place looks more rustic than I thought.

213
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,070
How much do you need?

214
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,809
When did I ask you for money?

215
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,539
I came because I wanted to see you.

216
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,609
Lower your mask.

217
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,419
No one is here. Come on.

218
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,590
I see. Right.

219
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,990
I still feel guilty whenever I think about that incident.

220
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,359
It must be killing you inside.

221
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,359
I get why you wear masks.

222
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,129
I'll just send you enough money.

223
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,629
Okay. Sure.

224
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:57,839
Then you gave this money to me because you wanted to.

225
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,570
I didn't ask you for money. Okay?

226
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,209
Don't tell my brother about it.

227
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:03,740
Promise me.

228
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:08,679
- I wired the money. - Wait. Hey.

229
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:12,689
Leave once I check it.

230
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:17,619
Okay.

231
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:20,659
I'll spend this money on something meaningful.

232
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:22,699
Thanks.

233
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,969
By the way, this place doesn't suit you.

234
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,800
It looks like a place for ordinary people.

235
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:33,310
But if some of these ordinary people turn out to be your fans,

236
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:35,510
that might fluster you.

237
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:44,350
I'll call you again.

238
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,658
You should swing it in one go.

239
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:50,790
That's it!

240
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:53,590
Okay.

241
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:01,600
Gosh. Bo Ra. Welcome.

242
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:04,300
Girls, come over here.

243
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:07,310
These are my daughters.

244
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,510
That's my youngest daughter. And that's my oldest daughter.

245
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,080
- Hello. - Say hello.

246
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,209
- Hello. - Hello.

247
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,080
You have beautiful daughters.

248
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,449
Have you played tennis before?

249
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:21,889
Of course.

250
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:25,658
- Look. - Gosh.

251
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,029
Were you an athlete?

252
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,090
Ta-Da.

253
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,230
- You got this. - Thanks.

254
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,939
- Gosh. - Are you all right, Bo Ra?

255
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:45,849
Gosh. To be honest, I play golf often.

256
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,378
It's been so long since I played tennis.

257
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:51,550
I see. Then you should have told me that sooner.

258
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:54,050
Why don't I teach you how to play?

259
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:56,918
- All right. Hold it like this. Yes. - Like this?

260
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:01,358
So this is the most basic Eastern forehand grip.

261
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,928
Swing it backward.

262
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,800
- And then hit the ball like this. - Gosh

263
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,299
Move forward. That's it. Just like that.

264
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,070
- Swing it all the way. - I see.

265
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,669
- Swing. - Okay.

266
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,570
I guess you need to warm up a bit more.

267
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,639
Have some water.

268
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,408
You did an amazing job,

269
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:21,648
raising them to be so sweet and beautiful.

270
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:23,379
I'm so envious.

271
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:25,790
You said you lost your husband early in your marriage...

272
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,590
and didn't have any children, right?

273
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,059
I was never fortunate enough to have the joy of raising children...

274
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,689
and just ended up getting old.

275
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,760
It's all right...

276
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,270
because you may end up with two grown daughters.

277
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,369
I see. Okay.

278
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,879
I'm even sick of my only daughter.

279
00:21:53,949 --> 00:21:55,280
Ms. Kim Bo Ra!

280
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,949
Is Ms. Kim Bo Ra here?

281
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,790
Is Ms. Kim Bo Ra not here now?

282
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,659
Ms. Kim Bo Ra.

283
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,359
Excuse me.

284
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,330
Isn't she looking for you?

285
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,270
- Is Ms. Kim Bo Ra not here? - My gosh.

286
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,600
Yes. I'm Kim Bo Ra! It's me.

288
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,010
Oh, sure. Thank you.

289
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:37,550
My, you're drinking?

290
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,888
This is an emergency.

291
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:41,149
I ruined the performance.

292
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,619
I'm sorry.

293
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,959
What's going on?

294
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,790
Your hand is okay.

295
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:56,669
Would it be okay...

296
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,609
if I stayed here for the time being?

297
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,580
Sure thing. You can stay here for as long as you'd like.

298
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,909
Thank you.

299
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,378
(World Vila)

300
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:14,119
How many fake suicide reports have we received? I can't keep count.

301
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:16,959
I'm relieved and grateful that they're alive.

302
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,659
I'd never complain about this.

303
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:23,359
Hey, I've been holding it for a while.

304
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,929
Let me use the restroom quickly.

305
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,230
All right.

306
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:44,719
I was responding to a call in the area. I'm heading back now.

307
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,590
- I see. - Don't get the wrong idea.

308
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:51,320
I won't.

309
00:24:52,189 --> 00:24:53,560
You're working hard until this late hour.

310
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,909
Shall I help you carry it?

311
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:11,409
Well...

312
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,649
I bet you bought beers and potato chips again.

313
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,350
No, I did not.

314
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,490
- Take it easy. - Thanks.

(Sweet and Salty, Wageul Wageul)

316
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,060
Thank you.

317
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,100
Lee sued the music director and the agency...

318
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,368
who took all the songs written by obscure songwriters...

319
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:11,539
and managed to copyright his songs after a fierce legal battle.

320
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,769
However, the composer who led this scheme was acquitted.

321
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,240
They hid us like ghostwriters.

322
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,379
For 3 years, I worked over 10 hours a day, every single day.

323
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,879
They paid me 1,000 dollars a month. Never a single raise.

324
00:26:24,219 --> 00:26:25,789
So his yearly salary was 12,000 dollars?

325
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,919
- I still regret it so much. - Isn't this insane?

326
00:26:27,949 --> 00:26:29,519
- Why did I work like a slave... - What? What's insane?

327
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
- without rebelling once? - Oh, right.

328
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,990
You're from Hakcheon.

329
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,600
Then you must hate this show.

330
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:39,730
- Why? - The thing is,

331
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
they reported that the detectives there...

332
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,868
carried out the investigation in an inappropriate manner...

333
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,439
for the Hakcheon disappearance case.

334
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,708
What do they think they know when they just work for a TV network?

335
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,510
They think they're detectives.

336
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
Right?

337
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,050
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

338
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,449
I told you not to be obsessed with chords!

339
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,359
You can write a good song...

340
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:39,759
with 3 to 4 chords alone.

341
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,128
Trust me.

342
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:43,260
Moo Jin is music!

343
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:47,570
Mr. Park, could you spare me a moment?

344
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,969
What are you doing? I'm having an important conversation now.

345
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:52,668
I need to talk to you about something important too.

346
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:53,810
It'd better be something important.

347
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,580
You guys, get out.

348
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:10,320
We got another email about you plagiarizing.

349
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:13,529
Of course, I'm sure you didn't do it on purpose, but...

350
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,830
Oh, that jerk.

351
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,359
I already taught him a lesson.

352
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,729
What? How?

353
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,599
I know everyone in the industry,

354
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,040
so I can figure things out right away.

355
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,009
It was just some clueless idiot.

356
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,540
It won't happen again, so don't worry.

357
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:32,079
I listened to all of them, and they're quite similar.

358
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,509
If the original songwriter sues us,

359
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,609
- the company... - Mr. Jo.

360
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,549
You really are clueless when it comes to music.

361
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,918
It's the same genre,

362
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,688
so it's only natural that the vibes are similar.

363
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:46,059
Also, no one even knew the song.

364
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,428
I kindly referred to it so that it'd see the light of day at last.

365

372
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,419

374
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:24,399
Did something happen recently?

375
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:32,500
Could you just prescribe me the same pills I used to take?

376
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:35,310
You need to tell me what's going on so I can treat you...

377
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,340
and give you a prescription.

378
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:43,080
Do Ha. There is...

379
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,580
a big sieve inside your head.

380
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,559
Even when you want to say something, you filter it through the sieve...

381
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,659
over and over again.

382
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,490
It's good to be careful with your words.

383
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,760
But sometimes, you need to express your emotions just as they are.

384
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:27,490
Excuse me.

385
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,750

393

394

I should've introduced myself first.

That guy isn't Kim Do Ha.

403
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,689
Says who?

404
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:02,049
- Hey, spy cam. - Sorry?

405
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,759
I heard you ended up at a police station because you were accused...

406
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,888
of planting a spy cam while chasing Kim Do Ha.

407
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:09,458
Gosh, you fool. Did you think I'd never find out?

408
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:10,698
- That was... - Yes, got it.

409
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:12,929
Trust me. There was some misunderstanding.

410
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,639
Sir, that man isn't Kim Do Ha.

411
00:32:16,699 --> 00:32:18,939
I saw Kim Do Ha right in front of my face.

Many of J Entertainment's songwriters...

420
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,050
have ghostwriters working for them.

421
00:32:35,449 --> 00:32:36,719
And some of them...

422
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:38,560
habitually copy other songs.

423
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,389
This was what I, Kim Do Ha, wanted to confess.

424
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:47,428
(Did Syaon know too? Doesn't that make her an accomplice?)

426
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,840
Can't we take this down immediately?

427
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:57,840
People are sharing shorts and clips of it,

428
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:00,480
so taking this down won't solve the problem.

429
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:06,189

431
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:12,260
To do that, we'll need Mr. Kim Do Ha to step in.

432
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,270
Don't tell me that you guys also think...

433
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,340
that man is Kim Do Ha.

434
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,909
He's not.

I can just tell.

He looks very different from the man I saw that day.

Fine. If it's not him, he should come forward and say so.

464

00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,330
Hello.

546
00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:28,630
Yes, hello.

547
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:31,170
To tell you the truth...

548
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:34,270
I am the CEO of J Entertainment.

549
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,440
Can we have a brief chat?

550
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,420
I'm sorry about the last time.

551
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:49,150
I was worried Do Ha's identity would be revealed...

552
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,259
if I admitted that I was the CEO of J Entertainment.

553
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:54,489
Right.

554
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,699
That day, you drove on his behalf.

555
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,029
Did something happen?

556
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
He just...

557
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,940
looked really stressed out.

558
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,249
Anyway, why does he do that?

559
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,709
He always has his face covered,

560
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,279
and he runs away and disappears all the time.

561
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,520
Is he ill or something?

562
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:30,699
He went through a really rough patch in the past.

563
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,330
There was a time in my life...

564
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:36,199
when I drank enough alcohol to last a lifetime.

565
00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:39,600
He changed after that.

566
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,270
He used to be very cheerful.

567
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:43,779
But he's gotten better since he moved to that building.

568
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,110
These days, he sleeps well at night...

569
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:47,750
and converses with his next-door neighbour.

570
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,250
I guess he's more than just one of your songwriters to you.

571
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:56,020
You seem to truly care for him.

572
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,790
Yes.

573
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,529
I'm worrying about Do Ha as his close friend, not as his CEO.

574
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,159
Oh, right.

575
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:06,259
So when he gets home,

576
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,600
please give me a call.

577
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:29,619
- We'll see it shortly, - Yes.

578
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:32,818
but it was neck and neck, overall.

579
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:34,658
I'd say it was intense.

580
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,659
That's right.

581
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,428
The current score is 1 to 1. The teams...

582
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:41,999
have completed the first half, which was fierce.

583
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,028
That's right.

584
00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:46,500
As you can see...

585
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,980
He can't even eat out.

586
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,480
What if he's starving himself?

587
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,889
Hello. You can sit there.

588
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:45,258
I guess the masked piano player isn't here today.

589
00:42:45,259 --> 00:42:48,529
You won't see him on stage for a while.

590
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:51,339
I see.

591
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:53,770
Wait.

592
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,109
I said you wouldn't see him on stage.

593
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,509
It doesn't mean he's not here.

594
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,040
Pardon me?

595
00:42:59,509 --> 00:43:01,508
We'll be closing up in about an hour.

596
00:43:01,509 --> 00:43:04,279
You can see him after that.

597
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:05,850
Take a seat.

598
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,330
Mr. Kim?

599
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,170
Wait.

600
00:43:57,069 --> 00:43:58,239
What are you doing?

601
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,310
You're a pianist.

602
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:03,480
What brought you here?

603
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:05,639
How did you know I was here?

604
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,009
I told her.

605
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:15,420
I told her to wait.

606
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,158
- Just a moment. - Let me.

607
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,459
This is not your business.

608
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,630
Will you please?

609
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,889
Then I'll leave it to you and get going.

610
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,199
Here.

611
00:44:24,799 --> 00:44:25,799
Sure.

612
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,270
Why did you keep your phone off?

613
00:44:38,779 --> 00:44:39,810
It was a hassle.

614
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,779
It's even more of a hassle for me because of you.

615
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,319
I met Mr. Jo earlier today.

616
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:49,718
Some weirdo visited the café,

617
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:51,359
and everyone has been talking about you here and there.

618
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,059
It bothers me even more.

619
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,429
Who talks about me?

620
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:00,060
Aren't you aware of the mess?

621
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:12,609
Many of J Entertainment's songwriters...

622
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,150
have ghostwriters working for them.

623
00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:17,719
And some of them habitually copy other songs.

624
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,250
I should've introduced myself first.

625
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,350
I am the songwriter, Kim Do Ha.

626
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,230
The company probably said it wasn't true.

627
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,529
If people don't believe it,

628
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:33,299
that can't be helped.

629
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:39,569
How uncool.

630
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,509
You should say it yourself, not the company.

631
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,909
It seems to be your habit to dump your duties on others.

632
00:45:53,049 --> 00:45:54,190
Leave.

633
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:59,420
I thought you'd be enthusiastic about your business of all.

634
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,759
Music is the only thing you can do, no?

635
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,500
You can neither eat nor take off your mask outside.

636
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,670
What if you can't even do music, what will you do in life?

637
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,068
Can you get by with the money you've earned?

638
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:12,638
This is enough. You know nothing about me.

639
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:13,669
Of course, I know nothing.

640
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,310
How would I know when you don't say a thing?

641
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:17,479
I don't know much,

642
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,079
but I do know that you wouldn't plagiarize others' work.

643
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,250
I know that you wouldn't even dream of being a ghostwriter or whatever.

644
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:25,880
But those who don't know as much would misunderstand, of course.

645
00:46:29,449 --> 00:46:31,589
You made up your mind to stop while drinking the other day.

646
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,219
What was the reason?

647
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,600
You can just make up your mind again.

648
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,310
Give Mr. Jo a call or something.

649
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,610
He's worried sick about you.

650
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:25,940
Music is the only thing you can do, no?

651
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,100
I've been well.

652
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:47,400
Seung Ju? Well...

653
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:50,500
He's preparing to study in Germany.

654
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:51,969
Yes.

655
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:55,270
He seems to feel frustrated in this country.

656
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,580
He needs to go to Europe at least to learn something.

657
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,850
Yes, right.

658
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:05,710
Make a right turn soon.

659
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,209
Make a left turn soon.

660
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,849
There's a speed bump ahead.

661
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,650
The road is narrow here.

662
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:15,088
Please slow down.

663
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:16,988
Go straight until the next direction.

664
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:18,819
You have arrived at the destination.

665
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,630
The directions are over.

666
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:40,679
(Kim Do Ha, I'm donating my master keyboard.)

667
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,380
(Changna-ro)

668
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:57,500
Who are you?

669
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,869
Oh, do you live here?

670
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:08,610
No.

671
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:10,940
Who are you?

672
00:50:15,409 --> 00:50:16,509
Mr. Kim Do Ha?

673
00:50:56,589 --> 00:50:58,190
Sorry. I'm sorry.

674
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:04,000
Are you from the police?

675
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,400
No.

676
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,670
I'm Kim Do Ha.

677
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,480
Are you really Songwriter Kim Do Ha?

678
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,150
How did you know?

679
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,619
This.

680
00:52:10,659 --> 00:52:11,758
(Missed call)

681
00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:12,999
(New message)

682
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,100
(Missed call)

683
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,969
(Plagiarist songwriters, J Entertainment, confession)

684
00:52:23,569 --> 00:52:25,778
Many of J Entertainment's songwriters...

685
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:27,239
have ghostwriters working for them.

686
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:30,150
And some of them habitually copy other songs.

687
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,060
What you said in the video...

688
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,069
It's your personal experience, isn't it?

689
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,528
How did you know?

690
00:52:50,529 --> 00:52:53,339
Otherwise, you wouldn't have done it.

691
00:52:55,569 --> 00:52:57,909
But why did you act like you were me?

692
00:52:58,739 --> 00:53:00,949
I wanted to do it with my own name,

693
00:53:02,049 --> 00:53:03,150
but as you know,

694
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:06,920
I'd be doomed in this industry if I did that.

695
00:53:08,949 --> 00:53:10,690
Apart from borrowing my name,

696
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,219
why did you tell a lie?

697
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:16,190
I never used a ghostwriter.

698
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,600
It wouldn't be justified if Kim Do Ha...

699
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,330
criticized Park Moo Jin only.

700
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:24,339
It'd be more effective to criticize J Entertainment itself.

701
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,339
Honestly speaking,

702
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,670
I kind of thought...

703
00:53:30,009 --> 00:53:33,210
you were like peas in a pod.

704
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:36,509
You two were the star songwriters of J Entertainment.

705
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:39,419
And you were faceless.

706
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,850
It seemed quite shady.

707
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,259
So that's how I'm seen.

708
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,889
I'm sorry. Please forgive me just once.

709
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,360
I'll delete the video and post an apology.

710
00:53:53,759 --> 00:53:55,069
Of course, you should apologize.

711
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,440
But...

712
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:02,469
don't you deserve an apology as well?

713
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,819
The new statement we posted yesterday.

714
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,719
How are people responding to it?

715
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,319
Well,

716
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:19,689
people don't seem to believe it...

717
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,360
no matter what we say.

718
00:54:24,259 --> 00:54:26,330
What if Syaon posts a written explanation?

719
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,399
We don't need a singer involved in this songwriter controversy.

720
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,368
It could backfire,

721
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:32,739
so he better stay put.

722
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:39,209
Sir, why don't we ask Mr. Kim Do Ha...

723
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,710
to take action?

724
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,980
I already said no to it.

725
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,350
Right.

726
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:57,699
Wait.

727
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,400
What the?

728
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:04,170
I'm sorry.

729
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:07,339
I'm actually not Kim Do Ha.

730
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,408
Park Moo Jin used and dumped me,

731
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:13,880
and that grudge...

732
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,480
led me to do this. I'm sorry.

733
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:28,889
Do Ha.

734
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,900
I'm Kim Do Ha.

735
00:55:34,929 --> 00:55:37,500
I'm sorry, I'm showing up too late.

736
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:40,299
Are you really Kim Do Ha?

737
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:42,369
Is he?

738
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:45,979
You must've been through a lot,

739
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,379
trying to resolve the issue without me.

740
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,110
Thank you, and sorry.

741
00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:52,380
I'll do my best not to cause any more harm to the company.

742
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:56,619
Hey, move.

743
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:00,959
Bring the real Kim Do Ha, and everything will be over.

744
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,388
Why must you drag this on?

745
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:05,560
I just don't understand.

746
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:08,100
Long time no see.

747
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:11,540
Who are you?

748
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:13,770
I've never seen you before.

749
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,739
I'm Yang Ji Hyuk.

750
00:56:16,569 --> 00:56:17,610
Don't you recognize me?

751
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,849
Well, do I have to know you?

752
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:24,048
Hey, what are you waiting for? Drag him out.

753
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:26,880
You shouldn't let a hawker in here.

754
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,650
You took his song without his name.

755
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,690
Is that why you don't remember him?

756
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:33,989
Gosh, what in the world...

757
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,400
Hello, Mr. Park.

758
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,969
I'm Kim Do Ha.

759
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:53,440
Hello, Mr. Park.

760
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:56,610
Kim Do Ha?

761
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,650
Yes.

762
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:00,949
Try to remember his name.

763
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:04,719
You're covering your face again.

764
00:57:06,619 --> 00:57:09,528
Gosh, the more I think about it,

765
00:57:09,529 --> 00:57:12,330
you seem way shadier than me.

766
00:57:13,299 --> 00:57:15,269
Even Iron Man reveals his face...

767
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,399
in a critical situation.

768
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,770
I wonder why he's so obsessed with hiding his face.

769
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,509
I mean, has anyone seen his face before?

770
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,238
The company is about to go down,

771
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:27,440
and he cares only about himself.

772
00:57:27,509 --> 00:57:29,809
Just how shady is he...

773
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:32,118
that he wouldn't reveal his face?

774
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:35,290
Just who is Kim Do Ha?

775
00:57:40,489 --> 00:57:41,560
Let's go.

776
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,069
Mr. Kim Do Ha.

777
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:51,900
I admire you so much.

778
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,368
When you're done working on Syaon's song,

779
00:57:54,369 --> 00:57:55,770
would you mind writing one for us...

780
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:59,209
Ethan. I'm sorry, but we can't afford to talk about that now.

781
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,909
- Let's do it later. - But...

782
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,020
I'm really grateful that you stepped in.

783
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:15,290
But revealing your face wouldn't be a good idea.

784
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:18,460
Right.

785
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:22,699
I'll handle Park Moo Jin's dismissal as soon as possible.

786
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,638
Were you aware of what he was up to?

787
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:27,339
I told him a few times.

788
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,009
I'm sorry.

789
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,380
Get him to write a written apology.

790
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,719
Make sure to compensate the victimized songwriters.

791
00:58:40,949 --> 00:58:41,949
Okay.

792
00:58:45,259 --> 00:58:46,259
Do Ha.

793
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,900
I'm sorry.

794
00:58:54,429 --> 00:58:55,699
Do you still hate me?

795
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:57,469
Ji On.

796
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:03,408
Deuk Chan, can you give us a moment alone?

797
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:05,139
Yes, go out for a bit.

798
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,480
Okay.

799
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:13,779
What is it?

800
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:16,619
Tell me.

801
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:19,520
I don't like you.

802
00:59:23,089 --> 00:59:24,330
I like you as a singer.

803
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,259
And as a friend.

804
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,569
But not as a woman.

805
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:34,139
- Do Ha... - I'll root for you as a fan.

806
00:59:51,259 --> 00:59:52,319
Let me apologize.

807
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,460
I'm actually not Kim Do Ha.

808
00:59:55,989 --> 00:59:58,059
Being exploited by Park Moo Jin,

809
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,400
I felt wronged.

810
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:02,929
A bad judgement led me to impersonate Kim Do Ha.

811
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:06,599
I hope no one will be...

812
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,069
victimized like me after this incident.

813
01:00:09,569 --> 01:00:12,709
I want Park Moo Jin and everyone who exploits nameless songwriters...

814
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,810
to be kicked out of the industry.

815
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,778
I'd like to apologize once again...

816
01:00:19,779 --> 01:00:22,750
to Kim Do Ha who suffered damage because of me...

817
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:26,060
along with gratitude.

I'd love you to come.

Good.
