(Luni Tarot Café)

11
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,778
Because of this darn power,

12
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:53,519
I drifted apart from my family and can't even date a guy.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,120
What is that power you have?

14
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:05,069
I...

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,470
can detect...

16
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:13,709
lies.

17
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:23,119
When people talk,

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,250
I can tell if they are lying or telling the truth.

19
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:35,399
I sound crazy, don't I?

20
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:40,530
I could only prove it to you if you lied to me left and right.

21
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:43,440
But you never lied.

22
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:48,179
That's why I liked you.

23
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:20,978
(Episode 7)

24
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:22,710
You should have fought back.

25
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,280
Letting him punch you like that made you look like a real cheater.

26
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,680
What do you know?

27
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,220
If I say so, then it is.

28
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,150
No, don't.

29
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:36,759
It's not him. He's not the culprit.

30
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,359
It's not going to work between us anyway.

31
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,329
Because of this darn power,

32
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,799
I drifted apart from my family and can't even date a guy.

33
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,629
It's pouring right now. Where are you?

34
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,759
Do you have an umbrella?

35
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:25,769
Why did I do that?

36
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,680
Why did I tell him, really?

37
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,180
Darn it.

38
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,250
Goodness! Come on!

39
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,759
Yes. Don't come to work today. I'll see you tomorrow.

40
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,560
What?

41
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,630
Everything's okay, right?

42
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,169
Yes.

43
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:17,259
Do you admit you were wrong?

44
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:20,660
Do you admit you were wrong?

45
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,368
Didn't I tell you that your classmates would hate you...

46
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:29,399
if you told them you could hear their lies?

47
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,868
That girl...

48
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:33,369
made fun of me first because we were poor.

49
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,910
She told me that her dad bought clothes and dolls...

50
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:40,609
for her in the US. She bragged to me about that.

51
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,520
But she was lying the whole time!

52
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:47,889
Yes. That girl looked like a meanie.

53
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,989
That ugly girl.

54
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,830
The thing is...

55
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,799
people could easily guess that we were poor.

56
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:02,069
But she kept...

57
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,299
not having a dad a secret, so no one would find out.

58
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,280
She didn't want anyone to find out, but you told everyone about that.

59
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,280
No one would like you then.

60
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:15,780
So don't tell anyone that you can hear their lies.

61
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,220
Anyone who knows that...

62
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,249
can't be friends with you.

63
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:22,689
They will leave you.

64
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,070
Did you sleep well last night?

65
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,309
What?

66
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:46,979
The room inside has to be cleaned up first, right?

67
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,549
What...

68
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,160
If you need to talk to me, just do it now.

69
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:05,700
Talk to you about what?

70
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:07,429
Must I have something to tell you?

71
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:08,999
Last night...

72
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,640
You must have a lot of questions for me.

73
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,439
About how you can hear people's lies?

74
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
Yes.

75
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:22,249
So what?

76
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,549
What do you mean?

77
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:27,890
Aren't you scared of me?

78
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:30,619
Or do you not believe me?

79
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,429
I do think you can hear them.

80
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,129
There were things about you that fascinated me.

81
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:40,499
And everything made sense after finding out about your power.

82
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,200
So what?

83
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,640
If you can hear lies, then you can.

84
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,999
You're not bothered that...

85
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,058
I'm pretending to be a shaman?

86
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:11,200
Don't you pay taxes?

87
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:13,200
Is that illegal?

88
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:16,340
No. You know that's not what I'm talking about.

89
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,080
Where's the broomstick?

90
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,580
Can you bring me a broomstick?

91
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,309
Who are you?

92
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,709
Ms. Hunter!

93
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,510
Hey, be quiet.

94
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,179
And let him go.

95
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,059
The floor was so messy.

96
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:17,359
After seeing that, I thought we were robbed.

97
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:20,829
So he lives next door to you.

98
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,470
How did he end up in the secret room?

99
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,439
Don't worry. I can trust him.

100
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,738
By the way, didn't Kassandra tell you that...

101
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:31,280
we were taking a day off?

102
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,720
She didn't contact me.

103
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,790
I see. I was busy watching this.

104
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,489
I mean, I like the song and all. But it's too long.

105
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,029
- Was it 5 minutes and 40 seconds? - It's 5 minutes 43 seconds...

106
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:56,200
You were a fan of Syaon too.

107
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,570
You're older than me, right? How old are you?

108
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,378
- I'm 29. - You're 29.

109
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:02,738
I'm 25.

110
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:04,749
Can I be casual with you?

111
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:06,609
What's your name?

112
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:09,080
- Hey, that's enough. - I'm Syaon's bodyguard.

113
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,060
I'm Syaon's songwriter.

114
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:16,889
Syaon's songwriter?

115
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,459
He has a rare nickname too.

116
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,128
Since your nickname is Syaon's Songwriter,

117
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,158
you're Kim Do Ha.

118
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,628
I'll call you Do Ha.

119
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:27,499
I'm Baek Chi Hoon.

120
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,369
Nice to meet you.

121
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Nice to meet you.

122
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:41,580
Gosh. Your nails are ruined. What happened?

123
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,680
It hasn't been a week yet.

124
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,950
Gosh. I know.

125
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,590
I shouldn't have been so awful.

126
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:00,470
(I'm sorry.)

127
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,300
Darn it.

128
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,310
Why am I sorry?

129
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:08,580
Do you want some accessories on your nails?

130
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:10,809
We have a promotion for them. You can get ten dollars off.

131
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,310
In that case, of course.

132
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:14,149
Wait.

133
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,590
You know what? Can you run the card first...

134
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:21,090
for whatever I owe now?

135
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:22,889
It might not go through.

136
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:33,029
Yes. It went through.

137
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,639
I'm so relieved.

138
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,469
Fine! Put some accessories on my nails.

139
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,739
Give me the prettiest and biggest one.

140
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,440
Why don't we meet up at the next fan club meeting?

141
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:47,680
- Okay. - I'll get going then.

142
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:49,420
- Okay. - Bye.

143
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,290
His dream is to become a bodyguard for Syaon.

144
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,790
Somehow, he ended up working for me.

145
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:58,729
Is this a dangerous job?

146
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,029
That you need a bodyguard?

147
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,670
Well, he usually drives for me.

148
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,769
I can drive too.

149
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:14,940
Let me know if you need help.

150
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,210
Cleaning this place was hard work.

151
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:21,550
I'll buy you a tasty meal.

152
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,580
You helped me. I should be my treat.

153
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,889
Let's go.

154
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,690
There's always a line at that bakery.

155
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,190
Is the bread that good?

156
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,800
It's next to your café. You never had the bread from there?

157
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,729
I didn't because it was next to my café.

158
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:42,939
If I go to his bakery and befriend him,

159
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,269
it might complicate things later.

160
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:48,580
Then why don't you try it today? It's really good.

161
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,440
What? Wait.

162
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,279
Well...

163
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,518
It's not that. Let's just go.

164
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,389
- What? - Gosh.

165
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,119
What? Oh, my.

166
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,859
You two have been hanging out a lot lately.

167
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,399
- Yes. - Are you two dating?

168
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,060
No.

169
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,930
We're just neighbours.

170
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:14,300
I thought you didn't like having neighbours.

171
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,970
You're just picky with people.

172
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,369
Hey.

173
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,940
Yes.

174
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:21,509
Can you move up?

175
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,180
Why is this line moving so fast? Goodness.

176
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,820
- We should move up too. - Okay.

177
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,888
The waiting was worth it.

178
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,559
- Let's get that. - This one.

179
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,189
- People wait in line for a reason. - I like this one more.

180
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,290
What's good here?

181
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:40,790
Those croissants are good too.

182
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,060
This is my favourite.

183
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,258
- I like this one. Financiers. - The total is...

184
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,528
- I see. - Thank you. Enjoy.

185
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:46,629
- Thank you. - Sure.

186
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,939
Welcome.

187
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,999
I bought them yesterday. Can I get a refund?

188
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:53,368
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:55,379
We can't give a refund for the bread you bought yesterday.

190
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,450
I don't want to make a scene. Please refund it now.

191
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,919
The shape came out nicely too. Why do you want to get a refund?

192
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,819
I found out that your bread had bugs in it!

193
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,888
I saw everything.

194
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,090
- What? - Bugs?

195
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:09,618
- Bugs? - What?

196
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:10,819
- There were bugs? - She said there were bugs.

197
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,830
Bugs?

198
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:13,759
In the bread?

199
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:20,299
Come on. You put the dough in the oven to bake it.

200
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,469
Then the cockroach should be baked too.

201
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,638
It's obvious that it's a set-up.

202
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,840
- What? - Cockroaches?

203
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,608
- Wait. - No. We shouldn't buy bread here.

204
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,609
Give me a refund now.

205
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,349
Okay.

206
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,179
- What's going on? - There were cockroaches.

207
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,720
- There were cockroaches? - Cockroaches?

208
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,889
- Here. - I can't believe this.

209
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,820
Let's go!

210
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,310
How could that just happen?

211
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,869
Right.

212
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:02,440
No one lied in there.

213
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,279
You can hear them all the time?

214
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,850
Well, why don't we eat something else?

215
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:22,729
Hey, two guys coming to a place like this doesn't look right.

216
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,998
After passing the police officer exam,

217
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,970
a fortune-teller told me this.

218
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,699
"When you get stabbed,"

219
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,040
"eat at a restaurant that has knives as their utensils."

220
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:34,039
You didn't get stabbed. It was me.

221
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,810
That was my fault. You got stabbed because I was sloppy.

222
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:40,379
Let's chase away the bad luck with this. It's my treat.

223
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,359
Gosh. I should have brought her to a place like this.

224
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,889
You like someone from the tarot café, right?

225
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,898
You don't even drink coffee.

226
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,399
You went all the way to the tarot café to buy coffee.

227
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Aren't I right?

228
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,540
- You are a detective indeed. - Right?

229
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:08,879
Gosh. Is she pretty?

230
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,950
She is. She's gorgeous.

231
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,709
Why don't you invite her out for a meal?

232
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,850
She has a boyfriend.

233
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:51,850
Do you want to leave?

234
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,619
No. Why should I?

235
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,229
Has she been dating that guy for a long time?

236
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:01,930
Let's just eat.

237
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:03,729
Okay.

238
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,728
What do you want to eat?

239
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:07,268
The eggplant gratin...

240
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:09,670
Yes. I like eggplants too.

241
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,170
Then let's order that.

242
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,070
As for the pasta...

243
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,739
How about this one?

244
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Sure.

245
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,589
It could've been so much worse.

246
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,830
What did your doctor say?

247
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,399
I'm fine.

248
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,940
- What are you doing this weekend? - What?

249
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:49,680
I don't have any plans yet.

250
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,279
Then let's make one with me.

251
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,550
Sure.

252
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,050
So are you going to give up on that lady?

253
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,529
No. She's not married yet.

254
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,889
I should wait and see.

255
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,330
Are you okay?

256
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:19,709
Here.

257
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,080
Give me a second.

258
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,550
I'll go and use the restroom.

259
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,530
You two aren't dating, right?

260
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
What?

261
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:45,270
He doesn't know that you can't eat eggplants.

262
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,300
And just now too.

263
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,139
That was a bit weird.

264
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,810
We're not.

265
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,080
I asked him to pretend to be my boyfriend.

266
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,490
Did I bother you that much?

267
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,629
I went to pay.

268
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,399
I had a feeling that you might try to pay for this.

269
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Thank you for the food. Let's go.

270
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:23,898
What? Already?

271
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:25,169
I still have some food left.

272
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:39,449
Thank you.

273
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,699
Something happened while I was gone.

274
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:50,429
Right?

275
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,070
He figured out that you weren't my boyfriend.

276
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,199
What gave it away?

277
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,709
Because of this.

278
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,740
I can't eat eggplants.

279
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,619
What else can't you eat other than eggplants?

280
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,090
Spoon worms, braised pupas, and cilantro.

281
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:20,060
Spoon worms, braised pupas, cilantro, and eggplants.

282
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:22,800
I'll remember them now.

283
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,050
We're done for the day.

284
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,859
Deuk Chan. What brings you here?

285
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,419
- Is that your brother? - Yes.

286
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:51,718
Hello.

287
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:54,290
What is it? What?

288
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:56,559
I can't order a burger now, right?

289
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,800
For you, yes. Of course.

290
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,629
Hey, can you go and fry up our signature set?

291
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,100
Hurry up.

292
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,909
Seriously. What are you doing here now?

293
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Gosh.

294
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:10,510
You...

295
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,409
Have you seen Eom Ho lately?

296
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,050
Eom Ho? No.

297
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,218
Why? Is he in Seoul?

298
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:19,449
He came to me. Do Ha...

299
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,618
He thinks Seung Ju is Do Ha.

300
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,219
Gosh. He's still on that?

301
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,129
He's wasting his time.

302
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,629
How can you laugh about that now?

303
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:33,570
He tried to kill Do Ha.

304
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,669
That's why he came to Seoul. To do the same.

305
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,409
That's why you're here.

306
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,309
Are you still in touch with any of your friends from Hakcheon?

307
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,849
I need to find out where he's staying...

308
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,249
and what he's up to.

309
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,089
Just tell Kim Do Ha.

310
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,188
Tell him to be careful.

311
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:54,189
No.

312
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,929
He just started to live like a normal guy.

313
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,459
Never.

314
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,560
Yes. He's changed a lot.

315
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,070
He's not even scared of me when he sees me.

316
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,729
Did you go and see him?

317
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,770
Do you know what he said?

318
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:11,969
He said he already paid back everything he owed me. Gosh.

319
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,569
He should know we're the reason...

320
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,009
he has a good life now and isn't locked up.

321
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,679
He'd still owe us even if he spent his entire life repaying us.

322
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,310
I told you...

323
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,280
not to bring that up again.

324
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:24,649
Deuk Chan.

325
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:32,128
Goodness. That was embarrassing.

326
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:33,629
This place is more embarrassing.

327
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,059
He touched his phone and made this without washing his hands,

328
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,330
and the table is all sticky.

329
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:43,800
You extorted Do Ha's hard-earned money.

330
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,668
Is this how you've been spending his money?

331
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:48,879
Hey, who is your brother?

332
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:51,439
If Do Ha and I are both drowning,

333
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,209
I bet you'll save him.

334
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:56,820
I'm done talking to you.

335
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,919
Close down the business at once.

336
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,889
You don't have what it takes to run your own business.

337
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,139
A reversed Ace of Pentacles.

338
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:22,009
I think you're about to make a big mistake.

339
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,040
A mistake?

340
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,379
I was going to buy a building. Should I not do it?

341
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,378
Are there good properties these days?

342
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:32,850
Gosh, the market's bad these days. Wait a bit.

343
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:35,490
Besides, it's actually a big headache to own a building.

344
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,119
That bakery too.

345
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,259
The premium is ridiculously high.

346
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,889
It's 200,000 dollars. Can you believe it?

347
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,458
Honey, you're here again!

348
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:45,300
Let's go eat something.

349
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:47,569
All he thinks about is food.

350
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,500
- I'll come back another time. - Okay, bye.

351
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,769
She owns buildings,

352
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,469
and her husband is a realtor.

353
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,310
What a compatible couple.

354
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,850
That's true. But they are not blessed with children.

355
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,049
You know, the bakery across the street.

356
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,389
I could never buy anything because they always had a long line outside.

357
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:11,590
But they were empty today, so I cleared them out.

358
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:14,129
Have some.

359
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:16,199
Oh, that bread...

360
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,699
That's right. When will that guy from yesterday come by again?

361
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:23,599
- Why? - Well, just because.

362
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,339
I like him. I want to befriend him.

363
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,438
What? Who's this guy?

364
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:28,270
Oh, he's very handsome.

365
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,579
He already knows everything about Ms. Hunter.

366
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,909
I see.

367
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,749
Is he talking about that guy?

368
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,780
What?

369
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,020
Yes.

370
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,219
What? You already know about him?

371
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,188
I feel so left out again. I'm hurt.

372
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:44,219
What?

373
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:46,290
It's that bread.

374
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,560
- Look. - Gosh!

375
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,899
He bought so many.

376
00:23:57,899 --> 00:23:58,909
It looks tasty.

377
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,780
Gosh.

378
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,949
Hey, we know how clean you are.

379
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,648
But people don't know that.

(I want to puke.)

384
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,158
Gosh, this makes no sense.

385
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,418
This is only possible...

386
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:20,129
if you roll the cockroach in the croissant dough.

00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:26,399
Has this person not responded to your message yet?

389
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,290
- Cheer up. - Take it easy.

390
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:51,619
Bye.

391
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:58,399
Hello!

392
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,669
Hey, what's with that voice?

393
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,669
- Hello. - You're back.

394
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,569
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

395
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,070
I was all over the place.

396
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,540
Don't worry about it.

397
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,349
You still have that cream bun I had the last time, right?

398
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,679
Yes. I'll get it ready for you right away.

399
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,520
Oh, my.

400
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,729
- I guess you're rich. - Pardon me?

401
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,029
Every time I see you, you're wearing such nice clothes.

402
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,999
I have a few too. I'm just not wearing it today.

403
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,868
I bet you don't have a 9-to-5 job, seeing how you're out and about now.

404
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:34,899
Right?

405
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,699
That's right. I don't have an office job.

406
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,269
- I see. - Then what do you do?

407
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,409
That's enough. You're being rude.

408
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,879
- Yes, that's enough! - I didn't say anything.

409
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:47,949
Here it is.

410
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,679
- Thank you. - No problem.

411
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,119
- One moment, please. - Sure.

412
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,820
My gosh.

413
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:56,359
Hello.

414
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,840
Viennoiseries. Is this it?

415
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,070
Pardon me?

416
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:17,309
Viennoiseries.

417
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:21,250
Oh, yes. That section is for viennoiseries.

418
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:22,679
I see.

419
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,219
I knew it. It's just a small neighbourhood bakery.

420
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,689
Pardon me? What do you mean?

421
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,060
I was just talking to myself.

422
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,800
Why is everything so expensive here?

423
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:42,699
Look at this pizza bread. Goodness.

424
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,209
Oh, they found a cockroach in this.

425
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:50,708
- Excuse me! - Hey, calm down. Don't.

426
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,980
Gosh, shall I buy this or not?

427
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,389
So you won't buy it?

428
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:04,659
No.

429
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:13,800
I'll take everything here.

430
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:17,300
All of these?

431
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:21,070
My gosh. You'll buy everything? That's amazing.

432
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:22,679
Oh, my.

(Yeonseo Bakery)

434
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,820
It'll take forever to eat all this.

435
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,060
Gosh.

436
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:49,699
So what?

437
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,800
If you can hear lies, then you can.

438
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,010
Gosh, no.

439
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,909
He reacted like that because he didn't fully understand it.

440
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,209
Oh, no.

441
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,320
My gosh!

442
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:06,449
Shoot!

443
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,619
Darn it!

444
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,159
Gosh.

445
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,419
You suddenly showed up out of nowhere.

446
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:55,369
I guess you've never used a laundromat before.

447
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:57,699
That's right.

448
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,480
Anyway, you really don't think it's crazy?

449
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:05,409
What do you mean?

450
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:07,579
I mean...

451
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,280
You're acting like you've met at least ten people like me.

452
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:11,919
It makes no sense to me.

453
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,859
You said you had never once heard my lies.

454
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,859
That's true, but...

455
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,500
How did everyone else react?

456
00:29:27,469 --> 00:29:28,770
Everyone else?

457
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,939
They probably have no idea.

458
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,469
Other than my mom and dad, you're the only one who knows.

459
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,719
It's a secret that I don't want anyone to find out,

460
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,050
and I've been doing a good job of hiding it for decades,

461
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:46,990
but I'm confused from time to time.

462
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,359
"Do I really want no one to find out?"

463
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,629
"Would I feel better if I just told everyone?"

464
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,899
Well, are you always indifferent about everything?

465
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,310
No.

466
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,310
I don't trust people easily, and I'm sensitive.

467
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,879
If someone else had said it, I wouldn't have believed it.

468
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,820
But you said it, so I just believed it.

469
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,560
Well, I am the trustworthy type.

470
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,570
That's right. I heard you lie once.

471
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,270
Really? What did I say?

472
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:40,169
Does this count as a lie?

473
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:42,409
I'm not too sure,

474
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:43,909
but the other day...

475
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:54,689
Gosh!

479
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,399
I'll try to hail one.

480
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,310
Oh.

481
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,080
You're the tarot café lady.

482
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:19,679
Yes.

483
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,409
You're like...

484
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:23,580
a baguette.

485
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,090
Hard on the outside...

486
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,889
and soft on the inside.

487
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:34,760
And you probably have holes inside.

488
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:38,329
Why do you say that? We've only talked a couple of times.

489
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,070
Come on. I don't need to talk to you to know these things.

490
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,639
I've been seeing you around for over a year now.

491
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
Oh, right.

492
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,639
You don't like it when I talk to you.

493
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,050
Sorry about that.

494
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:56,480
You've been talking for a while.

495
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,250
Do you want some bread?

496
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,219
You probably don't want this.

497
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,929
I swear, it's not true.

498
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,060
Look, this is...

499
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,270
I...

500
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,039
If this was dirty,

501
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,939
I wouldn't be able to eat it.

502
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,908
You see, I may not look like it, but I'm very clean.

503
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,378
Okay, I heard you.

504
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:27,148
When something's fallen on the floor...

505
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:28,250
I managed to get a taxi.

506
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,749
- Get going. - Hurry up and get in.

507
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,980
- My taxi is here? - Yes.

00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,820
- Come with me. - It's okay.

511
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,059
You really don't want this bread?

512
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,559
- Get home safely. - You don't want this?

513
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,829
- Thank you, sir. - Wait!

514
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,560
- Would you like some bread? - No, I'm good.

00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,039
His business isn't doing well because of that incident.

517
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,310
He must be under a lot of stress.

518
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,780
I don't want to get involved in stuff like this, but...

519

Do you want to help him?

520
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:07,649
We need to find out who posted that photo with the cockroach.

521
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:10,520
It's not like I can ask everyone in the neighbourhood.

522
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,270
You startled me.

523
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,639
Are you Reporter Oh Jin Soo?

524
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,409
- Who are you? - You saw Kim Do Ha.

525
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,409
Did he look like this?

526
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,990
Well, if you suddenly show me an old picture like this,

527
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,189
how would I know?

528
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:48,060
Besides, he was wearing a mask when I saw him.

529
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,330
Is that so?

530
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:52,869
- That's too bad. - Wait, but...

531
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,169
Who's the guy in that photo?

532
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,639
He's someone I'm looking for.

533
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:09,310
Is there a reason you thought Kim Do Ha was that guy?

534
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,750
Tall, pale.

535
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,650

Well, if you ever want to send a tip-off,

538
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,069
please contact me.

539
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,739
What are you after?

540
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,500
Getting Kim Do Ha on camera?

541
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,469
Yes, sure.

542
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,278
Taking a picture of him without a mask.

543
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:39,580
If it's a picture of him with Syaon, that's even better.

544
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,279
Must he be alive in that picture?

545
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,619
Sorry?

546
00:34:51,259 --> 00:34:52,319
Call me.

547
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,860
What was that about?

(Violent Crime Unit Team 1)

549
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,210
- Sorry to interrupt. - Yes.

550
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,380
I made this sandwich.

551
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:20,850
I made a bunch and gave them out, but there's one left. It's for you.

552
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,589
Oh, I was hungry. Thank you.

553
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,920
No problem.

554
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:30,428
- I have a question. - What is it?

555
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:31,659
Do you have a girlfriend?

556
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:36,338
No, I don't.

557
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:37,699
But there's someone I like.

558
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:42,980
That's too bad. I wanted to set you up with someone.

559
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,739
That's okay. Thank you though.

560
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,650
Thank you so much for this.

561
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,179
No problem.

562
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,380
Gosh.

563
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,729
(Mr. Lee Kang Min, you are due for your follow-up tests.)

564

(Closed Today)

566
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,369
So you'd like to ask questions about your business first?

567
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,380
I must say, it's funny...

568
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,080
that I came here, seeking business advice.

569
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,650
But I heard your readings were accurate.

570
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,560
Anyway, are you working at the moment?

571
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:09,730
- Sorry? - This says you're unemployed.

572
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,259
Look.

573
00:37:12,429 --> 00:37:15,169
I studied in France.

574
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,540
I returned to Korea only recently.

575
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:21,468
Right. So you're not working at the moment.

576
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:23,779
I'll start something very soon, in this neighbourhood.

577
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,750
- This neighbourhood? - Well, I'm just thinking about it.

578
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,750
Honey, I bet you're here again. Let's go eat...

579
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,089
- What? - What?

580
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,689
Oh, do you know each other?

581
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,730
No.

582
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,989
I don't know that man either.

583
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,829
- My wife isn't here, is she? - No.

584
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,900
Where did she go?

585
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,309
Well, let me ask you other questions then.

586
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,868
- Business-related questions? - No.

587
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:58,379
- Then about your love life? - No, not that either.

588
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,880
I saw him walking by, so I brought him inside.

589
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
Well done, right?

590
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,619
Hello? Yes.

591
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:09,719
He does whatever he wants.

592
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:21,000
What was that?

593
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,499
Why did he and the realtor act like they didn't know each other?

594
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,940
The guy who just left?

595
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,310
Yes.

596
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:31,610
He said he studied in France and returned to Korea only recently.

597
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,949
He knew about the cockroach incident at the bakery.

598
00:38:36,549 --> 00:38:37,580
Really?

599
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,520
Yes. He acted like a know-it-all when he came to buy bread.

600
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:47,330
But he knew about the cockroach incident,

601
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,790
yet he still came to buy bread?

602
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,130
Come to think of it, it's odd.

603
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:01,069
There must be something between that guy and the realtor.

604
00:39:06,509 --> 00:39:07,949
Hello!

605
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:09,610
Hello.

606
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,219
Oh! You're the owner of the tarot café.

607
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,150
What brings you here?

608
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:16,219
I want to look at some properties.

609
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:19,219
Oh, you have a boyfriend.

610
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:21,389
Are you getting married? Looking for a matrimonial home?

611
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:24,460
No, it's not that.

612
00:39:25,259 --> 00:39:26,259
You're just moving in together?

613
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,169
Many couples do that these days.

614
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,940
No, I'm interested in Yeonseo Bakery.

615
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,710
What?

616
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,879
Goodness. The owner hasn't even listed it yet.

617
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,449
You're mean.

618
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,949
You want to snatch up the store space, knowing they're struggling?

619
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,888
You see, that photo with the cockroach.

620
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:48,449
I don't believe it.

621
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,159
The bakery owner is such a diligent man.

622
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:55,258
Also, the premium for that space is ridiculously high.

623
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,630
Why would you be interested in that space?

624
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,929
One moment. I have to answer this.

625
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,468
Hello? Yes, sir.

(Yeonseo Real Estate)

627
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,109
Oh, that property.

628
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,409
It won't sell unless you knock it down by 10,000 dollars.

629
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,209
Everyone is struggling financially these days, you know.

630
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,150
I guess I was wrong.

631
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:18,548
He doesn't even believe that the photo was real.

632
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,089
It could cause problems.

633
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,118
It's not easy, so please be patient.

634
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,259
I'll do my best. Yes.

635
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,630
Come and visit me at my office soon.

636
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,198
I'll buy you a nice lunch.

637
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:32,799
Yes, that's right. My gosh.

638
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:34,730
Take care.

639
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,239
Yes. Talk soon.

Mr. So.

641
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:52,449
- About the cockroach photo. - Yes.

642
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:54,650
That was me.

643
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:57,889
- Sorry? - That bug...

644
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:01,130
I think it was my fault.

645
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,500
Are you saying that's a cockroach?

646
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:10,170
Look! There's another one. Over there!

647
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,480
This is a walnut crumb.

648
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:24,279
I don't even deserve to call myself a baker.

649
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,949
Do you want to take the flour outside?

650
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:29,020
I'll give it to you for free.

Oh, okay. Come on in.

660

Take a seat.

661
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:19,469
We think the realtor was the one who posted the cockroach photo.

662
00:42:21,509 --> 00:42:22,540
What?

663
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:26,139
I wonder if the guy with permed hair paid him for doing that.

664
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,350
They seem to know each other but are hiding it.

Oh, we just love jjajangmyeon. That's why.

666

Yes, we ordered three bowls to share.

667

But you have three chopsticks too.

668
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:49,698
Yes, we ordered three bowls,

669
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:51,339
so they brought three pairs.

670
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,369
How much premium are you thinking?

671
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,069
You want to sell it urgently, right?

672
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:58,079
I think it should be less than half.

673
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Right.

What?

Give it back!

- "Mom?" - Oh, right.

How subhuman!

I see.

00:44:55,331 --> 00:44:57,929
I'm playing the top 100 pop songs that Koreans love.

714
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,500
It's Jenifer Candler and John Joy's song.

00:45:22,549 --> 00:45:25,658
I prefer something classy to such music.

728
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:27,330
Did you listen to songs other than the title song?

729
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:29,559
Sensuous acoustic melodies,

730
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,429
instrumentation with a wonderful sense of space,

731
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,759
and skillfully used stereo.

732
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:35,929
What the... Are you actually him?

733
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,169
So his music is all right.

734
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,409
Anyway, Kim Do Ha's songs are not bad.

735
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:42,508
All right, I'll try playing one of his songs sometime...

736
00:45:42,509 --> 00:45:44,609
- since you highly recommend them. - Right.

737
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,580
I better play his music once.

738
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,609
By the way, I know all of you here...

739
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,619
except for him.

740
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,818
I'm not sure if he has broad shoulders or a small face,

741
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:54,619
- but I don't know his name. - Me neither.

742
00:45:57,889 --> 00:45:58,889
My name is...

743
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:01,860
Kim Do Ha.

744
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:10,770
- That's funny. - He says he's Kim Do Ha.

745
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:12,699
You don't want to tell us what your name is?

746
00:46:13,299 --> 00:46:14,468
It really is Kim Do Ha.

747
00:46:14,469 --> 00:46:16,838
That's hilarious.

748
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:19,278
- You're lying. - He's your favourite musician.

749
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:20,879
Give him your autograph, Do Ha.

750
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,279
It's ridiculous.

751
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,079
Do Ha, give me one too, so I can put it up in my store.

752
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,649
Do Ha.

753
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,189
You're funny. Cheers.

754
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,759
- Cheers. - Cheers.

755
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,589
We're drinking with Do Ha.

756
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,158
- Cheers. - We're drinking too much.

757
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:40,060
- Cheers. - Cheers.

758
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,569
Come on.

759
00:46:43,069 --> 00:46:45,838
- Drinks feel like water today. - I know.

760
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,238
- How much is the bill? - About 280 dollars.

761
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,309
- Will you be okay? - No way!

762
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,609
- You're treating us today. - What?

763
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,909
Fold your finger if you think you're handsome.

764
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,610
I had no choice but to fold mine.

765
00:46:57,619 --> 00:46:59,649
- No. - You folded three?

766
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,948
- Come on. - You're well aware you're handsome.

767
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:03,318
Do Ha, you...

768
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:04,319
Why did you fold yours?

769
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,859
What? I have a pretty chin.

770
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,028
Are you kidding me?

771
00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:08,428
- Unfold it. - Why...

772
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:09,790
This is unexpected though.

773
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:12,899
- Tetenchi. - Tetenchi.

774
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,028
- Down. - Nice.

775
00:47:14,029 --> 00:47:15,230
- Yes! - Great.

776
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:18,669
My team!

777
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,310
- Boo. - Boo.

778
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:25,380
Very good.

779
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:27,749
- Gosh. - Nice.

780
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,349
- Nice. - That's cheating.

781
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,618
- What? - Gosh.

782
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:33,048
- It's okay. - If you throw it like that...

783
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:34,049
Here.

784
00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:36,289
- Nice. - Good.

785
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:37,360
It's not good.

786
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:38,819
- Nice. - Yes!

787
00:47:40,219 --> 00:47:41,230
Goodness!

788
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:43,959
- Gosh. - Nice.

789
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,560
You can do it.

790
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,770
Okay!

791
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,069
- We won! - Yes!

792
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:56,610
- You lost! - Goodness.

793
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,409
Why did you drink so much?

794
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:04,380
I just followed you drinking, Mr. Kim.

795
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:08,449
You keep calling me Mr. Kim,

796
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,860
but isn't it a little too rigid?

797
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,389
How should I address you then?

798
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:15,429
Well...

799
00:48:16,759 --> 00:48:19,960
Just by my first name. It'd be way better.

800
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:25,600
Then, Do Ha?

801
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,139
Yes, Sol Hee.

802
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:44,690
Just a moment.

803
00:48:54,429 --> 00:48:55,529
It's nice.

804
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,110
Nice...

805
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:11,650
Here you go.

806
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,790
I love this ice cream.

807
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:15,619
I know.

808
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:17,190
What you hate...

809
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:19,920
are spoon worms, braised pupas, cilantro,

810
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:21,989
and eggplants.

811
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,270
Anyway, Mr. Kim...

812
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:32,139
I mean, Do Ha. If a woman dates someone...

813
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,509
who doesn't tell lies like you, she might find it so comfortable.

814
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:39,009
But you heard me lie once.

815
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,049
Oh, right.

816
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:43,310
We were on our way back from Gangneung.

817
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:46,779
It was just you sleep talking.

818
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:48,350
Sleep talking?

819
00:49:48,351 --> 00:49:50,790
You said you didn't kill someone.

820
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,860
It seemed like you were having a nightmare because of Syaon.

821
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,730
It was a lie when she said she'd kill herself.

822
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,969
You didn't know, did you?

823
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,080
You said you didn't kill someone.

824
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:36,799
Goodnight.

825
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:45,810
(Goodnight.)

826
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:00,259
The food is on me today.

827
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,089
It's all right.

828
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,159
In this time and age, I shouldn't take such treats.

829
00:51:06,759 --> 00:51:08,529
Oh, please, sir.

830
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:11,040
I've had my eyes on her for some time now,

831
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,670
and she is quite decent.

832
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:16,369
She's smart and knows how to win people's favours.

833
00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:19,908
But she has a problem with her son.

834
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:22,449
Gosh, that was just a happening.

835
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:26,350
She struggled a lot because of it.

836
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:28,819
Whether it was a happening or not,

837
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,119
people are too busy to pay attention to the details.

838
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:34,689
Everyone focuses on provocative headlines...

839
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,029
and doesn't even read what articles are actually about.

840
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,659
We have no choice but to choose someone with a clean slate.

841
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:42,600
Let me pour you a drink, sir.

842
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:49,610
For a candidate of the upcoming governor election...

843
00:51:51,009 --> 00:51:52,009
Oh, that.

844
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:55,279
Yoo Ji Eun seems eligible for me.

845
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:57,779
You mean the Gyeonggi-do spokeswoman?

846
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,690
Isn't she a little too young?

847
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,489
A young age is an advantage in every field.

848
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:07,159
Even in political circles, young politicians are preferred.

849
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,429
With experience and age,

850
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:12,759
you should help her in many ways.

851
00:52:14,429 --> 00:52:15,569
Of course.

852
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,000
Yes.

853
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:25,580
Do Ha wants to get some air.

854
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:27,610
He comes outside.

855
00:52:27,779 --> 00:52:29,810
Then he runs into me.

856
00:52:39,619 --> 00:52:40,659
Do Ha.

857
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:43,329
- What's with you? - I'm sorry.

858
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,459
I got the wrong person.

859
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,630
- Aren't you Syaon? - I'm not.

860
00:52:46,759 --> 00:52:48,130
- Hey. - It's you, Syaon.

861
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:49,699
What? She's Syaon?

862
00:52:49,869 --> 00:52:50,969
I'm not.

863
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:52,799
- Are you really Syaon? - My gosh.

864
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,939
- Can't you take a picture with us? - I'm a huge fan.

865
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,368
Come close. This is insane.

866
00:52:56,369 --> 00:52:58,139
- For real? - Gosh.

867
00:52:58,310 --> 00:52:59,380
Gosh.

868
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:02,810
What's with these people?

869
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:04,719
Are you okay?

870
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,150
What on earth?

871
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:07,279
Is he her boyfriend?

872
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:08,589
Not again.

873
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:12,758
I get that you don't know anything.

874
00:53:12,759 --> 00:53:15,230
But my girlfriend is way prettier than Syaon.

875
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,600
Stop bothering her,

876
00:53:18,759 --> 00:53:19,799
and just leave.

877
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:31,679
Where's your car?

878
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:34,080
- I'll walk you there. - Over there.

879
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,489
I'll escort you safely, so follow my lead.

880
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:58,670
Are you expecting someone?

881
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,969
No.

882
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,039
Thank goodness.

883
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,239
You have no customers, right?

884
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,138
Could I pull down the blinds?

885
00:54:05,139 --> 00:54:07,448
What is this about? Is a VIP customer coming?

886
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:09,980
Well, I'd say a VVIP customer.

887
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:26,630
Don't worry. Ms. Hunter...

888
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,830
I mean my boss is really nice.

889
00:54:31,069 --> 00:54:32,170
Do you work here?

890
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,739
What brought you here?

891
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:38,540
Do you know my boss?

892
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:42,110
Don't we need a word?

893
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,079
I'm sorry, but can you give us some space?

894
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,089
Okay.

895
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:57,900
(Luni Tarot Café)

896
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,029
You said you and Do Ha lived next door, right?

897
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:05,040
- Yes. - What's there between you two?

898
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:07,369
Are you just neighbours? Or...

899
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,279
Don't tell me you're in a relationship.

900
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,139
We aren't.

901
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,179
We just eat together from time to time.

902
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,549
Move.

903
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,420
- Excuse me? - Where do you want to live?

904
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,189
I'll pay for the house,

905
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,118
so pick somewhere you wanted to live.

906
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:27,860
Why must you go this far?

907
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:29,928
I said we weren't dating.

908
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:31,929
But you eat together.

909
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,770
Do Ha isn't the kind of person who eats with others.

910
00:55:36,929 --> 00:55:39,269
He normally doesn't tell anyone his name...

911
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,040
nor does he show anyone his face.

912
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,610
What's your bank account number? I'll send you the money.

913
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,210
This much.

914
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:53,349
On condition of moving to another place...

915
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,650
and cutting ties with Do Ha.

916
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:57,860
Please.

917
00:56:21,449 --> 00:56:23,678
(Mok Sol Hee)

918
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:24,880
(Mother)

919
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:29,589
(Mother)

920
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,290
Hello, Mother.

921
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:34,959
Where are you?

922
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,428
See me later in the evening.

923
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:37,429
This is urgent.

924
00:56:41,429 --> 00:56:42,429
I don't want to.

925
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:46,869
I'll just keep living his next door.

926
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:53,238
So you do have a crush on him.

927
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:54,750
Yes, I think so.

928
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:56,710
Now leave.

929
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:03,349
Sol Hee, please don't come between me and Do Ha.

930
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:04,420
"Sol Hee?"

931
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,588
There's nothing between you.

932
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:07,789
I'm not interrupting your anything.

933
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:11,298
You can find another man, but I can't.

934
00:57:11,299 --> 00:57:13,259
I'll die without him.

935
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,770
You say that like a habit.

936
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:18,739
You did it last time too.

937
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:22,009
Back in Gangneung.

938
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,509
You never meant to die in the first place.

939
00:57:26,739 --> 00:57:28,650
It's not like I wanted to do it.

940
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:31,579
I had to add insult to his injury.

941
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,019
Because that was his weakness.

942
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,850
Only then, he'd pay attention to me.

943
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:38,290
What is it?

944
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,330
What is his weakness?

945
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,630
He once killed someone.

946
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:56,310
Who killed someone?

947
00:57:56,969 --> 00:57:58,040
Mr. Kim Do Ha did?

948
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:09,750
Do Ha.

949
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,818
Why aren't you covering your face? That's not careful of you.

950
00:58:12,819 --> 00:58:14,630
What is it? You said it was urgent.

951
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,029
This won't do.

952
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Go to Germany.

953
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:26,440
You wanted to study music there.

954
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:29,669
You seemed a lot unstable,

955
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:31,309
so I had you by Deuk Chan's side...

956
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:33,480
and do what you wanted.

957
00:58:33,779 --> 00:58:36,909
But you can't write music for idol singers forever.

958
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,150
This was what was urgent?

959
00:58:43,819 --> 00:58:44,860
Seung Ju.

960
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:51,060
I've always lived for you.

961
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,158
After your dad died,

962
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,130
I wanted to raise you in abundance.

963
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,399
I went straight to work as soon as the funeral ended...

964
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,569
despite people calling me spiteful.

965
00:59:02,909 --> 00:59:04,408
When that happened to you,

966
00:59:04,409 --> 00:59:06,039
I made use of all my connections...

967
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,678
and begged on my knees...

968
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:09,779
to get you acquitted without charges.

969
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,119
So,

970
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:18,190
couldn't you...

971
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,290
help me just this once?

972
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:25,130
You really...

973
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,369
are a politician now.

974
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,399
After Father passed away, you gained many votes...

975
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,770
using your image as a single mother.

976
00:59:35,369 --> 00:59:37,039
And for sending me to a prestigious college,

977
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,210
you got nominated as a superintendent of education.

978
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,580
You couldn't let that son of yours become a murderer.

979
00:59:44,049 --> 00:59:45,379
That was why you went on your knees.

980
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,318
How could you...

981
00:59:47,319 --> 00:59:49,019
Just be honest with me.

982
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,888
I'm getting in the way of your career,

983
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:52,589
and so you want to send me abroad.

984
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,158
You don't even want to see...

985
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:56,460
a frightening face of a murderer.

986
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:04,369
I'm not going to Germany.

987
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,969
I have a more urgent and important business here.

988
01:00:09,969 --> 01:00:11,009
Goodbye.

989
01:00:22,989 --> 01:00:28,489
(Kim Seung Ju's student life...)

990
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,960
Why aren't you going home?

991
01:01:07,699 --> 01:01:08,770
I have...

992
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:11,000
something to tell you.

993
01:01:14,969 --> 01:01:16,009
Me too.

994
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:18,040
I have something to tell you too.

995
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:24,549
I heard something strange earlier today.

996
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,790
That you killed someone.

997
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,028
I'm sorry I'm bringing this up.

998
01:01:42,029 --> 01:01:43,100
You're offended, aren't you?

999
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:00,179
I was a murder suspect.

1000
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:10,290
But...

1001
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,360
it wasn't me.

1002
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:15,929
I didn't kill anyone.

1003
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:19,839
I didn't kill anyone.

1004
01:02:32,049 --> 01:02:36,190
(My Lovely Liar)

1005
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,119
A murderer.

1006
01:03:06,779 --> 01:03:09,549
But you didn't kill the victim.

1007
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:11,959
She even found out that you're Kim Seung Ju.

1008
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,319
The moment she speaks up, both of us will be doomed.

1009
01:03:16,089 --> 01:03:17,690
You think I'm the murderer.

1010
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,730
But why didn't you tell me?

1011
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,330
I'll be better to you.

1012
01:03:24,569 --> 01:03:25,770
If someone else comes to mind...

1013
01:03:27,699 --> 01:03:29,270
at a moment like this...

1014
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:30,869
That means you like him.

1015
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,480
Eom Ho came to see me.

1016
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,549
Where's Eom Ji?

1017
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,380
Where are you keeping her?

1018
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:38,650
No...
