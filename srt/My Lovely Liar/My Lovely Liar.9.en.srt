(Hwang Min Hyun)

00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:25,330
(Yun Ji On)

(My Lovely Liar)

7
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,009
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

8
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,078
(in this drama are fictitious.)

9
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,079
(The guardians of child actors were present at the filming.)

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,990
I don't need explanations.

11
00:00:57,389 --> 00:00:58,590
I believe you.

12
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:02,929
I do.

13
00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:20,009
That was really dangerous.

14
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,119
It could have turned out badly.

15
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:27,788
(Episode 9)

16
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:30,059
Gosh, your house looks amazing.

17
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:39,429
Were you listening?

18
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,369
Yes. I heard you just now and earlier too.

19
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,339
You're not hurt. And you're home safely.

20
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,009
I think we can talk about something else.

21
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,169
That man is the girl's brother, right?

22
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:19,810
Yes.

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,810
What was she like?

24
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,750
Your late girlfriend.

25
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,018
(Congratulations on getting accepted to SNU, Kim Seung Ju.)

26
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,489
- Over here. - Let's take a picture.

27
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,060
- Gosh. Hello. - Congratulations.

28
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,659
In 1, 2, 3.

29
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,299
(Graduation)

30
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,299
- You're the best, my son. - Why do you keep staring at him?

31
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:49,840
Just go.

32
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,079
Where were you?

33
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,780
Hello.

34
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,720
- Hello. - Hello.

35
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,889
- Let's take a picture together. - Okay.

36
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:11,489
Let's take a picture.

37
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:15,060
In 1, 2, 3.

38
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,829
- Say, "Cheese kimchi." - "Cheese kimchi?"

39
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,699
Come on. Stand closer.

40
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,739
We were each other's first love.

41
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,009
And we liked each other a lot.

42
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,749
When I started going to college in Seoul,

43
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,850
we had to stay apart.

44
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:38,819
But I thought it wouldn't be a problem...

45
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,220
back then.

46
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,919
Can't you stay here?

47
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,000
I think I'm going to miss you a lot. Please?

48
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:52,970
My classes start tomorrow.

49
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:57,440
Should I take a later bus?

50
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,069
Should I take the last bus out?

51
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,680
You should just go.

52
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:08,750
But...

53
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,220
you have to wear your ring all the time.

54
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:15,859
Don't take it off. Okay?

55
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,060
Okay. I won't.

56
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:26,200
But she must have felt insecure that I was going to Seoul.

57
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,010
Can't I just live with you in Seoul?

58
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:37,679
You know that I'm staying in the dorm right now.

59
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,010
And...

60
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,749
I don't think I can come down next week.

61
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:45,689
I have to study for my midterms.

62
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,989
You already took the exam.

63
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,960
That was the performance test for my major.

64
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:55,298
Just because I'm not going to college,

65
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:57,330
you think I'm clueless and you're lying to me, right?

66
00:04:58,429 --> 00:04:59,599
I'm not lying.

67
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,970
Then come see me on Friday next time.

68
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,499
Coming here a day early isn't that hard.

69
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,179
Going back and forth isn't easy for me.

70
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,678
I have group projects, lessons, and tutoring sessions.

71
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:17,450
I take care of them during the week. I have to make time to come here.

72
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,720
But if you act like this every time I come here...

73
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:22,590
This is hard for me too.

74
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,390
You've changed.

75
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,729
You once told me that not seeing me was harder.

76
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,378
What are you doing?

77
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:43,140
If you're going to leave me too, I'd rather die.

78
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,439
Stop it.

79
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,850
I don't have any dreams.

80
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,350
You are my dream.

81
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,890
But how come you have so many important things?

82
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,089
You keep putting other things before me.

83
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,859
I can't lose you any more than I already did.

84
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:58,829
I'm hanging by a thread,

85
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,729
and it feels like it's going to snap!

86
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:06,169
Okay. I'm sorry.

87
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:08,869
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,140
Back then,

89
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,340
I thought she behaved that way because she loved me a lot.

90
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:20,210
I thought...

91
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,320
there wouldn't be a problem if I made her happy.

92
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:33,059
What are you doing?

93
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,059
What? I was...

94
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,799
I was just...

95
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:42,139
(Don't contact me again. If you do, I'll kill you.)

96
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,839
(I'm busy, so don't contact me again.)

97
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,710
They were clingy and pestering you.

98
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,770
So I took care of them for you.

99
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,780
You're really nice to other women.

100
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,748
If you're half as nice to me as you are...

101
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:53,950
Stop it!

102
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,780
Seung Ju.

103
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,559
Seung Ju, I'm sorry. Let's sit down.

104
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,030
- What was that? - Gosh.

105
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,100
Seung Ju...

106
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:16,869
Seung Ju.

107
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,340
Seung Ju.

108
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,830
Let's break up.

109
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:44,629
I can't do this anymore. I want to break up.

110
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
No.

111
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,609
I told you.

112
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,139
You are my dream.

113
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,210
How could I...

114
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,978
be your dream?

115
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,479
Everything I do with you is my dream.

116
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,489
Are you...

117
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:10,059
seeing another woman in Seoul?

118
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:17,429
I still regret the lie I told her that night.

119
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,200
Yes. You're right. I like someone else now.

120
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
Who?

121
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,850
Is it that girl?

122
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:34,409
The girl who cried next to you on the orientation trip.

123
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,479
The girl from your class.

124
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,749
Or... Wait. Is it her?

125
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:41,589
The girl you pulled an all-nighter for the group project.

126
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,389
You said you bought her a coffee too.

127
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:45,330
Don't tell me it's her.

128
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,729
The high school girl you tutored. The one from a rich family.

129
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:50,560
Hey. Who is it?

130
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,100
Who is she? Tell me!

131
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:25,728
- Let go of me. - Stop it. What are you doing?

132
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:27,729
Let go of me!

133
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,248
Who is it? So who is this girl?

134
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:43,518
Just tell me who she is!

135
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,519
Give it back.

136
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:58,529
Seung Ju.

137
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,729
I'll be a better girlfriend than her.

138
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,939
You know that I can't live without you!

139
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,540
I'm going to die. I'm serious!

140
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,310
Fine. If you want to die, then do it. Die!

141
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,399
I wanted to look back.

142
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,769
But if I looked back,

143
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,670
I was afraid everything would repeat.

144
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,909
(Music Hall)

145
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,509
Mr. Kim Seung Ju?

146
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,779
Yes. Who are you?

147
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,248
I'm Detective Kwak Jin Hyuk...

148
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,920
from the Violent Crime Unit of Hakcheon Police Station.

149
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,960
You're under arrest for the murder of Choi Eom Ji.

150
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,259
What?

151
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:02,758
You have the right to an attorney.

152
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,498
You have the right to remain silent.

153
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:05,529
("Applied Vocal Music")

154
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,080
We found your shirt in your closet.

155
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:23,419
It's the shirt you wore that night.

156
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,450
And we found her blood and your blood from the shirt.

157
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,460
Did you kill Choi Eom Ji?

158
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,259
Yes.

159
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,399
I killed her.

160
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,040
How did you kill her?

161
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,170
What about her body?

162
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:47,210
Where's her body?

163
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,350
You confessed? What are you talking about?

164
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,790
They didn't find anything. Why did you confess?

165
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,790
She died because of me.

166
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,060
- Because of me. - Get your act together!

167
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,100
Your lawyer will be here shortly.

168
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,070
Her body wasn't even found yet.

169
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,210
You can get acquitted of this charge.

170
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:23,879
You know that this is an important time for me.

171
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,049
They'll review the validity of the warrant.

172
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,509
Let's make sure it goes our way. Okay?

173
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,999
So...

174
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:49,470
I recanted my testimony that I didn't kill her.

175
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,440
Deuk Chan corroborated my alibi.

176
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,850
Eom Ji's body was never found.

177
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,820
So I was acquitted.

178
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,450
Afterwards, I changed my name.

179
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:11,690
If I didn't tell her...

180
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,960
what I said,

181
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,229
she wouldn't have died, right?

182
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:22,869
I shouldn't have said that.

183
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,670
I could've said all the other mean things.

184
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,409
But I shouldn't have told her to die.

185
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,529
No wonder why it came across as a lie.

186
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,970
You said you didn't kill her.

187
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,310
But deep down, you think you're responsible.

188
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,080
But after hearing the whole story...

189
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,749
Do Ha.

190
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,090
Seung Ju, you didn't kill her.

191
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,060
You didn't kill her.

192
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:58,399
Hey, you. Come here.

193
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,700
Gosh, I can't believe this.

194
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,739
You're a reporter, right?

195
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,540
Yes.

196
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,810
I know that Kim Do Ha lives here.

197
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,050
Imagine how desperate I must be to do this.

198
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,518
I'm trying to earn a living. Can't you help me out here?

199
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,349
I can't help you even if I wanted to.

200
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,689
He hasn't been home.

201
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,289
It's been a while since he came back.

202
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,689
Even reporters stopped coming here a while ago.

203
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,859
Gosh. News travels slow for you.

204
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,258
- Did he move? - I don't know.

205
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:32,999
Get out of here. Come on.

206
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,170
Seriously.

207
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,470
(He hasn't been home for a while.)

208
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,830
I'll find you.

209
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,529
I will find you no matter what.

210
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:08,940
Okay?

211
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,269
Gosh.

212
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,670
Sorry about that.

213
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,748
You killed a girl. Do you think an apology can fix everything?

214
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:21,920
What? I didn't kill anyone.

215
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Gosh.

216
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,430
Eom Ho might recognize you.

217
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,029
What?

218
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,600
How would he recognize me?

219
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,609
He saw you in Hakcheon.

220
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,778
Get up.

221
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:53,979
- You're coming with me. - So get lost!

222
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,519
- What's going on? - What's wrong with him?

223
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:02,759
Don't you remember? You sat next to me that day.

224
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,259
What?

225
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:06,729
It was you?

226
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,060
When did you remember that?

227
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:12,770
The first moment I saw you after moving to Yeonseo-dong.

228
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:15,540
Why didn't you tell me right away?

229
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,669
I thought you didn't lie.

230
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:21,810
But I guess you just didn't talk.

231
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,240
I'm sorry.

232
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,409
Back then, I was afraid that you would find out who I was.

233
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,750
I couldn't even take off my mask.

234
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,520
But I doubt that Choi Eom Ho will remember me.

235
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,159
The fact that you still remember that is amazing.

236
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:43,959
I found you...

237
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,929
fascinating.

238
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:52,139
Is that a compliment or what?

239
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,909
Anyway,

240
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:57,040
come back to Yeonseo-dong.

241
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:01,280
I doubt that Choi Eom Ho knows you're staying in Yeonseo-dong.

242
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,919
Even if he comes back, I can listen to his lies.

243
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:10,459
I'll take that as a yes and go back first.

244
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:16,899
Wait.

245
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:18,500
Why?

246
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,300
Can you sleep over?

247
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,100
What?

248
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,980
He still might be around the apartment.

249
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,209
If you go now, you might be in danger.

250
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,850
I see.

251
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,090
Okay.

252
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,939
You can sleep here.

253
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,310
Then what about you?

254
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:03,010
I usually sleep on the sofa.

255
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,480
I can't fall asleep on the bed.

256
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,820
That's true.

257
00:19:14,449 --> 00:19:15,760
Do you need anything else?

258
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,129
Comfortable clothes?

259
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,659
Comfortable clothes.

260
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,399
Wait.

261
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,379
Liverpool?

262
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,859
I'll get you back for this.

263
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:25,689
Goodnight.

264
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,090
(Sleep inducer)

265
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,958
Because of that,

266
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:07,428
utilizing the players in the countryside can be iffy.

267
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:09,839
Looking at his last game in Bilbao,

268
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,709
he demonstrated a risk for the team.

269
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,608
It's important to figure out how the coach will alleviate that.

270
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,479
Actually, Pedri won't be playing today due to his injury.

271
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,509
Are you up?

272
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,909
Who's going to fill in for Pedri? Will it be Kessie? Or Sertz?

273
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,480
Yes.

274
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,489
What are you doing still up?

275
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,149
(Kim Do Ha: What are you doing still up?)

276
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
I can't sleep.

277
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,889
It feels weird to sleep on your bed.

278
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,000
I had never let anyone sleepover at my house.

279
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,169
So it feels weird.

280
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:40,469
Not even once?

281
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:42,969
That's right.

282
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,169
I should hear these things in person.

283
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:49,179
The El Clasico derby starts in ten minutes.

284
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,639
Shall we watch it together?

285
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,580
That'd be nice, but...

286
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,949
I'm a little hungry.

287
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,050
(I'm a little hungry.)

288
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:10,859
How did you do this?

289
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,199
Are you sure you've done this before?

290
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,010
Oh, my.

291
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,810
It looks like it's snowing.

292
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,889
By the way, how long have you been living here?

293
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,889
Well... About two years?

294
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,359
I see.

295
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,730
I'm suddenly grateful to Syaon.

296
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:48,800
Without the dating scandal with her, you would've kept living here.

297
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,169
At first, I thought this place was very fancy.

298
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,840
But thinking that this was your world...

299
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:57,540
It's quite lonely.

300
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,230
Oh, my.

301
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,260
My gosh. This screen is huge!

302
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:18,730
It looks like a movie theatre.

303
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,629
This is insanely cool.

304
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:22,969
Oh, my.

305
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,249
FC Barcelona's uniform...

306
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,549
features Catalonia's...

307
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,350
When did you become a soccer fan?

308
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,619
When I was little.

309
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,560
For some reason, I thought my dad always looked sad.

310
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:47,189
But he looked so happy whenever he was watching soccer.

311
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:50,830
I felt like going into a penalty shootout after overtimes...

312
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,800
meant that my dad could be happy for that much longer.

313
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,669
That's why I liked it.

314
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,939
So you started liking it because of your father.

315
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,169
At the beginning, yes.

316
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,879
Now, I like it for a different reason.

317
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,510
In soccer, lies are useless.

318
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:10,580
You can believe what you see.

319
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,750
That's why I like it.

320
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,359
You're...

321
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,429
like soccer.

322
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,810
Oh, the noodles will swell up.

323
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:44,449
Let's eat.

324
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,419
He's dutifully playing his role.

325
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:51,289
- So far, he hasn't let us down. - That's right.

326
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,990
The current score is...

327
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,459
Here he comes.

328
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,229
- Right behind him... - Wait!

329
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,570
- It'll go in! - He kicked the ball!

330
00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:03,770
My, the goalkeeper defended well.

331
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,669
That's nothing impressive.

332
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:07,868
A goalkeeper should do that much.

333
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:09,138
No, I beg to differ.

334
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:11,138
It curved after hitting the defender,

335
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:12,449
then it rebounded.

336
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:15,208
There was no rebound, and the defender wasn't hit.

337
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:17,178
He was!

338
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:19,148
He was hit. They'll show it now. Watch.

339
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:21,219
- Right there. - Go!

340
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:23,589
- See? It hit him! - No, it did not.

341
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,019
- It hit him. Look! - Look at that!

342
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,128
It went between his legs.

343
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:28,059
No! It hit the back of his leg.

344
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,958
- No, it didn't. - It did!

345
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,059
- Look. It really didn't. - See that? No!

346
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,398
It went that way because it hit the back of his leg.

347
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,500
It hit him.

348
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,469
Sure, if you say so.

349
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,209
All right.

350
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,109
Gosh, he really was hit.

351
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,989
The phone is turned off.

352
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,919
Please leave a message after the tone.

353
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,990
Where did she go?

354
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,600
Sol Hee.

355
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:12,439
Sol Hee.

356
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:14,939
Who are you?

357
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:17,279
Sol Hee, where are you? Sol Hee.

358
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,510
- Sol Hee, are you in there? - You can't go in there.

359
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,280
Oh! Hello, ma'am.

360
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,879
Ms. Mok isn't here today.

361
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,490
Oh. Well...

362
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:30,520
My daughter, Sol Hee...

363
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:34,260
Do you know if she's seeing someone?

364
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,858
You know how she is.

365
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:40,600
She rarely tells us things about her personal life.

366
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,739
My gosh. Because of that guy,

367
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,510
I haven't been able to sleep for the past few days.

368
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,408
It's not easy to find a good-looking man...

369
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,608
who's also competent.

370
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:55,709
Oh, is Ms. Hunter dating...

371
00:26:55,879 --> 00:26:57,250
a good-looking guy?

372
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,520
I came here to ask you that very question.

373
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:04,388
She's not even answering my calls.

374
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,628
Would you like a cup of coffee?

375
00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:07,730
Yes, an iced Americano.

376
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:13,469
Oh, dear. I made that mistake when I was younger.

377
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:14,698
I see.

378
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,439
I married Sol Hee's father solely based on his looks.

379
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:21,369
He kind of looked like Antonio Banderas, the actor.

380
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,780
I didn't even consider anything else.

381
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,050
Like an idiot.

382
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:27,878
That's how I ruined my life.

383
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,250
I see. That's how you ruined your life.

384
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,050
Do daughters inherit their mothers' taste in men?

385
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,310
Hello, excuse me.

386
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,080
Hello, sir.

387
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,090
We're...

388
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,359
writers of a TV show...

389
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,060
called "I Live in Nature."

390
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:16,999
Could we have a quick chat?

391
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,859
Please leave. I'm not interested.

392
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,929
Well...

393
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,129
Say something.

394
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,340
The thing is, sir...

395
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:28,209
We really struggled to climb up here.

396
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,609
We didn't even have breakfast. I really am about to pass out.

397
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,080
Me too. I feel like I'm about to faint.

398
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,459
(Mok Tae Sub)

399
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:49,060
Then I'll make you a bowl of spicy noodles.

400
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,760
You can sit here and wait.

401
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:53,669
- My gosh. Thank you. - Thank you!

402
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,530
What?

403
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,859
He said he couldn't sleep, but he's fast asleep.

404
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:41,949
He looks handsome even in the morning.

405
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,379
He had ramyeon last night.

406
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,999
Gosh!

407
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,469
If you sear it until the outside looks a little burnt,

408
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,198
it looks even more delicious.

409
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,399
No, that's not true.

410
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:04,199
Hello.

411
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,909
Why do you think my nickname was Pig?

412
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,080
What happened was... I was going to walk past you...

413
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:11,938
but stepped on the remote.

414
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:13,310
Let's see which one tastes better.

415
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,609
It's burning.

416
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,949
- Goodness. Look, it's burnt! - Oh, my. That looks fun.

417
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:19,419
Gosh.

418
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,590
Have you done stuff like that before?

419
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,790
No, never.

420
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:27,330
Same here, except for when I was little.

421
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,060
That must be nice.

422
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:38,939
Gosh, the sun's up.

423
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,580
(Mother)

424
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,520
The person is unable to answer the phone.

425
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,159
My gosh!

426
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,300
- Hello, Assemblywoman Jung. - Yes, hello.

427
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,799
How's your prep for the TV debate going?

428
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,070
Gosh, I'm so nervous that it's driving me crazy.

429
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,309
Oh, please. I know you're just saying that.

430
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,480
You worked as a spokesman in the past.

431
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,179
Well, we already know the questions we'll be asked, so...

432
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:29,859
The candidates should all get together for a meal soon.

433
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,830
Let's show the party members that it's a healthy competition.

434
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,359
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

435
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,529
Even if you're not nominated,

436
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,669
you should sincerely applaud the one that got nominated.

437
00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:44,540
- Let's go. - Yes, sir.

438
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:04,590
Can't you go faster?

439
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:06,189
(Mok Sol Hee)

440
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,459
Drive right behind me.

441
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,060
Don't lose me.

442
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,270
Okay, I won't.

443
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,590
Okay.

444
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,830
If you suddenly bring me to a place like this...

445
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,770
You said you wanted to check out a camp ground.

446
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:49,968
Right, but we should've come prepared.

447
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,040
I can't believe we came here empty-handed.

448
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,239
Beginners need good equipment.

449
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
Look at that.

450
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:57,709
Over there. They have almost everything except for a dishwasher.

451
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,409
Just wait.

452
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:04,179
(Geumeun Morae Camping Site, Yeoju)

453
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,820
Hello.

454
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,689
I rented the full set.

455
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,119
All of this?

456
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,840
- Where should I put this? - Over here, please.

457
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,839
- Right in the middle. - The middle?

458
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,879
Okay.

459
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,709
Like this?

460
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:08,379
What? Really?

461
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:18,619
Hold on.

462
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:29,869
Oh, this isn't it. You don't know how to do it.

463
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,339
No, this is wrong.

464
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,040
This side should be...

465
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,049
Like this, right?

466
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,770
Look at you.

467
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:23,619
Well done.

468
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,089
Good job.

469
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,400
- Have some water. - Thanks.

470
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:48,779
Look at all the meat you're throwing into the fire.

471
00:36:00,029 --> 00:36:01,029
Isn't it good?

472
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:05,460
- My goodness. - That's hot!

473
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,869
What was that?

474
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,670
Sol Hee, are you all right?

475
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:12,670
- Yes, I'm fine. - It must've totally startled you.

476
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,110
Why is this so hard to peel?

477
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,489
Ta-Da!

478
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:37,060
My dad would love this place.

479
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,330
It's nice here.

480
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,299
Thank you, Mr. Kim Do Ha.

481
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,339
Well, I guess it's hard for you to quit that habit.

482
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:56,520
Last time, we said we'd get on a first-name basis. Am I wrong?

483
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,549
Well...

484
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,489
Mr. Kim Do Ha and Do Ha sound similar enough.

485
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:05,420
All right, then. Ms. Mok Sol Hee.

486
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,989
Gosh, seriously.

487
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,130
Fine. I'll try harder.

488
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,509
By the way, why did you suddenly decide to believe me?

489
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,569
It sounded like a lie to you.

490
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,580
I don't know either.

491
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,279
I guess I wanted to believe you more than my ears...

492
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,119
which I had been relying on for 27 years.

493
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:39,460
I must say, it's so fascinating.

494
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:42,589
Five years ago, you sat next to me on the bus.

495
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,630
Then you became my next-door neighbour.

496
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,299
And now, you're sitting right next to me.

497
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,469
Right?

498
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,839
I suppose you're my fate.

499
00:37:56,779 --> 00:37:57,880
I'm fascinated again.

500
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:02,480
Back then, I thought you were my fate too.

501
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:06,850
Now, you don't think that?

502
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:22,069
Are you cold?

503
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,569
A little.

504
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,079
We've tracked down the suspect's vehicle.

505
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,209
We'll block and stake out these exit routes.

506
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,079
- Kang Min, you'll be here. - Yes, sir.

507
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,319
- And this is where you'll be. - Yes, sir. Got it.

508
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,189
- He's dead meat. - Let's go!

509
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,889
- Hurry. - See you later!

510
00:38:47,889 --> 00:38:49,359
If someone else comes to mind...

511
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,960
at a moment like this, does it mean I'm crazy?

512
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,799
Wait up! I'm coming with you.

513
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,139
Are you in a bad mood?

514
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:04,279
How could I be in a good mood?

515
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,349
We're heading out to catch a scumbag who stabbed someone and fled.

516
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,880
No, it's not about that. You seem a little different today.

517
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,889
Don't worry about my mood. Just focus on catching the suspect.

518
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:18,659
Yes, sir!

519
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,630
I'm curious about something.

520
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:27,699
Then how do promises sound like to you?

521
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:31,339
Even if you really meant it when you made the promise,

522
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,839
you could have a change of heart later on.

523
00:39:38,139 --> 00:39:40,249
If you truly mean it the moment you say it,

524
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,949
it sounds true to me.

525
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:49,350
"I'll love you forever."

526
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:53,330
Then stuff like that would sound true too.

527
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:57,759
But those things don't mean much as there are so many variables.

528
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,068
I tell my clients...

529
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:02,569
not to blindly believe promises or pledges.

530
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:04,699
I tell them to get a clear answer.

531
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,739
A clear answer? Like what?

532
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:10,940
For example...

533
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,650
"The person I love the most now is you."

534
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:18,150
Answers like this are most succinct and precise.

535
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,929
The person I love the most now...

536
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,529
is you, Sol Hee.

537
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:35,860
Look, this is yummy.

538
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,670
Is it good?

539
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:44,368
How come I can't reach you?

540
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:45,900
I'm worried. Call me.

541
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,279
Here, try it.

542
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,839
Do you like it?

543
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:54,179
Yummy.

544
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:00,750
(Seo Jun: I miss you.)

545
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,389
I'll call you when my husband falls asleep.

546
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,460
- Mom! - Oh, no!

547
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:12,330
Is she okay?

548
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,270
It's not hot.

549
00:42:15,529 --> 00:42:18,039
Her skin is so delicate.

550
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,699
Yes, baby.

551
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:35,719
(Seo Jun: Okay, text me before calling. Love you.)

552
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:44,029
It's okay, baby.

553
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,269
Yes, it's okay.

554
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,169
Yes, you're okay now.

555
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,339
- It's okay. - Honey.

556
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,110
- Yes? - Mom!

557
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:58,880
Yes, my baby.

558
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,678
Mom!

559
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:03,309
- Mom! - Shall I warm up her food again?

560
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,920
Yes, just put it in the microwave for a minute.

561
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:06,819
Yes. It's okay, baby.

562
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:11,759
Mom!

563
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:15,060
Mom!

564
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:18,730
Mom!

565
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,199
Mom!

566
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:25,739
Mom!

567
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:34,909
Give me another mug.

568
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,449
No, since I'm full, give me soju.

569
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,988
Hey, don't drink both. You'll get a headache.

570
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:43,049
Stop drinking.

571
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:44,860
I'm here as a customer.

572
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,029
I said stop drinking. Gosh.

573
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,130
Is this the only pub? I can just go somewhere else.

574
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,329
Hey, get it together.

575
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:55,429
Let go.

576
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,369
What's wrong with you?

577
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,469
Hey.

578
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,540
Does not getting asked on a second date make you this distressed?

579
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,738
You only met him for three hours.

580
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:06,540
Why are you acting like you've seen him for three years?

581
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,679
I...

582
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,949
I really liked him.

583
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,589
You don't know anything.

584
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:21,629
I didn't know you were so easily lovestruck.

585
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,889
When we were dating,

586
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,259
didn't it take us about 2 to 3 months to kiss?

587
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,029
Be quiet. Someone will hear.

588
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:37,839
- Happy now? - Gosh.

589
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:40,380
I can't stay still with this song.

590
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,649
- Hey, what's wrong with you? - Listen up, people.

591
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,379
Please pay attention to me.

592
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,290
Do you all know the dance move trending in Paris?

593
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:49,819
I'm scared, gosh.

594
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,819
- What? - Hey.

595
00:44:52,759 --> 00:44:54,690
I'm sorry. She's pretty drunk.

596
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:55,860
Don't mind her.

597
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,529
Come on!

598
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,860
Hey! Come on!

599
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,929
You know this, right?

600
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:04,540
Nice!

601
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:35,100
Cool.

602
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,969
Hold on.

603
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:41,969
This is great!

604
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:59,960
Yes, it's me. Please stop staring at me.

605
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,330
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

606
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:16,869
I know I should respect your privacy in situations like this.

607
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,080
But I am approaching you as a man, not a fan.

608
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,449
May I buy you another glass of the same drink?

609
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:26,350
Why do men keep approaching me? How annoying.

610
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,389
Don't misunderstand.

611
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,020
I said that as a woman, not a singer.

612
00:46:35,529 --> 00:46:38,830
It is only natural that a lot of men approach you. You're so beautiful.

613
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:45,639
Then why is there a man who doesn't like me?

614
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,380
How am I supposed to win him over?

615
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,980
Who in the world is he?

616
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:54,449
He's the opposite of you.

617
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,219
He doesn't like me as a woman,

618
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:01,250
but he likes me as a singer.

619
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,619
Then should I sing to him?

620
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,839
I'm sitting and looking out the window

621
00:47:22,369 --> 00:47:27,080
Thinking of you all day

622
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,618
All scenes feel like a movie

623
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:38,589
And I love you so

624
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:47,069
The season has come when we were together

625
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:53,400
There are leaves on the street

626
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:56,569
Hello.

627
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:58,710
One moment, everyone.

628
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,658
Sometimes, I wish we may one day

629
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:17,730
Isn't she Syaon?

630
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:23,270
And I will give you so many tales

631
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:29,440
- With I, still in me - Syaon!

632
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:33,079
Well I can remember

633
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,650
You always

634
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:52,460
I like you

635
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,099
My heart

636
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:02,639
As it's always been

637
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:08,509
Love you forever

638
00:49:13,279 --> 00:49:14,690
Thank you.

639
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:17,259
Thank you.

640
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,299
Kang Min, I'm getting sleepy, so I'm going to listen to something.

641
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,500
Go ahead.

642
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:39,710
In June 2018, at the start of summer,

643
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,750
Choi Eom Ji, who was only 24 years old,

644
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,080
disappeared at Hakcheon Beach.

645
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,718
She only left...

646
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:48,349
- Kang Min. - her bloody sandals behind.

647
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,219
Have you seen the culprit of this case in real life?

648
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:52,920
I heard he was handsome and from a prestigious university,

649
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:55,489
so he even had a fan club when he was a murderer.

650
00:49:55,989 --> 00:49:57,860
Not a murderer, a suspect.

651
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:00,730
You're a cop.

652
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:02,900
How could you watch someone expose another person?

653
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,270
Come on. Everyone knows he's the culprit.

654
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,170
He was with her until her last moment, and they had a big fight.

655
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:11,679
On top of that, her blood was found on his clothes.

656
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:15,980
It was supposed to end if they had only found her corpse.

657
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,079
Her brother still seemed to be...

658
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,790
looking for that suspect.

659
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:24,759
He probably wants to kill him so bad.

660
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,020
Here it is.

661
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,230
He is pretty handsome.

662
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:32,330
Kang Min, look. Isn't he handsome?

663
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:38,540
Are you that shocked?

664
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,569
Are you sure it's him?

665
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:42,270
Pardon?

666
00:50:42,271 --> 00:50:44,110
Are you sure he's the suspect of that case?

667
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,009
Yes.

668
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:49,279
(Graduation photo of Hakcheon Beach Murderer)

669
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,460
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

670
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:02,230
What's wrong?

671
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:05,130
(Sol Hee, the guy who lives next door)

672
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:11,739
That's nothing.

673
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,569
(Sol Hee, the guy who lives next door...)

674
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:21,549
Please get back to me once you see this text.

675
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:36,830
Have a good night.

676
00:51:37,799 --> 00:51:38,860
You too.

677
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:20,069
Oh, my gosh!

678
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:33,020
Eom Ho came to see me.

679
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,219
He asked if Kim Seung Ju was Kim Do Ha.

680
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,939
(Missed Calls)

681
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:57,778
(Deuk Chan, Mother)

682
00:52:57,779 --> 00:52:59,009
(Why aren't you picking up? I'm worried. Please call.)

683
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:18,029
(Live)

684
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,560
Gosh, was she dumped?

685
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,400
Darn it. That's not good.

686
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:32,310
What?

687
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,150
You...

688
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:35,549
I heard the reporters...

689
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:38,920
stopped wandering around Kim Do Ha's house a while ago.

690
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,219
You went there?

691
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,989
Where is Kim Do Ha right now?

692
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:50,698
Come on. How am I supposed to know that?

693
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:52,229
If I knew, I would be there.

694
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,528
Also, why are you talking so casually?

695
00:53:55,529 --> 00:53:56,569
Answer me.

696
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:01,810
Gosh.

697
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,239
What... What do you want?

698
00:54:07,509 --> 00:54:10,880
What do you mean? It's our second time seeing each other.

699
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,549
You can talk casually if you have a problem with it. Okay?

700
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:19,860
I just remembered.

701
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:21,789
Syaon. You know Syaon, right?

702
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:24,900
Syaon is singing at Gangnam Palace Hotel right now.

703
00:54:25,259 --> 00:54:26,959
If you follow Syaon,

704
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,230
you will probably be able to meet Kim Do Ha.

705
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:31,639
Sir.

706
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:40,008
Can I confess to you my shallow fears?

707
00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:44,479
To someone who made me find the true shine

708
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,419
Can I confess to you my shallow fears?

709
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,529
To someone who can only stop me fall

710
00:54:56,989 --> 00:54:58,230
Thank you.

711
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:00,230
Syaon, let's go.

712
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,928
What? I was going to sing one more song.

713
00:55:02,929 --> 00:55:04,869
What are you getting yourself into?

714
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,810
- Let's go. - Thank you, everyone.

715
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:09,339
Bye.

716
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,380
- Come back! - Syaon!

717
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,130
Come on.

718
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:44,279
It's okay. Go home.

719
00:56:20,139 --> 00:56:22,380
(Cleaning in Progress)

720
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:25,619
Where is Kim Do Ha?

721
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:29,389
I don't know.

722
00:56:29,949 --> 00:56:31,190
Please don't kill me.

723
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,420
If you don't know,

724
00:56:36,989 --> 00:56:38,429
call him and tell him to come here.

725
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:45,900
You're that person, right?

726
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,839
The person who tried to kill Do Ha.

727
00:56:49,969 --> 00:56:51,310
Do you want to die in his place?

728
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:52,909
Call him.

729
00:56:58,350 --> 00:56:59,380
Sure.

730
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,819
I wanted to die today anyway.

731
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,619
Do whatever you want.

732
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,790
I'm glad I have something I can do for Do Ha.

733
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:09,489
Kill me.

734
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:12,299
- Kill me! - Are you insane?

735
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,080
(Syaon)

736
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,429
(Syaon)

737
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:57,409
Do Ha, hang up this instant. Do Ha!

738
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,080
Seung Ju...

739
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,549
I mean, Kim Do Ha.

740
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:05,279
It's been a while.

741
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,219
Don't hurt her. Just talk to me.

742
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,319
Where are you?

743
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,580
What a pleasure.

744
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,429
It's so great to see you.

745
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,100
Yes,

746
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:56,799
it's been a while.

747
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,639
That's right.

748
00:59:00,699 --> 00:59:02,869
You had the same expression on your face back then too.

749
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:05,610
As if nothing had happened.

750
00:59:09,509 --> 00:59:11,549
Do you know the two things I regret the most?

751
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,119
Telling Eom Ji to have fun...

752
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,520
when she told me she was meeting you.

753
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:20,790
Letting you go...

754
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:23,790
on that bus...

755
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:26,929
after you killed Eom Ji.

756
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:30,500
- Eom Ho... - That day,

757
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:32,298
even after seeing Eom Ji's text that she would kill herself,

758
00:59:32,299 --> 00:59:34,509
you said you would go to Seoul like it was nothing.

759
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,069
Even now...

760
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,440
You have that same expression on your face right now!

761
00:59:43,409 --> 00:59:45,650
How are you still in one piece? Tell me.

762
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:53,589
I am going to cut you up into pieces...

763
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:56,630
and throw your body parts onto the street one by one.

764
00:59:57,759 --> 00:59:58,929
Just like me,

765
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:02,230
I am going to make your mom look for you for the rest of her life!

766
01:00:17,449 --> 01:00:18,679
Please get back to me once you see this text.

767
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,230
Tell me.

768
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:37,029
What did you do with Eom Ji?

769
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:40,969
Did you kill her painfully?

770
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,540
Was she in a lot of pain?

771
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,809
Where is Eom Ji?

772
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,449
Tell me, please!

773
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:53,380
Do Ha.

774
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:57,420
Seung Ju, you didn't kill her.

775
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:05,299
Eom Ho.

776
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,469
I didn't harm Eom Ji.

777
01:01:10,029 --> 01:01:12,199
There are a lot of things I did to her that I should apologize for.

778
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:15,969
But I didn't kill her.

779
01:01:18,339 --> 01:01:19,679
I didn't kill her.

780
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,420
Are you saying she killed herself again?

781
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:27,919
I'm sick of hearing that.

782
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,250
Why would she kill herself?

783
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,920
Because I was her dream.

784
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,230
Why do you need a dream?

785
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,159
Your dream should be Seung Ju.

786
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,630
But I told her we should break up.

787
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,239
When she told me she would die without me,

788
01:01:47,799 --> 01:01:49,440
I thought she was just saying that.

789
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,210
I didn't know she would really kill herself.

790
01:01:55,509 --> 01:01:56,509
That's right.

791
01:01:57,949 --> 01:01:59,679
Eom Ji only had you.

792
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:02,249
She only had you. Why did you do that to her?

793
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,250
No! She had you too.

794
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:07,960
Why didn't you help her?

795
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:10,460
Why didn't you hold onto her?

796
01:02:21,069 --> 01:02:22,469
I know it's my fault.

797
01:02:24,779 --> 01:02:25,839
I'll live...

798
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:30,650
the rest of my life in guilt.

799
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,989
I'll do at least that.

800
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,589
(My Lovely Liar)

801
01:04:10,779 --> 01:04:13,279
I thought it would be better to meet him in person once.

802
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,519
- Go! - What are you doing?

803
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,789
I know I'm being nosy,

804
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:18,589
but I'm so worried. You're continuously on my mind.

805
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:21,928
You guys are dating, aren't you?

806
01:04:21,929 --> 01:04:25,259
Well, I don't think he ever asked me to be his girlfriend.

807
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,670
Do you think Sol Hee won't be affected if you stay here?

808
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:31,799
What does she do?

809
01:04:32,739 --> 01:04:33,839
Did she really kill herself?

810
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:37,009
I should stay by her side and protect her.
