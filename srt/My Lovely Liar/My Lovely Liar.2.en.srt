(The guardians of child actors were present at the filming.)

10
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:51,520
A black hoodie and a black mask.

11
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,648
It's him.

12
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:53,920
It's not me.

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,590
Take off his mask.

14
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,389
You're right.

15
00:00:58,529 --> 00:00:59,859
Let's take a look at his face.

16
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:02,029
No, don't.

17
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,829
It's not him.

18
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:09,000
He's not the culprit.

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,869
- What? - How are you so confident?

20
00:01:13,169 --> 00:01:14,610
If I say so, then it is.

21
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:28,160
If I say so, then it is.

22
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:34,300
This is what I do.

23
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:40,830
Suit yourself.

24
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,880
If I say so, then it is.

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,259
Did you do a tarot card reading or something?

26
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:43,630
Let's catch the real culprit instead of wasting time here.

27
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:47,329
Right. Give us a good reason this guy isn't the real culprit.

28
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,910
Gosh. She startled me.

29
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,239
It's not him.

30
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:00,909
I accidentally sprayed my perfume on him instead of the pepper spray.

31
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,750
I don't smell any of my perfume from him.

32
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,818
Hold on. I'm an expert on perfume.

33
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,949
- Which perfume do you use? - It smells like incense.

34
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,889
Incense... Women with a lot of stories...

35
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:14,859
usually go for this scent.

36
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,030
- Sir, can you hold on to him? - Okay.

37
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:20,229
We can try to follow the scent and look for the culprit.

38
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:22,939
- Hold on. - Wait.

39
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,238
Sir, it's not him. You don't have to hold him.

40
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,310
- What? - Gosh, he's not the culprit.

41
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,250
Gosh, come on.

42
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,359
- Hold on. - This is weird.

43
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,430
I smell it from him.

44
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,530
Wait.

45
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,829
It's a reversible hoodie.

46
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:51,829
- He wore it the other way around! - Gosh.

47
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,699
And a black mask!

48
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,340
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

49
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,009
- You... - You jerk.

50
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:07,049
Get him.

51
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,318
Hey, let's take him to the police station.

52
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,619
- Gosh. - We found him right away.

53
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,350
It's all sorted out. You can go now.

54
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,289
- Right! - Seriously.

55
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,220
Gosh. How could it be him?

56
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,319
Why...

57
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,289
Why did you help me?

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,970
Do you...

59
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:28,270
know me?

60
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,780
I didn't help you.

61
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:38,379
I just told them you weren't the culprit because you weren't.

62
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,919
And...

63
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,390
I first have to see your face if I want to recognize who you are.

(Episode 2)

65
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,689
Does she really not remember me?

66
00:05:57,619 --> 00:05:59,629
He didn't lie for sure.

67
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,830
He wasn't the culprit, but something was off about him.

68
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:06,499
The guy was surrounded by the people.

69
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,599
But when they tried to take off his mask,

70
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,369
he made a fuss and told them not to do it.

71
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:17,039
So I went up there and told them that he wasn't the culprit.

72
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,210
But...

73
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:22,850
what's so awful about showing his face?

74
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:26,049
He must have some kind of scar, right?

77

What?

78
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:03,419
No. Don't.

79
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:08,830
Gosh, this is scary. What is this?

80
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:58,179
Gosh.

81
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,229
That unit has been vacant.

82
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,359
Whatever.

83
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,649
One, two.

84
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,449
- Let's go. One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four.

85
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,190
- One, two, three, four. - Go.

86
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,920
Two, three, four.

87
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:22,619
Three, four.

88
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,290
Two, three.

89

- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

90

- One, two. - One, two.

91
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:15,609
Okay.

92
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,609
Mother.

93
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,350
You didn't tell me that I was going to hike today.

94
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,359
Right. I didn't see this coming either.

95
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,920
I'm sorry about this.

96
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,388
Gosh. A mother-in-law is speaking so politely to her daughter-in-law.

97

It's so great to see you getting along well.

98

By the way, can't we just talk here?

99
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,699
No way. A picture is worth a thousand words.

100
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,868
For land like this,

101
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:47,268
you ought to look at it first and then sign the contract.

102
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,940
Otherwise, you could get conned.

103
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:53,810
Wait.

104
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,279
Oh, my gosh!

105
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,619
That's a deer.

106
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,719
How adorable!

107
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Can you eat stuff like this?

108
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,090
Do you want one?

109
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,228
But I don't think that's a deer. Isn't that an elk?

110
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:15,239
Try it.

111
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,040
Wait. Does this land fall under the green belt?

112
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,340
What?

113
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,778
Gosh, what do you mean?

114
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,040
That's nonsense.

115
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:25,608
Do you see the smoke over there?

116
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,209
They're doing some construction down there.

117
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,479
They're getting ready to open up a new GTX line.

118
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,988
Goodness.

119
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:35,090
Gosh, that scared me.

120
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,929
This information hasn't been released officially yet.

121
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,228
Not a lot of people know about this.

122
00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:43,129
Anyone with good Intel already bought land here.

123
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,969
If you don't decide quickly,

124
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,170
it will all get sold.

125
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:53,769
I'm getting a call now. Look.

126
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,509
Yes. Hello, sir?

127
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,779
I'm at the site right now.

128
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,220
Yes. I got it.

129
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,090
My joints hurt. Let's go down.

130
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,489
Let's go.

131
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,148
Yes.

132
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:10,690
I'll call you later. Okay.

133
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,330
Hold on, ladies.

134
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,429
Gosh. Good grief!

135
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,830
Hey, go away!

136
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:18,999
Get away from me!

137
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
I feel awful that you had to get your shoes dirty.

138
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,350
I put in a bit more money than your fee.

139
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,019
Thank you.

140
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,619
You didn't have to do that.

141
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,519
Thank you.

142
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:49,729
Bye.

143
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,920

(This month's settlement amount: 12,780.5 dollars)

145
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,209
Some patients can't properly get primary medical care...

146
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,549
in small rural cities.

147
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,820
So they are forced to come to major cities.

148
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,389
And that's awful.

149
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,149
I agree.

150
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,560
Training more doctors isn't important.

151
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,460
Increasing the number of public healthcare providers...

152
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,460
takes priority.

153
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,460
Gosh, you're right.

154
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,409
- Gosh. Come on. - Who is this?

155
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,310
- Why don't you guess? - Darn it.

156
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,850
Are you her daughter?

157
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,180
What? Does she look like my daughter?

158
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:16,050
Not my younger sister or a niece?

159
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,350
Well, she does look like she could be your younger sister.

160
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,758
Mister, come to your senses.

161
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,920
She's not a doctor.

162
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:26,228
Yes, I'm a doctor.

163
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:27,829
She likes to make silly jokes.

164
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,060
I'm not joking.

165
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,768
Unless you want to lose all of your money to her,

166
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:33,128
you should pay for this meal and walk away now.

167
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:34,200
Hey.

168
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,638
Actually, I have an appointment with my patient at 3pm.

169
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,239
I had to leave anyway.

170
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:43,379
Gosh.

171
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,478
Yes, this looks tasty.

172
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,049
Since I helped you big time,

173
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,749
can you order one more of that before you go?

174
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,189
Professor Kim, it's not what you think. I...

175
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,449

00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,259
Forget it. He lied and ditched you.

178
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,430
I can't pay this. Give back my card.

179
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:02,629
What?

180
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,430
You told me to use it for my living expenses.

181
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:08,299
How could you spend this much money in a month?

182
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,840
You must think we're filthy rich.

183
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,408
Besides, you promised that you wouldn't do this nonsense.

184
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:13,970
That's why I gave my card to you.

185
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,739
I won't believe anything you say on the phone.

186
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:16,979
This nonsense?

187
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,978
Hey, do you know how taxing this job is?

188
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,819
I have to educate myself with professional knowledge.

189
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,618
And I have to study a lot about acting too.

190
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:26,618
Besides, I have to be detailed and prepare props like this.

191
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,518
I have to make great efforts to pull this off. Did you know that?

192
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,789
Exactly. You can stop making an effort to con people.

193
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,859
I even went to prison for you!

194
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,739
You can't do this to me.

195
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,180
If you keep doing this, I'll never see you again.

196
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,050
You won't see me again?

197
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:55,748
Because you can't hear your own lies,

198
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:56,979
you're lying through your teeth.

199
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
What...

200
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,060
Here's the additional dish that was ordered.

201
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,320
(From Dad)

202
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,070
Gosh.

203
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,709
He should have taken a selfie and sent it to me instead.

204
00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:00,310
What? You went there yesterday?

205
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,249
Hey, you should have told me sooner.

206
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,919
I would have cleaned and furnished the house too.

207
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,520
No. I'll send everything tomorrow.

208
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:11,520
Who are you talking to right now?

209
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,689
You startled me.

210
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,599
I know that we're close, but you should still knock.

211
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Isn't this Do Ha?

212
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,668
Do Ha.

213
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:19,770
He hung up.

214
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:24,139
What? He won't even answer my calls.

215
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,609
Hey, Ji On.

216
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,280
I went to a young CEOs' gathering a while ago.

217
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,209
Everyone went on and on about how much they all liked you.

218
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,719
It was difficult to turn them down when they asked me to introduce you.

219
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:38,989
So what?

220
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,990
Are you telling me...

221
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:41,959
I should meet these boring men who only have money to show off?

222
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:45,490
I'm telling you to meet men who like you.

223
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,300
Deuk Chan, Do Ha likes me more.

224
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,139
He just hasn't realized it yet.

225
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,168
You have no idea.

226
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:01,740
Hey, what kind of an idiot doesn't know how he feels?

227
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,109
No. Listen.

228
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,340
Hello.

229
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:12,250
I really enjoyed tonight's show.

230
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:13,879
I see. Thanks.

231
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,050
Wait. Men who are good at playing the piano are my type.

232
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:22,060
Can you take off your sunglasses just this once?

233
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,959
I don't have personal conversations with customers.

234
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:27,429
Have a good evening then.

235
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,658
Why not?

236
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:30,959
Can't you just show me your face? I bet you're handsome.

237
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,300
Here you go. I got them back for you.

238
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:12,669
These are from a luxury brand. You should take them back.

239
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,969
Thank you.

240
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,310
Gosh. She's been coming here often.

241
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,050
I thought that the young lady had a good taste in music.

242
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,090
But she had been coming here to get your number.

243
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:30,089
Come on, I told you that.

244
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,819
- I said no. - Let's go.

245
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,989
- Soju? - Of course.

246
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,158
- Are you buying drinks tonight? - Of course. You bet.

247
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,059
Hey, are you sure we're going for another round?

248
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,159
Don't go home now.

249
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:40,500
Kim.

250
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yes.

251
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,240
The first time I performed on stage,

252
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,708
I was so nervous that my hand that was holding the stick...

253
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,109
was shaking like crazy.

254
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,980
Then my friend who was standing next to me said this.

255
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,149
"Just think that everyone in the audience is a zombie."

256
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:01,020
"Then you'll feel better."

257
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,189
Did it help?

258
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,619
No, not really.

259
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,889
Well, I guess it made me a little less nervous.

260
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:08,459
But it was scary.

261
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,469
I thought it might help you though.

262
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:18,439
Just think that all those people are zombies.

263
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,439
Then I should run away.

264
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:22,439
My goodness.

265
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,780
Zombies scare you, and you're so afraid of people.

266
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,709
Why do you keep coming here? It's not like you get paid.

267
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,590
I feel at ease on stage. That's why.

268
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,760
And it's fun.

269
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:37,519
What?

270
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,629
I thought you'd say it was because of me.

271
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:46,600
Hey, so it's not because of me?

272
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,740
Yes, it is.

273
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:52,469
Now, you say that?

274
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:54,609
Do I not scare you?

275
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:56,209
Am I not human?

276
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,409
Then shall I just be a zombie?

277
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,419
My goodness.

278
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:31,539
There are four defenders.

279
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,049
Dalot, Varane, and Lisandro Martinez.

280
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,280
- These three will go together. - I see.

281
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,350
Nice lineup.

282
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,549
- Here's Christian Eriksen. Shoot! - Shoot!

283
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,149
- Gosh, it was blocked. - No!

284
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:45,219
That was so close!

285
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,290
What's going on?

286
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,169
It's quite close.

287
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,530
I think it's doable.

288
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,780
Right, the game today.

289
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:13,090
They're getting ready for a running jump.

290
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:20,159
A corner kick. It's going high, to the other side.

291
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:56,760
You're that...

292
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:03,369
Thank you for last night.

293
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:06,070
When did you move here?

294
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,240
I didn't see you move in.

295
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,909
Last night.

296
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:13,810
You moved here at night?

297
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:19,050
That's right. I had to move in a rush, empty-handed.

298
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:21,350
Who moves at night?

299
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,590
Darn it. Why isn't this working?

300
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,939
My stuff will arrive tomorrow.

301
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:59,329
Hold on. Does he wear a mask even when he's at home?

302
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,529
He must seize this opportunity.

303
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,560
- Yes. - Yes.

304
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,539
He had a good opportunity in the last season,

305
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,968
- but because of the injury, - What's this?

306
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,570
he was left out of the roster, which was a painful memory for him.

307
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:18,509
I'd say he could even be a winger.

308
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,408
That's right. Liverpool FC's current midfield lineup...

309
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:22,820
isn't looking so ideal.

310
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,179
The current manager, Klopp...

311
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,020
By any chance,

312
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,629
you didn't eat mine, did you?

313
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,060
No, I didn't even touch it.

314
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,270
All right, then.

315
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:41,869
Wait, hold on.

316
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,639
You can have this.

317
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,540
I think they forgot to send your cheese balls.

318
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,740
It's not here?

319
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,250
Gosh, they made a mistake.

320
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:59,350
It's okay. You can have it. It's yours.

321
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:00,719
Just take it.

322
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:02,560
You helped me.

323
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:09,060
All right, then.

324
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
Thank you.

325
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:17,199
What?

326
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:19,840
He's a Liverpool fan?

327
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,209
The ball is going inwards.

328
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:29,519
It goes high up and...

329
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,250
- Liverpool gets a chance and... - They have it this time.

330
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,020
I should've asked him why he always wears a mask.

331
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,289
It's quite far.

332
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,388
Because of the formation,

333
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:42,800
the goalkeeper has to move like a sweeper-keeper.

334
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:44,500
Did he put poison in this because I'm a Manchester United fan?

335
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,938
Naturally, what Erik ten Hag has been emphasizing the most...

336
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:56,040
since the last game is keeping the fighting spirit.

337
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,379
- Shoot! - But it doesn't go far.

338
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:04,249
- The chance has come. - Are they going to make it?

339
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,888
A cross. Go for it!

340
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:07,590
- Waiting for the right moment. - Cross!

341
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,158
The left side has opened up.

342
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,489
- The ball goes past. - As long as she didn't see my face.

343
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,299
- Shoot! - That's it. Goal!

344
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,799
Yes! My gosh!

345
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,968
- It's a goal! - Gosh, that's...

346
00:28:20,969 --> 00:28:23,869
- That was Bailly. - Nice!

347
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
This is great.

348
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,638
- He's cutting in between them! - Oh, no!

349
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:33,510
- That's a foul. - Yes! Give him a yellow card.

350
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,549
- Why did he... - Nice! Yes!

351
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,419
- Here he comes! - That's a foul.

352
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,619
- No! - That's Fabinho.

353
00:28:41,949 --> 00:28:42,990
Nicely done.

354
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,129
Shoot!

355
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,499
- No! - Shoot!

356
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,600
- Yes! - Shoot!

357
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,100
It's in!

358
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,709
- Nicely done! - Yes! Well done!

359
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,878
- Oh, my. That was good. - Shoot!

360
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:06,250
- Shoot! Goal! - Goal!

361
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:08,709
- Oh, my. - Mohamed Salah!

362
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,118

Hey, who's helping you?

724
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,079
How many people are on your team?

725
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,219
I work alone.

726
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,618
I know you have songs that you copied little by little.

727
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:56,549
Tell me all the songs you stole from.

728
00:55:58,159 --> 00:55:59,989
You're talking as if plagiarism is a natural thing.

729
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,860
Moo Jin, do you plagiarize?

730
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:07,769
Hey, do you think I would? Of course not.

731
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:10,230
I'm asking you right now.

732
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:11,869
I don't.

733
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,069
My goodness. You're making me livid.

734
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:24,009
You seem pretty drunk. Why don't we call it a night?

735
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:25,920
Sit down!

736
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:29,389
Hey.

737
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,460
I paid good money for this meeting to happen.

738
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,460
I should get at least one thing out of this.

739
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:40,130
I see. Well, I was planning on paying the bill.

740
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,469
Gosh. I don't need this anymore!

741
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:49,770
Okay.

742
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,710
Then just drink another Coke before you go.

743
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,549
That's okay, right?

744
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:57,980
Here. I'll open it for you.

745
00:57:07,389 --> 00:57:09,589
Here. Have a refreshing sip.

746
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:14,428
Goodness. What do I do? It got all over you.

747
00:57:14,429 --> 00:57:15,629
Here. Give me your sunglasses.

748
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,698
- I'll wipe them for you. Here. - It's okay.

749
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:19,368
It got all over your handsome face.

750
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:21,110
Here. Give it to me. What?

751
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,380
No. I didn't press the button.

752
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,380
That's strange.

753
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,549
What's wrong with this?

754
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,190
I'll get going then.

755
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,218
Hey!

756
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:40,219
Darn it. Gosh. Seriously.

757
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,060
Kim Do Ha, where are you going? Come over here.

758
00:57:44,259 --> 00:57:45,929
Hey, you punk. Get back over here.

759
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,989
Yes, sir.

760
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:16,658
(Cheongdam)

761
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,860
I'm at Japanese Cheongdam.

762
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,299
And my destination is Hannam Palace.

763
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,100
Yes. Thank you.

764
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:25,339
"Hannam Palace?"

765
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:28,540
That's where Kim Do Ha lives.

766
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,239
That's not his car though.

767
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,279
What is this?

768
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,319
"The spirit of truth?"

769
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:40,818
The spirit of truth, my foot.

770
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:45,089
This is a fake, good-for-nothing spirit.

771
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:48,988
Hey, you're a swindler, aren't you?

772
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:50,029
You should stop...

773
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,629
if you don't want me to spread rumours...

774
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:53,699
that you're a songwriter who plagiarizes.

775
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:55,199
What?

776
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,469
I'll summarize everything from today and send you an email.

777
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,110
Your payment is due tomorrow.

778
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:06,110
What? Are you done?

779
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,190
Darn it. Why did I do that earlier?

780
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:21,889
I could've gotten into big trouble.

781
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:29,170
Right. Hey, Syaon and Kim Do Ha aren't dating.

782
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:30,528
- Really? - Yes.

783
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:32,739
But how do you know that?

784
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:39,580
Did you meet Kim Do Ha?

785
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:45,850
And my destination is Hannam Palace.

786
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,540
What are you doing right now?

787
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,249
I can't believe you.

788
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,048
How could you keep it a secret...

789
01:00:17,049 --> 01:00:18,719
that you're meeting Kim Do Ha?

790
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,219
You know I sign confidentiality agreements.

791
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:23,618
And look at you right now. How was I supposed to tell you...

792
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:25,690
when I knew you would act like this?

793
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:27,690
So did you see his face?

794
01:00:27,929 --> 01:00:29,630
I swear I didn't.

795
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:32,330
He probably has eyes, a nose, and lips.

796
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,699
Hey, stop.

797
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:44,170
I'm just going to take a slight look at his face.

798
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,250
How dare you try to lie!

799
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:49,710
Stop the car!

800
01:01:02,389 --> 01:01:05,500
I kept you next to me because I liked how honest you were.

801
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,360
If you keep this up, I can't continue working with you.

802
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,339
The thing is, I suddenly lost it.

803
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,600
I'm sorry.

804
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,069
Move.

805
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:55,350
Aren't you the man next door?

806
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,310
What are you doing here?

807
01:01:57,449 --> 01:02:00,619
Sir, it's not Hannam Palace.

808
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:04,489
It's 135 Yeonseo-dong.

809
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,869
This is 135 Yeonseo-dong.

810
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,699
Gosh. I should just take this.

811
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:40,389
I'm a Liverpool fan,

812
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:43,659
and my favourite player is Milner.

813
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:46,500
I heard Kim Do Ha has this car too.

814
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:53,469
Could it be?

815
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,469
Kim Do Ha?

816
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,869
Gosh. Don't be like this. How shameful.

817
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:42,980
(My Lovely Liar)

818
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:08,439
She saw my face.

819
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,069
Why did he have to make a fuss over that?

820
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:13,138
But what was he like?

821
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:14,849
I'm not sure if he just always tells the truth...

822
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:16,809
or if the spirit's powers don't work on him.

823
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:19,278
- What? - It's a sign from the spirit...

824
01:05:19,279 --> 01:05:21,520
to tell you that you're destined to be together.

825
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:24,920
I'm Senior Officer Lee Kang Min from Hakcheon Station.

826
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,460
Then are you happy because you know everything?

827
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:28,789
Since my love life is doomed,

828
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:30,289
I want everyone else's life to be doomed as well.

829
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:31,290
Do you have a problem with that?

830
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:33,729
How dare you interfere and mess everything up!

831
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:34,730
That's enough.
