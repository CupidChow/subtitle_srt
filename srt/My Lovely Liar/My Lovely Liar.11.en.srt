1
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:13,080
(Kim So Hyun)

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,949
(Hwang Min Hyun)

3
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,389
(Yun Ji On)

4
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,170
(Seo Ji Hun)

5
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,270
(Lee Si Woo)

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,979
(My Lovely Liar)

7
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,980
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

8
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:45,049
(in this drama are fictitious.)

9
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,050
(The guardians of child actors were present at the filming.)

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,249
Why did they want us to take care of this in the middle of the night?

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,089
A gifted fortune-teller told us...

12
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,218
we would get into big trouble if we dug it up during the day.

13
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:55,788
Let's pay our respects and begin.

14
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,359
- Gosh. - All right.

15
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:59,690
We are trying to move you to someplace nice.

16
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,999
Please don't move or get startled.

17
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:12,809
What's down here?

18
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:16,240
Goodness!

19
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,080
- What's going on? - Goodness.

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,080
- Gosh. - Hey, is that a bone?

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,720
Could it have come out when the body was buried?

22
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:26,250
Even if it had, the body should have been buried deeper than this.

23
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,690
- Hey, step aside. - Gosh.

24
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,300
- Oh, my. - Goodness.

25
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:05,759
What's wrong?

26
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:09,360
Human bones? Where?

27
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,198
They found the bones from the grave.

28
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,669
Maybe, the bones belong to the deceased.

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,500
Okay. I'll go and check it out.

30
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,539
Okay. Text me the address.

31
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,810
Let me drive you. Where is it?

32
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,150
You know the hill behind Hakcheon Beach?

33
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,609
I'll pay for this.

34
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,120
Ring up the bill for me.

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,750
Okay.

36
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,919
- We called just in case. - Right. Listen to me.

37
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,690
Hello, sir.

38
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:38,229
Hey, you're here too.

39
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:41,600
Are you sure the bones don't belong to the body that was buried?

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,499
Some bodies are buried without coffins.

41
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,030
Even if the body was buried without a coffin,

42
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,470
it was supposed to be buried much deeper than this.

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,199
We kept digging just in case we were wrong.

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,669
The coffin is here.

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,609
- Come here for a second. - Okay.

46
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,650
- You too. Come here. - Okay.

47
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,650
So listen.

48
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:40,049
Sir.

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Hey.

50
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:43,519
What is it?

51
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,358
Do you think this could be...

52
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,199
the skeleton of the missing girl, Choi Eom Ji?

53
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,568
Where did you get that idea? That was random.

54
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,430
Brutal crimes like this rarely took place in this village.

55
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,139
That's the only case that comes to my mind.

56
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,199
And the beach is around here too.

57
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,039
Did you find any items when you were digging?

58
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:03,840
Like clothes or personal belongings.

59
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,310
No. We didn't find anything like that.

60
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,750
Why did you come all the way here? Why are you questioning them?

61
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,419
- I... - This is my case.

62
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:13,850
You can leave now.

63
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,359
- Hong Sik. - Yes.

64
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,129
Did you call the forensic team?

65
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,030
Yes. I did give them a call.

66
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,030
- Gosh. - Goodness.

67
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,429
Be careful.

68
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,309
All of us worked hard today.

69
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:34,509
Do you want to have an after work get-together?

70
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,010
An after work get-together?

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,479
It sounds good.

72
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:42,249
But I'm a bit tired today.

73
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,619
Let's take a rain check.

74
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,989
Same here. I'm kind of beat today.

75
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,389
And I have to watch a movie tomorrow too.

76
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,959
Syaon sang the soundtrack for the movie.

77
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,400
I need to watch it ten times.

78
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,470
Sure. Well, I only asked out of formality too.

79
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,840
Some people are having a wrap party at Boor Boor.

80
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,869
Do you want to go with me?

81
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:09,478
- Cheers. - Great.

82
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:10,510
All right.

83
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,719
This hits the spot.

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,950
What a surprise to see you here. You came voluntarily too.

85
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:19,118
I guess he must be in a good mood. He won the cash prize.

86
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,019
By the way, I was really impressed earlier.

87
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,159
What will you do with the cash prize?

88
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,789
I'm going to buy an audio interface.

89
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,559
An expensive one at that too.

90
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,428
- The audio what? - What?

91
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:30,830
By the way, shouldn't you split the money, 6 to 4?

92
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,700
The pianist contributed a lot to the performance.

93
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,429
No, it's fine.

94
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:36,369
I made a lot of mistakes because I joined at the last minute.

95
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,239
You wrote a great song.

96
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:44,979
By the way, what's going on between you two?

97
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:46,809
What?

98
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,549
She's my girlfriend.

99
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,090
Why did you tell them here?

100
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:58,289
They must be surprised.

101
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,059
We weren't surprised. We all knew that you were an item.

102
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,498
I think they've been dating for over 100 days.

103
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:05,629
You guys make a cute couple. You look good together.

104
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,039
By the way, what do you think is going on between us two?

105
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:13,340
We fell for each other at first sight.

106
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,808
What's wrong with me?

107
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:22,150
- Calm down. - So cute.

108
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,350
I'll be honest. I fell for you the moment I laid my eyes on you.

109
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,329
Gosh, you should have asked me out on a follow-up date.

110
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,259
I thought you were dating someone else.

111
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,629
I'm not dating anyone else.

112
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,770
I told you that I wanted to be careful.

113
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Hey, I guess I can't hold my liquor anymore.

114
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:44,639
I already feel like puking.

115
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,910
- Do you have pickles? - It's not a great sight to see.

116
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:56,479
Let's go over to my place

117
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,820
Yes

118
00:06:57,821 --> 00:07:00,919
But we shouldn't tell anyone about this

119
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,789
Will you really go over to his place?

120
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
What?

121
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,830
I was wondering if you were really going over to his house tonight.

122
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,729
Well, I'll see how it goes.

123
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,539
I think you should take more time to get to know him.

124
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,939
You should check if he's trustworthy.

125
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:20,710
Why?

126
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,510
If I say so, then you should just...

127
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,210
Anyway, I warned you.

128
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,679
It's up to you to decide.

129
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,950
What was that?

130
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,520
Is she really a shaman?

131
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,289
Have some of this.

132
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,070
Well, can you sit somewhere else?

133
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:49,700
By the way, are you really...

134
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,640
Kim Do Ha, the songwriter?

135
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,609
Pardon?

136
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,809
Can you...

137
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,549
I would like you to be my master!

138
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,320
Hey, are you drunk? Why would he be your master?

139
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:06,520
Wait. Do you do martial arts? Are you trained in that field?

140
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,459
I know everything.

141
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,719
The CEO of J Entertainment came to this neighbourhood...

142
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,059
a while ago, didn't he?

143
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,359
Please be my mentor, Mr. Kim.

144
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,738
You're already talented. Why do you need me as your mentor?

145
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:22,798
No.

146
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,738
- What? - You were really the songwriter?

147
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:26,368
No way. Then your ex-girlfriend is Syaon?

148
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:27,979
They weren't...

149
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,979
in a relationship.

150
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:32,710
- Really? - By the way,

151
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,609
you guys can't tell anyone.

152
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,619
Sure. We can keep it a secret.

153
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,249
But why?

154
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,560
I did something wrong a long time ago.

155
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,759
- Like what? - What did you do?

156
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,229
That was...

157
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,700
School violence!

158
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,840
Be quiet.

159
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,479
Well...

160
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:12,148
- Hey, what's going on? - What?

161
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,449
Were you sharing secrets without me?

162
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,889
- No. - No.

163
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,559
I'll explain it to you if I get a chance next time.

164
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,028
What is it? Tell me.

165
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,658
Why did you stop talking when I came back?

166
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:25,669
It's nothing important. We were talking about our lives.

167
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,969
We were talking about his ex-girlfriend.

168
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,238
- Right. - It was about his ex-girlfriend.

169
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:30,638
It's rude to talk about his ex when his girlfriend is here.

170
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,069
- Right. - Yes.

171
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,869
Will you be my mentor?

172
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,039
- Yes, he's your mentor. - No?

173
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,439
- We already talked about that. - He said okay.

174
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,349
- You should accept him. - I know I can be good.

175
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,679
- I'm curious. - I don't know.

176
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,949
- His ex became his mentee. - I'm curious too.

177
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,180
But I don't know.

178
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,350
How much of it were you going to tell them?

179
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,060
You would have told them everything if that guy hadn't come back.

180
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:55,830
When you told me about your secret, you said something like this.

181
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:58,398
You didn't want anyone to find out,

182
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,769
so you lived your whole life, protecting that secret.

183
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,670
But at times,

184
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,268
you wondered...

185
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,070
if telling your secret to people would make you feel better.

186
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:08,509
I guess that's how I must have felt.

187
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,149
But still. You never know how they will react to that.

188
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,680
Gosh. It's all my fault.

189
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,089
I believed you too easily.

190
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,159
You must think that other people would do the same.

191
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:26,259
I don't think you believed that easily.

192
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,800
But I have you to thank.

193
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,840
It still amazes me.

194
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,409
Walking around like this without my mask on.

195
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,509
Letting the night breeze touch my skin.

196
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,509
Laughing and having a good time with other people.

197
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:49,879
It's been ages since I did all this.

198
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,060
Thank you.

199
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,330
It's my first time doing all this.

200
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,388
It was my first festival.

201
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:03,300
It was my first time hanging out with people.

202
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,629
So I should be more thankful.

203
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,970
But among everything,

204
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,210
you fascinate me the most.

205
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,459
- Gosh. - You startled me.

206
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,460
- What is it? - What?

207
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,470
Please be my mentor.

208
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,970
I want to make music.

209
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,810
What?

210
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,820
I want to learn from you. Please teach me.

211
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:00,350
Please...

212
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,989
Please be my mentor, Mr. Kim.

213
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,960
Since when did he start following us?

214
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,450
(Brother)

215
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,920
Hello. The cell phone owner can't answer the phone now.

216
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,989
Your brother is at my house right now.

217
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:41,190
He's very drunk.

218
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:43,700
It's okay.

219
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,570
I'll let him crash here for the night.

220
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,409
Yes. Do you want to take him?

221
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,810
The address is...

222
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,550

224
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,330
Hey, Soo Jin.

225
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:16,158
I told you to stop calling.

226
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,259
I have a get-together with my colleagues today.

227
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,170
We can meet tomorrow.

228
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:22,139
Yes. I love you too.

229
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,009
What was that?

230
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,579
- You startled me. - Who were you talking to just now?

231
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,609
You said you loved her.

232
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,509
I talked to my mother whom I love very much. So what?

233
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:35,419
What are you doing here?

234
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,580
You acted as if you were a gentleman earlier.

235
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:39,388
I knew you were a dirtbag.

236
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:41,590
So what if you know? What are you going to do about it?

237
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,119
Hey. You like her, don't you?

238
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,728
Gosh, seriously. What an odd taste in women.

239
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:49,029
You jerk.

240
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,398
Go and find another woman.

241
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,028
She was way too easy. So it was no fun.

242
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:55,070
You jerk!

243
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,269
What are you doing?

244
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,309
- Are you okay? - Yes.

245
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,778
- My goodness. Hey, Oh Baek. - Gosh.

246
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,340
Get a grip.

247
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
This jerk...

248
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:07,709
- Forget it. Darn it. - Are you okay?

249
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,379
I think he likes you a lot, Soo Jin.

250
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,050
- Soo Jin? - What?

251
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,759
Was it Yeon Doo?

252
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,489
Yeon Doo?

253
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:23,658
Cho Rok. I'm sorry.

254
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:24,659
I thought...

255
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,040
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,839
- Hey, get up. Wake up now. - Hey.

257
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Hey, you.

258
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,008
I'm glad you're here.

259
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,609
Say hello.

260
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,609
This is Kim Do Ha, the famous songwriter.

261
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,018
What are you talking about? Get up now.

262
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,090
You know my brother, right?

263
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,590
He's in Atlantis. J Entertainment produced his group.

264
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,358
He's Ethan, the main vocalist of Atlantis.

265
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:58,059
Mr. Kim Do Ha. I admire you so much.

266
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,868
When you're done working on Syaon's song,

267
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,170
would you mind writing one for us...

268
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,040
- Just get on my back. - Gosh.

269
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:07,739
- Get on my back now. - But I'm heavy.

270
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,540
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:15,479
Don't forget this.

272
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:19,220
He won the cash prize at the festival.

273
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,050
The festival?

274
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,359
I see. Okay.

275
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,330
Thank you.

276
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Your younger brother is very talented in music.

277
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Get home safely.

278
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,310
Let go of me.

279
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,310
Gosh. You little punk.

280
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:48,450
You've never done this before. This isn't like you.

281
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,478
You passed out in someone else's house...

282
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,119
and said that he was Kim Do Ha or whatever.

283
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:56,219
Hey, he really is Kim Do Ha.

284
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,389
He's the songwriter.

285
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:00,129
- Gosh. - Come on.

286
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,899
- Whatever. Be quiet. - You don't believe me?

287
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,359
You don't believe me?

288
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,479
What is this?

289
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:26,119
What a weird dream this is. Am I going mad?

290
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:34,989
What?

291
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,229
Am I dreaming?

292
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,199
I don't think this is a dream.

293
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,040
Gosh, it feels so real.

294
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,539
Well, since this is a dream, let me...

295
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,008
This isn't a dream!

296
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,409
Gosh. What?

297
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,209
What is this? Goodness.

298
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,310
What? Where are we?

299
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,549
Gosh. We were going to leave after having the spicy tteokbokki.

300
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,618
I must have gone mad.

301
00:16:57,619 --> 00:17:00,119
Gosh. Right. The tteokbokki.

302
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,488
- I must be losing it. - Hey, this never happened.

303
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,319
This was a dream. A nightmare.

304
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,628
A nightmare? Hey, don't be so harsh.

305
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:08,128
Yes, it's a nightmare.

306
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:10,359
I hope you're gone by the time I come out of the shower.

307
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:12,770
Hey, let's have hangover soup before we go.

308
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:15,699
What?

00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,770
Let's have hangover soup.

310
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,309
I'll ask for more chilli peppers and the spicy paste.

311
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,280
And I'll ask for lean meat since you don't like fatty parts.

312

- Keep going. - Extra salted shrimp and chives.

313
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,019
- Great. - Hey, I only ordered two bowls,

314
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,550
but it came out to 48 dollars. Darn it.

315
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:33,149
Hold on. What is that?

316
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,790
Do you still wear that underwear?

317
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,059
What?

318
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,958
You had it even before we started dating.

319
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,188
I have several pairs of the same underwear.

320
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:41,388
Besides, these are from a luxury brand.

321
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:43,229
I'm so sick of your underwear. They stink too.

322
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,469
Gosh, when did she see them? Seriously.

323
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,800
There's a hole here. Darn it.

324
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:53,810

325

- Ma'am. - Yes.

326
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,709
- Can you give us more kkakdugi? - Sure.

327
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,090

328
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:13,089

- Enjoy. - Thank you.

332
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,340

That's what you said when we sat over there last time.

336
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,919
You couldn't take off your mask either.

337
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,958
But what made you think about taking off your mask...

338
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,830
to eat with me that night?

339
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,189
You were eating it with gusto.

340
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,399
"Gosh."

341
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,969
What? When did I say it like that?

342
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:00,810
Back then, I couldn't tell you this,

343
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:02,709
but you ate just like a middle-aged man.

344
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,448
A middle-aged man? You're mean.

345
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:07,809
What about you?

346
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,718

00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,699
Did you finish the initial report?

362
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What?

363
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,429
A woman in her 20s?

364
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,829
There was blunt force trauma to the head.

365
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,639
I can't be certain if that was an immediate cause of death.

366
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,608
But the body must have been there for over five years.

367
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:07,810
It will take a while to collect her DNA.

368
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,339
As soon as I get her DNA,

369
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,139
I'll compare it with the samples of registered missing people.

370
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,909
Hello?

371
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,050
Yes. Okay. I got it.

372
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,259
(Looking for a missing girl, Choi Eom Ji)

373
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,659
(If you know her whereabouts or saw her, please call us.)

374
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,128
Candidate Jung Yeon Mi won 52.1 percent of the votes.

375
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:35,799
As she won the majority vote, without having to hold another vote,

376
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,968
she officially became the candidate for her party.

377
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:39,039
Thank you.

(Announcement of primary election results for governorship)

379
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:43,510
I would like to address my junior and senior politicians here.

380
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,109
I ask for your help.

381
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,419
I will do my best to repay you with a victory.

382
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,780
Thank you.

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,959
(Kwak Jin Hyuk, Hakcheon Police Station)

385
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:13,209
Sir.

386
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,608
- Hey. - Could this be...

387
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:16,638
the skeleton of the missing girl, Choi Eom Ji?

388
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:18,509
Why did you come all the way here? What's up with the questions?

389
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,510
This is my case.

390
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:33,629
Hi, it's me.

391
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,429
It's been a while.

392
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,159
Are you still at Forensics?

393
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:40,330
Do you know someone at the National Forensic Service?

394
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,109
My goodness.

395
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:53,909
What are you doing here?

396
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,780
Did you come to smash the place?

397
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,649
Get me some cold water.

398
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,959
Have you been drinking again?

399
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,070
My gosh.

400
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,069
Hey. The guy you're seeing. What does he do?

401
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,178
Does he have money?

402
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:24,209
You came to ask me that?

403
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:29,878
I'm not seeing anyone.

404
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:30,879
Come on.

405
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,888
The guy who looks like a smooth boiled egg.

406
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,090
Does he have money or not?

407
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,159
I have money too.

408
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,959
He doesn't have any money. He's dirt poor!

409
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:43,500
Hey!

410
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,698
You can find a rich guy who loves you too at your age.

411
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,069
Why would you date him...

412
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,500
and waste your taut skin and looks?

413
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:56,809
If he's rich and he loves me, does nothing else matter?

414
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,438
All you need are those two.

415
00:22:58,439 --> 00:22:59,879
What else do you need?

416
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,850
As long as he's not a convict.

417
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,389
I went too far last time.

418
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,629
My bad.

419
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,699
You took your time to apologize.

420
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:25,939
You're just as much in the wrong.

421
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,510
Do you know...

422
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,449
how your father's doing?

423
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,820
No.

424
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,789
Why?

425
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,459
Did he meet someone?

426
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,229
You don't know anything?

427
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,730
He met someone?

428
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:53,699
How would I know? I don't know anything!

429
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:54,929
You do know.

430
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,438
Darn it. I'm leaving.

431
00:23:58,439 --> 00:24:01,070
What happened? How do you know?

432
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,080
I saw him during a hike.

433
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:09,619
Is Dad okay? Is he doing well?

434
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,080
There's no need to worry about him.

435
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,419
He was with a woman way younger...

436
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,060
My goodness.

437
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:17,658
It's amazing.

438
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:20,388
With his good looks, though he's old and penniless,

439
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:22,089
young women still fall for him.

440
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,060
It was a real sight. I was almost jealous.

441
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:28,070
My gosh...

442
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:38,369
I decided to believe what you said.

443
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:44,340
That you can hear when someone lies,

444
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,179
and that you believe him because of it.

445
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,179
All that.

446
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,919
Thank you.

447
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,619
But...

448
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,889
is there a weakness to your ability?

449
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:04,859
I can't decipher sounds from a TV or phone.

450
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,000
I must hear someone talk in person.

451
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,300
And it's not about facts.

452
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,340
What the speaker really believes comes across to be true.

453
00:26:15,469 --> 00:26:16,540
Then...

454
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,449
if someone murdered someone else,

455
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,179
but has no idea they did,

456
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,320
you could hear that as the truth.

457
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:31,459
I said "if."

458
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,159
You said you believed me.

459
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,760
Why do you keep saying this?

460
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:41,869
In Hakcheon,

461
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:45,169
a skeleton of a woman in her 20s was found.

462
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,379
On a mountain near the coast where Choi Eom Ji went missing.

463
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,909
They're analysing her DNA,

464
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,050
and she died about five years ago.

465
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:58,949
So what?

466
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:00,750
Sol Hee.

467
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,859
The Kim Seung Ju guy.

468
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,359
He was taking sleeping pills and sedatives at the time.

469
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,060
Side effects include...

470
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:10,830
reduced cognitive function and memory loss.

471
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,899
He took this to sleep?

472
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,649
I get what you're saying,

473
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:31,250
but he's not like that.

474
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,820
I see.

475
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,429
I'm a bit jealous.

476
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,869
I should go.

477
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,520
Kim. Are you in a good mood?

478
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:14,760
- Does it show? - Yes, totally.

479
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,429
The guy who played the drums...

480
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,030
asked about you.

481
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,699
"What's his name? Who signed him?"

482
00:28:22,939 --> 00:28:24,540
He really grilled me.

483
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:26,509
What did you tell him?

484
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,310
Not much. I just said you were Kim.

485
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,609
That I don't know much else.

486
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,320
My name is Kim Do Ha.

487
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,949
I don't have an agency right now.

488
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,859
Oh, your name...

489
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,429
It suits you well.

490
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,230
Long time no see.

491
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,139
Sol Hee.

492
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,939
You should've come earlier.

493
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,580
Do Ha's performance today.

494
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:06,179
He tore up the stage.

495
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:09,250
I missed it.

496
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,219
I'll head out, Do Ha.

497
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,050
Lock up for me.

498
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,490
Do Ha...

499
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:37,340
Play it.

500
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:39,949
I can't play the piano.

501
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,419
There's one song anyone can play.

502
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:01,570
"The Chopsticks March" is titled a march,

503
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:03,340
but it's actually a waltz.

504
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,069
You don't pound the keys.

505
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,570
You play it so listeners sway with pleasure.

506
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,609
That's how it should sound.

507
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:14,379
Sit next to me.

508
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,889
Your left hand goes here,

509
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,689
and your right here.

510
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,139
Is something wrong?

511
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,240
- What? - You look a bit glum.

512
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:51,580
I'm not. I was smiling throughout.

513
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,750
I can't hear when someone lies,

514
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,480
but I can read expressions.

515
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:42,729

517
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,000
Check.

While everything changes,

00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,809
if there's something you believe is unchanging...

521
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,740
Am I the only one here?

522
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Look carefully.

523
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,320
Are you listening?

524
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:24,570
I could've been alone.

525
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:31,080
The tteokbokki here is the best.

526
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,648
Hey, you.

527
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:37,149
Will you eat slowly?

528
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,249
It's so good.

529
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,520
Am I not getting the movie properly?

530
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:49,189
Thank you.

531
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:58,069
Don't fight and play together as good friends do.

532
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,269
What? Why would you say that?

533
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,270
Darn it.

534
00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:09,050
You're Syaon, aren't you?

535
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,589
Here.

536
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,540
Hey.

537
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,908
I'm watching this for the tenth time to listen to...

538
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,179
the song you sang for the soundtrack.

539
00:34:41,509 --> 00:34:43,580
I was happy all ten times.

540
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:48,989
And I'd like you to be happy as long as you do music.

541
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,360
If that's too much,

542
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,830
you can take a break.

543
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,060
You can take a long break.

544
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,270

I'll say just three things.

610
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:59,869

Début the singers you think have a chance,

620
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,239
and those who don't,

621
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,310
drop them.

622
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:38,880

If you're still working on them,

627
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:49,449
they're not worth it.

628
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,790
Drop them.

629
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:06,369

00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:19,100
Do I have to get a call?

730
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:20,940
I'm sure it's just procedure.

731
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,709
I'm going to tell them everything I know.

732
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,839
What are you going to say?

733
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,679
Please. Don't do anything.

734
00:47:30,009 --> 00:47:32,719
You can do that for me. Can't you?

735
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,420
If I'm the culprit,

736
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:37,319
I shouldn't do anything. But...

737
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:39,489
I didn't do it.

738
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:42,560
Didn't you...

739
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,860
and that dead girl have matching rings?

740
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,199
Where is that?

741
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,639
I threw it in the ocean in Hakcheon.

742
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,670
Why are you asking me that?

743
00:47:54,009 --> 00:47:56,339
Okay. I'm not worried.

744
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:59,509
You just need to answer them like you just answered me.

745
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,020
Here.

746
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,619
I saw that it was about a three-and-a-half hour drive.

747
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:44,860
Eat this on your way there.

748
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,159
You can have it on your way back too.

749
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:47,960
Thank you.

750
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,500
Do you want me to go with you?

751
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,540
No. Don't worry.

752
00:48:58,369 --> 00:48:59,540
I'll come back safely.

753

at 11am today regarding her inheritance.

755
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:18,860
And tomorrow at 2pm...

756
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,929
and 4pm, you have VIP consultations.

757
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:23,258
Okay.

758
00:49:23,259 --> 00:49:26,299
Then I'll go get the car.

759
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:30,269
There's a lot of traffic going to Seongbuk-dong,

760
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,900
so the shortest route there...

761
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,869

What is this?

764
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:46,080
Up until yesterday, this video didn't have that many views.

765
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,749
But the views have kept going up ever since news broke...

766
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,520
that they found the body.

767
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,489
What should we do?

768
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:57,500
Aren't you suspicious of him?

769
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:01,729
I'm sure you're not dating a murderer.

770
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:04,400
I'm sure you've already vetted him before you started dating.

771
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,469
Thank you for believing in him.

772
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:11,179
I wish others would believe in him too.

773
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,509
He really didn't do it.

774
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,049
He's a really nice guy.

775
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,969
Ms. Kim.

776
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,068
If Mr. Jo said that he wasn't going to work with Kim Do Ha,

777
00:50:37,069 --> 00:50:39,969
then you'll need a songwriter and a song. Right?

778
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:43,269
Why don't you show him my song?

779
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,080
- Gosh... - It's not the time for that.

780
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:48,009
- Can you go? - My gosh.

Hey, it's me.

787
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,049
Is what you told me about the songwriter Kim Do Ha true?

788
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,489
If it is, could you ask him if he could write a song for me?

789
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,420
All of a sudden?

790
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,289
Don't you need to ask your company...

791
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:36,230
My company isn't going to work with Kim Do Ha anymore.

792
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,900
Or...

794
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,069
If you feel uncomfortable asking, can you set up a meeting for me?

795
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:47,199
I'll ask him myself.

796
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,839
You didn't even believe me. Why are you asking all of a sudden?

797
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,409
I'll ask him when I get a little closer to him.

798
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:55,810
I have a customer. Bye.

799
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:05,860
What are you talking about?

800
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:11,000
Do you know Kim Do Ha?

801
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,540
You said she committed suicide, but we found her body.

802
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,339
On a mountain, at that.

803
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:25,440
I need you to tell me about that day again.

804
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,279
You got into a huge fight with Choi Eom Ji at the beach.

805
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,850
Tell me again what happened after that.

806
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:37,420
I left Eom Ji at the beach,

807
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:40,659
and I was out of it.

808
00:52:42,029 --> 00:52:43,389

Why are you changing your story?

811
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,339
Didn't you say you were at a pub watching soccer?

812
00:52:55,409 --> 00:52:57,980
No. I didn't go.

813
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:03,850
Your memory seems to be off since so much time has passed.

814
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:05,678
Stop talking nonsense.

815
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:07,150
This is exactly how I remember it.

816
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:09,920
That night,

817
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:13,420
I walked all night and got home around dawn.

818
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:18,560
I couldn't sleep, and I didn't want to stay there.

819
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,299
That's why I got changed and went to the bus terminal.

Are you scared since her body's been found?

No. I didn't kill her.

No, there isn't.

The reason why he covers his face...

843
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,449
is because he's a murderer.

But Kim Do Ha always wears a mask,
