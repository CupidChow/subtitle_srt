Why? Is she from Hakcheon?

52

But she didn't sound like she was from Hakcheon.

Hey, she's a good person.

00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,588
There was a famous case in Hakcheon.

183
00:11:34,588 --> 00:11:36,228
A girl went missing at the beach.

184
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,258
Oh, there?

185
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:41,559
From what I remember, the boyfriend was the culprit.

186
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,199
- You remember that case, right? - I know that case too.

187
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,138
- I know that case. - Were you there when it happened?

188
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,199
- No, I mostly worked in Seoul. - Wasn't that case closed?

189
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:48,569
I was there only briefly.

190
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,008
- I hope we can work well together. - Same here.

191
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,348

Can I get some sleep inducers?

197
00:13:04,978 --> 00:13:06,019
Sure.

198
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:25,939
Are you sure this is solid?

199
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,399

- Hey. - You can talk over there.

I don't know what you might do this time.

Okay. I'll stay here and talk.

I'm sorry about that night.

217
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:58,289
You always wear masks everywhere.

218
00:14:58,289 --> 00:14:59,529
I got curious, so I couldn't help it.

219
00:15:01,498 --> 00:15:03,399
Had I known that you wouldn't come home after that,

220
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,569
I wouldn't have done that.

221
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:08,638
How did you know that I hadn't been home?

222
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,939

223
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:19,149

What?

226
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,588
You didn't think of anything after seeing my face?

227
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,118
Like you've seen my face somewhere.

228
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,258
Well, I just thought...

229
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:41,138
you were handsome.

230
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,208
What?

231
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,579
You are handsome.

232
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:47,279
Well, you're not my type, though.

233
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:56,789
That's not what I meant.

234
00:15:56,848 --> 00:15:57,919
Excuse me!

235
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:02,128
Come on. This is driving me crazy.

236
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,159
I just lost my cell phone.

237
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:06,429
I need to make a phone call. Can I borrow your phone?

238
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,529
That phone was brand-new too. I just bought it yesterday.

239

- this trick to scam people now. - It's mine.

244
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,738
You can't just lend your phone to him.

245
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:23,049
He was telling the truth.

246
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:24,508
Yes, I know the place.

247
00:16:25,378 --> 00:16:27,019
Get ready to run after him when he runs away with your phone.

248
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,189
I'll be there right away. Okay.

249
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:31,789

252
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:40,858
If I lend it to you, will you pay it back?

253
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:42,299
Of course.

254
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,098
You have my number there. Send me your account number.

255
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:46,868
I'll wire it to you as soon as I find my phone.

256
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,079
I don't have any cash.

257
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:55,449
Do you have cash on you?

258
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:57,579
What?

259
00:16:58,008 --> 00:16:59,878
Give it to me. I'll pay you back later.

261
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:27,539
Do you trust people that easily?

262
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:29,509
I don't trust people.

263
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,378
I only trust their deserving words.

264
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:36,418
Anyway, thank you. I know you were trying to help me.

265
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:46,299
Bye.

266
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:43,918

267
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,618
It seems she trusts everyone she meets.

268
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:03,838

269
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:06,938

- It's tasty. - Really?

00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:01,858
Do you think I'll buy it?

358

00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:26,059
Gosh.

364
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,658
I thought I could convince her, but she won't buy it.

365
00:25:29,858 --> 00:25:30,888
Darn it.

366
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:37,799
Enjoy your food.

367
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:42,299
Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

368
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,838
- Why won't you eat more? - It tastes awful.

369
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:49,009
I'm full too.

370
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:51,608
Are you sure you're not lying?

371
00:25:52,178 --> 00:25:54,819
I'm not lying. Aren't you lying, Mom?

372
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:58,219
No. Just seeing you eat fills me up.

373
00:25:58,418 --> 00:25:59,688
Eat just one more.

374
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:01,519
No. You eat more, Mom.

375
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:03,928
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors and decide?

376
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:05,088
Sure!

377
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,029
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

378
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:11,128
It's three dollars.

379
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:14,739
Add two servings of gimbap, and I'll pay for what they ate too.

381

382
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,178
What's up?

383
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,319
Deuk Chan.

384
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,388
What's with my paycheck?

385
00:26:33,388 --> 00:26:34,588
What do you think?

386
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:37,358
I deducted all the company money you had spent.

387
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:39,658
Have you not sold your burger shop yet?

388
00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:42,559
You're using your corporate credit card to boost your sales.

389
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,438
How did you know?

390
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:51,638
How many times have you done this, starting with the wine bar?

391
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:54,809
All your business have failed, so give up and just work hard.

392
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:57,408
Don't be distracted, okay?

393
00:26:57,608 --> 00:26:59,209
Okay, I'll close up the shop.

394
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:02,719
But what about my paycheck, Deuk Chan?

395
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,719
I'm not your brother while you're wearing that employee ID card.

396
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:11,088
Get back to work, Mr. Jo Jae Chan.

397
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:12,959
Darn it, seriously.

398
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,269
Hello.

399
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,368

(Jo Deuk Chan)

401
00:27:26,908 --> 00:27:28,378
I'm really sorry,

402
00:27:29,108 --> 00:27:30,479
but how about next Tuesday?

403
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,749
As for the time, I'll work around your schedule.

404
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:37,989
Yes.

407
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:54,898
Okay.

408
00:27:55,898 --> 00:27:58,438
Then I have no choice but to do this.

409
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:00,979
Cheese.

Our parents set us up.

412
00:28:14,188 --> 00:28:16,489
I'm not sure if he loves me.

413
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,289
Does he want to marry me since he's at the right age to get married,

414
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:20,559
and we're in the same league?

415
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:23,029
I really can't tell.

416
00:28:23,698 --> 00:28:26,698
So I want to have a serious conversation with him,

417
00:28:26,969 --> 00:28:28,838
and I'd like you to listen in.

418
00:28:30,638 --> 00:28:34,009
This will vibrate once if it's true. Twice, if it's a lie.

You'll be charged in ten-minute intervals.

420
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,148
We'll tell him I'm your friend as I'll be sitting in.

421
00:28:40,848 --> 00:28:41,948
Any other questions?

422
00:28:41,948 --> 00:28:44,289
Do you have a boyfriend, by any chance?

423
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:45,848
Personal questions aren't allowed.

424
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:47,289
I'm sorry.

425
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,658
I just thought it'd be easier for you to understand how I felt...

426
00:28:50,858 --> 00:28:53,299
if you were in a relationship now.

427
00:28:55,198 --> 00:28:56,799
My job is to tell you the truth.

428
00:28:57,398 --> 00:28:59,668
I don't really need to understand how you feel to do that.

429
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:34,799
(I can't talk because of my vocal cord nodules.)

430
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:38,838
(Just give me one big bill for my surgery and living expenses.)

431
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:39,979
(Thanks in advance.)

432
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:44,479
Who are you?

433
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:50,188
Did I come to the wrong unit?

434
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,888
Doesn't Sol Hee live here?

435
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:01,398

436
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:05,499

437
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:12,769
(I can't talk because of my vocal cord nodules.)

438
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:16,079
Come on. Let's talk inside.

439
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,678
You can still talk even if you have vocal cord nodules!

440
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:24,348
Are you trying to con your own daughter now?

441
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:26,989
Oh, was I mistaken?

442
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:29,188
Whatever, you're such a know-it-all!

443
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:39,898
Let's go inside.

444
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:42,638
Where did you spend all the money I gave you?

445
00:30:42,638 --> 00:30:44,039
Let's go inside, and you can tell me everything.

446
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,969
No, I refuse to go inside. I don't want to talk to you.

447
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:47,309
Why not?

448
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:48,709
Because you're scary!

449
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,688
Are you going to give me money or not?

450
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:01,059
I'll come in if you'll give me money.

451
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:03,459
Will you just leave if I refuse to give you money?

452
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,329
What are we going to do, sitting face-to-face?

453
00:31:05,388 --> 00:31:07,698
You'll just interrogate me...

454
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:09,459
to call me out on my lies.

455
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,769
You earn money very easily. Why can't you give me some?

456
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:14,999
Does it feel like a waste to you?

457
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,269
You think I earn money easily?

458
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:19,638
If I were you... Gosh, a credit card is a given.

459
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:21,678
I'll set up automatic monthly e-transfers.

460
00:31:22,908 --> 00:31:25,709
You destroyed the whole family. Don't you even feel bad?

461
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:29,178
It wouldn't have happened if you weren't a con artist to begin with.

462
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:31,388
Besides, I was an elementary school kid back then.

463
00:31:31,618 --> 00:31:33,088
Do I still have to feel bad about it?

464
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:37,188
You still feel bad.

465
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:43,299
Any decent person would express it through monetary means.

466
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,569
Compensation, settlement money, condolence money.

467
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:46,969
Why do you think they exist?

468
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:49,569
Whether it's gratitude or guilt,

469
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:51,438
the only way you can express it...

470
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:54,779
is through money.

471
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:19,769
Just so you know, I'm not doing this because I feel bad.

472
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:21,938
I'm giving it to you so you'd stay out of trouble.

473
00:32:23,938 --> 00:32:27,279
My gosh. Thank you, my dear daughter!

474
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,009
Seriously, thank you so much!

475
00:32:31,948 --> 00:32:34,178
I mean it. You know that, right?

476
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:16,059
I'm sorry.

477
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,789
By the end of the month...

478
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,759
Yes. Once we decide on the construction company next week,

479
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,398
the construction will begin right away.

480
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,029
My gosh, you're very impatient.

481
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:28,769
I told you I'd be in touch.

482
00:33:29,098 --> 00:33:32,638
Yes, that's right. I'll be in touch. Bye.

Your mom...

490
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,098
took my money, 30,000 dollars.

491

If I don't get the money back, I'll die.

492

I'm very ill now.

493
00:34:05,469 --> 00:34:08,338

00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,579
The client has changed the location.

542
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,048
- Call them and check. - Sure.

543
00:38:53,258 --> 00:38:55,098
(Police)

544
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:56,428
(Luni Tarot Café)

545
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:04,508
Hello. What's going on?

546
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,479
What is it? Did you see something?

547
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:12,908
No.

548
00:39:13,848 --> 00:39:15,848
I saw a man who looked like someone I knew.

549
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:24,758
This is huge, isn't it?

550
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,459
I'll try it now.

551
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:28,298
(It's bigger than your face.)

552
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,329
(I'm here to see you, Syaon)

553
00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:35,269
It's so good!

554
00:39:35,568 --> 00:39:38,109
This is the Special Cheese Burger.

555
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,468
It's really delicious.

556
00:39:39,868 --> 00:39:41,908
What are you going to eat today?

557
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:43,778
How about a burger, like me?

558
00:39:43,778 --> 00:39:46,479
(Wishing you nothing but success)

559
00:39:53,888 --> 00:39:54,919
Wasn't the burger delicious?

560
00:39:56,218 --> 00:39:57,629
Now, give me...

561
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,289
Do Ha's address.

562
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:01,598
Okay.

563
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:04,999
I'll give it to you.

564
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:34,758
I thought I'd already met all of Hee Yul's friends.

565
00:40:34,758 --> 00:40:37,899
Oh, we reconnected after many years.

566
00:40:38,298 --> 00:40:39,598
I told you.

567
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:43,068
Anyway, I barely see you these days.

568
00:40:43,368 --> 00:40:44,368
Have you been very busy?

569
00:40:44,908 --> 00:40:47,709
Yes, work's been quite busy.

570
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,359
Who are you texting?

571
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:04,258
Oh, it's just a group chat with my co-workers.

572
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:15,638
Are you texting a female co-worker?

573
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:17,539
Gosh, no.

574
00:41:17,638 --> 00:41:19,568
Not at all.

575
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:28,818
Sung Jun.

576
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:33,519
Can we really get married?

577
00:41:43,528 --> 00:41:46,298
Marriage? At our age? That's nonsense.

578
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,138
Age means nothing.

579
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,439
You should get married when you've found the right person.

580
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:52,238
I'll never find anyone better than you.

581
00:41:53,068 --> 00:41:54,109
I'm sure of it.

582
00:41:58,979 --> 00:42:00,749
Give me your hand.

583
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:15,428
Oh, my.

584
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:17,899
I've been wearing it all day.

585
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:19,629
I see that!

586
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:23,609
"Don't skip meals."

587
00:42:25,169 --> 00:42:27,539
"Sweet dreams." Just sending you such texts...

588
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,539
isn't good enough for me.

589
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,408
We'll fill up the fridge,

590
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:34,079
and I'll cook for you.

591
00:42:35,718 --> 00:42:37,589
I want to see you eat and sleep well...

592
00:42:38,888 --> 00:42:40,218
right by your side.

593
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:48,499
Okay.

594
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:53,528
This wasn't that expensive.

595
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:08,448
Are you going to marry me?

596
00:43:10,618 --> 00:43:14,459
Hey, your friend is here. What are you saying all of a sudden?

597
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:17,059
I know you've been dating me because everything...

598
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,928
just happened to work out. I did too.

599
00:43:20,428 --> 00:43:21,598
Don't say that.

600
00:43:22,298 --> 00:43:25,129
I didn't date you because of your social status.

601
00:43:25,368 --> 00:43:26,769
Did something happen to her today?

602
00:43:29,669 --> 00:43:33,039
I didn't think any of that mattered,

603
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:36,079
but now it does.

604
00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:40,678
I actually fell in love with you.

605
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:47,559
Let's talk about this stuff when we're alone. Okay?

606
00:43:53,428 --> 00:43:54,629
It's an urgent call.

607
00:43:56,758 --> 00:43:58,028
Do you love me?

608
00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:03,068
Where are you right now?

609
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:14,318
If you would like,

610
00:44:14,649 --> 00:44:17,289
I can find out who he's seeing.

611
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:25,229
Thank you. You may leave now.

612
00:44:26,189 --> 00:44:28,098
- Sorry? - I don't think...

613
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:30,899
I can break up with him anyway.

614
00:44:31,698 --> 00:44:34,638
So that's all I want to hear.

615
00:44:36,169 --> 00:44:38,169
Even after hearing all of his lies...

616
00:44:42,508 --> 00:44:44,249
Okay. I understand.

617
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,579
Can you just lie to me once?

618
00:44:48,818 --> 00:44:52,149
Can you tell me that you don't actually serve the spirit of truth?

619
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:55,359
And that you don't actually hear anything.

620
00:44:59,758 --> 00:45:03,399
I can tell you that you won't be happy...

621
00:45:03,899 --> 00:45:05,198
if you marry him.

622
00:45:06,698 --> 00:45:08,798
Then are you happy because you know everything?

623
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:12,868
I know I look pathetic,

624
00:45:14,238 --> 00:45:15,879
but I don't know. I just...

625
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:21,519
want to trust everything he says.

626
00:45:46,408 --> 00:45:49,238
I'm sorry. I've been all over the place these days...

627
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:51,979
because I was preparing for this.

628
00:45:54,178 --> 00:45:55,318
I love you, Hee Yul.

629
00:45:59,988 --> 00:46:01,189
Will you marry me?

630
00:46:05,089 --> 00:46:07,829
Sung Jun made us keep it a secret from you.

631
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:10,499
- We were all dying to tell you. - Oh, my gosh.

632
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:12,899
Look at that.

633
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:14,839
(My lovely angel, will you marry me?)

634
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:18,339
My gosh.

635
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:36,118
Then are you happy because you know everything?

636
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,158
How many times do I have to tell you?

637
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,798
I have a lot of work.

638
00:46:48,698 --> 00:46:50,439
You're not coming from work.

639
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,669
Why do you keep lying these days?

640
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:56,939
Sol Hee, what's wrong with you these days?

641
00:46:57,778 --> 00:47:00,008
Why can't you trust me? You're always just getting mad.

642
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:02,178
Lee Kang Min.

643
00:47:03,379 --> 00:47:04,519
Do you love me?

644
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,919
- What? - Just answer that.

645
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:09,658
Do you love me?

646
00:47:19,868 --> 00:47:21,098
Let's talk tomorrow.

647
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:23,568
I'm so tired today.

648
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:25,738
Let's break up.

649
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:28,278
What?

650
00:47:29,709 --> 00:47:31,008
Let's break up.

651
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,919
Weren't you waiting for me to say that?

652
00:47:34,278 --> 00:47:36,149
Sol Hee, when did I...

653
00:47:36,149 --> 00:47:38,948
If not, are you really going to marry me next year?

654
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:49,959
Of course,

655
00:47:51,198 --> 00:47:52,269
we should.

656
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,379
There is...

657
00:48:07,749 --> 00:48:10,079
a secret that I haven't told you.

658
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:13,618
To be honest,

659
00:48:14,919 --> 00:48:16,289
I hear lies.

660
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:34,479
Thank you. The next one is on me.

661
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:36,309
- Thank you. - Round two will be on me.

662
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:37,848
It was nice meeting you today.

663
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,249
I'll contact you once I get home.

664
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,218
I couldn't text you because I've been busy. Sorry.

665
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,848
It's okay. I understand.

666
00:48:42,848 --> 00:48:44,888
- It's nice seeing you in a while. - I missed you too.

667
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,888
- Babe, I love you. - Babe, I love you.

668
00:48:46,888 --> 00:48:48,189
I think I need to go home now.

669
00:48:48,189 --> 00:48:49,959
- I don't think I can drink anymore. - I'll drive you home.

670
00:48:49,959 --> 00:48:51,928
- Get home safe. Let's meet again. - Okay.

671
00:48:52,028 --> 00:48:53,289
No, don't worry.

672
00:49:46,379 --> 00:49:47,678
Would you like to order?

673
00:49:49,749 --> 00:49:51,419
I'm pretty new to jazz clubs.

674
00:49:51,419 --> 00:49:52,419
Then,

675
00:49:53,048 --> 00:49:55,559
would you like me to bring you a drink that suits the music?

676
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,928
Yes, sure.

677
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,118
Can you give me the same drink again?

678
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:58,888
They're good.

679
00:51:02,658 --> 00:51:03,689
You...

680
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:06,829
You're her, right?

681
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:08,698
What? Who...

682
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:11,698
I almost became your brother-in-law.

683
00:51:14,568 --> 00:51:16,598
I don't have a good memory.

684
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:18,638
The first thing you asked...

685
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:21,579
as soon as you met me...

686
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:24,079
was how things were in bed.

687
00:51:25,508 --> 00:51:26,908
My goodness.

688
00:51:26,908 --> 00:51:28,118
How are things in bed?

689
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:31,488
- Pardon? - You must sleep together too.

690
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:32,649
Are you satisfied sexually?

691
00:51:32,649 --> 00:51:35,258
You know, that messed up my mood.

692
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,559
Right. I remember.

693
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:39,589
You do?

694
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:46,769
It's nice seeing you here.

695
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:49,598
We should drink together.

696
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:50,939
What?

697
00:51:51,868 --> 00:51:53,508
Her blind date moved on to a drinking date?

698
00:51:58,979 --> 00:52:00,379
Do you know someone out there?

699
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,419
Well...

700
00:52:04,919 --> 00:52:06,089
The woman next door.

701
00:52:11,289 --> 00:52:12,459
"The woman next door?"

702
00:52:21,399 --> 00:52:22,439
Let's clink glasses.

703
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:30,039
How's your cousin?

704
00:52:30,879 --> 00:52:32,008
Is she doing well?

705
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,318
That's none of your business anymore.

706
00:52:35,379 --> 00:52:36,649
I have plans.

707
00:52:44,959 --> 00:52:46,559
You don't look anything like her.

708
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:48,829
You're not her cousin, are you?

709
00:52:49,598 --> 00:52:50,658
What's her name?

710
00:52:52,868 --> 00:52:54,238
Tell me.

711
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:57,039
Her first name and her family name. All of it!

712
00:52:57,198 --> 00:52:58,368
Gosh. Seriously.

713
00:53:01,709 --> 00:53:03,609
Who are you? Answer me.

714
00:53:03,879 --> 00:53:05,908
How dare you interfere and mess everything up!

715
00:53:05,908 --> 00:53:07,079
My gosh!

716
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:12,089
I'm so unlucky today.

717
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:14,888
Okay! I made a mess!

718
00:53:14,888 --> 00:53:16,118
Since my love life is doomed,

719
00:53:16,118 --> 00:53:18,289
I wanted everyone else's life to be doomed as well.

720
00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:20,528
That's why I did that! Do you have a problem with that?

721
00:53:21,229 --> 00:53:23,098
You must be crazy. How dare you...

722
00:53:27,798 --> 00:53:28,868
That's enough.

723
00:53:30,198 --> 00:53:31,238
What?

724
00:53:33,508 --> 00:53:35,209
Who are you?

725
00:53:35,309 --> 00:53:36,379
I'm a pianist.

726
00:53:39,408 --> 00:53:40,778
Do you have anything left to say to this man?

727
00:53:41,278 --> 00:53:42,318
No.

728
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:50,059
That punk! Hey!

729
00:53:51,129 --> 00:53:52,459
- What's going on? - Why is he yelling?

730
00:54:04,198 --> 00:54:05,908
Darn it. I was fooled.

731
00:54:06,638 --> 00:54:09,309
How could he only tell me the neighbourhood?

732
00:54:21,718 --> 00:54:23,388
You're the man next door, right?

733
00:54:24,089 --> 00:54:26,758
I'm not seeing things because I'm drunk, right?

734
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:29,298
How do you have to act during a blind date...

735
00:54:29,298 --> 00:54:30,928
for the man to grab your collar?

736
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:32,968
What?

737
00:54:33,368 --> 00:54:35,798
What are you saying? A blind date?

738
00:54:37,439 --> 00:54:41,008
That man was the guy you met on your blind date today, right?

739
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:43,539
No.

740
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:45,948
I don't know him.

741
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:50,718
What did you do...

742
00:54:50,718 --> 00:54:52,488
to make a stranger grab your collar?

743
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,289
I don't know either!

744
00:54:55,488 --> 00:54:59,129
Gosh. It's not like I want to hear it.

745
00:54:59,488 --> 00:55:01,499
I just hear it. What am I supposed to do?

746
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:06,298
He can just live a nice life without lying.

747
00:55:06,298 --> 00:55:08,868
Why did he get mad at me? Gosh.

748
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,269
You hear something? What are you saying?

749
00:55:16,209 --> 00:55:17,209
Do you think you're going to throw up?

750
00:55:23,678 --> 00:55:26,948
Gosh! I can't do this anymore!

751
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:29,658
What are you doing? Are you insane?

752
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:50,738
That's why he grabbed your collar.

753
00:55:50,738 --> 00:55:52,749
By the way, you must feel comfortable...

754
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,749
without your mask in front of me now.

755
00:55:59,848 --> 00:56:02,658
Come on. Drive safely.

756
00:56:03,089 --> 00:56:04,218
Since when did I not have my mask?

757
00:56:04,959 --> 00:56:07,359
From the beginning. You didn't know?

758
00:56:11,428 --> 00:56:13,499
Why did you even go there...

759
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:14,638
when you can't take off your mask?

760
00:56:16,298 --> 00:56:18,439
You probably didn't go to drink.

761
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:21,908
I went to play piano.

762
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:27,048
Then were you the person playing the piano?

763
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,118
Gosh.

764
00:56:37,118 --> 00:56:38,129
What's wrong?

765
00:56:38,859 --> 00:56:40,028
You're messing with me again, aren't you?

766
00:56:40,028 --> 00:56:42,629
No, it's real this time.

767
00:56:42,959 --> 00:56:44,568
What should I do? Should I stop the car?

768
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,129
Should I?

769
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:49,568
It was a prank.

770
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:51,908
I got you.

771
00:56:53,908 --> 00:56:55,039
You're so gullible.

772
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:01,818
I got you good.

773
00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:35,178
When I drink a lot,

774
00:57:35,178 --> 00:57:37,379
I have to eat this restaurant's hangover soup.

775
00:57:38,189 --> 00:57:39,388
I thought you felt like throwing up.

776
00:57:40,348 --> 00:57:41,988
You can eat. I'll wait in the car.

777
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:43,258
Today,

778
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:47,559
I really didn't want to drink canned beer from my fridge.

779
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:51,769
I didn't want to eat delivery food.

780
00:57:53,368 --> 00:57:55,638
And I didn't want to talk to myself while watching TV.

781
00:57:56,238 --> 00:57:58,638
I really didn't want to be alone today.

782
00:58:00,908 --> 00:58:04,079
So please just sit next to me for five minutes.

783
00:58:09,848 --> 00:58:11,048
Just five minutes.

784
00:58:17,859 --> 00:58:19,829
Thank you for sitting down.

785
00:58:21,528 --> 00:58:24,629
Also, thank you for helping me earlier.

786
00:58:24,698 --> 00:58:26,528
Someone was about to be hit.

787
00:58:26,868 --> 00:58:28,298
I had to stop him.

788
00:58:28,499 --> 00:58:30,968
No one else there seemed to care.

789
00:58:31,539 --> 00:58:33,169
They didn't know you.

790
00:58:35,379 --> 00:58:38,109
And we're acquainted.

791
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:44,278
I mean, we're not strangers.

792
00:58:55,129 --> 00:58:56,758
What? He didn't order one.

793
00:58:56,758 --> 00:58:58,269
It's 2 bowls for 2 people.

794
00:58:58,269 --> 00:58:59,499
You even have your spoon ready.

795
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:04,269
Thank you.

796
00:59:05,908 --> 00:59:08,109
Well, since it came out, you should eat it.

797
00:59:08,209 --> 00:59:09,278
This place is good.

798
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:11,138
I don't eat outside of my house.

799
00:59:11,138 --> 00:59:13,379
Then are you going to make me eat both?

800
00:59:22,718 --> 00:59:23,718
What?

801
00:59:24,459 --> 00:59:25,459
Come over here.

802
00:59:31,229 --> 00:59:33,298
Here. This is okay, right?

803
00:59:33,298 --> 00:59:35,269
I already know what you look like anyway.

804
00:59:50,778 --> 00:59:51,848
Gosh.

805
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:09,559
By the way,

806
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,368
people aren't as interested in others as you may think.

807
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:17,098
Everyone's busy dealing with their own lives.

808
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:20,408
I don't know why you're keeping yourself so secluded,

809
01:01:20,609 --> 01:01:21,908
but just saying.

810
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,928
Hey, why do you think Syaon drove around this neighbourhood for hours?

811
01:01:43,059 --> 01:01:46,198
Kim Do Ha has to be somewhere near here.

812
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:48,568
Darn it. We've been doing this for hours.

813
01:01:48,568 --> 01:01:49,868
Do we have to go this far?

814
01:01:49,868 --> 01:01:52,339
Darn you. Just check each name carefully!

815
01:01:52,468 --> 01:01:53,468
All right.

816
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,678
How frustrating.

817
01:01:57,309 --> 01:01:58,408
"Bok Soo."

818
01:02:00,448 --> 01:02:02,048
What? "Jo Deuk Chan?"

819
01:02:02,879 --> 01:02:04,749
He has the same name as J Entertainment's CEO.

820
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:06,548
Hey.

821
01:02:07,618 --> 01:02:08,689
Mr. Jo?

822
01:02:09,718 --> 01:02:10,818
Mr. Jo?

823
01:02:12,658 --> 01:02:13,689
Who are you?

824
01:02:16,258 --> 01:02:18,329
The thing is,

825
01:02:18,329 --> 01:02:21,229
my friend lives here.

826
01:02:21,229 --> 01:02:22,669
No matter how many times I ring the doorbell,

827
01:02:23,098 --> 01:02:24,439
he won't open his door.

828
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,408
Yes.

829
01:02:27,238 --> 01:02:28,508
Is that so?

830
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,579
What unit does your friend live in?

831
01:02:31,778 --> 01:02:32,778
Sorry?

832
01:02:33,678 --> 01:02:34,979
Unit 502.

833
01:02:37,948 --> 01:02:38,948
Unit 502.

834
01:02:40,448 --> 01:02:42,888
You might've seen him around.

835
01:02:43,118 --> 01:02:44,988
He's tall, and his mask...

836
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:48,258
He has fair skin.

837
01:02:50,698 --> 01:02:51,698
Any idea?

838
01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:02,979
So you're saying he's tall...

839
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,379
and has fair skin?

840
01:03:10,678 --> 01:03:12,249
Gosh, sweetie!

841
01:03:34,169 --> 01:03:38,379
(My Lovely Liar)

842
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:04,068
They probably don't know I live here.

843
01:04:04,068 --> 01:04:05,209
Let's go inside.

844
01:04:05,368 --> 01:04:06,439
The woman next door helped me.

845
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:09,908
By the way, do you never lie?

846
01:04:11,178 --> 01:04:12,249
How have you been?

847
01:04:12,379 --> 01:04:13,848
Oh, no.

848
01:04:13,848 --> 01:04:14,919
You're acting strange.

849
01:04:15,048 --> 01:04:17,048
Is it because you want to look good in front of her?

850
01:04:17,048 --> 01:04:18,318
Tell me who she is.

851
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:21,348
I can't live without Do Ha, and he can't live without me either.

852
01:04:21,488 --> 01:04:23,689
- How could you kill someone? - What's wrong?

853
01:04:23,689 --> 01:04:24,988
I came here on purpose...

854
01:04:24,988 --> 01:04:26,758
with hopes of running into you.

855
01:04:26,758 --> 01:04:28,428
Just be straightforward with him.

856
01:04:28,428 --> 01:04:30,028
("RUN" by Woody will be released on Tuesday, August 8.)

857
01:04:30,028 --> 01:04:31,229
I have a boyfriend.
