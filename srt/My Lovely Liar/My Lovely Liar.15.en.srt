(Episode 15)

12
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,800
Sol Hee.

13
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:07,539
Excuse me. She's awake.

14
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:14,209
What about Mr. Jo? What happened to him?

15
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,009
They just started his surgery.

16
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:18,880
Is it serious?

17
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,750
What about you?

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,520
Are you okay?

19
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,289
Yes. I'm all right.

20
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:28,819
You're up.

21
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:31,589
You had a vasovagal syncope...

22
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,329
due to the shock wave from the explosion.

23
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,660
You'll be all right.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,559
If you feel fine, you can go home.

25
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,399
- Thank you. - Sure.

26
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:46,169
Thank goodness.

27
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,990
(Surgery in progress)

28
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:01,860
You're up.

29
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,729
It looks like Mr. Jo...

30
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,630
has several fractures in his femur, ribs, and other parts of his body.

31
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:12,228
The surgery will take some time.

32
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:14,299
I handed over the evidence to the forensic team.

33
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:19,209
Once Mr. Jo recovers,

34
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,769
the police will have to question him.

35
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,150
So you should go home and get some rest.

36
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,850
Thanks, Kang Min.

37
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,160
Do you think you can walk?

38
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,960
(Yeonseo Hospital)

39
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,069
I can't believe I actually fainted.

40
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,139
You must have been shocked.

41
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,239
Of course, I was.

42
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,750
I'm talking about Mr. Jo, not me.

43
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,160
Even I was so shocked.

44
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,000
What will you say to him when he wakes up after the surgery?

45
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,799
I want to ask him what happened between him and Eom Ji.

46
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,940
I have nothing else to say to him.

47
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,280
I can go on my own.

48
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,850
You should stay next to Mr. Jo.

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,549
I know you're thinking about him.

50
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,590
I'll get going.

51
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,060
Let me know when you get home.

52
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,488
If we take the Yanghwa Bridge, we'll get there faster.

53
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:13,850
Let me take that bridge.

54
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,660
Sure.

55
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,140
Thank you.

56
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:40,379
Sol Hee did everything.

57
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,079
She went to see Jo Jae Chan...

58
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,850
and figured out that Jo Deuk Chan was the real culprit.

59
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,720
She also found the evidence.

60
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:58,070
After finding out about Sol Hee's ability,

61
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:00,600
I thought...

62
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,999
we might not have broken up if she didn't have that ability.

63
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:07,109
I resented her ability a bit.

64
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,350
But...

65
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,249
her ability helped you a lot.

66
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:21,989
I should be a better boyfriend.

67
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:25,859
Then stop ending up in the hospital.

68
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:29,229
This is getting old.

69
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,080
Would you like some coffee?

70
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:51,020
No. I'll take the orange juice next to the coffee.

71
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,340
Sir, how long until we arrive?

72
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,210
Gosh, I'm sorry. I thought this path would be quicker.

73
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:17,510
There's nothing you can do. It's not like you did it on purpose.

74
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:26,820
Deuk Chan's surgery went well.

75
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,580
Why did you do it?

76
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:00,749
Did you think about how it would've affected us if you had died?

77
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,929
The police...

78
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:12,400
have the evidence.

79
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,939
As soon as you recover, the police will question you.

80
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:19,939
Okay.

81
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,280
I guess I couldn't die...

82
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:27,080
even if I wanted to...

83
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,150
before I was punished for my crime.

84
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,460
Now, tell me...

85
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,059
what happened.

86
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,929
I didn't do it on purpose.

87
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,200
That night,

88
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:53,639
you neither came to watch the soccer game...

89
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,979
nor answered your phone.

90
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,650
I went to the beach to look for you.

91
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:10,859
Seung Ju?

92
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,960
Seung Ju!

93
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:22,239
Why are you here alone? What about Seung Ju?

94
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,478
Why are you all bloody? That again?

95
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,539
We...

96
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:31,780
broke up.

97
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,619
Is it for good this time?

98
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,019
You'll cling on to him and make a scene again.

99
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,560
Just stop that now. Okay?

100
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,790
You stop it.

101
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:47,430
Stop what? What do you want me to stop?

102
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,330
Having feelings for Seung Ju.

103
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:52,430
Stop that.

104
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:55,899
Eom Ji already knew everything.

105
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,139
That's nonsense. Who told you that?

106
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,889
Did Seung Ju tell you that?

107
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,709
We need to talk.

108
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,080
What are you doing? Let go of me.

109
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,249
Let go of me! Where are we going?

110
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,320
Tell me. Did Seung Ju tell you that?

111
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:46,690
No.

112
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,190
Then who told you that nonsense?

113
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,439
Well, this...

114
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
I thought I was just being sensitive.

115
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,739
I put two and two together after seeing that.

116
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:09,639
I realized why I was strangely jealous of you.

117
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:15,149
You know what? He won't be yours just because we broke up.

118
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,189
You got it all wrong.

119
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,420
I know everything.

120
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,090
You tried to split us up.

121
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:25,430
That's because you clung to him like a leech and made him miserable.

122
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,429
You were absolutely no help to Seung Ju's life!

123
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,759
Then what about you?

124
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,899
He's in bigger danger around you than around me.

125
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,970
You need to stop too.

126
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,269
Let go of Seung Ju.

127
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:43,979
Why should I do that?

128
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,210
Hey.

129
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:48,479
You know,

130
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,690
I'm different from you who will fade away over time.

131
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,590
Then I'll tell Seung Ju about you.

132
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,628
What? Tell him what?

133
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:01,290
I'll tell him why you're staying by his side.

134
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,960
How dare you try to come between us?

135
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,670
You've done enough! Just get out of our lives!

136
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,999
"Our lives?"

137
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,670
Deuk Chan.

138
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,739
I'm sure you know...

139
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,249
Seung Ju doesn't feel the same way as you.

140
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:23,749
Seung Ju and I were in love once.

141
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,290
That's the difference between you and me.

142
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,930
What did you say?

143
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,330
Difference?

144
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,310
Yes.

145
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,019
You're right.

146
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,859
Eom Ji. Get up.

147
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,670
Hey, Eom Ji. I...

148
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,170
I...

149
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,989
Eom Ji.

150
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,119
Eom Ji.

151
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,489
Eom Ji.

152
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,460
Eom Ji...

153
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:49,170
(Jae Chan)

154
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,749
Hello.

155
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,749
Deuk Chan, where are you?

156
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,618
I'm...

157
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,819
Hey, where's Kim Seung Ju right now?

158
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,919
My friend saw him fighting with Eom Ji at a bar.

159
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,259
Apparently, it was quite serious.

160
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,259
Will they finally break up today?

161
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,670
If I left her body like that,

162
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,009
I thought that you might be framed for my crime.

163
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:53,070
I just thought no one would know...

164
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,569
if I made it look like she committed suicide.

165
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,840
(I'm going to leave now. Thank you for everything. Be well without me.)

166
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,710
(Power off)

167
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:42,739
Right.

168
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,609
Then I realized that the ring on my necklace was gone.

169
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,018
I was always worried...

170
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:25,690
that I couldn't find the ring.

171
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:36,259
I thought everything would be over if I burned the shirt.

172
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,100
But I just couldn't.

173
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,440
If you were to end up in prison,

174
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,369
I was going to turn myself in right away.

175
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:02,420
I just...

176
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:07,290
wanted to keep that ring.

177
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,330
I was always envious of her.

178
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:16,000
I had thought that it was all in my past.

179
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,939
I also found a ring that likely belonged to suspect Kim.

180
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,279
The matching ring he wore with Choi Eom Ji, who died.

181
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,780
It was as if Eom Ji was trying to catch me from running away...

182
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,219
and saying there was nowhere else to turn.

183
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:55,339
I was going to turn myself in.

184
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,179
But I had so many loose ends to take care of.

185
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,509
I wanted to wrap up the loose ends at the agency and with my divorce...

186
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,480
before I did that.

187
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,750
That's why I asked Jae Chan to take my place temporarily.

188
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,689
I have a question.

189
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,590
Why did you...

190
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,659
kill Eom Ji?

191
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,369
Because I had romantic feelings.

192
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,570
What?

193
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:24,840
Did you like her too?

194
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:28,810
I had those feelings...

195
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,909
for a very long time.

196
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:36,780
I didn't want anyone to know.

197
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:41,320
I didn't want anyone to go through trouble.

198
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:48,859
I was going to take my feelings to the grave.

199
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,169
I wasn't going to tell anyone.

200
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,369
I'm sorry.

201
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,139
So many people have gotten hurt by this.

202
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,740
An apology won't solve everything.

203
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:09,449
Right.

204
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,719
I know.

205
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,490
But...

206
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,129
things must have been tough on you too.

207
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,639
Bye.

208
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,050
Do Ha.

209
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,020
Take care.

210
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:15,310
Are you done talking to him?

211
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:17,949
Yes.

212
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:20,649
Thank you for letting me talk to him.

213
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:49,779
It's been confirmed that the real culprit...

214
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,049
of the Hakcheon Beach Murder Case is the CEO of J Entertainment,

215
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,789
an entertainment agency that manages many famous artists such as Syaon.

216
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,119
This discovery has shocked a lot of people.

217
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,188
The police disclosed...

218
00:20:58,189 --> 00:21:00,059
the DNA test results that showed Jo's DNA...

219
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,760
found on the deceased's clothes.

220
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,329
Jo's attorney has disclosed that...

221
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,698
Jo voluntarily admitted to killing the victim...

222
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,770
and coercing his brother to make a false testimony.

223
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,579
("Real Culprit of Hakcheon Beach Murder Case Is Finally Revealed")

224
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,480
(The culprit was the CEO of the agency Kim worked with.)

225
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,219
Let's include an apology letter.

226
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:31,760
Pardon?

227
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:34,330
Before we air this week's episode,

228
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,229
let's insert an apology letter in the beginning...

229
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,760
about our episode for the Hakcheon Beach Missing Persons Case.

230
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:38,899
Why?

231
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:42,570
It's not like we said Kim Seung Ju was the culprit.

232
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,810
You got Detective Kwak to come clean about fabricating the case.

233
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,939
No. What Jung Yeon Mi said was true.

234
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,780
I made an innocent guy look guilty.

235
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,350
I should own up to what I did.

236
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,199
(CEO Jo Deuk Chan)

237
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,699
(September 4, 2017, Do Ha's birthday)

238
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:46,889
Eom Ho.

239
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,230
I'm sorry.

240
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,570
Don't be like this. Get up.

241
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,639
I'm sorry.

242
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:06,409
When I die,

243
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:09,980
how am I going to face Eom Ji?

244
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:17,389
I just told Eom Ji...

245
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,490
that it was all okay.

246
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,070
It was my first time seeing a picture of Choi Eom Ji,

247
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,669
but I felt like I knew her well.

248
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:08,209
Was it because I had heard so much about her?

249
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,580
Why didn't you come in?

250
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,609
How could I go in there with you?

251
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:17,980
Seeing me might make her uncomfortable.

252
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:23,820
Then why are you here?

253
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,290
I've only attended a few funerals.

254
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,830
But for some reason, I feel like...

255
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:34,230
she'd hear everything you say in your head here. Don't you agree?

256
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,000
That's why I'm here.

257
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:38,740
I had something to say to Ms. Choi Eom Ji.

258
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:46,179
I told you. I didn't drink.

259
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,679
Gosh. I swear, I didn't even have a drop of alcohol.

260
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,490
Yes.

261
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,290
I have to go.

262
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,570
I'm curious about something.

263
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,810
You said you came here to say something to Eom Ji.

264
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,149
What was it?

265
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,649
Nothing much.

266
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,490
I told her to rest in peace now...

267
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,419
and asked her to help you sleep peacefully through the night.

268
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:35,389
But you know, ever since I became your next-door neighbour,

269
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:37,060
I haven't seen Eom Ji in my dreams.

270
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,669
That was one of the reasons I decided to stay in Yeonseo-dong.

271
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:46,669
Perhaps, Ms. Choi Eom Ji did that on purpose.

272
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,580
Because she knew that I'd help you clear your name,

273
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,810
she gave you a sign that you should stay by my side.

274
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,250
Right, maybe.

275
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,540
Hey, don't I look like I've gained a bit of weight?

276
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:19,740
What? No, not at all.

277
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,980
Gosh, thanks. I really wanted to treat you this time.

278
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,809
Yes, I'm almost there.

279
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,550
I'll be there in ten minutes.

280
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,419
People don't lie these days.

281
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,790
Cho Rok, let's eat this together.

282
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:44,429
Get out. Go.

283
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,199
I've come to the wrong place.

284
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,740
- Hey. - Ouch, that hurt.

285
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,570
Are you seeing him again?

286
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,108
No.

287
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:56,208
Oh Baek also runs a business in the area, so he dropped by...

288
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,310
What?

289
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,079
You're still calling him so fondly?

290
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,178
That bar!

291
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,648
He said he quit the job at that weird bar in just a day.

292
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,279
I saw it with my own two eyes.

293
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,049
They introduced him as a new bar boy.

294
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,619
Clearly, he knew what he was doing.

295
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:11,489
Besides, you two were together at the time.

296
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,729
If I were you, I wouldn't even want to see him and would move my store.

297
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,560
I can't believe you're still friendly with him.

298
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,658
- At this rate, you'll sleep with... - Gosh, I heard you. Stop.

299
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,530
That's enough. I heard you.

300
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,938
Gosh. Why would I sleep with him?

301
00:28:22,939 --> 00:28:24,969
Come to your senses, friend.

302
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:27,039
Okay. I know why you're worried.

303
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,740
You don't have to tell me. I know.

304
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,850
Here's your coffee.

305
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:40,050
My gosh. This is a lot.

306
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:43,260
- Will this be enough for everyone? - Yes, of course.

307
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,320
One moment, please.

308
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,929
Okay. Could you hold this for me?

309
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,040
- I'll leave it like this. - Sure.

310
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:02,879
(For Kang Min)

311
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:07,108
They're heavy. Can you carry them by yourself?

312
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:09,580
Yes, of course. Easy-peasy.

313
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,878
Thanks for these. I'll be off, then.

314
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,179
- Bye. - Bye.

315
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:23,959
Since when were you and Mr. Lee Kang Min so close?

316
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:26,168
Sorry?

317
00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:28,230
Are you going to keep calling him by his first name?

318
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,399
You could just call him Mr. Lee Kang Min.

319
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,709
Did that bother you, my dear Do Ha?

320
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,419
My dear Do Ha. I guess that hurt your feelings.

321
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:51,520
You should've just told me.

322
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:57,929
Well, it's just that...

323
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,770
You can't spring this on me here.

324
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:07,770
Why don't you call me "my dear Sol Hee" too?

325
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:13,649
My dear Sol Hee.

326
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:22,250
Yes, my dear Do Ha.

327
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,330
My dear Do Ha.

328
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
My dear Sol Hee.

329
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:40,570
It wasn't even one of our cases.

330
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:42,909
You did such a great job.

331
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:45,480
Thanks to you, we solved a five-year-old cold case.

332
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,108
The higher-ups are discussing a special promotion for Kang Min.

333
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:51,550
I think it's happening for sure. Applause!

334
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:54,320
- Go, Kang Min! - Way to go!

335
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,359
Good for you.

336
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,330
What's going on?

337
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,490
Hey, what's that?

338
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,929
The owner of the tarot café told me to take these for everyone.

339
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,698
- Free coffee? - Thank you.

340
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:10,740
- Thanks for the coffee. - Thank you.

341
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,668
Oh, wait! This one is...

342
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:17,040
It's Kang Min's.

343
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:18,938
Thanks for the coffee.

344
00:31:18,939 --> 00:31:20,279
- Enjoy. - Can I take this?

345
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,379
(For Kang Min)

346
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,850
Gosh.

347
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,019
She can't meet me because her job is keeping her too busy.

348
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,760
It makes no sense to me.

349
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:38,730
Maybe that was her way of sternly rejecting you.

350
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:40,129
Exactly.

351
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:43,600
You see, I've never had anyone...

352
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,168
who "sternly rejected" me.

353
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,570
In fact, I've never been rejected by anyone.

354
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,579
I want to know the real reason she is rejecting me.

355
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,678
I'm confident that I can convince her...

356
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,209
once I find out why she's rejecting me.

357
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:56,850
I see.

358
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,849
Well, we don't want to waste time,

359
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,159
so the first question should be if she rejected you because...

360
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,560
- she found you unattractive. - Right.

361
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:08,659
I'm confident that she'll say no.

362
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Okay.

363
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,869
Then where shall we meet?

364
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,869
Well...

365
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,909
Syaon has a livestream scheduled for this evening.

366
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,679
We'll be done before 7pm, right?

367
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:26,780
What? 7pm?

368
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,349
Hey, we'll be done way before that. Don't worry.

369
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,350
Really?

370
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,708
We should order something to drink first.

371
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:04,249
- Excuse me. - No, I'm good.

372
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,080
I have to leave shortly anyway.

373
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,719
Okay.

374
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:12,320
I appreciate you showing your interest in me,

375
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,628
but as I mentioned the other day...

376
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:15,760
Is it because...

377
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,100
you don't like me?

378
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,070
You don't find me attractive at all as a man?

379
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,869
My gosh, it's not like that.

380
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,409
Gosh, you.

381
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,148
Then stop listing absurd excuses and just tell me the real reason.

382
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:39,350
Why are you rejecting me? Are you just shy?

383
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,290
- Is that it? - Well...

384
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:47,230
The thing is, I'm swamped with work.

385
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,030
You're cute.

386
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:53,928
All right. If you're that busy,

387
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:55,769
we'll hang out from time to time. I'll work around your schedule.

388
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,199
There's a reason I must work very hard.

389
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:01,340
I have a daughter.

390
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:04,409
- You have what? - A daughter.

391
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,250
Oh, it is true.

392
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,909
Well, I mean...

393
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,349
But you're not married.

394
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,619
That's right. I'm a single mother.

395
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:16,819
That's okay.

396
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,059
Your daughter must be very pretty if she takes after you.

397
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,560
She takes after her father.

398
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,829
Oh, no. She doesn't take after her mother.

399
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,929
Gosh.

400
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,499
It doesn't matter.

401
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,928
It's not like I know that guy.

402
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,769
Anyway, how did you end up getting pregnant?

403
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:35,209
I go clubbing every weekend.

404
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,278
- What? - I met him at the club...

405
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:38,710
and had a one-night stand.

406
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:40,409
You had what?

407
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:44,219
Goodness. It really is true.

408
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,920
Okay, fine.

409
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,818
You've got a nice body and a pretty face,

410
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,289
so I didn't think you'd be naive.

411
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,489
It's all right.

412
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,029
I like that you're honest.

413
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,428
I got a boob job.

414
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,559
And I underwent full-face plastic surgery.

415
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,799
Nothing you see here is natural.

416
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:00,129
It's hard as a rock.

417
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,528
I can't move the tip of my nose. It hurts so much.

418
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:04,939
You need money and patience to undergo plastic surgery,

419
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,039
so I see it as a way of making an effort.

420
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,709
And how you look now is what matters.

421
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,338
You're pretty. Your nose looks natural too.

422
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:12,079
Also, I rarely shower.

423
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,949
To be honest, I didn't take a shower today either.

424
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:17,318
My gosh. Is this dandruff? Oh, no.

425
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:20,349
I bet you thought they were glitter. So did I. But it's dandruff. Oh, no.

426
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,790
You know what? I don't care anymore.

427
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:23,118
My gosh. I have dandruff too!

428
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,988
That's why I mainly wear white.

429
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,488
The thing is, I don't want people to know that I rarely shower.

430
00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:30,829
That's why I always wear such a thick layer of foundation.

431
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,629
I think it's about 5mm today. Shall I scrape it off and see?

432
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,868
And I wear insoles. They add about 5cm to my height.

433
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:36,439
I'm so bad at using chopsticks.

434
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,469
You don't need to know how to use chopsticks to eat

435
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,670
You know?

436
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:47,150
You see,

437
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,080
it's all a lie.

438
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:54,589
What?

439
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,860
I just don't like you, jerk.

440
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,119
What?

441
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:03,129
Sol Hee, what is going on here?

442
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,528
I didn't want to cause trouble...

443
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,199
because you're the CEO's son.

444
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,199
I hope that got the message across.

445
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:18,909
It's so hard to earn a living, isn't it?

446
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,250
Goodness.

447
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,278
Min Jae. Wait.

448
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:25,419
Sol Hee, what is going on?

449
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,749
Min Jae. Are you mad at me because of my joke about chopsticks?

450
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,819
Wait, Min Jae.

451
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,500
Ms. Hunter.

452
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,169
What just happened?

453
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,830
Call Kassandra.

454
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:45,369
Tell her to give the client a full refund...

455
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:48,409
along with the penalty for breach of contract.

456
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:50,380
A full refund?

457
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:04,159
(Hakcheon Missing Persons Case Suspect's Recent Activities)

458
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,460
It's all my fault.

459
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,159
He asked me...

460
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,559
to help him meet you.

461
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,069
But I said no.

462
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,440
Sol Hee.

463
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:27,810
My dear Sol Hee.

464
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,920
Do Ha.

465
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,150
What should I do?

466
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:36,520
What's wrong? Did something happen?

467
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,460
I can no longer detect lies.

468
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,739
I've been thinking that it was weird.

469
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:52,698
Even when I was sure that someone was lying,

470
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:54,139
it sounded like they were being truthful.

471
00:37:55,509 --> 00:37:57,239
I should've known when I noticed it.

472
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,880
Is this the first time?

473
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,750
It's never happened before?

474
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,779
No, never.

475
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,150
The doctor said...

476
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:12,520
the sound of the explosion might have damaged your eardrums.

477
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,600
The doctor said it'd naturally heal with time.

478
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,658
And you didn't mention anything about it,

479
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:20,969
so I thought it'd be okay.

480
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,169
It doesn't look good. Let's go see a doctor.

481
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,239
No.

482
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,508
When I was little, my dad took me...

483
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:30,810
to every ENT doctor in the country,

484
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,279
but none of them could tell me what was wrong with my ears.

485
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,449
It's not something they can figure out by examining my ears.

486
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:41,989
Right, you must feel confused and lost.

487
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:45,020
Something that was so natural to you...

488
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,429
suddenly disappeared.

489
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:50,929
But maybe...

490
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:53,170
there's a good side to this.

491
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,299
Like what?

492
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,569
Now, you can make new friends.

493
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:07,210
And you don't have to hear lies in crowded places anymore.

494
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,880
Also, you can just appreciate it...

495
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,949
when others compliment you.

496
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,459
Maybe, if things were always that way.

497
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,659
But I can't do that.

498
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:22,729
I feel like I'm constantly being deceived,

499
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,259
and I suspect everyone around me.

500
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,630
It's driving me nuts.

501
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:33,069
Even your sulky pout is so cute.

502
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,980
That sounds like a lie too.

503
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,049
You said you knew I never lied.

504
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,549
You can't suspect me too.

505
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,319
My ability might suddenly come back,

506
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,250
so lie to me once a day.

507
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:50,860
Lie to you?

508
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:52,319
About what?

509
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,029
When you said I was pretty, I could tell you really meant it.

510
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,569
Try saying, "Sol Hee, you're ugly."

511
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,698
Gosh, no. I don't want to.

512
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:05,798
How could I say that?

513
00:40:05,799 --> 00:40:07,908
Come on. I know it's a lie.

514
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:08,969
It's okay. Just say it.

515
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:18,819
Sol Hee.

516
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:24,759
You're pretty.

517
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:26,888
No!

518
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:29,129
- It's okay. Say it just once. - I really can't do it.

519
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,999
- "You're ugly." Say it just once. - I can't.

520
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,629
Come on! Just do it. Say just once that I'm ugly.

521
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,699
You're ugly.

522
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:43,069
Sorry.

523
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,979
I'm offended.

524
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,679
Come on. You know it's a lie.

525
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,350
Yes, I know.

526
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,290
I'm just not used to this yet.

527
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:58,520
Hey, Sol Hee.

528
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,989
Even if the ability never comes back,

529
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:05,529
wouldn't it be nice to live a normal life?

530
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,799
You wanted to live like that too.

531
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,880
You know, the VIP cases...

532
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,989
Let's stop accepting new requests.

533
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,589
- What? - What?

534
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,629
But not for good, right?

535
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,428
You're just taking a short break because...

536
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:37,100
you're having trouble channelling the spirit, right?

537
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:43,569
To tell you the truth, I can't channel the spirit of truth.

538
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,239
What?

539
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,968
The spirit wasn't the reason...

540
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,909
I could detect lies.

541
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,279
It was all my ears.

542
00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:56,718
I have something like a lie detector in here,

543
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,520
but it broke.

544
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,259
Okay.

545
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,360
I mean, you're very different from most shamans.

546
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,829
You never perform any shamanic rituals and don't even pray.

547
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,330
You only respond to lies.

548
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:18,068
Also, I've never once heard you say...

549
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,810
that you could see the spirit. You always said you could hear it.

550
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:23,539
- Oh, that's true. - Hey. If you knew that,

551
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,838
how come you never said anything?

552
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:27,850
Well, I just thought you probably had your reason.

553
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,380
I mean,

554
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:32,919
rather than saying you have a lie detector in your ears,

555
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,049
saying that you're a shaman who serves the spirit of truth...

556
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:41,730
would be easier because people would be more likely to believe it.

557
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:44,258
My gosh, you're scaring me here.

558
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:46,869
What? So I'm the only one who had no idea?

559
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:51,698
Why don't we stop accepting VIP clients...

560
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,339
and just run the tarot café?

561
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:56,980
We can do that, but our numbers will drop significantly.

562
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,250
You'll only get paid your hourly wages.

563
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:04,419
For this month, you'll get your normal pay.

564
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,819
Think about it and let me know.

565
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,389
I'm in.

566
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,359
I'm done thinking. What about you?

567
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,089
I'm in too. I'm a loyal employee.

568
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,290
Of course, I should stay.

569
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:18,799
Then lunch is on me.

570
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,600
Then how about a barbecue?

571
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,799
A barbecue? Nice, let's have some beef!

572
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:26,170
Let's go.

573
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,080
We're ready.

574
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,278
You're sure my face will be blurred, right?

575
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:37,819
Yes, of course.

576
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:40,249
You agreed to be on the show on that condition.

577
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,889
Please don't forget to blur my face.

578
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,020
I don't want this to affect my family in any way.

579
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,520
Put your worries to rest.

580
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,259
I'm hungry.

581
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:52,000
Let's have some gimbap before we get started.

582
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,638
If you don't mind,

583
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:01,469
I'll make some spicy noodles quickly.

584
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,008
Gimbap won't be enough to fill you up.

585
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:05,380
That dish you made for us the other day?

586
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,580
My gosh. We'd love that.

587
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,678
- I told you about the noodles. - You said it was good.

588
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:11,119
Thank you so much.

589
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,330
(Idol Group Audition)

590
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:35,270
- Excuse me. - Yes.

591
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:41,979
You know, all the ugly scandals surrounding J Entertainment.

592
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,679
I don't like that your name keeps being brought up.

593
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,589
Aren't you struggling without an agent and a management team?

594
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,519
If you decide to work with us,

595
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,920
we'll provide the best service in the industry.

596
00:44:54,529 --> 00:44:55,759
I'll think about it.

597
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:01,670
Don't you need a composer?

598
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:03,869
Why would you suddenly ask about composers?

599
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,369
You know I'm pretty close to Kim Do Ha, don't you?

600
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:10,040
You'll arrange a meeting with him?

601
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,810
How are you?

602
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,319
You had to leave Yeonseo-dong because of me.

603
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:23,960
I apologize again for that.

604
00:45:24,759 --> 00:45:25,819
I'm really sorry.

605
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,290
No, I should apologize.

606
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,799
Why should you?

607
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,960
You treated me so well,

608
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,830
and I got the wrong idea about you.

609
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:38,568
Thanks to your help,

610
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,610
my brother recovered and came home.

611
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,139
Thank you.

612
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,339
What does he do these days?

613
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:47,779
I'd like to see him.

614
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,750
Ten grand per night?

615
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:55,020
That's too expensive.

616
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:57,460
But take a look.

617
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:00,929
You have a view of the Eiffel Tower.

618
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,929
I thought...

619
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,600
I'd like to visit the US.

620
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:10,500
The US?

621
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:13,170
The US is nice too.

622
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:15,170
I had the Korean flag...

623
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:17,940
put up in a San Francisco hotel for a month.

624
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:19,440
The Korean flag?

625
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,179
This hotel puts up a flag that represents certain guests.

626
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:27,420
Do you know what kind of guests they hang the flags for?

627
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:32,360
Lend me your ear.

628
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,330
The guest who spends the most that day.

629
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,830
Good for you.

630
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,440
Shall we look up some videos...

631
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,779
that recommend honeymoon destinations?

632
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,339
Yes.

633
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:55,679
Oh, dear.

634
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,750
I left my glasses in the car.

635
00:46:58,779 --> 00:47:00,250
(Honeymoon destinations)

636
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:06,860
(Mountains healed my pain of divorce)

637
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,299
Just a moment.

638
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,969
(Mountains healed my pain of divorce)

639
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:19,239
(Mountains healed my pain of divorce)

640
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:22,539
We visited him ten times...

641
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,210
and only then did he agree to film.

642
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:26,739
Oh, you like things like this?

643
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,879
Shall we go camping one day?

644
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,349
I once went camping in Iceland when I studied abroad...

645
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,579
Be quiet.

646
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,318
I didn't bring home much money,

647
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,659
but I thought I loved her more than enough.

648
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:39,360
I found out about her affair...

649
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:43,900
and realized she didn't need my love.

650
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:46,429
So we broke up.

651
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,069
The fact that...

652
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:51,169
a man can do nothing...

653
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,769
(Man in the mountain)

654
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:56,310
for the love of his life is a great torment.

655
00:48:03,549 --> 00:48:04,549
Let's see.

656
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:06,380
Nice.

657
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:11,119
Hey.

658
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,889
Tarot lady.

659
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,089
Will you read my fortune?

660
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,130
What?

661
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,469
You wouldn't have known,

662
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,739
but Oh Baek is my ex-boyfriend.

663
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,369
Oh, I see.

664
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:28,839
But...

665
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:32,110
we broke up when I caught him working at a shady bar.

666
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:35,250
While you were dating?

667
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:40,520
He said he only manned the till and that he quit...

668
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,150
as soon as he found out it was shady.

669
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,190
But what woman would believe that?

670
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:50,860
Right.

671
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:56,199
I guess I'm not a woman.

672
00:48:56,699 --> 00:48:58,500
I want to believe that.

673
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,838
You said the guy I met on the blind date was trash.

674
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:09,009
Will you read my fortune again?

675
00:49:10,049 --> 00:49:12,019
- What? - I'll believe him...

676
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,719
if you tell me to.

677
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,719
Read my fortune.

678
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:19,920
Sorry.

679
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:21,960
I can't help you now.

680
00:49:22,529 --> 00:49:23,758
Why not?

681
00:49:23,759 --> 00:49:25,460
I really want to help you,

682
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:27,429
but...

683
00:49:30,569 --> 00:49:33,269
Is it that hard?

684
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,368
You could just tell me to believe him.

685
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:39,710
That's what I came here hoping you'd say.

686
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:42,449
I...

687
00:50:03,429 --> 00:50:04,569
I need to wake up.

688
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:40,838
- Hi. - Where are you?

689
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:41,869
Are you in Yeonseo-dong?

690
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,810
Yes. Why?

691
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,980
Let's meet up.

692
00:50:45,339 --> 00:50:47,810
I can't come over to your place.

693
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:49,380
Shall we meet there?

694
00:50:57,489 --> 00:50:59,389
Why do we never have any customers?

695
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,488
I think...

696
00:51:03,489 --> 00:51:06,429
we should put up a sign outside that says...

697
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:09,270
"Americano takeout three dollars."

698
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:10,869
That'll bring in some people.

699
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,868
As if that would work. Look at the interior.

700
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:16,009
That's why we need a new look.

701
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:19,980
We need to be more friendly to the customers too.

702
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,908
Watch how I serve the customer...

703
00:51:22,909 --> 00:51:24,179
that just came in.

704
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,589
Welcome, dear customer.

705
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,420
Hi.

706
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:35,060
Why are you here?

707
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:37,259
I'm meeting Do Ha here.

708
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,100
Don't get me wrong.

709
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,069
I moved on,

710
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,230
and it's about work.

711
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,770
Sol Hee.

712
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:49,969
Do Ha.

713
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:51,880
You got here first.

714
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,750
She moved on? She hasn't.

715
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:57,819
She could have.

716
00:51:58,750 --> 00:51:59,779
Stay cool.

717
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,818
Take a seat over there.

718
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,219
Would you like a coffee?

719
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,619
- Yes, please. - Sure.

720
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:16,199
How have you been?

721
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,639
I've been well. Why did you want to see me?

722
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,069
I met with an agency CEO yesterday.

723
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:24,080
He wanted to sign me,

724
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:25,980
so I said I'd recommend someone.

725
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,449
Would you like to meet him?

726
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:32,880
Just like that?

727
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,919
Deuk Chan did everything for you until now,

728
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,489
but things have changed.

729
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,460
You have no connections at all.

730
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:44,960
Thanks.

731
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,170
But I have a plan of my own.

732
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:49,730
What's that?

733
00:52:49,869 --> 00:52:51,600
There are people I'd like to work with.

734
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,469
You'll produce a group?

735
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:56,909
It's not like that.

736
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,080
I'll tell you when I've worked things out.

737
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:02,810
Are we rivals, then?

738
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:07,719
That sounds a bit corny, doesn't it?

739
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:33,779
I'll walk you to your car.

740
00:53:33,909 --> 00:53:35,810
You could be in danger, like last time.

741
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:39,849
Who are you?

742
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,150
I'm Syaon's Bodyguard.

743
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:44,218
I know that.

744
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:47,589
But I want to know the name your parents gave you.

745
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:49,929
What for?

746
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,399
You don't want to tell me?

747
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,000
No, I don't mind.

748
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,670
My name is Baek Chi Hoon.

749
00:53:58,369 --> 00:53:59,699
Put in your number.

750
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:01,069
What number?

751
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,509
Your phone number. Would I need you account number?

752
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,639
Oh, okay.

753
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:09,980
Thank you.

754
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,150
Here you go.

755
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:20,690
Are you interested in being my actual bodyguard?

756
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,630
You'll have to quit working here, then.

757
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:40,339
Can you do a reading for today?

758
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,750
Pay ten dollars in advance.

759
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,589
Do you need a cash receipt?

760
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,960
No.

761
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,560
Let's see.

762
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:56,830
Pick a card.

763
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,269
The one at the end.

764
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,310
This one?

765
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,778
Gosh. You need to go on a date today.

766
00:55:14,779 --> 00:55:18,279
This card signifies a deepening love.

767
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:21,020
No way. Shall we head out?

768
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,020
I can't. I have to work.

769
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,960
Go ahead. We have zero customers.

770
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,730
Yes, let's. I picked a great card.

771
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,600
Okay, then.

772
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,540
See you.

773
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,440
Have fun!

774
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,319
I'm not...

775
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:58,790
really needed here, am I?

776
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,230
We don't have many customers,

777
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:04,330
and it would be better for Ms. Hunter...

778
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,560
if she had less wages to pay, right?

779
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,669
If you were to say you quit, she'd be upset.

780
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,069
Would she?

781
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:13,400
What should I do?

782
00:56:14,569 --> 00:56:17,679
Why? Did you get a nice job offer?

783
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,779
Syaon asked me...

784
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,610
to work with her.

785
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:31,588
The host will enter soon. When they do,

786
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:33,689
we'd be very grateful if you'd welcome them...

787
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,359
with loud applause.

788
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,500
I'll let you be, then.

789
00:56:39,659 --> 00:56:41,429
I thought you never saw a play.

790
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:42,928
How did you know?

791
00:56:42,929 --> 00:56:45,270
All the dialogue would sound like a lie.

792
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,568
- Am I wrong? - You're right.

793
00:56:49,569 --> 00:56:51,239
Please give a warm hand.

794
00:56:51,339 --> 00:56:54,709
Here come the bride and groom.

795
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,250
How lovely.

796
00:56:57,049 --> 00:57:00,319
Here we have the main characters.

797
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:04,618
What kind of joke is this?

798
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:06,689
The wedding rings...

799
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,629
are going on both their ring fingers.

800
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,158
Were you startled?

801
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:13,528
Do you smell it? I apologize.

802
00:57:13,529 --> 00:57:15,770
- Let's... - Freeze!

803
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,869
I'm so sorry.

804
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:20,909
Unfreeze!

805
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,060
- Thank you. - Thank you.

806
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:52,369
I'd never been to an actual play.

807
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:56,009
I'd been to watch one of my friends put up in university,

808
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,679
but everything sounded like a lie,

809
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,709
so I never went to one since.

810
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,909
It was so much fun.

811
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:03,980
Let's go to a musical next time,

812
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,719
and then see standing comics.

813
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,719
Do Ha.

814
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,259
When did you arrange all this?

815
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:15,790
To be honest, I talked it out with Kassandra yesterday.

816
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:19,299
You asked me to lie to you once a day.

817
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:23,100
It was cute, seeing you get duped for the first time.

818
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,799
Let's get something to eat.

819
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,639
Okay. What do you want?

820
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:30,710
Pork belly?

821
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:32,540
Pork belly?

822
00:58:33,739 --> 00:58:34,810
Anything else?

823
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:36,980
Tteokbokki.

824
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,150
We had that yesterday.

825
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,719
Then...

826
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:44,389
Pasta? Or steak?

827
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:47,520
Right? That's what I've been craving today.

828
00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:48,790
Okay, then.

829
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:52,658
I think we should go.

830
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:54,000
We're the only ones left.

831
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:56,630
- We are. Let's go. - Yes, let's go.

832
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:05,579
(Navigation)

833
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,479
(Input destination)

834
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,150
(Steak)

835
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,388
Do Ha, they say this is a nice place.

836
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:15,389
Shall we go there?

837
00:59:17,049 --> 00:59:19,560
Sol Hee, the thing is...

838
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:22,190
I'm really sorry,

839
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,360
but I have to go home.

840
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,330
I just remembered I had to work on something.

841
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:30,799
Do you?

842
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,568
Is it urgent?

843
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,610
It's not urgent,

844
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:36,770
but it's getting to me.

845
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:42,810
I'm sorry I kept you from your work.

846
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,719
Sorry. Let's eat out tomorrow.

847
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:49,819
Okay.

848
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:08,739
Bye.

849
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:10,869
Bye.

850
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,299
Okay, let's do this.

851
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:38,039
Thinly slice the mushrooms.

852
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,699
Slice the mushrooms.

853
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:42,838
Dice the onion and garlic.

854
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:44,110
Dice them well.

855
01:00:44,779 --> 01:00:47,310
Snap the ends off the asparagus.

856
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,350
Don't add too much.

857
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:56,048
This much is 100g.

858
01:00:56,049 --> 01:00:57,250
It cooks in seven minutes.

859
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:59,619
We'll crush one.

860
01:00:59,719 --> 01:01:02,330
Crush it, then chop it up.

861
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:13,138
(Save some noodle broth.)

862
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:15,210
Add some noodle broth.

863
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,380
The noodle broth isn't added now?

864
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:24,109
- The parsley. - Parsley.

865
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,219
Chop it up.

866
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:30,219
Sprinkle it on top.

867
01:01:34,259 --> 01:01:35,489
This is parsley?

868
01:01:36,429 --> 01:01:38,029
What did I just add?

869
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:48,270
What kind of date ends without dinner?

870
01:01:55,509 --> 01:01:57,980
Is someone downstairs cooking something nice?

871
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,949
I'm starving.

872
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:09,560
I'm starving to death.

873
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,969
Come over for dinner.

874
01:02:17,969 --> 01:02:18,969
What?

875
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:29,049
The smell was coming from here.

876
01:02:36,589 --> 01:02:37,719
What's all this?

877
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:40,989
Sorry.

878
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:42,960
I lied to surprise you.

879
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:44,830
Are you angry?

880
01:02:46,699 --> 01:02:48,330
Did you cook all this?

881
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,330
Yes.

882
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,739
I'm figuring out the positives...

883
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:54,739
of you not hearing lies.

884
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,210
- Let's eat. - Okay.

885
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,130
- Try it. - Okay.

886
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:19,900
It looks nice.

887
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:33,409
It's good.

888
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:37,679
Are you lying?

889
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:41,179
No. Try it yourself, and you'll know.

890
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:43,750
Here.

891
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,489
How is it?

892
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:54,029
- It's good. - Isn't it? It's nice.

893
01:03:54,259 --> 01:03:56,028
- Why is it nice? - Didn't you cook it?

894
01:03:56,029 --> 01:03:57,400
I did try hard,

895
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,369
but I didn't think it would be nice.

896
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:01,509
- It's lovely. - Good.

897
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:02,839
Try the steak too.

898
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:04,170
- Okay. - I put in some work.

899
01:04:09,009 --> 01:04:10,609
- It's well-cooked. - Gosh.

900
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:12,250
- What is this? - I don't know.

901
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:17,689
At a glance, it might look like a rock.

902
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:18,859
I can't cut mine.

903
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:19,860
Eat this piece.

904
01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:25,730
It's good.

905
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:27,230
It tastes nicer than it looks.

906
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:30,900
Cheers.

907
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:46,580
That actress is so pretty.

908
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,589
Do Ha. Who is prettier?

909
01:04:50,449 --> 01:04:52,119
Why would you even ask?

910
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:54,119
You're prettier, of course.

911
01:04:56,429 --> 01:04:58,330
It's nice that it sounds true.

912
01:05:00,299 --> 01:05:01,330
It is true.

913
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:10,639
Do Ha.

914
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,610
Yes?

915
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:14,880
I think...

916
01:05:17,909 --> 01:05:20,750
I'll be okay even if I can't hear lies.

917
01:05:25,219 --> 01:05:26,290
I mean it.

918
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:14,569
(My Lovely Liar)

919
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,069
When I couldn't hear the lies,

920
01:06:47,869 --> 01:06:49,270
I felt so afraid.

921
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:51,709
See if I'm telling the truth.

922
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:52,739
I love you.

923
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:54,850
Seung Ju.

924
01:06:55,509 --> 01:06:58,420
I'm sorry to make you live as Do Ha.

925
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,818
Hello. I'm Sol Hee's boyfriend Kim Do Ha.

926
01:07:01,819 --> 01:07:02,849
- Like this. - Yes.

927
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:04,419
I need to see your mom.

928
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,789
I'll announce the winner of the Best Composer Award.

929
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,020
The winner is...

930
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:10,690
Will you marry me?
