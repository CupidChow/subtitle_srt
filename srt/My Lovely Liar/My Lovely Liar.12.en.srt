Kang Min. Where are you now?

15
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,210
No!

16
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:41,889
Let go!

17
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,319
I'm going to kill that jerk!

18
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,190

(Interview Recording Room)

20
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,710
Look. This is the weapon you used, correct?

21
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,680
Yes. I did it. You got me.

22
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:05,250
So lock me up now.

23
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,179
I need to get locked up first...

24
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,918
so I can get released quickly and kill that jerk.

25
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,579
Who said you could get released quickly?

26
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,059
You stabbed an innocent guy, and now he's hospitalized unconscious.

27
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,690
It's all because of Kim Seung Ju.

28
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:21,629
Is he dead?

29
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:24,570
He's in surgery.

30
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,330
We don't know yet.

31
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,280
When the elevator doors opened, I saw a man lying down on the floor.

32
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,510
When Choi Eom Ho saw me,

33
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,010
he charged at me with a knife.

34
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,379
Ms. Mok.

35
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,749
After witnessing their scuffle,

36
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,220
did you come back inside and call 911?

37
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:48,660
Yes.

38
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:04,770
You should have waited inside after calling the police.

39
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:07,039
Why were you so reckless, coming out of the house?

40
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,510
How could I just wait at home?

41
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,549
- I wanted to help him. - He had a knife.

42
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,020
Hey, Mr. Kim.

43
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,660
You said he would only use the knife on you.

44
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,489
A man was stabbed and transported to a hospital.

45
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,189
And her life was in danger too.

46
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,059
How will you explain this then?

47
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,699
Stop it, Kang Min. Why are you doing this? He's a victim too.

48
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,999
How is he a victim?

49
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,070
He doesn't have a scratch on him.

50
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,840
You're the only one who wasn't hurt.

51
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:40,639
Everyone around you was in harm's way.

52
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,280
But look at you. You're fine.

53
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,280

56

How's your brother?

57
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,760
Are you really him?

58
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:32,890
Kim Seung Ju?

59
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:36,929
Yes.

60
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,640
Is it true that...

61
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,869
you murdered a girl?

62
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:47,309
No.

63
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,140
Then why did that man do this to my brother?

64
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,179
Why did he stab my brother?

65
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,049
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,390
That's all...

67
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:06,960
I can say.

68
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:08,760
It's all my fault.

69
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,770
My brother asked me for a favour.

70
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,270
He wanted to meet you.

71
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,270
But I said no.

72
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,809
If I had just said yes...

73
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,410
Gosh.

74
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,720
The surgery went well.

75
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,689
Luckily, his vital point wasn't damaged. So he'll live.

76
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,729
He will wake up once the anaesthesia wears off.

77
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:42,400
Thank you.

78
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,970
Thank you!

79
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,720
That's really good news.

80
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,890
When Young Jae said it was all his fault,

81
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,619
my heart sank...

82
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,160
because I knew how guilty he must have felt.

83
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:18,200
I almost ruined...

84
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,799
both of their lives.

85
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,570
Why are you blaming yourself now?

86
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,340
The one who stabbed him is at fault.

87
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,410
But he carried that knife because of me.

88
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:35,350
Everything Mr. Lee said earlier was true.

89
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,420
Everyone but me...

90
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
had something awful happen to them.

91
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:42,989
Don't count yourself out.

92
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,690
This must be the hardest on you.

93
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:54,399
I should go to the recovery room.

94
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:56,040
I'll go with you.

95
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,570
Are you hurt?

96
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,379
I sprained my ankle slightly when I fell earlier.

97
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,420
What?

98
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,790
That jerk took all of my money and ditched me.

99
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,658
I need to pay the loan interest and rent for the restaurant.

100
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,499
I've been using credit cards to pay them.

101

I didn't want to ask you.

102
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,729
But can you help me one last time?

103
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:28,800
Isn't that what you said every single time you came to me?

104
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,669
I want to stop falling for your lies.

105
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,670
I'm serious.

106
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:35,139
Once I close down the restaurant, I'll just work here for paychecks.

107
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,810
I will work diligently. I mean it.

108
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:41,180
Is there a designated position for you in the company?

109
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,720

Okay, fine.

186
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,529
Then I can't be certain to recommend you to him.

187
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,060
I got it. Gosh.

188
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,470
Wait.

189
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:03,570
What?

190
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,479
Why would anyone want me to join their new group?

191
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,749
I'm old. And I'm not a new face either.

192
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,050
I think this happened so that I would come to my senses.

193
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,220
I should stop now.

194
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,460
Ethan.

195
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,999
Once you recover, I'll write a great song for you.

196
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:32,369
No.

197
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,330
I'm good.

198
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:37,200
Thank you for the offer.

199
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,019
Mr. Kim? You're Mr. Kim Do Ha, the songwriter, right?

200
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,149
You're Mr. Kim, right?

201
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:54,888
- Mr. Kim. - Are you Kim Seung Ju?

202
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,059
- Are you really him? - Mr. Kim.

203
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,689
- Mr. Kim. - Can you give us a comment?

204
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,959
- Are you him? - Are you Kim Seung Ju?

205
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,859
- Excuse me. Wait. - Can you answer our question?

206
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:04,329
Do Ha.

207
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,498
- Did you change your name? - Are you Kim Seung Ju?

208
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,499
- Answer our question. - A comment, please.

209
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,398
- Did you change your name? - A comment.

210
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,840
Yes. I'm Kim Do Ha.

211
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,408
Did you hide who you were because you were a murder suspect?

212
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,238
Will you continue to work as a songwriter?

213
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:19,648
Did Syaon or Mr. Jo Deuk Chan...

214
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,549
know about your past and help you hide?

215
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,479
Because I was a murder suspect,

216
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:26,089
I did hide my identity.

217
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,850
Did you kill Choi Eom Ji?

218
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:29,859
No.

219
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:31,789
I didn't kill her.

220
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,228
If you didn't do anything wrong,

221
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:34,729
why did you hide all these years?

222
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,029
Because no one believed me.

223
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,999
Just like now.

224
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:44,540
Your fans who loved your music are very shocked.

225
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,039
Is there anything you would like to say?

226
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,070
You can still...

227
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:49,379
like my music.

228
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,210
I will do my best...

229
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,950
to reveal the truth.

230
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,300
Why did you come to the hospital?

231
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,629
You hurt your ankle.

232
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,379
Are you all right?

233
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,980
What about you? Are you okay?

234
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,020
You told everything to the reporters.

235
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:31,949
Are you okay?

236
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:36,520
I only told the truth.

237
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:39,929
So you're not okay.

238
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,669
When I went down to Hakcheon yesterday,

239
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:53,709
I wanted to know who buried her there,

240
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,039
who killed her,

241
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,409
and why the culprit killed her.

242
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,080
These questions came to my mind.

243
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,550
But now,

244
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,020
I want to catch the culprit.

245
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,959
I know where you're coming from. But it's too dangerous.

246
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,059
We should wait for the time being.

247
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,060
No.

248
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:21,270
A man almost died because of me.

249
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,770
I hurt the people around me.

250
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,810
I don't want to wait any longer for things to get better.

251
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,250
I'm sure there's more I can do.

252
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,520
I'll find the culprit.

253
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,448
- Hello. - Hello.

254
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:43,389
- The news article about... - Yes.

255
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,529
No. The allegation in the article isn't true.

256
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,530
Okay.

257
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:48,899
No, it's not true.

258
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,829
I thought your son was in Germany.

259
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,230
You said you were certain she committed suicide.

260
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,398
They are criticizing me because of you.

261
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:58,469
I'm sorry.

262
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,608
But my son isn't the culprit.

263
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:04,179
What people hate the most is lying.

264
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,179
You should have been honest from the get-go.

265
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,909
Or you shouldn't have let him get caught.

266
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,678
I will do my best to prove his innocence...

267
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,649
Here's the best thing you can do right now.

268
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,090
Withdraw from the election.

269
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:18,990
You know how hard I worked to get this far.

270
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:22,699
Even if I lose, I would like to finish the election.

271
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,030
You must be mistaken.

272
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,868
Yes. Losing an election is nothing...

273
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:30,799
for politicians in the long run.

274
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,969
But here's the problem.

275
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:35,310
You don't even have...

276
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,310
the opportunity to lose now.

00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:42,980

Do Ha.

284
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,709
Help me just this once.

285
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,080
My business partner betrayed me.

286
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,449
My debt is growing even as I speak.

287
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,719
If you don't help me, I have no choice but to jump into the river.

288
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,019
Think about the time when I helped you in the past.

289
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,659
So, can't you please help me just once more?

290
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,790
Back then, it wasn't an easy decision for me either.

291
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:04,030
I felt bad for Eom Ji.

292
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,198
Of course, I feel bad for you too. I feel bad for everyone involved.

293
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:12,409
But Eom Ji was in such a pitiful situation.

294
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:15,340
Her dad took all her money and beat her up.

295
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,408
What?

296
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,378
I'm not saying you did it.

297
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:20,709
I'm talking about Eom Ji's dad.

298
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,949
But her dad rarely came home.

299
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,320
Right.

300
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:29,990
He came home from time to time and turned the house upside down.

301
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,629
Hey, don't tell me you didn't know?

302
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,878
- Eom Ji. - Why are you here so early?

303
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,679
I rushed here because I wanted to see you.

304
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,879
Let's eat these.

305
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,649
Let's go somewhere else.

306
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:02,689
Hey, did you cry?

307
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,929
- Let me see your face. - No, I...

308
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:08,189
Don't lie. You did cry.

309
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,500
Something must've happened.

310
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,209
I missed you too much.

311
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,449
Oh, I guess she was too embarrassed to tell you.

312
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,490
She told me everything.

313
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:37,689
Anyway,

314
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:40,029
even if Eom Ji hadn't died that day,

315
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,060
that jerk would've beaten her up to death eventually.

316
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,000
That man...

317
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,169
Do you know where her dad is and what he's up to now?

318
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:50,639
Well...

319
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,209
If I tell you, then will you give me the money?

320
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:08,990
My gosh.

321
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,490
So, he really is the songwriter who wrote Syaon's songs?

322
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,959
How come you're not surprised?

323
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,599
Well, I had an inkling.

324
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,300
Then, did you have an inkling about that too?

325
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,040
The fact that he's a murderer?

326
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:24,770
He is not a murderer.

327
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,169
The spirit told me.

328
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,540
The spirit?

329
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,179
Oh, Ms. Hunter.

330
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,719
Then, how about revealing your true identity?

331
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,749
- What? - At the moment, people...

332
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,520
are boycotting Syaon's album, saying a murderer made it.

333
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,958
Why don't you come forward and say this? "I'm a liar hunter."

334
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:49,030
"Everything Kim Do Ha said is all true. The spirit told me."

335
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,399
Why don't you just say that?

336
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,929
I bet you want to help him clear his name.

337
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:55,429
- Gosh, that's... - No way!

338
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:59,739
No, never. I won't let that happen!

339
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,939
Hey! Why would you jeopardize your livelihood because of him?

340
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,908
If people found out what you could really do,

341
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:06,749
no one would lie in front of you.

342
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,819
Come to your senses, and just break up with him!

343
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,350
You said if the man loved me and was rich, the rest didn't matter.

344
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:14,688
He loves me and is well-off.

345
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:16,189
I said you should never date a criminal.

346
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:20,128
A murderer at that. Gosh, you've got some nerve.

347
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:22,799
He is not a murderer. Trust me, I know he's not!

348
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,559
You're the only one who knows that.

349
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,138
Everyone else would just think that you're a murderer's girlfriend.

350
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:30,698
Who cares what others think?

351
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:32,540
I know he's not a murderer, so why should I end it?

352
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:33,869
I won't break up with him!

353
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,750
Gosh, why is my business so slow?

354
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,688
It's because you step out so often.

355
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:51,118
There isn't a single customer. I can't stay there. I'm too bored.

356
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,629
Hey, it's so hot today...

357
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,359
- Hi. - "Hi?" How random.

358
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:00,899
Hey, did you hear about Kim Do Ha?

359
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,569
- Yes. - Isn't it crazy?

360
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,269
It must be the "past" he talked about that day.

361
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,009
I thought I was being mean, calling him a bully.

365
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,549
but I thought he kind of looked like a killer, so...

366

- What's with him? - Yes, don't be so doubtful.

539
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:15,130
That's right. I have.

540
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,139
So,

541
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:20,670
my son cannot be the culprit, no matter what.

542
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:22,509
You know that, right?

543
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,639
Yes, ma'am.

544
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:26,650
He's denying it,

545
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,109
and there is no solid evidence,

546
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,718
so it'll be hard to prove him guilty.

547
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,880
Don't worry.

548
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:35,089
All right, then. I'm counting on you.

(Assemblywoman Jung Yeon Mi)

550
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,759
Wait, but...

551
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,429
It's done.

552
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,699
I have nothing to worry about now.

553
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,940
I must be confident.

554
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:09,860
I suggest you drop out voluntarily.

555
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:11,759
Wouldn't that look better?

556
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,359
I won the nomination fair and square...

557
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,730
by winning the primary election.

558
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,698
As for the speculation about my son being a murderer,

559
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:21,428
nothing's been confirmed yet.

560
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:22,900
That's not important.

561
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,699
The public has already turned against you.

562
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:27,040
Just drop out.

563
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:29,069
I cannot do that.

564
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:32,178
If I just manage to clear my son's name,

565
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:34,249
I can win back all my existing supporters...

566
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,150
while also gaining sympathy votes.

567
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,178
Suffering for years due to false allegations...

568
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:40,850
and finally clearing his name.

569
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,290
It's certainly dramatic enough.

570
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,389
But that is...

571
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,428
only if your son isn't the culprit.

572
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:51,259
With Yoo Ji Eun, we won't win.

573
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,630
The other candidate is way more experienced than he is.

574
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,639
Please wait and see.

575
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,909
I'll be sure to turn this into a golden opportunity for us.

576
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,900
Gosh! Hey!

577
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:43,480
Hey! Go away!

578
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,759
Stay still.

579
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:14,080
- You're just going to walk away? - Leave.

580
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,850
Your daughter...

581
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:18,049
is seeing someone.

582
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:24,290
Are they getting married?

583
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,230
It's not that.

584
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:29,929
He's a murderer!

585
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,350
- Ms. Hunter. - Yes?

586
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:53,020
You don't have anything left for the day. You should go home.

587
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:56,089
No, if I'm at home, I end up thinking too much.

588
00:40:57,259 --> 00:40:59,589
I feel like you're thinking too much here as well.

589
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,400
No, whoever comes in starting now, I will do my best to serve them.

590
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,469
Welcome...

591
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,278
Hey, you faker.

592
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:19,579
Watch your mouth.

593
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,318
Hey, you are all in cahoots, aren't you, you swindlers?

594
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:25,520
What is the problem, sir?

595
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,190
Hey, since when were you and Kim Do Ha a thing?

596
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:31,758
I saw everything.

597
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:34,230
You two were being all lovey-dovey.

598
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,059
Darn it. What's going on?

599
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,360
Did he end up like that because of me?

600
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,270
They had to take an X-ray scan over a minor sprain.

601
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:44,999
- I'm really okay now. - That lady.

602
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,170
I can walk.

603
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,080
How could I stay still when you could die, Do Ha?

604
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:53,650
- "Do Ha?" Kim Do Ha? - Is that really liking someone?

605
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,909
Oh, my gosh.

606
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,318
Look at them.

607
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:00,350
I'm sorry...

608
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,690
for getting you swept up in this.

609
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,960
I didn't get swept up in this.

610
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:09,929
I'm just standing by a man I like.

611
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,399
Is that why you lied and said he was telling the truth?

612
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,270
No wonder. I knew none of it made sense.

613
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:21,540
Why don't you sit down first? We can continue while sitting.

614
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,179
Gosh.

615
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,310
- Do you want coffee? - Yes.

616
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,000
Back then, we were complete strangers,

617
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,199
and everything he said was the truth.

618
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,909
I knew you would say that.

619
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,540
But there is something I have. Do you want to see this?

620
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,239
Here.

621
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,250
What do you think this is?

622
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,619
I'm going to post this everywhere and make your business go under.

623
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:10,359
Who in the world would trust a shaman who is dating a murderer?

624
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,360
Don't you agree?

625
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:13,529
I see.

626
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,830
So, there was such an option.

627
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,699
That is a wonderful idea.

628
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,969
I really wanted to follow him,

629
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,299
but I promised to wait for him here while doing my job.

630
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:29,540
But if you do that, I will no longer have anything to do.

631
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:32,179
Then that would give me a good excuse to follow him.

632
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,580
What are you saying? Are you crazy?

633
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,048
Please upload that photo everywhere.

634
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:38,249
Darn it. Hey.

635
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,790
You're just playing it cool because you don't think I can, right?

636
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:41,949
What?

637
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:44,319

639

Darn it.

640
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,500
I deleted it, Ms. Hunter.

641
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:52,529
What?

642
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:01,669
Do you think I'm a fool?

643
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:03,838
Do you think I came all the way here...

644
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,079
with the photo saved on my phone only?

645
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,379
Come on. I uploaded it to the cloud,

646
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,079
sent it to my email, and have it backed up on an external hard drive.

647
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,279
What are you going to do? What will you do now?

648
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,619
You must really not trust that I'm a Liar Hunter,

649
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,159
seeing how you just spat out a bunch of lies.

650
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,630
Fine. Then,

651
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,830
just give me back my money.

652
00:44:30,029 --> 00:44:31,069
Why?

653
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,610
I did my job with integrity,

654
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,839
and the picture that you had to threaten me is gone now.

655
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,139
So why should I?

656
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:44,449
Also,

657
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,850
I would like to say one last thing as a Liar Hunter.

658
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:53,460
Mr. Kim Do Ha is not a murderer.

659
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,330
If he were to be one,

660
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:00,730
then you, Mr. Park Moo Jin,

661
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,770
would already be dead.

662

What do you need to ask me?

665
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,900
In the past, didn't Eom Ji's father,

666
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,569
Choi Yong Guk, work at your father's factory?

667
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:36,969
All the men in the neighbourhood have worked at my father's factory.

668
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:40,270
Can you ask your father...

669
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:42,810
if he knows where Choi Yong Guk is?

670
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:44,639
Hey, are you...

671
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,739
trying to get revenge?

672
00:45:48,009 --> 00:45:50,449
Are you trying to get back at me for doing that interview?

673
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,449
You even came to my workplace.

674
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:55,549
I don't have the energy to get revenge on you.

675
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,920
I'm just asking because I need to know.

676
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:05,799
A while back,

677
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,670
I saw Eom Ji's father at the bank...

678
00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:10,900
where Eom Ji used to work.

679
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,210
I found it weird that he was...

680
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:16,940
still visiting that place even after Eom Ji had died.

681
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,250

Ms. Hunter.

685
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,330
It'll be stipendiary.

686
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,000
That means she'll still pay you.

687
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,139
I see.

688
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:49,009
I don't think I can even work properly at the moment.

689
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,540
Whenever I deal with clients, I wonder what I'm even doing.

690
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:54,310
There is someone else who needs the help of my ability.

691
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,420
Okay. Good thinking.

692
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,420
Thanks.

693
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,219

694
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:04,520
if this is right.

695
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,928

696
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:09,929

Yes.

699
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,630
Then I'll be leaving first.

700
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,029

Did you listen to anything we were saying?

703
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:28,210
Do you think her powers have gotten weaker?

704
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:29,650
Isn't it strange?

705
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,080
Her powers have not weakened.

706
00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:35,650

00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:41,150
So this is where she works.

720

Our Sol Hee.

721
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,619
Gosh, she won't pick up.

722
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,130
Should we try waiting for her nearby?

723
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,758
They're temporarily closed, so she'll be resting for a few days.

724
00:48:51,759 --> 00:48:52,960
Where would we wait for her?

725
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,330
I was just saying, just in case.

726
00:48:56,429 --> 00:48:59,569
I know where she works now, so I'll come again next time.

727
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:03,469
Wait. Honey.

728

00:49:13,819 --> 00:49:15,650
I don't know what else to call you.

730
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,790
We're divorced.

731
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:22,190
We haven't seen each other in years.

732
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,029
Stop acting like nothing happened between us.

733
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:31,040
Are you going to her?

735
00:49:40,909 --> 00:49:41,980
What are you talking about?

736
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,850
Fine. Go. Just go.

737
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,049
I'm going to go to a rich man too.

That is why his eye got stung by a bee.

But why does he look even better with the patch?

742
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,250
Hey, Sol Hee.

743
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:57,290
Are you doing well?

744
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:59,889
I guess.

745
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:01,589
I haven't really found much.

747
00:51:03,489 --> 00:51:04,900
Me too. I'm so-so.

748
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,159
I miss you.

749
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,199
Me too.

750
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,199

The "Curious Stories" team...

763
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,889
has called me multiple times, saying they're covering the story again.

764
00:52:36,449 --> 00:52:38,719
So, I thought you guys were from a broadcasting station.

765
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,889
I didn't expect the prime suspect to come here himself.

766
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,600
We want to find the real culprit who killed Ms. Choi Eom Ji.

767
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,299
To be honest, I didn't suspect you.

768
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,170
Eom Ji's life was full of hard knocks.

769
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,440
She always had to deal with creditors...

770
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:04,020
and her dad coming here, asking for money.

771
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,549
I knew she wouldn't be able to hold out.

772
00:53:09,449 --> 00:53:11,059
I heard her father...

773
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,119
kept visiting this place even after Eom Ji died.

774
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:14,630
What was the reason?

775
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,360
Because of life insurance.

776
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:22,469
There must've been a life insurance under her name.

777
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,369
He always came and caused a scene, demanding us to update his bankbook,

778
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,540
saying he should be paid out because she went missing.

779
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:31,080
He even yelled while calling the insurance company.

780
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,439
After her remains were found,

781
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,009
he received the insurance money a few days ago.

782
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,880
He was so happy.

783
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:40,719
He was happy?

784
00:53:41,949 --> 00:53:42,949
Yes.

785

798
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,000

799

No, there's nothing like that.

800
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,400
We came knowing he did.

801
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,539
He said it was like an instalment savings plan...

802
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,639
and it had high interest rate.

803
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:41,449
Mr. Choi Yong Guk received his daughter's life insurance.

804

So what?

805
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,920
Then, should he not accept it when they gave it to him?

806
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,690
He just gets violent when he drinks,

807
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,060
but he's not someone who would do that to his own daughter.

808
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,560
Apparently, he was so happy after receiving it.

I mean, I couldn't handle my debt with the money you gave me,

- Why did you lie? - What's the problem?

883

Can't I lie?

884
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:49,389

00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,278
How dare you try to fool me?

900
00:59:38,279 --> 00:59:40,540
- Let go! - How dare you lie?

901
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,349
You punk.

902
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:44,980
- Let go! - You punk.

903
00:59:50,089 --> 00:59:52,560
Tell me. Did you kill Eom Ji?

904
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:57,830
Did you kill her?

905
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:09,610
(My Lovely Liar)

906
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:38,798
I'll make sure you won't have to go through anything difficult again.

907
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,139
It's not hard for me at all.

908
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:42,839
Can you tell me again in more detail?

909
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,270
Seung Ju!

910
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:46,079
Are you suspecting him?

911
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,850
You can't do this...

912
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,909
after everything we've done for you.

913
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,679
I want to be your client.

914
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,850
Just be honest with me.

915
01:00:54,549 --> 01:00:55,650
Who is the culprit?

916
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:00,219
Don't come any closer, or I'm going to stab her.

917
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,589
Just let her go and leave.
