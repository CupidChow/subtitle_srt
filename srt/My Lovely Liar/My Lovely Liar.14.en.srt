Why did he go to Hakcheon?

What do you want?

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,360
I'm here to turn myself in regarding Choi Eom Ji's case.

22
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:37,699
I killed her.

23
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,580
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,919
The truth is I let him hide in my house.

25
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:01,419
How long have you known this?

26
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,229
Do Ha, I persuaded Jae Chan...

27
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,229
to turn himself in.

28
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,840
I didn't want them to suspect you again.

29
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,568
That's why I persuaded him.

30
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:20,370
Then how come you haven't done anything all this time?

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,239
You watched me live in hiding after getting framed as a murderer.

32
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,350
Now you persuaded him?

33
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:33,190
The other day, Jae Chan asked me...

34
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,660
whom I would save first if you and Jae Chan were drowning.

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,160
I...

36
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,690
didn't answer him then.

37
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,400
But I would save you.

38
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:47,199
I would save you without a moment's hesitation.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,180
I thought long and hard about this before I came to this conclusion.

40
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,280
It wasn't easy. He is my brother.

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,359
I'm sorry...

42
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,160
for not telling you everything.

43
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,030

The alleged culprit turned himself in.

48
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,499
But Hakcheon Police Station can't take this case because of...

49
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,400

50

- Why did you turn yourself in? - Why did you do it?

57
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,888
- Did you have a grudge against her? - Did you commit the act alone?

- All right. Step back. - A comment, please!

59
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,459

65
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,510
Five years ago, a girl went missing at Hakcheon Beach.

66
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:37,238
Recently, the remains of the missing girl were found on a nearby hill.

67
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:40,609
And the suspect who allegedly murdered this girl in her 20s...

68
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:42,419
turned himself in to the police.

69
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,248
At 1:30pm today,

70
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:45,988
Mr. Jo, a man in his 20s,

71
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:47,689
came to the police station of his own volition...

72
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:50,358
and claimed that he was the culprit...

73
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:52,160
of the murder case at Hakcheon Beach.

74
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:55,498
Mr. Jo submitted the ring the victim was wearing...

75
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:57,770
until the day of her disappearance as evidence.

76
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:18,890
It was you?

77
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,059
You killed her?

78
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:25,460
("Investigation of Hakcheon Murder Case Takes a New Turn")

79
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,618
Mr. Jo said he felt pressured when the police found his ring...

80
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:53,090
at the crime scene and decided to turn himself in.

81
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,159
It was confirmed that Mr. Jo was acquainted with Mr. Kim,

82
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,228
who was once a prime suspect in Hakcheon Beach Murder Case.

83
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:03,228
Mr. Jo is the younger brother of a major entertainment agency...

84
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,498
and a general manager at the agency.

85
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:06,330
This discovery has shocked a lot of people.

86
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,499
The police began reinvestigating the case based on Jo's testimony.

87
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:13,168
This case had remained unsolved for five years.

88
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:15,579
Now, all eyes are on the Hakcheon Beach Murder Case...

89
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,249
to see if the police can finally find the real culprit.

90
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,959
Can you help me?

91
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,600
(Kim Do Ha: Can you help me?)

92
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,830
It's strange.

93
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,970
The culprit has been identified,

94
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,270
but I still feel very uneasy.

95
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,609
The fact that Eom Ji was murdered...

96
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,879
and the culprit who killed her...

97
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,210
was someone close to me feels all wrong.

98
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,020

00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,330
She died a tragic death.

102
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,359
When will you be happy then?

103
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,070
You were in agony because you felt responsible.

104
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,270
But you're still struggling despite the real culprit has been caught.

105
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,510
When will you be happy then?

106
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,650

Right.

140
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,359

I don't know why I'm being punished.

145
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,209
You thought your son wasn't innocent when he was.

146
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,909
That's why you bribed the detective. It was your doing.

147
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,309
The fact that you bribed him...

148
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,979
won't go away even though the real culprit is revealed.

(Assemblywoman Jung Yeon Mi)

153
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,560
Why did you confuse me?

154
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:59,229
Why did you tell me you killed her at first?

155
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,759
Why did the police find your shirt stained with her blood?

156
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:06,700
You should have made it clear if you weren't the culprit.

157
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,470
The ring Detective Kwak pocketed belonged to the culprit.

158
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,739
He ruined the chain of custody, so it won't be admissible in court.

159
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,479
I told you that I threw my ring into the ocean.

160
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,109
Don't you remember?

161
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:27,049
You neither listen to me nor believe me.

162
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,790
This isn't about believing you.

163
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,018
Back then, given all the circumstances,

164
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,259
it was reasonable to assume that you had killed her.

165
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:35,758
I didn't want to be a pathetic woman...

166
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,769
who'd always side with her son just because she's the mother.

167
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,940
Why would that make you pathetic?

168
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:47,609
I needed someone...

169
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,409
to take my side unconditionally ever since I was a kid.

170
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,960

171

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,070
Is that true?

Mr. Jo!

177
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,489
The public sentiment isn't favourable.

00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,128
The rumour that you framed Songwriter Kim Do Ha...

183
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,369
for the murder your brother committed...

184
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,128
has been spreading continuously.

185
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:50,499
They don't know my relationship with him.

186
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,909
If they had known, they wouldn't have been able to say that.

187
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,878
Anyone who commits crimes...

188
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,909
should be punished, even if that's my brother.

189
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:00,009
I have no interest in getting involved with that kind of matter.

190
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,989
No matter what people say about us, we must come together.

191
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,529
Just focus on your work and do what you've been doing.

192
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,460
Those people will get tired of gossiping.

193
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,499
I'll call Haei Entertainment. Don't worry about that project.

194
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,200
Sir.

195
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,080
If you show the public that you're on good terms with Mr. Kim,

196
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:32,450
this scandal will be sorted out quickly.

197
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,080
Okay. I see.

198
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,080
Thank you.

199
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,059
That's a family matter.

200
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,719
It has nothing to do with my business.

201
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,489
Think about all the contracts we've exchanged before this.

202
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,628
I agreed to all of your conditions too.

203
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,600
You're putting me in a tight spot if you back out now.

204
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,330
Syaon is staying at your agency, right?

205
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,139
Of course. She's our number one artist.

206
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,180
I'll take that we will proceed as planned. Goodbye now.

207
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,950
Am I your number one artist?

208
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,080
I'm glad you're here.

209
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,978
When will you want to come back to work?

210
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:11,478
I'd like you to come back soon.

211
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,420
You're really scaring me.

212
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,719
I knew that you were a businessman to the core.

213
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,960
But how could you think about money at times like this?

214
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,529
I won't work with you.

215
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:24,498
Gosh, I can't. You're creeping me out.

216
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:25,499
Ji On.

217
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,409
If money was the only thing I really cared about,

218
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,509
why would I have supported you to make a début...

219
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,639
when you were a nobody?

220
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,920
I got you the best stylists and choreographers.

221
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,249
You joined my agency when I had nothing because you trusted me.

222
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,489
That's why I supported you.

223
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,720
And what about Do Ha?

224
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,758
He covered up his face and didn't want to see anyone.

225
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,330
I was the one who dragged him to the piano.

226
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,159
You know that too.

227
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:02,399
I do. I know,

228
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,540
but you're only thinking about the agency.

229
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:09,279
It might look like that's all I care about...

230
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,180
when I'm doing this for you and Do Ha's sakes.

231
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,320
You, Do Ha, and me.

232
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,350
The three of us grew this agency.

233
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,389
I must save it.

234
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:21,790
Would you be okay if the agency went under?

235
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,290
No. I wouldn't be okay either.

236
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,330
Even if you switch to a different agency,

237
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,470
you should make the change once things get sorted out here.

238
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,799
If you switch to another agency the moment our agency struggles,

239
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,940
people may applaud you, but inside, they'll criticize you.

240
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,979
But did you really not know?

241
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,080
That your brother was the culprit?

242
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:51,080
I found out rather late.

243
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Really?

244
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:55,389
I already told Do Ha.

245
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,119
I apologized too.

246
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,289
Apologizing once won't be enough. Do it until he gets sick of it.

247
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,559
Apologize on your knees. Beg for his forgiveness.

248
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,999
Call him and text him to apologize. Just keep apologizing.

249
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:10,300
If Do Ha accepts your apology,

250
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:12,670
I'll stay too.

251
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,109
I'll do that.

252
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,139
What are you doing? Let's meet.

253
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:52,379
Sure. Where?

254
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,629
Sit over here.

255
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,339
Good job hanging in there.

256
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,408
- Good job hanging in there. - Good job hanging in there.

257
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:55,438
- Good job hanging in there. - Good job hanging in there.

258
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:56,609
Good job hanging in there.

259
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,179
(Congratulations on proving your innocence.)

260
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,810
Blow out the candles.

261
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,419
All right, Kim. Here you go.

262
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,119
Take it.

263
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,560
(Cheering for you, from Joong Kyu)

264
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,850
(We aDo-Ha you, you adorable.)

265
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,889
(We aDo-Ha you, you adorable.)

266
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,340
Is he crying?

267
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,909
- What? Why are you crying? - What is it?

268
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,980
- Well, those are happy tears! - Gosh.

269
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,948
- Is he happy? - Go and comfort him.

270
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:10,149
- What are you doing? - What? What's going on?

271
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:11,520
He's really crying.

272
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,918
- Cheers. - Cheers.

273
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:14,949
Awesome.

274
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:19,888
- Beer is better, though. - This is great.

275
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,559
- Try it. - Can I try the cake?

276
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,628
- Try it. - I can't cut this.

277
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:25,158
- It's too precious to cut it. - This case is really good.

278
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:27,128
- Hey, don't do that. - Come here.

279
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:28,569
- Just once. - I told you not to do that.

280
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,639
You shouldn't do that.

281
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,539
I was just joking. Why did you get so angry?

282
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,608
It's because you always try to get the cream on my face.

283
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:34,609
It's annoying.

284
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,878
- "Always?" - I was just goofing around.

285
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:37,409
- You didn't have to get so serious. - Well, that's not funny.

286
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:42,280
I guess you two have cakes quite often.

287
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:45,750
What?

288
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,319
That's not it. I was just trying to be funny.

289
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,419
Everyone does that.

290
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,820
There's no way.

291
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:56,299
What's up with the mood?

292
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,898
Yes. You're the man of the hour. You should make a toast.

293
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,669
- Right. - That sounds good.

294
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:07,040
Thank you so much, everyone.

295
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:10,138
- That's it? - That's all?

296
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:11,178
That's too short.

297
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:13,179
Come on. Say a few more things.

298
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,290
Actually,

299
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,959
I used to secretly come here alone and leave after I played the piano.

300
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:26,859
I wanted to play the piano with my face covered up.

301
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:28,760
Thanks to Mr. Jang, who still let me play,

302
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,230
I could come here alone, play the piano, and leave.

303
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,699
Then, one day, I saw Sol Hee watching me from the bar.

304
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:39,839
- Gosh. - Goodness.

305
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,939
That's when I realized...

306
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,280
that I wanted someone to come and see me play here.

307
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,250
And now,

308
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,490
I'm here with the people I like. And being here with everyone...

309
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,389
makes me happy.

310
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,560
I'm so glad that I moved to Yeonseo-dong.

311
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,928
- My gosh. - What was that?

312
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:08,428
I told you to make a toast.

313
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:10,198
But you ended up confessing your love to her.

314
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:12,040
If that's what you want to do,

315
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,009
- you give her a kiss. - Kiss her.

316
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,208
- Give her a kiss. - Kiss her.

317
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:20,279
- Give her a kiss. - Kiss her.

318
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,249
- Give her a kiss. - Kiss her.

319
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,618
- Give her a kiss. - Kiss her.

320
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,080
- Hurry up. - Kiss her!

321
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,050
He really kissed her!

322
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:30,520
- Hey! - No way!

323
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:32,730
I can't believe it.

324
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:37,399
Guys, let's leave them in the zone.

325
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:41,000
- Gosh. - No way.

326
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:33,949
Hey, Deuk Chan.

327
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:47,129
Hey.

328
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:49,639
I didn't expect you to reach out.

329
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,570
Have a seat.

330
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,649
I was so angry back then,

331
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:11,590
which could be why...

332
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:14,060
you weren't able to talk to me.

333
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:19,169
What is this about? Hold nothing back.

334
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,939
When did you first know...

335
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:26,340
that Jae Chan was the killer?

336
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:32,580
A little after Eom Ji was found.

337
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,949
I'm sorry.

338
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,330
What is it? Do you still not believe me?

339
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,030
If you act in the same way as the others, it'll be very hard on me.

340
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,368
Although this is probably nothing...

341
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,800
compared to what you had to go through.

342
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,709
Right, I get it.

343
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,609
I don't care what others think.

344
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,419
I'm fine with whatever they gossip about me.

345
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,350
But it's upsetting to know...

346
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,790
that you share their sentiment.

347
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:19,560
Is this the amount of trust I've placed in you over the years?

348
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,629
I'm in a crisis right now.

349
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:24,159
The company is suffering,

350
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:26,169
and I've been abandoned by those around me.

351
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,709
It was the same for me.

352
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,240
And only you...

353
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,510
were by my side.

354
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,090
If you hadn't called me back then,

355
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,459
I would've gone days without saying a word.

356
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,060
I only mentioned my music once,

357
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,629
but you got me all kinds of equipment the next day...

358
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:00,330
and had them installed.

359
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:04,199
Right.

360
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:06,810
I remember that.

361
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,639
(Lawyer Kim Bo Hyung)

362
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,480
Is that Jae Chan's lawyer?

363
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:19,850
No, mine.

364
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,520
I'm in the process of getting divorced.

365
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,959
That seems sudden.

366
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,929
It just happened that way.

367
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:34,800
I guess it's true that misfortune never comes alone.

368
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,770
However,

369
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,709
I don't want the company to become entangled in these misfortunes.

370
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:49,719
Is there anything I can do to help?

371
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:53,449
I do have a few songs written.

372
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,830
Well,

373
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,959
the company is holding its vision proclamation ceremony on Friday.

374
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,139
It'd be nice to show everyone that we're still on good terms.

375
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,740
Could you be present at the ceremony?

376
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:29,218
(Testimonial statement)

377
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:31,159
(He felt that having the ring made him feel like her boyfriend.)

378
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,800
Mr. Jo,

379
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,770
you're claiming to have killed Ms. Choi Eom Ji.

380
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:48,069
- Mr. Jo. - Yes?

381
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,109
Answer me.

382
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:50,740
Sorry?

383
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,010
Did you kill her?

384
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,379
Yes.

385
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:01,250
And this ring is proof of that.

386
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:05,859
Yes, I took it off her finger after killing her.

387
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,159
You ordered a ring like hers to wear yourself.

388
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,199
Why?

389
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,399
Eom Ji...

390
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,699
never took off the matching ring she got with Kim Seung Ju.

391
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:21,209
The day she took it off...

392
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,810
was going to be the day I confessed my feelings.

393
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:28,379
However, that day never came.

394
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:30,618
Then it occurred to me...

395
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:33,949
that I could get a ring that matched hers.

396
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,889
It felt good to wear the ring.

397
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:37,689
I felt like I was her boyfriend.

398
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:43,800
Then why did you kill someone you obviously loved?

399
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:45,600
It was an accident.

400
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,300
A friend told me...

401
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,740
that she and Seung Ju had a heated argument,

402
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,969
and it seemed like they had broken up.

403
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,679
I found her alone at the beach.

404
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,209
Seung Ju!

405
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,219
Just stop.

406
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,289
Why drag me out here just to talk?

407
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,489
- Go out with me. - No.

408
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,519
Why not?

409
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,359
- She wasn't with Seung Ju anymore. - Go out with me.

410
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,530
- You're insane. - So I asked her out.

411
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,428
- But she wasn't interested, - Let go of me.

412
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:19,800
which made me push her out of anger.

413
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,040
But she didn't get up,

414
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,969
and her head was bleeding.

415
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,409
And being scared, I ran off.

416
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,810
I pretended to watch the game at the pub with my brother...

417
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,480
and texted Eom Ho from her phone,

418
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,980
stating how she'd rather die.

419
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,520
I figured I could make it look like a suicide...

420
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:44,020
and be done with it.

421
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,060
And that night,

422
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,429
I buried Eom Ji's body.

423
00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:00,239
What did you do with her clothes and belongings?

424
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,340
I left her shoes...

425
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:03,980
at the beach to fake her suicide.

426
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,810
I threw away the clothes into the ocean.

427
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,790
(He burned Choi Eom Ji's clothes.)

428
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,759
(He burned Choi Eom Ji's clothes.)

429
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,560
I threw away the clothes into the ocean.

430
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,090
What?

431
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,300
A penny for your thoughts?

432
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,340
I met with Deuk Chan.

433
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,010
I wanted to know how long he had known...

434
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,310
about what Jae Chan did.

435
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:41,879
When did he first find out?

436
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,520
A little after Eom Ji was found.

437
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,389
How long have you two known each other?

438
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,060
Since middle school, I think.

439
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,359
We've known each other for about 15 years.

440
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,159
Gosh, 15 years?

441
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,270
I don't know everything about him though,

442
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,570
and it suddenly feels like there's a distance between us.

443
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,810
The company is going through a rough patch right now.

444
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:12,580
He invited me to a company event,

445
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:16,050
and I'm contemplating whether I should go.

446
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,320
You know,

447
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:24,590
every lie that was told bruised me as a kid.

448
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:28,689
It hurt when my friend lied about voting for me as class leader.

449
00:30:29,699 --> 00:30:32,059
It also hurt when a friend lied about not bringing her PE uniform...

450
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,270
just to keep me from borrowing it.

451
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,869
I grew up not trusting anyone,

452
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:40,639
which is why I don't have a friend I can call at night to rant.

453
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,679
So...

454
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,980
don't be quick to dump a friend of 15 years.

455
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,189
- You have me, you know. - What do you mean?

456
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,790
A friend you can call at night.

457
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,359
You're right.

458
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,500
Tell me how you disposed of Ms. Choi's clothes.

459
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:11,799
I already told you that I burned them.

460
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,839
Actually, you wrote you burned them in your written statement,

461
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,280
but you told me you threw them away into the ocean.

462
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,280
Is that so? Then, I guess I tossed them in the water.

463
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:21,850
How can you mix that up?

464
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,649
Burning them is completely different from throwing them in the water.

465
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,350
Detective,

466
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,449
it's been five years.

467
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,289
Can you easily recall what you did on June 24, 2018?

468
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,389
I can't...

469
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:38,060
because it was just another ordinary day for me.

470
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,369
But for you, the day was far from normal...

471
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,040
since you had committed murder.

472
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:50,240
I'm done talking without a lawyer.

473
00:31:53,449 --> 00:31:54,879
Why did you turn yourself in?

474
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,149
You found my ring at her burial site.

475
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,949
I was scared,

476
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,590
and the guilt was overwhelming.

477
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,590
You're overwhelmed with guilt,

478
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,230
but you won't speak without a lawyer?

479
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,929
Just speaking up about it took a lot of courage on my part.

480
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Don't you think?

481
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,628
If I'm acquitted due to insufficient evidence, that's a matter of law.

482
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:17,000
Nothing can be done about it.

483
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:20,169
Who said...

484
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,540
you would be acquitted?

485
00:32:26,949 --> 00:32:27,949
My lawyer.

486
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,480
He's right, isn't he?

487
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,459
(Lawyer Kim Bo Hyung)

488
00:32:54,969 --> 00:32:55,969
Yes, Mr. Kim.

489
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,340
I received the document for the division of property.

490
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:02,250
I sold the car, and the house is being sorted out.

491
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,820
I'm going to give in to my wife's demands.

492
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,590
It's all right.

493
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,419
Just process it like so.

494
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,379
(Kang Min)

495
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:42,689
Hey, Kang Min.

496
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,260
Right now?

497
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,070
It didn't seem appropriate to talk over the phone.

498
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:56,869
Did you know that my station is handling Jo Jae Chan's case?

499
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,540
Yes, I saw it on the news.

500
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:01,439
How is it coming along?

501
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,310
Not well.

502
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:05,179
He isn't being that forthcoming.

503
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,449
Didn't he turn himself in?

504
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,149
Some do so as part of a plan.

505
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,080
Not everyone surrenders with honest intentions.

506
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,920
Could there be an ulterior motive?

507
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,060
Before,

508
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,529
he and his brother opted to be alibis for Kim Do Ha.

509
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,500
- Yes. - Don't you find that weird?

510
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,670
Why would he do that when he was the killer all along?

511
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,679
He probably did it for Jo Deuk Chan's sake.

512
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,449
Deuk Chan cares about Do Ha a lot.

513
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,448
Jae Chan confessed,

514
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,520
only because Deuk Chan convinced him to.

515
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,319
He had his younger brother turn himself in to help his friend?

516
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,560
There has to be another reason.

517
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,429
Sol Hee,

518
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,400
can I ask for a favour?

519
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,659
Hey, Sol Hee. Just a second.

520
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,369
Got it.

521
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,239
See you tomorrow.

522
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,009
Was that Deuk Chan?

523
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,639
Yes.

524
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,710
I'm going to attend that event tomorrow.

525
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,179
I feel like I was being too sensitive toward him.

526
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,350
But Do Ha...

527
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:53,290
Yes?

528
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,489
It's nothing.

529
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,258
I was hoping to hang out tomorrow,

530
00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:04,330
but enjoy your time.

531
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,770
Sure.

532
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:30,690
He had his younger brother turn himself in to help his friend?

533
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,130
It's Jo Deuk Chan...

534
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,830
that you suspect.

535
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,299
Yes.

536
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,170
I have my suspicions, but I don't have any solid evidence.

537
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:45,900
Got it.

538
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,509
I'll speak to Jo Jae Chan tomorrow.

00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,029
(CEO Jo Deuk Chan)

540
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,040
Hey, Do Ha.

541
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:30,449
I haven't been to events like this, so I'm a little nervous.

542
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,319
You really can't afford to be nervous.

543
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:37,319
You might even have to say a few words later on.

544
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,889
I'd rather watch from the sidelines.

545
00:37:43,029 --> 00:37:45,599
Let me introduce you to the employees first.

546
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,929
You haven't officially met them yet.

(2023 J Entertainment Vision Proclamation Ceremony)

548
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,509
- Hello. - Hello.

549
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,679
This is our manager.

550
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:02,310
- Sir. - Please greet each other.

551
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:07,190
Hello. I officially greet you for the first time.

552
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,118
I'm Kim Do Ha.

553
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,289
For some reason, I feel reassured...

554
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,420
to see you two together.

555
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:20,730
Do Ha.

556
00:38:29,779 --> 00:38:31,279
It must've been rough for you.

557
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,250
This ordeal was hard on you as well.

558
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,949
It wasn't that bad.

559
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,860
- You're here. - Hey.

560
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,899
You'll only get 30 minutes with him,

561
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,599
and he may end the session at any moment.

562
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Okay.

563
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:57,439
Even if the killer turns out to be Jo Deuk Chan,

564
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,899
what we need is physical evidence.

565
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,969
That's what we must find.

566
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,940
Got it.

567
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:04,480
Let's go.

568
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,420
What on earth?

569
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,360
Hi. You remember me, right?

570
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,299
Whatever. Why are you here?

571
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,569
Jo Deuk Chan sent me.

572
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,330
My brother?

573
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:30,068
Why you, of all people?

574
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:31,569
You may not know this,

575
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:34,209
but I have a close relationship with him...

576
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,339
thanks to Do Ha.

577
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:38,880
Really?

578
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:42,179
Sure. But why are you here?

579
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,690
Well, he wanted me to relay a message.

580
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,159
The plan has gone awry.

581
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,860
In what way?

582
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
Get him to speak for himself. What is he up to anyway?

583
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:06,500
He's hosting a big event to remedy the damage...

584
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:08,369
you caused the company.

585
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,440
A vision proclamation ceremony or something like that.

586
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:14,210
He's hosting that at this moment in time?

587
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,179
Yes.

588
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,989
Do Ha headed there due to his request.

589
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:24,960
They're still good friends?

590
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:28,659
Why do you ask?

591
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,428
Did you think you caused a rift between them?

592
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,799
Of course!

593
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:35,029
His girlfriend was killed by his friend's younger brother.

(2023 J Entertainment Vision Proclamation Ceremony)

595
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:01,029
Hello,

596
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:03,900
I'm Jo Deuk Chan, CEO of J Entertainment.

597
00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:07,529
I apologize...

598
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:11,739
for the inconvenience I caused to those present at this event.

599
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:17,979
Thanks to your support, J Entertainment was able to grow...

600
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,350
as one of the nation's top record labels.

601
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,650
I'm curious about something.

602
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,589
Why were you still holding on...

603
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:30,159
to Ms. Choi's ring?

604
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:37,060
Ever since the day I hurt Eom Ji,

605
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,630
I have been haunted by the guilt.

606
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,040
Having the ring in my possession made me seem like less of a monster.

607
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:50,480
That ring...

608
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,210
was given to you by your brother.

609
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,719
What are you talking about?

610
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,980
That's not true.

611
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:10,960
Mr. Jo's the one who sent me here.

612
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,698
You don't have to lie to me.

613
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,170
Hold on a second.

614
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,469
You said earlier that the plan had gone awry.

615
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:22,040
Which part of the two plans are you talking about?

616
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:31,779
Gosh, were you kidding me?

617
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,150
I almost fell for that.

618
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:39,159
Do you really trust your brother?

619
00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:42,730
Are you not aware that he had you turn yourself in...

620
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,399
for Do Ha's sake?

621
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,799
Why are you even here? Just leave.

622
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:55,909
"If Do Ha..."

623
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,440
"and I are both drowning,"

624
00:43:00,909 --> 00:43:02,080
"I bet..."

625
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,549
"you'll save him."

626
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:10,619
Who is your brother?

627
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,020
If Do Ha and I are both drowning,

628
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,830
I bet you'll save him.

629
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,869
To be honest,

630
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,869
Jo Deuk Chan's answer was...

631
00:43:29,569 --> 00:43:30,639
Yes.

632
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,909
- That's right. - Who are you?

633
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,250
Who are you?

634
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,589
Jo Deuk Chan...

635
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,259
really only saved Do Ha.

636
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,699
Do you still not realize?

637
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,600
You're locked up here by yourself.

638
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,199
That's not true.

639
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:01,409
I'm going to leave soon.

640
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:05,508
Additional evidence to prove your guilt has been found.

641
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:08,049
What did they find?

642
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,920
I can't tell you that.

643
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,690
What is it? That's not mine!

644
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,520
Hey.

645
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:22,190
How could there be evidence when I'm not the culprit?

646
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:25,929
That's...

647
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:37,980
That's my brother's.

648
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,509
It belongs to my brother.

649
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,859
Next, I will talk about the expansion strategy...

650
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,690
for overseas activities.

651
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,069
As many of you already know,

652
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,939
K-pop is currently the most popular music genre in the world.

653
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,698
During the past five years...

654
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:09,569
Thank you. I know it was hard for you to come here.

655
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,980
But still, I'm glad I came.

Sol Hee.

659
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:56,790
What made you trust him?

660
00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:00,829
Before getting involved in a matter this big,

661
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:03,758
you should've prepared a fail-safe such as his weakness.

662
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:04,830
A fail-safe...

663
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,270
I thought I had one.

664
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:16,980
What is this?

665
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,909
That is Eom Ji's ring.

666
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,020
What?

667
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:26,020
Why do you have this?

668
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,119
Jae Chan, take that to the police station...

669
00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:31,360
and turn yourself in.

670
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,020
What?

671
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:34,960
The one who killed Eom Ji...

672
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,929
is me.

673
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:44,069
I want to go to the police station and turn myself in this instant,

674
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,799
but if I do, both of our lives are over.

675
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,909
Are you being serious? Did you really kill her?

676
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,850
But why are you suddenly trying to turn yourself in?

677
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,278
No one knows about it anyway.

678
00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:00,790
Can't you just continue living like this?

679
00:47:01,489 --> 00:47:02,790
Why do you think...

680
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:05,759
I still have that ring?

681
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:09,659
After doing that to Eom Ji, I have not once felt at ease.

682
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,270
That ring allowed me to turn myself in at any time,

683
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:18,040
so it put my mind at rest.

684
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:22,270
It made me feel like I wasn't too terrible of a person.

685
00:47:23,469 --> 00:47:25,040
Deuk Chan, snap out of it.

686
00:47:25,339 --> 00:47:27,080
Why are you suddenly like this? You're scaring me.

687
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,279
I can't do this anymore.

688
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,049
I'll give you everything,

689
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,420
so just stall for time.

690
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:37,819
How?

691
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,989
Do you want me to go to jail in your stead?

692
00:47:43,589 --> 00:47:45,429
This ring is not admissible.

693
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,100
You won't be declared guilty.

694
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:49,730
Deuk Chan.

695
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:52,069
Do you have any other evidence?

696
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:02,409
Where is that?

697
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,420
Tell me. I'll help you get out of here.

698
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,989
Tell me.

699
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,989
Where is it?

700
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,130
The company.

701
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,670
His office.

702
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,069
Thank you for everything.

703
00:48:29,069 --> 00:48:32,810
I interviewed each and every person here myself...

704
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,380
and carefully welcomed you all to become a part of this family.

705
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:40,389
Thanks to you all, we were able to come this far.

706
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:44,489
I will keep those good memories with me...

707
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:49,190
and step down from my position.

(Mok Sol Hee)

709
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,909
Lastly, I will make another important announcement.

710
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,909
Please welcome the next CEO who will lead J Entertainment...

711
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:09,850
with a round of applause.

712
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:13,750

713
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,949
- What? - Really?

(J Entertainment, Jo Jae Chan)

715
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:10,239
First off, this is very sudden,

716
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,639
and it's my first time in this type of situation.

717
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:16,679
I am just good...

718
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,619
at making music.

Deuk Chan.

720
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,529
I'll just help you by your side.

721
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:29,989
Let's work hard again like we did four years ago.

722
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,569
Please stay as the CEO of J Entertainment.

723
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:27,389
What? Where is it?

724
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,790
What was that? Is that why you brought me here?

725
00:51:33,259 --> 00:51:35,230
We built this company up together.

726
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,429
This is not my company. It's ours.

727
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,799
I wish you would take charge of this company.

728
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:42,199
This is my last request.

729
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:45,739
What do you mean by "last?"

730
00:51:46,569 --> 00:51:48,770
I just want to take some time off.

731
00:51:49,509 --> 00:51:51,710
I never got to rest properly because of work.

732
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:54,980
I need to greet some people.

733
00:52:00,279 --> 00:52:01,319
Yes, Kang Min.

734
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:03,089
Sol Hee, you're at J Entertainment, right?

735
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,318
Yes.

736
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,658
I heard there was a piece of evidence here,

737
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:06,860
but I'm not sure where it is.

738
00:52:07,389 --> 00:52:08,860
The safe, next to his desk.

739
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,369
What's the passcode?

740
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,580
Hey, Sol Hee.

741
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,579
I'm sorry. Earlier...

742
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,618
Do Ha, do you know the passcode that Jo Deuk Chan uses often?

743
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:33,879
Sorry? What are you saying...

744
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,549
I am in his office right now.

745
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:37,758
There is a piece of evidence in his safe,

746
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,360
but I can't open it because I don't know the passcode.

747
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:41,589
What's going on? What evidence?

748
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:43,489
The real culprit who killed Choi Eom Ji...

749
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:47,259
is Jo Deuk Chan.

750
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,239
(CEO Jo Deuk Chan)

751
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:14,889
(September 4, 2017, Do Ha's birthday)

752
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:22,259
(September 4, 2017, Do Ha's birthday)

753
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,460
I heard that you two were dating.

754
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,360
Congratulations.

755
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,730
I would save you.

756
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,629
I would save you without a moment's hesitation.

757
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,539
Someone who would get the same matching rings...

758
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,270
as another couple.

759
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:37,209
Someone who was very close to Kim Do Ha...

760
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,710
because they knew where the ring was made.

761
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:41,548
Someone who faced unrequited love toward Choi Eom Ji.

762
00:54:41,549 --> 00:54:42,549
(September 4, 2017, Do Ha's birthday)

763
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:50,989
It wasn't...

764
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,319
Choi Eom Ji.

765
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,889
Are you looking for this?

766
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,489
What?

767
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:09,699
Give that to me.

768
00:56:15,869 --> 00:56:16,909
Sol Hee.

769
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,850
Sol Hee, wait!

770
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,589
I'm going to turn myself in.

771
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,500
I was planning on it from the start.

772
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,969
But I kept pushing it back, and this is where I ended up.

773
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:49,270
The reason you pushed it back...

774
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,739
is because of Do Ha, right?

775
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:00,250
Stop liking Seung Ju.

776
00:57:03,949 --> 00:57:06,420
Yes, you're right.

777
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,869
I like Do Ha.

778
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:17,940
I'll admit it.

779
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,239
But Sol Hee, please...

780
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:25,540
Don't tell Do Ha.

781
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,610
I'm begging you.

782
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:39,360
What does all of this mean?

783
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:46,529
Do Ha.

784
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:06,380
Deuk Chan.

785
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:13,159
Is that why you stayed by my side this whole time?

786
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:15,860
No...

787
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:18,759
Well...

788
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:32,279
Then...

789
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,679
Then is that why you killed...

790
00:58:41,389 --> 00:58:42,389
No...

791
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,089
Mr. Jo Deuk Chan.

792
00:59:21,389 --> 00:59:24,429
Is it true that you forced your brother, Jo Jae Chan,

793
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:25,860
to make a false confession?

794
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:33,469
Come with us to the police station for now.

795
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:44,250
- Take him with you. - Yes, sir. Come with me.

796
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,389
Hello, sir.

797
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,170
- Jo Deuk Chan! - Jo Deuk Chan.

798
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,408
- Sol Hee. - Yes?

799
01:01:23,409 --> 01:01:24,619
Stay here. It's dangerous.

800
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,889
- Nam Jun, lift up his legs. - Yes, sir.

801
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:40,799
Slowly.

802
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:47,799
Nam Jun, call 911.

803
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:12,659
Hello, we are located around...

804
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:13,929
Jo Deuk Chan.

805
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:35,619
Sol Hee.

806
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:15,330
(My Lovely Liar)

807
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:48,360
What are the people left behind supposed to do?

808
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:53,900
Couldn't Choi Eom Ji have done that on purpose?

809
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,170
I'm not someone who's just passing through like you.

810
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:59,000
Thanks to you, a five-year-old cold case has been solved.

811
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,940
I feel like you should just call him Mr. Lee.

812
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:04,239
Is that what you thought, my dear Do Ha?

813
01:04:06,139 --> 01:04:07,939
Do you want to be my bodyguard?

814
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:10,249
But that means you would have to quit working here.

815
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,380
What do I do? I...
