Sol Hee!

12
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:05,829
What? What's this about?

13
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,870
- Did you watch that? - Watch what?

14
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
Gosh.

15
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,069
Your dad. He was on TV.

16
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,280
Why would he be on TV?

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,879
I found out about her affair...

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,208
(Man living in nature)

19
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:22,119
and realized she didn't need my love.

20
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,619
So we broke up.

21
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,288
- This is Dad? - The fact that...

22
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:26,749
- Gosh. - a man can do nothing...

23
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,389
- It's obviously him. - for the love of his life...

24
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,890
is a great torment.

25
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:32,429
Do you know what he said?

26
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,770
Apparently, I had an affair. That's why we got a divorce.

27
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,039
- You didn't then? - What?

28
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,740
You... Is that what you think happened too?

29
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,909
Whenever I asked Dad why you guys got a divorce,

30
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,580
he always lied.

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,610
And the only thing I found out...

32
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:55,319
was that he saw you walk into a hotel with some guy.

33
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:57,949
How did he see that?

34
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,160
No. What are you talking about?

35
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:06,159
He just wanted...

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,489
to buy me an expensive meal at the hotel buffet.

37
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,928
We only went there to have a meal.

38
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,630
You can hear that I'm telling the truth, right?

39
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,630
Hey, I feel so wronged!

40
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,469
I need to go and see your dad.

41
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,039
Let's say you met with him and cleared up the misunderstanding.

42
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:18,870
What happens next?

43
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,738
Will you get back together?

44
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:21,880
Are you crazy?

45
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,380
There's a guy I'm planning to marry.

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,249
Then the next time I see Dad,

47
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,389
I'll tell him what really happened. Okay?

48
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,258
It looked like he was having a peaceful life there.

49
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:38,030
Don't go up there and bother him...

50
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:39,660
unless you want to get back together.

51
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:42,900
Okay.

52
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,030
- Mom. - Yes?

53
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,538
Tell me when you get married.

54
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:50,799
I'll send you a cash gift for the wedding.

55
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,970
Sure.

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,060
Wait. Do you take pictures too?

57
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,130
Yes.

58
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:16,329
I must take the prettiest pictures and send them to my daughter.

59
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,669
- Hello. - You're here.

60
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,840
Take this.

61
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,008
You didn't have to buy anything.

62
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,608
You invited me to your house.

63
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,210
I didn't think it was good manners to show up empty-handed.

64
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,919
- Come on in. - Okay.

65
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,549
Excuse me then.

66
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,000
Gosh, that's a great song.

67
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,840
There's no guide track for this yet.

68
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,410
- This is your song. - What?

69
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,780
I told you I would write a song for you.

70
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:04,479
You turned it down, though.

71
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:07,720
I was wondering if you had a change of heart.

72
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,880
I see.

73
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,049
I'm really grateful.

74
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:14,619
But I left my team,

75
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,389
and I'm not working with any agency now.

76
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,289
I won't even have a chance to sing this song.

77
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,160
Young Jae said he would help me write this song.

78
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,059
And I'll be your producer.

79
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:27,769
So you can release your album in the second half of this year.

80
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,799
What do you think?

81
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,470
- My album? - Yes.

82
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,140
I...

83
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,339
If you're doing this...

84
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,950
because you feel bad for what happened before...

85
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:41,280
You're way too humble.

86
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,379
I listened to all of Atlantis' albums.

87
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,650
You were such a good singer that I wanted to listen to...

88
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,689
your solo song.

89
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,160
(Dream Villa)

(Luni Tarot Café)

91
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:32,799
I'm sorry. We're closed for the day.

92
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:34,229
Hey.

93
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,869
Hello.

94
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,169
Well, I'm sorry how I acted...

95
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:41,879
the other day.

96
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,410
I was pretty drunk.

97
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,679
You must have been startled.

98
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:48,979
No.

99
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,520
I would have been frustrated if I were in your shoes too.

100
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,160
I made a decision on my own.

101
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,890
What did you decide?

102
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,059
Cho Rok.

103
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,570
You're here too.

104
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,369
I need to have a serious conversation with you.

105
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,840
I'm sorry, but can you give us some privacy?

106
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,309
Sure. Bye.

107
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,280
I don't want to have any serious conversation with you.

108
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,609
Let's just stay friends...

109
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,678
and talk about something light...

110
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:24,320
like other businesses in this area as fellow business owners.

111
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,960
Do you mean that?

112
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:30,689
Yes.

113
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:34,059
Bye, Mr. Bar Owner.

114
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,770
Don't regret that.

115
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,609
Ms. Hwang.

116
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,979
You didn't mean that. Right?

117
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,350
No. I meant it.

118
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,688
Right. Let me pack up some leftover salads.

119
00:06:58,689 --> 00:06:59,720
Wait.

120
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,260
How could you tell?

121
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:12,668
What do you mean?

122
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:14,330
I can't hear people's lies anymore.

123
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,340
How do I know if they're being honest or not?

124
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:21,039
I just believed what I wanted to believe.

125
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,879
That brought me peace.

126
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
I see.

127
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,419
When you believed me that I wasn't the culprit before,

128
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,460
you said you just wanted to believe me.

129
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,359
Just do that.

130
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:53,340
See if I'm being honest or not.

131
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,080
Okay.

132
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:00,379
I love you.

133
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:09,559
I love you too.

134
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:27,169
Gosh. Please buy my vegetables. I'll give you a good price.

135
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,979
Did you get stung by a bee again?

136
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
What? Yes.

137
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,919
You brought a lot of bracken ferns today.

138
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,350
Gosh, you have ginseng too. They are quite valuable.

139
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,960
- I was lucky. - I see.

140
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,118
Gosh, you did a good job growing them. They're big.

141
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:46,129
I gave them fertilizer, so they grew well.

142
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:48,029
You've always done a good job.

143
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,560
- How are your crops? - Gosh.

144
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,299
Goodness, my legs.

145
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,800
Oh, my legs!

146
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,169
- Goodness. I'm sorry. Are you okay? - Oh, my. No, not my crops!

147
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,609
Goodness.

148
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,868
- This is awful. - You have to be more careful...

149
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:01,879
when driving.

150
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,749
Gosh. You're not supposed to sell your crops...

151
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:09,219
on the side of the street.

152
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,778
This is illegal.

153
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:13,790
You don't pay taxes. You only accept cash. You know?

154
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,359
What's going on?

155
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:27,899
- Take the money. - Gosh. Thank you.

156
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:29,840
Here. Take it.

157
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:31,909
I'm good.

158
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,609
Take it.

161
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,469
- Why don't you pick one first? - Let's see.

162
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,070
- This one? - I want to pick this card.

163
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,638
- That looks good. - I can't see it.

164
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,009
- Which one will it be? - Here are your drinks.

165
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,279
Enjoy.

166
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,879
Ms. Hunter.

167
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,190
- Ms. Mok. - Yes.

168
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,759
There's something I have to tell you.

169
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,959
You're here.

170
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,729
- Hey, you have a lot of customers. - Yes.

171
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,999
You said you needed to talk to me. What is it?

172
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:33,799
What? Nothing.

173
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,840
I'll tell you later. It can wait.

174
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,739
This is good.

175
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,739
That drink is really popular these days.

176
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,350
Come back and have the drink again.

177
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,249
- I won't be coming here again. - What?

178
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,149
Somehow,

179
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,859
we ended up staying friends despite our past.

180
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,859
But I can't be a friend to you anymore.

181
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,330
I came to say goodbye.

182
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:09,100
Thank you for everything.

183
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,609
I mean it.

184
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,310
I didn't do anything.

185
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,249
I couldn't be there for you when things were tough.

186
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:20,950
No.

187
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
You weren't physically with me, but you had always been with me.

188
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:26,519
I never stopped thinking about you.

189
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,219
I only thought about getting better, so I could go and see you.

190
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,790
That's what kept me going.

191
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:33,659
And I got to do that.

192
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,629
Sol Hee.

193
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:42,539
If we run into each other on the street,

194
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,800
let's smile and say hello.

195
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:49,779
Goodbye.

196
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
Kang Min.

197
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:55,249
Thank you for everything.

198
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:20,909
What do you think?

199
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:24,879
Well, it's nice.

200
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,108
But the song is geared toward the vocalist too much.

201
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:29,549
So we should balance it with more emphasis on the instruments.

202
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,018
No, my vocal part must stand out more during the chorus.

203
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,789
The thing is, your chorus isn't that good.

204
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,419
- I know you practiced. - No.

205
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,488
But it wasn't a huge improvement.

206
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,060
All right. Let's move this part like Young Jae said.

207
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:41,898
Can you add another instrument there?

208
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:44,059
- No, not there. Here. - You'll barely hear my voice then.

209
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,128
- No, the instruments must... - Let's increase the volume here.

210
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:48,128
The overall balance of the song is important.

211
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:50,139
- The overall balance is important. - No.

212
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:53,670
- Let's do a group cheer. - Okay.

213
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,479
- You got this, Ethan! - You got this, Ethan!

214
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:06,289
That's enough. Just tell her already.

215
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,489
What if Ms. Hunter cries for real?

216
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,689
What if she tries to stop me from leaving?

217
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,590
What am I going to do then? I'm a softie.

218
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:20,670
- You're here. - Hey...

219
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:41,018
- Ms. Hunter. - Yes.

220
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:43,190
I think I need to...

221
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:47,359
quit my job here.

222
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:49,029
What?

223
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,200
- Why? - Well, the thing is,

224
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:55,840
Syaon offered me a job to be her bodyguard.

225
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,070
Really? Hey, that's great.

226
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,509
Yes, but...

227
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,950
- aren't you sad? - Syaon?

228
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,319
- The singer who sang "Spoiler?" - Yes.

229
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,819
That's so fascinating! Congratulations!

230
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,590
Okay. Thank you.

231
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,159
- Sol Hee. - Yes?

232
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,700
- I have a question. - What is it?

233
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,639
You washed them in the same load, right?

234
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,600
- Then what? - You should separate them.

235
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,209
Separate them how?

236
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,939
White clothes, black clothes,

237
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,908
coloured clothes, and towels. Like this.

238
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:40,109
Gosh. Who separates their laundry into that many groups?

239
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:42,479
- I can't do it. - I'll do it for you from now on.

240
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,850
- Sure. - Okay.

241
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,290
Did you order something?

242
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,059
I didn't.

243
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,229
It wasn't me either.

244
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:56,460
Sol Hee!

245
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
Oh, no.

246
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,728
- What are we going to do? - What should I do?

247
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:01,998
Wait.

248
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:04,399
- I should hide that first. - Okay.

249
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:06,869
- Yes. - Oh, no.

250
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,179
- Sol Hee. - Yes?

251
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,239
Can you see me?

252
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:14,908
Yes, I can. I can see you very clearly.

253
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:17,450
Hurry up. You should stay in my room for now.

254
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,060
Right. His shoes.

255
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,399
What are you doing here? You didn't even call.

256
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,670
Come on. You know that I never call before visiting you.

257
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,639
You should get used to this.

258
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,278
What are you doing?

259
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,638
Go back to your house. Or go to that man's house.

260
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,850
I just ran away from that man's house.

261
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:49,179
What? Is something wrong?

262
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,220
I ran away...

263
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,850
because I just couldn't bring myself to kiss him.

264
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,388
Gosh. Why are you talking about that here?

265
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:02,699
Hey, your dad was dressed in such shabby clothes.

266
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,699
But he looked a lot sexier than that guy who covered himself...

267
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,869
in designer clothes.

268
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,200
You met Dad?

269
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,839
All he has is money. All your dad has is a handsome face.

270
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,670
Gosh, these two guys are making this so difficult for me.

271
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,778
Then you can meet...

272
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,049
a handsome guy who's also rich.

273
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,519
Hey, why would he want to date me unless he's crazy?

274
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,779
He could date any woman he likes.

275
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,519
I thought...

276
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,989
your dad and I got a divorce...

277
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,029
because I thought he had no affection for me...

278
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,800
and was embarrassed that I was an ex-convict.

279
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,699
I couldn't get a decent job...

280
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,499
because I was convicted of fraud.

281
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,368
Back then, I thought it was all your fault.

282
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:48,580
So I hated you.

283
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,339
I thought I would feel better...

284
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,749
when I extorted money out of you.

285
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:58,690
But after realizing why your dad divorced me.

286
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,290
my resentment disappeared. I didn't need any money for it.

287
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:15,129
When I was young,

288
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,539
I was glued to the railing in the balcony...

289
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,239
and wondered when you would come home.

290
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,439
I only waited for the sound of your heels.

291
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,279
Back then, I didn't have any friends.

292
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,609
So I wanted to play with you.

293
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,179
I didn't send you to prison on purpose.

294
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,250
I wouldn't have been able to play with you then.

295
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:43,159
Hey, you're coming with me tomorrow.

296
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,629
To go where?

297
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:48,330
I need to talk to your dad in person.

298
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,668
You should go alone.

299
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:52,938
This is something you two have to talk it out.

300
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,939
I need you there, so your dad doesn't lie to me.

301
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,509
But I haven't been able to hear people's lies lately.

302
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,649
Gosh, forget it.

303
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,749
Let's meet at 10am tomorrow. Okay?

304
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,649
No, Mom, I really can't hear people's lies anymore.

305
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,289
- Okay? - Don't stand me up. Okay?

306
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,688
Meet me at 10am.

307
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,719
But...

308
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,569
Hey, you heard everything. Right?

309
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,669
You should go tomorrow.

310
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:30,780
If you're there, your parents will be more honest.

311
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,480
If it goes well, they might even make up.

312
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Sol Hee.

313
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:53,029
You harvested a lot.

314
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,530
What? This is not much.

315
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,000
Dad.

316
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:00,109
Mom didn't do it.

317
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:03,810
What on earth are you talking about?

318
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Well,

319
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:10,148
she did enter a hotel with another man.

320
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,219
But they left after having a meal.

321
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,490
Did your mother put you up to this?

322
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:18,459
To find me and tell me her excuse?

323
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:21,829
Nothing will change.

324
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,030
It's true that she went to the hotel because of money.

325
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,198
Since you're here, have some noodles before you go.

326
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:29,199
This is unfair!

327
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,339
You told everyone you got a divorce because I cheated on you.

328
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,979
And you're playing the victim.

329
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,449
This isn't fair for me.

330
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,448
Coming here to see me...

331
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:45,149
will give the wrong idea to the man you're dating now.

332
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:47,850
Go back down. And live happily with that guy.

333
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,159
Did he mean that?

334
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:53,760
Why are you using her like a lie detector?

335
00:19:54,189 --> 00:19:56,458
She has to listen to people's lies to make a living.

336
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:57,529
Don't you even pity her?

337
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,070
I'm the most pitiful person in the world right now.

338
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:03,239
I got sick and tired of living a poor life with you.

339
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,269
So I dated dozens of rich men.

340
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,340
But I'm here again!

341
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,939
Yet, again,

342
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,809
I found you and came to see you...

343
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,349
when your life is the definition of poverty.

344
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,080
So I pity myself the most for being so stupid like this!

345
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,100
- Mom! - I'm sorry.

346
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,369
I'm sorry, you jerk!

347
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,080
Do you think you can live here?

348
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,749
You'll see bugs all the time.

349
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,448
You can't even take a warm shower in the morning.

350
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,619
You can't get your favourite food, pork belly, delivered either.

351
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:01,358
I can buy you a small apartment.

352
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,129
No. I'm not taking anything from you.

353
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,169
See? You're living like this because you have too much pride.

354
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,469
Do you know why you're living here?

355
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,468
What? Nature healed you?

356
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:13,070
Gosh, don't be ridiculous.

357
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,540
You just ran away!

358
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,108
It's because you didn't think...

359
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,608
you could live a good life like other people.

360
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:21,178
Because you're ashamed and feel small compared to other people,

361
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,319
you're living your life in hiding like this!

362
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,218
You're the last person to judge me!

363
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:27,349
You deceived goodhearted people and scammed them!

364
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,590
You mooch off rich men as if you have no pride.

365
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,529
I'd rather live like this than live like you.

366
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,590
Gosh, stop it.

367
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,530
I can't hear people's lies anymore.

368
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,800
So everything you're saying sounds sincere to me.

369
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,899
I'm really upset. So stop fighting.

370
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:44,898
- Sol Hee. - Why do you say...

371
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:46,109
hurtful things to each other?

372
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,540
Why are you treating each other more harshly?

373
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,129
Do Ha.

374
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,639
It was so scary.

375
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,179
I couldn't hear their lies at all.

376
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,609
So they could have meant everything they said.

377
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:31,919
A lot of people don't know how they really feel.

378
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,789
Sometimes, they say things, not knowing...

379
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,290
if they mean it or not.

380
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,689
Sometimes, they know they're not being honest as they speak.

381
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,889
So they regret saying such things.

382
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,260
I'm sure your parents didn't mean what they said.

383
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,609
I went there, thinking things might work out between them.

384
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,609
But I couldn't have been more wrong.

385
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:57,209
But good job.

386
00:22:58,209 --> 00:22:59,310
I'm glad you went.

387
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,020
Aren't you hungry?

388
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,559
(Tteokbokki)

389
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,590
Tteokbokki?

390
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,459
Sure.

391
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:40,989
The police...

392
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,560
decided not to detain you while investigating your case, right?

393
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Yes.

394
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,689
I'm going to comply with the police and pay for what I did.

395
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,040
I'm selling the house where I used to live...

396
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,240
because I like this place better.

397
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:00,540
This apartment reminds me...

398
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:02,939
of the place where we lived when you were little.

399
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,919
I was thinking the same thing.

400
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,790
You were always very mature even when you were little.

401
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,290
You rarely stressed me out while growing up.

402
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,658
You never once caused trouble when you were in school...

403
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,500
and always got good grades without me telling you to study.

404
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,399
You were a good son,

405
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,300
but I was not a good mother.

406
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,409
You were a cool mom...

407
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,080
who was good at her job.

408
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,050
I wonder what our lives would've been like...

409
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,949
if I were an ordinary mother who visited you once in a while...

410
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,619
to fill your fridge with food.

411
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:54,629
That does not suit you.

412
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,169
You know, Mother.

413
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:08,840
I'm seeing someone.

414
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,580
I know.

415
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,609
I saw her face, although it was from afar.

416
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:15,719
When?

417
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,649
When there was some kind of festival in this neighbourhood.

418
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,119
You seemed really happy.

419
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,159
I didn't want to disturb you, so I just left quietly.

420
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,230
Don't make her uncomfortable by telling her to meet me now.

421
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:38,240
If you two decide to get married, then you can introduce me to her.

422
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,340
Seung Ju.

423
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,619
I'm sorry I made you live as Do Ha.

424
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,830
I should get going.

425
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,139
- Okay. - Oh, right.

426
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:13,270
What's her name?

427
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:16,379
I should know her name, at least.

428
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,340
Sol Hee.

429
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,850
Her name is Mok Sol Hee.

430
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,379
All right. I'll remember that.

431
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,969
Will this be enough?

432
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:51,310
Oh, Dad.

433
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:55,750
Come on in.

434
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,290
- Take a seat. - Hey.

435
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:05,929
Is it true that you can't detect lies anymore?

436
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:09,500
Yes.

437
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:13,469
Are you all right?

438
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,800
I've gotten used to it.

439
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,570
Although I had a hard time when you and Mom were fighting.

440
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:21,070
Sorry about that.

441
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,409
Mom said she thought you lost all your affection for her...

442
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,719
because she was an ex-con.

443
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:32,179
That's why she said she wanted a divorce.

444
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,419
I got the wrong idea when I saw her walking into a hotel,

445
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,730
and she misunderstood where I was coming from.

446
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,429
My goodness.

447
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,530
Mom doesn't seem happy at all these days.

448
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:52,000
She's about to marry a man she doesn't even love.

449
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:56,179
Stop her, Dad.

450
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,080
That day, she went to see you hoping to reconcile with you.

451
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,919
Even if we get back together, we'll split up again.

452
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:07,649
I don't have a knack for earning money,

453
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,020
but for your mother,

454
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,760
nothing's more important than money.

455
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:18,699
Don't worry about us. Just focus on your own life.

456
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,899
Now that you can no longer detect lies,

457
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,469
you can try to find joy and happiness in the mundane.

458
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,540
What about you, Dad? Are you happy?

459
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,080
Of course, I am happy.

460
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:35,050
That's not a lie, is it?

461
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:38,080
This feels so weird.

462
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,619
This is my first time hearing you ask such a question.

463
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,069
(CEO Sa Ji On)

464
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,070
Oh, this.

465
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,070
- It means nothing. - Sorry?

466
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:05,179
I have shares in the company,

467
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,209
so I was somehow appointed the CEO of the company.

468
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,020
But I'm an artist, you see.

469
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,989
I have no interest in running the company,

470
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,619
nor do I have a knack for it.

471
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,530
I'm like a puppet CEO.

472
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,600
I'm relieved to hear this because you were born to be a singer.

473
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:26,499
Anyway, you already quit your job at the café?

474
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,570
Yes.

475
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,969
Oh, no. I don't know when I'm going to release my next album.

476
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,570
- Pardon me? - Well, that's okay.

477
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:35,369
You can start working right away.

478
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,079
But you're taking a hiatus at the moment.

479
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,449
What's there for me to do?

480
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,649
The practice room, the recording studio, the gym, and home.

481
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,549
That's where you can find me these days,

482
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,020
but some weirdos keep following me around.

483
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,919
They even take weird photos of me and post them.

484
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:52,320
Really?

485
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,929
From now on, I'll stay right by your side and protect you.

486
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,399
Don't worry about a thing.

487
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,939
I have to say, this place feels empty without Chi Hoon.

488
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,179
I know. I agree, Ms. Hunter.

489
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:14,349
But I'm no longer the Liar Hunter.

490
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,580
Don't you think it sounds weird that you keep calling me "Ms. Hunter?"

491
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,050
Well, you keep calling me Kassandra too.

492
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:22,520
Come on. It's no big deal.

493
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:26,689
Sol Hee.

494
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,659
Dad.

495
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,659
Oh, hello.

496
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,330
I must...

497
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,669
meet your mother.

498
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,949
Hi, Mom. Where are you?

499
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,550
Me? I'm in the middle of selecting my wedding dress right now.

500
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,719
Hey, can you meet me...

501
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,350
at the café at Palace Hotel at 7pm today?

502
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:56,219
Why?

503
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,590
The man I'm marrying wants to meet you.

504
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,689
He said he'd bring his sister too.

505
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,899
Why should I meet them?

506
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,199
Besides, I can no longer detect lies.

507
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,299
- Actually, Mom... - Just come!

508
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,769
They want to meet you.

509
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,968
Drop by, even for just five minutes.

510
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:13,340
- Okay? See you then. - Mom.

511
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,080
Well, you should just go there with your father.

512
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,750
Face the problem head-on.

513
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,159
Go there with Dad?

514
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:33,659
Sol Hee.

515
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,359
Oh, say hi. This is my dad.

516
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:42,030
Hello! It's nice to meet you.

517
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,469
I'm Kim Do Ha, Sol Hee's boyfriend.

518
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:52,040
Oh, I see. Nice to meet you.

519
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,020
You're handsome.

520
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,990
Do Ha, can you help me?

521
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,888
Yellow will brighten his complexion.

522
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:06,959
Yellow?

523
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:08,790
Nice.

524
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,600
Is it too bright?

525
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:12,829
How about pale blue? It'll look refreshing.

526
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,499
Oh, let's see. That's nice.

527
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,570
What do you think?

528
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,340
No. A jacket will make him look more dashing.

529
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,240
- How about this navy jacket? - Oh, I like this suit.

530
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:24,010
Is this too dark?

531
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,310
Then how about this jacket...

532
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:30,019
- With this shirt? - and this white shirt?

533
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,419
Yes, they look nice together.

534
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,918
The colours look great on him.

535
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:34,250
Dad, what do you think? Look.

536
00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:36,718
Forget it. This doesn't suit me.

537
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:39,459
The size is perfect for you. You'll look dashing in these.

538
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,560
- Yes. - Try these on.

539
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:43,959
Aren't these clothes very expensive?

540
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,000
No. Hurry up and try them on.

541
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,029
- But... My goodness. - Try them on.

542
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,070
Hurry.

543
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,090
Can I have the comb, please?

544
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,600
Thank you. The scissors too.

545
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:19,669
Sir, I'll give you a bold cut.

546
00:33:22,969 --> 00:33:23,969
Oh, my.

547
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,310
Where did you learn to do this?

548
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:32,040
Oh, my mom ran a hair salon in the neighbourhood where I grew up.

549
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:35,678
So I watched what she did and picked up the skills.

550
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,080
Sol Hee, come here for a moment.

551
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:39,449
What's up?

552
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,619
Which one's the prettiest?

553
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,619
Great idea. I felt like something was missing.

554
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,060
I think your mother will like a fancy design.

555
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,429
This one is really pretty.

556
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,399
But my mom won't like it.

557
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,270
My mom will prefer something bigger.

558
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,310
Something glamorous.

559
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,550
- This one's nice too. - Yes.

560
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,480
My goodness.

561
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,588
Hey, this is not good.

562
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:15,349
We should just be honest with her.

563
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,860
- No. - Why not?

564
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,988
If I tell her I've been divorced, she'll ask me why I got a divorce...

565
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,259
and keep bugging me.

566
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,928
Besides, I never registered my marriage certificate.

567
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:23,999
So on paper,

568
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,730
- I've never been married. You know? - Goodness. You're being ridiculous.

569
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,299
Gosh.

570
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:31,469
Hyang Sook! Have a seat here.

571
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
This is my sister.

572
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,579
Hello, I'm Cha Hyang Sook.

573
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,238
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

574
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,650
- Please have a seat. - Thank you.

575
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,219
Now, it's hitting me...

576
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:46,350
that we are becoming a family.

577
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,790
By the way, where's your daughter?

578
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:51,819
Oh, she'll be here shortly.

579
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,559
She said she'd be here soon.

580
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,860
- I see. - Okay.

581
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:58,529
You picked the right woman. Goodness.

582
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:03,969
She seems nice.

583
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,339
Isn't she a good catch?

584
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,739
Yes, you picked a good one this time.

585
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:10,079
- I did a good job, right? - Yes, well done.

586
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,779
My goodness.

587
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,048
- Isn't she pretty? - Yes.

588
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:16,949
- She seems like a nice, quiet lady. - Right?

589
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,419
This is the best decision you've ever made.

590
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,219
- Aren't you proud of me? - Yes, I am.

591
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,869
Here's your Americano.

592
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,809
Here's your lemon tea.

593
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,209
Thank you.

594
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,049
Thank you.

595
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,818
- Have some tea. - Thank you.

596
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:54,948
This is why it's nice to order the same thing...

597
00:35:54,949 --> 00:35:57,118
- for everyone. - Yes, totally.

598
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,989
It's a hassle to deal with servers asking you what's for who.

599
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,829
When your daughter gets here, let's go have some beef.

600
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,568
There's a steak house across the street.

601
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:12,639
They dry-age their meats. It's to die for.

602
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,770
Sure, sounds good.

603
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:20,249
You see, I really don't need anything.

604
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,580
I just want to see the two of you live a happy life together.

605
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,080
But I have a favour to ask.

606
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:29,048
When I go on a trip with my family,

607
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:32,419
could you take care of my Min Soo?

608
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,959
Min Soo?

609
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,199
- Yes, he's her cat. A Persian cat. - Yes.

610
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,400
This is ridiculous!

611
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,839
What was that?

612
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:49,738
She's allergic to cats.

613
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:51,610
What? Who is this man?

614
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,749
Are you talking to us?

615
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,349
She hates sour stuff, so she doesn't even put vinegar in her Naengmyeon.

616
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,379
How could you order lemon tea for her?

617
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,150
And what? Dry ageing? Forget it.

618
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,789
She likes pork better than beef.

619
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,819
Pork belly!

620
00:37:07,029 --> 00:37:09,388
- My gosh. What is going on here? - He knows nothing about you.

621
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:10,560
You're going to marry this man?

622
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:16,369
Hyang Sook, who is he?

623
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,908
Why are you here?

624
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:21,309
How dare you show up here?

625
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,440
- My gosh. - What's happening?

626
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,779
I came here to save you.

627
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
What on earth is he saying?

628
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,080
Instead of marrying a man like him,

629
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,889
you should just marry me again.

630
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,659
Marry me.

631
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:02,980
No, I don't want to get back together with you!

632
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:15,790
I don't want to get back together with you!

633
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,179
Goodness.

634
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,650
Well done. You made the right choice.

635
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,659
That's a lie, Mom.

636
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,389
You do want to go back to Dad.

637
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,810
Without you, I have no choice but to live like this.

638
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,080
Please save me.

639
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,889
My gosh!

640
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:34,269
Oh, dear. I knew this would happen, you fool.

641
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,739
Just stay single.

642
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,778
Come with me!

643
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:39,480
- Wait, sister. - Come on.

644
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,349
(My Dear Do Ha)

645
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,689
Well done, Sol Hee.

646
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,290
- That must've been stressful. - Yes.

647
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,460
I was getting used to it, but it all came back.

648
00:39:55,889 --> 00:39:59,060
I'm no longer sure if this is a good thing. I don't know what to think.

649
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:00,569
What's wrong with me?

650
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:02,069
It's natural to feel that way.

651
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,770
Anyone would feel that way.

652
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:08,540
Where are you?

653
00:40:09,569 --> 00:40:10,610
I'm almost home.

654
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:13,210
I miss you.

655
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,779
I'll stay up to wait for you. Hurry home.

656
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,920
Drive safely.

657
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,989
(My Dear Do Ha)

658
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:30,259
You really got the ability back?

659
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,928
Yes.

660
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,469
You're pretty! You're prettier than me.

661
00:40:37,069 --> 00:40:39,369
Hey. What the...

662
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:41,040
So it really is true.

663
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:46,580
Hold on. Does it mean we can start accepting VIP clients again?

664
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:49,278
No, I just want to run the café as it is now.

665
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:50,778
Whether I can hear them or not,

666
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:52,049
I want to just ignore them from now on.

667
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,919
Well, if you want to work with a real shaman,

668
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,960
you can find another job.

669
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,529
No, I'll just stay here.

670
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,658
Really? Why?

671
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:06,730
That's because...

672
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,040
I like working with you, Ms. Hunter.

673
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,569
Is that right,

674
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,980
Ye Seul?

675
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:25,779
Yes!

676
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,449
Sol Hee.

677
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:36,060
I can't believe it!

678
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:03,119
When you sing that part, you have to make it sound more rhythmical.

679
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,559
Stay on the beat until the end.

680
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,819
Okay, got it.

681
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,159
We'll try that again.

682
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
It's much better, right?

683
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,009
Yes, it sounds much nicer.

684
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:25,278
I liked that. What do you think?

685
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:26,880
Can I try it just once more?

686
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,409
- Once more? - I think I can do a better job.

687
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:31,549
All right, then.

688
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,350
All right.

689
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,219
My, this is perfect for breakfast.

690
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,960
You have to watch what you eat, so I picked something light.

691
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:53,069
- It's good. - Yes, this is tasty.

692
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,080
I'm worried.

693
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,409
Oh, because of myself, not you.

694
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,948
You wrote such a great song. What if it doesn't do well because of me?

695
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:04,019
Gosh, you're at it again.

696
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,749
Hey, just eat this.

697
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,989
Be quiet, will you?

698
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:09,718
Ethan, it looks like you need a confidence boost...

699
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:11,060
before your album comes out.

700
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:14,130
Go climb a mountain and yell at the top of your lungs.

701
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:27,810
Goodness!

702
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,940
You should just kill it!

703
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,738
You always let them go.

704
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:35,278
They think you're letting them out for a walk, so they all come back.

705
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,580
They're living things too. How could I kill them?

706
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,020
Hello!

707
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:46,190
Oh, you're that writer. What brings you here?

708
00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:48,029
Oh, I'm...

709
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,929
My gosh. Hello.

710
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:56,069
I'm the writer of the show, "I Live in Nature."

711
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,799
Well, I'm here because...

712
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:03,068
You know, the spicy noodles you made for us the last time.

713
00:44:03,069 --> 00:44:05,310
I came back for more.

714
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,178
You came all the way here on this hot day just for the noodles?

715
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,879
If you sell it, you'll make a fortune.

716
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,020
Nonsense.

717
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,888
You see, I've worked on many shows about discovering good restaurants.

718
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:17,919
I'm telling you. I've never had such delicious spicy noodles.

719
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,959
I gave you the recipe that day.

720
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,758
Right, I tried following the recipe, but it didn't taste the same.

721
00:44:22,759 --> 00:44:25,059
Goodness. Write it down.

722
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,000
One spoon of gochujang and...

723
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:30,369
Sorry. Do you really think we'll make a fortune...

724
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,670
if we sell it?

725
00:44:37,779 --> 00:44:39,380
- Here. - Thanks.

726
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,249
This is what's been keeping me busy.

727
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,850
My gosh. Well done.

728
00:44:46,279 --> 00:44:47,819
I'm a little worried.

729
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:51,560
He put his faith in me and worked so hard.

730
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:54,290
What if his album doesn't do well?

731
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,559
I'll know once I take a listen.

732
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,069
I've been a jazz musician for 20 years. You can't fool my ears.

733
00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:02,929
Shall we listen to it now?

734
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:06,638
Listen to it when you're alone.

735
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:08,868
I will, but I want to listen to it now too.

736
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:10,809
No, I'm embarrassed.

737
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,509
Goodness. Don't be.

738
00:45:12,909 --> 00:45:14,880
My gosh. Why are you embarrassed?

739
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:18,650
You won't stop me now?

740
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,020
No, I won't.

741
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,908
("Ethan Makes His Solo Début")

742
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,609
("Born Out of Collaboration With Songwriter Kim Do Ha")

743
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,479

(Yeonseo Bakery)

746
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,459
The 2024 KMA.

747
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,199
The show is already nearing its end.

748
00:46:07,429 --> 00:46:09,330
My gosh. Already?

749
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:11,869
Yes. The highlight of the Korea Music Awards still remains.

750
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,569
We will now announce the winner of the Best Composer Award.

751
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,709
Artist Syaon will present the award.

752
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,810
Please welcome her with a big round of applause.

753
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:31,719
Hello, I'm Syaon.

754
00:46:34,029 --> 00:46:36,388
Syaon, it's been a really long time.

755
00:46:36,389 --> 00:46:38,600
Could you briefly tell us what you've been up to?

756
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,868
I've been studying music...

757
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:42,670
and working on my new album...

758
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,569
while catching up on sleep and eating well.

759
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:48,408
When I was busy promoting my previous albums,

760
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:49,869
I wasn't sure what to do...

761
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:52,380
and what I should show you...

762
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,650
Oh? Ms. Hunter.

763
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,350
Why are you so late?

764
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:02,690
This way, please.

765
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:04,459
I must say, it suits you.

766
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,029
Well, I'm a truly successful fan.

767
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,699
A successful fan?

768
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,869
I can admire my star while working.

769
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,170
Here.

770
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:19,969
Let's go.

771
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:24,710
Please look forward to my future endeavours too.

772
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,750
All right. The 2024 KMA Awards.

773
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,580
I will now announce the winner of the Best Composer Award.

774
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,520
The winner is...

775
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,489
Kim Do Ha. Congratulations.

776
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:46,860
Yes, congratulations.

777
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,399
Kim Do Ha has led Ethan's first album...

778
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,799
and single to great success,

779
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,068
- Thank you. - and he has won this award...

780
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:56,739
for two consecutive years.

781
00:47:56,969 --> 00:47:59,638
No one else has accomplished this at the Korean Music Awards.

782
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:01,710
Congratulations on winning the award.

783
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:21,799
Thank you.

784
00:48:22,929 --> 00:48:24,199
To be honest,

785
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:28,040
Kim Do Ha is a made-up name that I used to hide from this world.

786
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:31,839
When I was hiding behind my name,

787
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:35,210
I didn't know that a moment like this would occur to me.

788
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:40,150
Come to think of it, life is a process...

789
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:43,520
of trying to believe in the things that are hard to believe.

790
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:46,159
Trusting that our dreams will come true...

791
00:48:46,759 --> 00:48:48,429
and that love will last forever.

792
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,330
Stuff like that.

793
00:48:54,569 --> 00:48:57,799
Music gave me this award, but someone's trust...

794
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,869
allowed me to come up here to accept this award.

795
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:05,440
I will share my joy of winning this award...

796
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,349
with the person whom I love,

797
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,279
who trusted me more than I trusted myself.

798
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,150
Thank you.

799
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:28,469
Gosh. This trophy is so pretty.

800
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:30,670
How pretty.

801
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,739
- What? - You're really pretty.

802
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,409
Come on.

803
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,850
We met a few hours ago. What are you saying?

804
00:49:43,049 --> 00:49:45,419
How could you become even prettier in just a few hours?

805
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,219
That's enough.

806
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:49,449
Since when were you two a thing?

807
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,218
Us? It's been 580 days.

808
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:54,360
What? Has it really been that long?

809
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:56,330
It has only been a week since we started dating again,

810
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,529
but we had originally broken up on day 573.

811
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:01,770
To be exact, 573 days and 12 hours have passed.

812
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,339
Why are you so detailed?

813
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:08,409
What?

814
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:11,039
Look at how sweet he is. Two drumsticks.

815
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,409
You should learn from him.

816
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,980
Hey, I didn't tell you this yet, did I?

817
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,179
My uncle owns a cottage in Donghae.

818
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,719
What do you think of going on a couple trip together?

819
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,448
- I'm down. - Me too.

820
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,089
- That sounds nice. I'm down. - I'm in.

821
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,250
I'm down.

822
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,920
It's a "couple" trip.

823
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:26,589
You're single.

824
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,400
What do you think of participating in "Single Alone?"

825
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:34,829
- What? - "Single Alone."

826
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:35,868
- That sounds like a good idea. - It suits your image.

827
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,138
- That's a good idea. - I can't do that.

828
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:39,698
Everyone in the country will be able to see my face.

829
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:40,838
No. Never.

830
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:42,609
Why not? You're handsome.

831
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,540
- He's right. - Yes.

832
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,750
What part of me is handsome?

833
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,020
Your eyebrows are cool.

834
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,379
- Yes, your eyebrows are handsome. - Yes.

835
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,920
- Your eyebrows are cool. Yes. - Yes.

836
00:50:57,089 --> 00:50:59,388
- Goodness. - Oh, my.

837
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,289
- Gosh. - Amazing!

838
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:02,528
- Gosh. - Goodness!

839
00:51:02,529 --> 00:51:03,629
He has a nice chin too.

840
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,730
Let's film a support video ahead of time.

841
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,000
Let's do it.

842
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:10,399
Please give Kwang Soo lots of love,

843
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,839
and I hope you find a nice partner.

844
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,338
He's good at eating jjajangmyeon.

845
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:15,369
Please contact him for the "Single Since Birth" special.

846
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:21,548
- Yes, he has attractive eyebrows. - He's handsome.

847
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:23,149
- Good luck. Let's get married! - He's attractive.

848
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,350
That's good enough.

849
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,448
Then should we congratulate him...

850
00:51:26,449 --> 00:51:28,349
- on his marriage ahead of time? - Yes, we should.

851
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:30,249
- Congratulations on your marriage! - On your marriage!

852
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,459
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

(Luni Tarot Café)

854
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:34,960
Gosh. This feels nice.

855
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,860
Cho Rok.

856
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,529
Congratulations on getting back together with Oh Baek.

857
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:43,469
Gosh. Please.

858
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:47,239
I'm not quite sure about it yet. I don't know if this is right.

859
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,940
Well, if you need any help, let me know.

860
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:57,149
What can you do to help? Tell me.

861
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,880
What can you do?

862
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:02,949
But I just want to follow my heart now.

863
00:52:08,029 --> 00:52:09,830
How nice!

864
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:21,909
Hey.

865
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:25,139
Do you want to grab something to eat tomorrow with me and Ethan?

866
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,509
I have something to do tomorrow. Sorry.

867
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,549
I see. What is it?

868
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:35,389
There's someone I didn't get to mention during my acceptance speech.

869
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:01,679
I saw you on TV.

870
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:05,080
I like your song.

871
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,759
There was something I really wanted to tell you.

872
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:16,960
That day...

873
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,060
You know...

874
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:22,770
On the day of the happening with Eom Ji.

875
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,638
I looked at Eom Ji's phone...

876
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:29,239
to send a text to Eom Ho.

877
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,150
There was a text that Eom Ji had typed up...

878
00:53:37,279 --> 00:53:38,350
to send to you.

879
00:53:40,819 --> 00:53:41,850
To me?

880
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:44,860
Yes.

(Seung Ju)

882
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:13,719
Seung Ju,

883
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:15,949
there were not a lot of good things...

884
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:18,388
about my life.

885
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:21,060
(Delete)

886
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,500
It was cold, dark,

887
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:27,869
and hopeless like this night sea.

888
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:31,770
I always thought the sea was black,

889
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,000
but after meeting you,

890
00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:36,409
I realized that it was blue.

891
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:40,080
I'm not dying because you left me.

892
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,850
I was able to survive thanks to you.

893
00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:46,250
I hope you don't blame yourself.

894
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,949
I want you to forget about everything and be happy.

895
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:52,460
I mean it.

896
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:10,810
She only had thankful things to say about you.

897
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:14,009
She really wanted you to be happy.

898
00:55:16,049 --> 00:55:17,080
I...

899
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:20,889
really wanted to tell you that.

900
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,130
Thank you.

901
00:55:41,469 --> 00:55:42,540
Hello.

904
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,420
Full tank. What?

905
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,449
You.

906
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:01,258
I've only been seeing your face in the news. It's nice to see you...

907
00:56:01,259 --> 00:56:02,489
in person after a while.

908
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,258
Goodness. I can't believe...

909
00:56:06,259 --> 00:56:09,729
you're working here after doing all of that. Gosh.

910
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:11,199
Do you have enough money for food?

911
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:13,469
Did you eat yet? Gosh.

912
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,409
What?

913
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,778
- Gosh. - What a nice car.

914
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:26,949
- You punk. - But shouldn't you sell this car?

915
00:56:27,279 --> 00:56:29,388
You should just worry about not plagiarizing, you punk.

916
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:31,119
My gosh. You punk. What?

917
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:32,819
That punk.

918
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:36,060
Hey, I'm Park Moo Jin, you punk!

919
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:39,529
Hey, give me the receipt! This is a corporate credit card, you punk!

920
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,940
- Excuse me. - Yes?

921
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,178
Can we get three glasses of iced Americanos?

922
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:53,339
- Three? - Yes.

924

Welcome.

926

Are you the Liar Hunter?

927
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:11,429
Yes, I am.

928
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:14,528
But I don't work as a Liar Hunter anymore. It's been a while.

929
00:57:14,529 --> 00:57:16,170
I know that.

930
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,969
But my daughter-in-law is a bit strange.

931
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:24,170
Can you meet her just once, please?

932
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:25,779
I beg of you.

933
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,948
Thank you. Have a nice day.

934
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:31,750
- Thank you. - Please come again.

935
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:39,860
Shouldn't you send a notice to everyone?

936
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,129
- A notice? - To the VIPs,

937
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:43,588
saying you're not a Liar Hunter anymore.

938
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:45,460
I think you should call them...

939
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:47,560
or email them to explain.

940
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,829
I still receive calls from people,

941
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:51,568
begging to meet you.

942
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:53,469
They even offered to pay double or triple the amount.

943
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,040
Do you know how hard it is to say no?

944
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:07,889

We must look good together.

947
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:13,159
Some people even think you're my boyfriend.

948
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:15,830
- Isn't that funny? - Yes, I guess.

949
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,630
It's funny.

950
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,799
- It's funny? - Gosh.

951
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,639
How could I even dare to be involved with you like that?

952
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:28,009
Of course, it's funny.

Sorry?

Please don't make jokes like that.

- You're so cute. - Sorry?

957
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:46,759

959
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:06,080
Right. Please wait just a little bit.

Here. I have 2 regular sizes and 1 large.

- Enjoy. - Mom.

969

What do you mean?

970
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,469
I came by myself on purpose.

971
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:32,298

Do Ha sent something again.

"Father and Mother,"

979
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:53,060
"I'm sending you this because it's good for controlling blood sugar."

980
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:56,130
"Always stay healthy. From Kim Do Ha."

981

Honey. Try it.

982

Goodness.

983
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:11,179
- How does it taste? - It's supposed to be good for you.

984
01:00:11,739 --> 01:00:12,810
Right.

985
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,649
Send my congratulations to my son-in-law...

986
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:16,749
for receiving his award.

987
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,250
What do you mean by "son-in-law?"

988
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:21,419
Has he not asked to marry you yet?

989
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,049
What are you saying?

990
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:24,959
Who would get married this early?

991

If you're going to, just get it done quickly.

992
01:00:26,759 --> 01:00:28,258
He's so handsome and competent.

993
01:00:28,259 --> 01:00:29,559
You don't want another woman to take him away.

994
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,960
She's right. His looks are on another level.

995
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,269
Can we get more kimchi?

996
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:38,400
Yes, coming right up!

997
01:00:38,569 --> 01:00:40,439
- Here's the kimchi. - You can just rest.

998

I'll help.

999
01:00:41,509 --> 01:00:42,908
When will the food be ready?

1000
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:44,540
One moment, please!

1001
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,980
You should've gone with me. Why did you go alone?

1002
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:52,020
If you were to go...

1003
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:56,420
Never mind.

1004

Do Ha, why are you smiling?

1005
01:01:05,529 --> 01:01:07,060
Are you glad that Manchester United is losing?

1006
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,368
When did I smile?

1007
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:12,239
See? You're smiling even now.

01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,750
No one has scored yet.

01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,118
You look like you're about to fall asleep.

01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,290
No.

1014
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:38,960
Gosh, that person is sitting super close.

1015
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:41,830
He can probably see the players' pores.

1016
01:01:44,029 --> 01:01:47,100
I wonder how it feels to watch a match in those seats.

1017
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:48,469
Should we go to a match too?

so no one can truly tell...

1080
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:35,549
what's inside just by knowing whether they're lying or not.

1081
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:16,429
Do Ha, do you know that?

1082
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,060
What?

1083
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:21,770
People think we're like a fox and rabbit.

1084
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:25,469
- Who? - Just everyone we know.

1085
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:28,910
Then I must be the rabbit.

1086
01:08:29,509 --> 01:08:31,779
Why are you the rabbit? I'm the rabbit.

1087
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:33,740
Sometimes, you're like a fox.

1088
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,949
- When? - Even now. You look like a fox.

1089
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,248
- I look like a fox? - Yes.

1090
01:08:38,249 --> 01:08:40,450
You look like a fox though.

1091
01:08:41,379 --> 01:08:43,119
I'll be the fox then. You can be the rabbit.

1092
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,958
Fine. Let's do that.

1093
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:45,959
Okay.

1094
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,929
People have reached out to me for many reasons.

1095
01:08:58,129 --> 01:09:01,169
But I have decided not to use this ability anymore.

1096
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:05,839
It used to be my job to find the truth for people.

1097
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:07,980
But rather than focusing on the truth,

1098
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,879
I want to focus on the things that I trust and love.

1099
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:17,219
Thank you for everything.
