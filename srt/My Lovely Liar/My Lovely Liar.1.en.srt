(Year 2018)

(Episode 1)

12
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,060
Sir, how could you do this to me?

13
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:04,269
It really wasn't me. Please spare me.

14
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,200
You.

15
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:07,939
Please spare me. It wasn't me.

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,039
- Keep talking. - Please spare me.

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,209
- Please spare me. - You punk.

18
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:13,910
You little...

19
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,708
I should just end you.

20
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,679
- Sir, I'm sorry. - How did Grizzly Bears...

21
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,850
find out about the location? How did they show up there?

22
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,119
How?

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,550
I'm sure one of you has to be the rat.

24
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:27,789
- Spill it. - Please spare me.

25
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:29,089
No?

26
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:33,289
Gosh. It will be fun to watch you fall off from here.

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,100
- Hey, let's cut it. - Sir.

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,428
- Hey. - No!

29
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:39,130
- Spare us. - Please!

30
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,139
- What are you doing? - Spare us!

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,339
- Don't do it. - No!

32
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,970
- Sir. - Spare us!

33
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,640
Don't cut the rope!

34
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:47,910
Hey, wait.

35
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,119
Who is it?

36
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,720
Hey, shut it.

37
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,319
Spare us.

38
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,829
Did you think that was going to work?

39
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,630
Seriously. Goodness. You guys are unbelievable.

40
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,239
You'd better stay up all night. Got it?

41
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:17,069
- Yes, sir. - Excuse me.

42
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:20,739
I'm here for a case. Who's my client?

43
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,509
Are you the Liar Hunter?

44
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:28,479
Right.

45
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,190
- Yes. - "Yes?"

46
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:33,090
Gosh. I can't believe this.

47
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,389
"A Liar Hunter who serves the spirit of truth."

48
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,430
Kid, give me a second.

49
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:47,840
Chairman Min. Is this kid the Liar Hunter?

50
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,239
She looks like a kid.

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,340
If you put in the wrong address in your GPS, beat it.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,039
- Or I'll scold you. - Okay.

53
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,349
Look at you. How dare you glare at me?

54
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,419
Get your hand away from her.

55
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,590
Step back.

56
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,759
My apologies.

57
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,069
This way.

58
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,180
Did you leak the intel to Grizzly Bears?

59
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:41,590
No.

60
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,829
Did you leak the intel to Grizzly Bears?

61
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,370
No. I really didn't do it.

62
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,780
- No! It wasn't me. - Gosh.

63
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,340
This is unfair.

64
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:07,979
I see.

65
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,220
You should have waited until I got here.

66
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,120
They didn't do it.

67
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:16,689
Sir, how can you trust anything that kid says?

68
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,729
We've never met her.

69
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,059
Hold on.

70
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:26,929
Was it you? The one who leaked the intel to Grizzly Bears?

71
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,200
What are you talking about?

72
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,340
Answer her.

73
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,840
- Sir. - Cut it out. Answer her now.

74
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,979
Of course, it wasn't me.

75
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:46,390
Of course, it wasn't me.

76
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:50,020
Of course, it wasn't me.

77
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
It was him.

78
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:02,939
What are you talking about?

79
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,439
Who do you think you are? Do you have evidence?

80
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,979
If I say so,

81
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,010
then it is.

82
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:18,019
Sir, no. Come on. When Grizzly Bears were beating you up,

83
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,020
I broke my leg, trying to protect you.

84
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:24,189
How could you take that kid's word over mine? She's a stranger.

85
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,160
Are you sure you broke your leg?

86
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,299
Shut your mouth, kid.

87
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:34,600
If you lie to me, I'm going to kill you.

88
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:42,608
You jerk. You stabbed me in the back.

89
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,910
- No, boss. - How dare you?

90
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,549
- Beat him up. - Sir. No.

91
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,119
You're not going to kill him, right?

92
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,059
- That's not it. - No.

93
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:01,900
Did you just lie to me?

94
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,859
Boss.

95
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:06,369
I'll make sure he's at least breathing once I'm done.

96
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,410
Take it.

97
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,510
Thank you for your help.

98
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,809
Guys.

99
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,350
The Liar Hunter is leaving.

100
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:26,150
Say goodbye to her.

101
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,160
That was so scary.

102
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,839
It's Group F of the 2018 Russia World Cup.

103
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,679
The match between Korea and Mexico will begin shortly at midnight.

104
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,418
Although the game is scheduled at a late hour...

105
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:59,248
By the time I get to Gwanghwamun, the game will be over.

106
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:00,889
To our team,

107
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,319
this match against Mexico will be a turning point.

108
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,928
- What? - If we lose to Mexico as well,

109
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:09,400
we will not be able to advance after the group stage.

110
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,830
So we must give our all to the game as there is no way to turn.

111
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,368
I knew it. There's a soccer fan even in the countryside.

112
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,410
We must show our fighting spirit...

113
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,058
They ought to do that. Or they might mess it up.

114
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:38,530
- They must stop it once. - Right.

115
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,798
Oh, no.

116
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,260
(Mexico: 2, Korea: 1)

117
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:45,499
We're not going to advance to Round of 16.

118
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:49,840
Okay. The referee has blown the whistle.

119
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,350
Bye.

120
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,479
(Mountain Park Motel)

121
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:10,090
Kid.

122
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:12,530
I'm going to kill you today.

123
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:23,299
Darn it.

124
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,680
Kid, how far do you think you can go?

125
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,550
Come on.

126
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,759
Gosh.

127
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,869
Hey!

128
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,570
Darn it.

129
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:01,580
Come back here!

130
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:06,749
Come back!

131
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,389
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,489
The earliest bus to Seoul, please.

133
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,769
Please. Start driving already.

134
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,519
Don't kill me.

135
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,790
What are you doing here?

136
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,019
- I'm going to Seoul. - Look.

137
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:49,658
Eom Ji sent me a message at dawn...

138
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:51,658
that she was going to kill herself. But I can't reach her.

139
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:52,729
What's going on with her?

140
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,300
We broke up.

141
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,340
Did you guys fight again?

142
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,699
Forget it. We'll talk about this later.

143
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,768
Let's go and look for her.

144
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:07,710
No. I'm not leaving.

145
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,779
How could you be so brazen?

146
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,648
She forgave you for cheating on her when you were in Seoul.

147
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,580
Is she a joke to you?

148
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:17,320
I never cheated on her.

149
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,489
- Goodness. - What's going on?

150
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,988
Did you meet a new girl in Seoul? Is that it?

151
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:25,129
No!

152
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:28,898
Stop him.

153
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:29,930
You jerk.

154
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,399
Get up. You're coming with me.

155
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:37,570
- Get up. - Darn it. Stop it.

156
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,509
The bus can't leave because of you. Get off the bus.

157
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,810
Did you bring your new girlfriend from Seoul with you?

158
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:50,319
Gosh. Fine. I'm his new girlfriend.

159
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,249
He's mine now. So get lost!

160
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:57,859
Darn it.

161
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,259
- Get out of my way! - Come on.

162
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:02,029
Sir, let's go.

163
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,028
Sit down, everyone.

164
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,399
- Gosh. - Let's go.

165
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:08,269
We should go now.

166
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,440
(Hakcheon General Bus Terminal)

167
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,670
You don't need to thank me.

168
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,600
I just needed to get to Seoul fast.

169
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,479
You should have fought back.

170
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:01,090
Letting him punch you like that made you look like a real cheater.

171
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,619
What do you know?

172
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:07,759
If I say so, then it is.

173
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,639
This is what I do.

174
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:22,379
(A Liar Hunter who serves the spirit of truth)

175
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:01,149
(Year 2023, 5 years later)

176
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:49,859
Gosh, I'm not a kid.

177
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,560
It's embarrassing to do this in front of you.

178
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:54,629
Is it embarrassing?

179
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,869
Why? I like it.

180
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,540
Stop it.

181
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,749
How are things in bed?

182
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:07,979
Pardon?

183
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,618
You must sleep together too.

184
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:10,779
Are you satisfied sexually?

185
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,190
Come on. I'm kind of curious too. Why don't you answer her?

186
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,830
Yes.

187
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,229
I'm satisfied.

188
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,600
I see. It's true.

189
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,269
Pardon?

190
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,149
Gosh. Are you sure you two are cousins?

191
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,378
You guys don't look alike at all.

192
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,019
You two don't look alike at all.

193
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:48,989
I hear people resemble each other once they fall in love.

194
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,420
Is it because you guys aren't in love?

195
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,560
What?

196
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:57,800
Let's be honest. You're dating her for her money, aren't you?

197
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,299
Ji Hye, do I have to answer her ridiculous question?

198
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,469
Well, you see, she's quite blunt.

199
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,108
She's just worried about me.

200
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:09,139
Just tell her she has nothing to worry about.

201
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,109
Okay?

202
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,109
Yes, I'll be honest.

203
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,749
I did start this relationship by the lure of her money.

204
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,450
But now,

205
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,159
I love her.

206
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,229
You're telling the truth again.

207
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:34,600
It sounds like you can tell...

208
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:37,869
if something is true or not just by hearing the answer.

209
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,970
Yes. If I say so, then it is.

210
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:44,040
Gosh.

211
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,950
When should we get married?

212
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,949
I don't want a small or modest wedding...

213
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,989
because I'm getting married late.

214
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,259
I want my wedding to be grand and extravagant.

215
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,320
Do whatever you want.

216
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:00,959
Thank you.

217
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,659
Say hello to each other. You'll be seeing each other a lot.

218
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,470
My name is Jang Ji Hoon.

219
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:08,070
We haven't met. Nice to meet you.

220
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,940
You two have met before.

221
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,739
What?

222
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,149
Have you two met before?

223
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,820
Are you okay?

224
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,560
Gosh. That startled me.

225
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,790
I was so startled that I dropped the honorifics.

226
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,358
I'm sorry. I'll clean that up right away.

227
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,670
Right. Clean it up right away.

228
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,170
Are you pregnant?

229
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:45,170
What?

230
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,239
No.

231
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,749
Did you get her pregnant?

232
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,279
What nonsense is that?

233
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,988
Honey, I've been trying to be patient so far.

234
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:01,819
This cousin of yours is being so rude.

235
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,960
The baby is his.

236
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:22,109
I'm sorry.

237
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,939
Let's just apologize to her and ask for her forgiveness.

238
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,949
Gosh. What's wrong with this woman?

239
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:30,419
Hey.

240
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,188
How dare you accuse me of something I didn't do?

241
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:35,520
You turned me into a piece of trash!

242
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:38,560
Didn't I tell you? If I say so, then it is.

243
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,959
Gosh.

244
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,388
Hey, you've been getting on my nerves.

245
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:43,730
I can't believe this girl. You little...

246
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,669
Darn it.

247
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,340
I'll get going now. Thanks for the meal, Ji Hye.

248
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,340
- You... - One more thing.

249
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:55,209
Honey.

250
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:58,649
Her or me?

251
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:00,979
Whom do you love more?

252
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,050
No. Which one of us is more attractive as a woman? Tell me.

253
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:06,718
Ji Hye, what on earth are you doing?

254
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,118
Answer me!

255
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,719
It's you, of course!

256
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:13,429
That's a lie.

257
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:14,929
- What... - Gosh.

258
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,369
No. Listen to me.

259
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:21,770
No, seriously.

260
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:23,669
No!

261
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,669
(Luxury Brand Rental)

262
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:30,878
We just finished here.

263
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:33,479
But she will take a while to wire us the rest of our fee.

264
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,208
Ms. Choi isn't doing so well right now.

265
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:38,119
No. I just checked, and she wired us the balance.

266
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:41,519
I knew it. Rich people are indeed different.

267
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,290
They settle the bills even when things are hectic.

268
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:44,989
I'll wrap it up then.

269
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,090
Okay. Thanks.

270
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,530
By the way, what do you do with all the money you save up?

271
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:54,029
I'm only following the calling of the spirit.

272
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,128
I'm not interested in luxury goods.

273
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:57,139
- I know you like money. - What?

274
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,909
Well, I mean,

275
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:02,379
you raise your fee every year.

276
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:06,009
The price of things is going up...

277
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,350
and so does your salary.

278
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,718
Right. Then you should perform a ritual.

279
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,290
I hear people make a fortune off performing rituals.

280
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:13,949
Rituals?

281
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,219
Rituals don't mix well with me.

282
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,159
How can rituals not be good for shamans?

283
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,629
By the way, weren't you possessed by the spirit during the ritual?

284
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,100
Well, yes.

285
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,179
The truth is, I was never possessed by a spirit.

286
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:43,649
My ability to tell lies from the truth...

287
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,790
was created in my mother's womb.

288
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,358
Please listen to my prayer.

289
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:57,099
Give my child a gift.

290
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,869
A gift good enough for her to make a living out of.

291
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,540
Dear Father.

292
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,708
I never caught a break in my life. I seek your blessing now.

293
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,550
Please give my child a chance at having a decent life.

294
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:16,619
I desperately pray to benefit from some of that blessing.

295
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,520
Amen.

296
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,129
The source of all suffering is money.

297
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:29,958
So don't give my child any artistic gifts...

298
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,000
as they require money.

299
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,030
Give her a gift that doesn't require money.

300
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,368
It is our fault.

301
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,909
It's my fault.

302
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,109
It's my fault.

303
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:43,980
I never got lucky with my parents or my husband.

304
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:45,709
It's my fault.

305
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:49,218
At least, I can get lucky with my child.

306
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:51,580
You can do that much for me, can't you?

307
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,020
- Oh, no. - Gosh.

308
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,789
- Are you all right? - Are you okay?

309
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,458
The moment she got pregnant,

310
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:03,628
she started to pray...

311
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,629
to all kinds of deities that were known in our world every day.

312
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,139
I don't know which deity was responsible.

313
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,609
But I was able to tell lies from the truth.

314
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:22,618
Two dollars? Come on. Let me have it for a dollar.

315
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:24,319
Gosh, don't be absurd. I can't do that.

316
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,118
- Give it to me for a dollar. - No. I won't sell it to you.

317
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,448
- Mom. - No.

318
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:30,760
- What? - I want the turtle doll. Please?

319
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,859
I'll get you that doll later. Okay?

320
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,459
Gosh, you're not going to buy it for me.

321
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,439
How much longer must we live like this?

322
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,010
Things will get better soon.

323
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,219
"Soon?" When will that be?

324
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,649
I want to eat pork belly.

325
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:02,719
Hold on.

326
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:11,459
Why don't you eat this, thinking that there's pork belly inside?

327
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,100
Open wide.

328
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,969
It's not like anchovies will turn into pork, wrapped in lettuce!

329
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:28,749
It's okay.

330
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,350
Mom and Dad aren't fighting.

331
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,060
I could sense that...

332
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:41,230
lies were bad...

333
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,699
and sad.

334
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:50,139
(Mok Sol Hee)

335
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,209
Mom told me to become a prosecutor so I could put the skill to use.

336
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,678
Hey, I heard your guesses were always accurate.

337
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,178
Then I wouldn't be in this mess now.

338
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,378
Hey, wait. My tutor asked me...

339
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:03,918
to be his girlfriend once I enter college.

340
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,149
Do you know if he's telling the truth?

341
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,719
Go to college, then you'll know.

342
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,060
Hey, I'll pay you!

343
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,330
That was when I realized it.

344
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:18,159
Fifty dollars. What do you say?

345
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,799
That there could be...

346
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,129
an easier and faster way than becoming a prosecutor.

347
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:24,139
Make it 70.

348
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:31,239
However, no one believed that I practically had a lie detector...

349
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,580
inside my ears,

350
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,510
so I decided to pretend that I was a shaman.

351
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:42,259
- Hello, I'm the Liar Hunter... - Are we going to talk here?

352
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,958
Can't we go somewhere quiet?

353
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,959
Pardon me? That's...

354
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,030
Let's sit down.

355
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:55,968
I contacted you because...

356
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:58,840
And as I gained more clients who had a lot of money,

357
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:01,368
I needed a place that was more private and secretive.

358
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:04,009
- All right. In 1, 2, 3! - In 1, 2, 3!

359
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,379
- All right, 1, 2! - There.

360

(Luni Tarot Cafe)

361
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,480
- Nice. - That's great.

362
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,320
However, my power doesn't work unconditionally.

363
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,530
I can only detect lies that I hear in person.

364
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,659
That's why I have no choice but to travel around to hear their voices.

365
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:33,369
Date me!

366
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,109
It's "Please date me."

367
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:38,109
You always get that part wrong.

368
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,108
My, I see that you're now a fan too.

369
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:41,980
You even memorized the fan chant.

370
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,520
Only because you always play the song and sing along.

371
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,949
That's how everyone becomes a fan.

372
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,590
Do you want to go to the awards ceremony with me later today?

373
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,290
I heard Kim Do Ha might be there too.

374
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,159
Who is Kim Do Ha? A rookie singer?

375
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:56,000
My goodness.

376
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,559
Ms. Hunter, he is not a rookie singer.

377
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,730
He's a songwriter who exclusively works with Syaon.

378
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,869
She even has her own songwriter now?

379
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,080
But the thing is, he's quite a character.

380
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:12,409
No one knows anything about him other than the fact that he's a guy.

381
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,280
He doesn't meet anyone.

382
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,820
Even when he has virtual meetings,

383
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,520
he joins the call with his face covered.

384
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,119
He sure is an attention seeker.

385
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:25,019
Why would an attention seeker show up with his face covered?

386
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,389
He likes to look mysterious.

387
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,760
So people are curious about him even though he's just a songwriter.

388
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,060
His strategy surely worked.

389
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,480
(Syaon)

390
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,709
Excuse me. Could you blow into this?

391
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,230
Stop!

392
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,669
- Hey! - Behind you. Hey!

393
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:41,969
Be careful!

394
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:44,138
Hey, hurry up and call for backup!

395
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:46,209
(DUI Checkpoint)

396
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:20,468
Where is it?

397
00:27:20,469 --> 00:27:23,208
Where's my love?

398
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:26,980
Hey, where are you? Let's fall in love

399
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,080
Never be sad

400
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,388
This is all for you, let's fall in love

401
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:40,329
- Syaon! - Syaon!

402
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,999
This is all for you, love

403
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,369
It can't be undone

404
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,299
(Composer Kim Do Ha)

405
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,799
This is all for you, let's fall in love

406
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,009
It can't be undone

407
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,909
It's all for you, love

408
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,820
All right. Thank you for the amazing performance, Syaon.

409
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,349
Every performance needs...

410
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,688
the artist's beautiful voice, cool choreography,

411
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,859
and most importantly, a good melody that will make them shine.

412
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:15,229
The 2023 Korea Music Awards.

413
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,760
Now, let's find out the winner of the Best Composer Award.

414
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:20,770
I will announce the winner.

415
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,230
The award goes to...

416
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,840
Congratulations. Kim Do Ha!

417
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:30,310
(Composer Kim Do Ha)

418
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,949
Is Syaon going to accept the award on his behalf?

419
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,090
(Tonight's your night, Syaon!)

420
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:51,300
Well...

421
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,770
Thanks to Mr. Kim Do Ha,

422
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,840
an ordinary girl named Sa Ji On...

423
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:00,469
has been reborn as Syaon.

424
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:03,280
I will make sure...

425
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,179
he gets this award...

426
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,709
along with my grateful heart.

427
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:09,980
Mr. Kim Do Ha.

428
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,379
Congratulations!

429
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:23,929
Smile.

430
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,668
- One, two, three! - All right, stay like that.

431
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:28,230
One, two! Smile.

432
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,178
(Best Composer Award, Kim Do Ha)

433
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:37,780
- Hello. - Hey, you're here.

434
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:40,250
I want a song by Kim Do Ha.

435
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:42,510
Does anyone know how I can reach him?

436
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,879
He only works with Syaon, doesn't he?

437
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:49,820
I heard even people from J Entertainment had to wait in line.

438
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:52,320
I'm sure he won't accept external requests.

439
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:54,189
Kim Do Ha.

440
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,899
What is the reason he won't show his face?

441
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:00,530
I heard songwriting was just a side hustle...

442
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,800
and that he had to keep his identity hidden for his main job.

443
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,810
Maybe he's an agent at the National Intelligence Service.

444
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:16,639
You've watched way too many movies.

445
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,340
How about this?

446
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:20,649
I heard he was a minor.

447
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,250
A high school boy.

448
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:27,189
- Oh, my. - He's so hot.

449
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,260
Apparently, his family owns a large conglomerate or something.

450
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,458
His parents tell him to study business and not make music.

451
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:36,929
A conglomerate? Which one? S Group?

452
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,060
That I don't know.

453
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,969
But the quality of the songs he writes...

454
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:42,169
There's no way it's just a side hustle.

455
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:44,439
I heard a completely different story.

456
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,560
I heard he was a genius. A real genius.

457
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:10,830
Well, then there's no reason for him to hide, is there?

458
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,230
Savant syndrome.

459
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,570
Oh, no wonder.

460
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,540
Right. The way he arranges songs...

461
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,909
tells me that he's well-versed in classical music.

462
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,070
Syaon!

463
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:27,678
- Yes? - You know Kim Do Ha well, right?

464
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,850
What's he like?

465
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,520
Well... I don't know him that well either.

466
00:32:33,189 --> 00:32:35,688
I've talked to him on the phone and via email a few times.

467
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:37,990
Come on. Tell us just one thing you know about him.

468
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,689
The one thing I can tell you for sure is...

469
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,429
He has a nice voice.

470
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:55,639
Stop.

471
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,609
Are you playing exactly the same as the string guide I sent you?

472
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,619
Yes, we didn't modify anything.

473
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,850
The first violin. Is the E string tuned?

474
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:12,889
It's in D Sharp.

475
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:14,760
Tune it up a little more.

476
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,429
It's good now. Shall we go again?

477
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,219
We're good now, right?

478
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,089
I'm going home.

479
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:19,089
Stay just a little longer.

480
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,829
Leave now, and they'll say you've changed now that you're popular.

481
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,000
I feel completely drained.

482
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,099
I haven't eaten anything...

483
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,299
since yesterday afternoon because I had to wear this dress today.

484
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,468
I'm about to pass out.

485
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,369
You won't. I've been there and done that too.

486
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,670
Syaon!

487
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:36,678
Congratulations on winning the award.

488
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,839
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

489
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,008
Thank you so much.

490
00:34:40,009 --> 00:34:43,219
We'd like to congratulate Mr. Kim Do Ha too.

491
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,850
Could you please call him for us?

492
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:49,190
I can only contact him when I'm working with him.

493
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,360
I see.

494
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:52,488
We're managed by J Entertainment too.

495
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,790
We'd love to work with him too.

496
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,799
Hey, I'm the CEO of the agency, you know.

497
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,829
I'll ask Mr. Kim Do Ha about it.

498
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,198
- Really? Thank you. - Of course.

499
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:07,568
Why is everyone making so much fuss over that jerk, Kim Do Ha?

500
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:09,139
He rips off other songs.

501
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:12,210
Mr. Park! What do you mean he rips off other songs?

502
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,209
Why are you being like this? What if ugly rumors spread?

503
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,650
Syaon's new song.

504
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,479
The chord progression is exactly the same...

505
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,618
as that of the song I wrote three years ago.

506
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,690
My gosh. Why did you drink so much?

507
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,290
Cheer up.

508
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,529
I'm sure you'll win the award next year.

509
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,528
Hey, I have a pile of awards at home.

510
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:34,368
Do you think I'm being like this because of the trophy?

511
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:37,569
Kim Do Ha copied my song!

512
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,040
I need to ask him about it in person, so arrange a meeting.

513
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,040
Seriously, why are you being like this?

514
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:45,379
Even I have only met him a couple of times.

515
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,448
Forget it. Hey, just give me his number.

516
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:50,349
- What is it? 010... - Mr. Park.

517
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,088
- What? Is it 011? - That's ancient.

518
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:54,449
Hey, hold this.

519
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,560
Gosh.

520
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,359
- Mr. Jo. - Yes.

521
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,028
Yes, Deuk Chan. Oh. Yes, sir.

522
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:07,329
Mr. Park seems very drunk.

523
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,230
Could you take him to the men's room?

524
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:10,440
Yes, sir.

525
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,009
- Hey. - Get him out of here.

526
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:14,868
- Hello. - Hey, do you know Kim Do Ha?

527
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:16,508
- Yes, let's go. - Hey, Kim Do Ha...

528
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:18,710
What's his number? 010...

529
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,350
Oh, that's Syaon.

530
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,548
Why is she holding two trophies?

531
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:31,259
Come on. One of them is Kim Do Ha's.

532
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,928
Hey, let's follow Syaon.

533
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:38,960
Tail her quietly.

534
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,299
Get moving!

535
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,008
(I thought Kim Do Ha would be there.)

536
00:36:47,009 --> 00:36:48,169
(The award went to someone who deserves it.)

537
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,368
(Of course, the award went to Kim Do Ha.)

538
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:50,709
(I'm really curious about him.)

539
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,008
(His music is the only joy of my life.)

540
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,149

00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,529
I brought some bread from my bakery.

723
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,799
It's not because I had leftovers.

724
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,198
I made more to share with you guys.

725
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:35,069
You brought some leftover bread?

726
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,408
No, I baked some more.

727
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:39,539
- He brought some leftover bread. - I see.

728
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,579
- Thank you. - Thank you.

729
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,609
Thank you.

730
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,048
- Did we order any food? - We did.

731
00:54:44,049 --> 00:54:45,749
- Kimchi stew? - Two kimchi stews.

732
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,218
- And what else? - We ordered two?

733
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:49,749
- We ordered two. - I'm hungry.

734
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:50,790
Gosh.

735
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,198
- Seriously. - How...

736
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:06,969
- Your name is Sun Mi, right? - Sorry?

737
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,810
Aren't you Miss Korea, Jin Sun Mi?

738
00:55:08,969 --> 00:55:11,310
Are you Sun Mi? There are three of you.

739
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,679
- That wasn't funny. - I usually am. Today's not my day.

740
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,849
But you haven't been here in a while, right?

741
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:17,650
Yes, you too, sir.

742
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:19,979
What do you mean by "sir?" You can treat me like your older brother.

743
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,689
You said you would last time.

744
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,019
I did? When?

745
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,359
You're 34 years old, right?

746
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,118
- No, I'm 33 years old. - I see.

747
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,359
- She's older than you. - Hey.

748
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,159
Really? You look so young.

749
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:32,698
You have a baby face.

750
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:34,599
- I thought you were a minor. - How funny.

751
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,899
Should we clink our mugs?

752
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,139
- Cheers! - Cheers!

753
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:41,709
That's so refreshing.

754
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,369
- You must like drinking. - This place has good food.

755
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,339
- Goodbye. - See you.

756
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,080
Hey.

757
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,819
Those ladies want my number. Should I give it to them?

758
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:56,850
- Let's do a cheers. - Cheers.

759
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:00,489
Now, we just need Cho Rok to come.

760
00:56:01,389 --> 00:56:03,359
Our neighborhood is filled with kids,

761
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,500
so they think anything over 20 dollars is expensive.

762
00:56:05,659 --> 00:56:08,469
Let's be real. If the same menu is sold in Gangnam,

763
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:11,068
no one would complain even if it's 40 dollars.

764
00:56:11,069 --> 00:56:12,368
Exactly.

765
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,739
We all use the same coffee beans too.

766
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,639
But the cost of espresso in Gangnam starts at five dollars.

767
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,338
Come on. The shrimps in your pasta...

768
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:22,309
are so tiny.

769
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,580
I thought they were small salted shrimp.

770
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:26,419
If you charge 40 dollars for that in Gangnam,

771
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,150
people will trash your restaurant. Seriously. Gosh.

772
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,289
Hey, don't just laugh. Listen.

773
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,389
You should also invest in interior design.

774
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,028
These days, people aren't paying for the coffee beans in the coffee.

775
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,089
It's the price of the seat.

776
00:56:37,259 --> 00:56:38,528
When I visited your cafe last time,

777
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:40,529
all I saw outside the window was a clothing donation bin.

778
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:44,239
You expect to receive five dollars for a view like that? How shameless.

779
00:56:44,299 --> 00:56:47,469
You guys have no shame. You're the worst. Gosh.

780
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:49,670
The worst.

781
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:55,810
The worst atmosphere.

782
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,949
Nice. This is a nice table to sit at.

783
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:02,619
This is the most comfortable, right?

784
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:05,089
I told you to watch what you say.

785
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,759
Gosh. It's the three of us again? I'm sick of this group.

786
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,658
Let's just eat some bread.

787
00:57:10,659 --> 00:57:12,599
- Congrats on increasing sales. - Congrats on increasing sales.

788
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,799
- Congratulations. - Totally.

789
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,099
Why are you so pretty?

790
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,698
I recommended your shop to my friends.

791
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:17,838
We did.

792
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,468
- I'll tell you my recipe. - I'll tell you my recipe.

793
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,138
It's nice seeing you in a while.

794
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:22,468
It's nice to see you too.

795
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:23,469
We should meet more often.

796
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:25,309
We should meet here more often.

797
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:27,080
I love seeing all of you here.

798
00:57:34,449 --> 00:57:35,589
Hey, the tarot cafe owner is here.

799
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:39,460
Over here.

800
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,830
Don't be so annoying. She'll run away.

801
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,860
Why? Do you want me for yourself?

802
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:46,299
- What are you saying? - You like what I said.

803
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:48,199
How is she going to help?

804
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,869
Gosh. I don't want to sit there.

805
00:57:56,369 --> 00:57:58,639
Right. Do you want some bread?

806
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,049
- Thank you. - Sure.

807
00:58:04,819 --> 00:58:06,580
Gosh. You've gotten even prettier.

808
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,088
Didn't we say hi earlier during lunchtime?

809
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:16,230
Yes, but you're even prettier than then. It's remarkable.

810
00:58:16,529 --> 00:58:17,829
You're the eight wonder of the world.

811
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,400
How could you keep getting prettier?

812
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,529
There's something I'm curious about.

813
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,500
You know how you cover up your shop when you talk to your customers?

814
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:26,770
Why do you do that?

815
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:32,138
Well, if the content is serious,

816
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:34,380
we do it to show that they can trust us to keep their secret.

817
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,609
Then shouldn't they be visiting a specialist?

818
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,048
I don't think...

819
00:58:39,049 --> 00:58:40,948
hearing someone say stuff about a few cards...

820
00:58:40,949 --> 00:58:42,689
will be of much help...

821
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:43,989
Gosh! Sorry.

822
00:58:45,089 --> 00:58:46,159
I'm sorry.

823
00:58:46,259 --> 00:58:48,790
- This is why I don't have friends. - She's right.

824
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:50,360
Me too.

825
00:58:50,529 --> 00:58:52,230
Really? Me too.

826
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,969
Hello. It's nice to see you all.

827
00:58:58,239 --> 00:58:59,798
I'm the president of this cooperative.

828
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:03,008
I see a lot of young owners here today.

829
00:59:03,009 --> 00:59:05,778
Please give a round of applause to the owner of Boor Boor...

830
00:59:05,779 --> 00:59:06,779
for allowing us to meet here.

831
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,479
You don't need to.

832
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,548
You still have to pay for everything.

833
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:11,778
Yes, thank you.

834
00:59:11,779 --> 00:59:15,049
Before our meeting, I have an announcement to make.

835
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,488
You've all seen this before, right?

836
00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:20,389
A black hoodie and a black mask.

837
00:59:20,589 --> 00:59:23,889
He's a pervert who only approaches women who live by themselves.

838
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:26,729
If any of you live in this area,

839
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,130
please be careful whenever you go home after work.

840
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,099
Okay. Everyone...

841
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,170
(Luni Tarot Cafe)

842
01:00:17,549 --> 01:00:21,149
You can't do anything with such a weak...

843
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,250
and idle mindset!

844
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:26,588
Everyone. When I was your age,

845
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:29,758
I was fired up with passion!

846
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:30,959
I worked so hard.

847
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,060
On that note, I will propose a toast.

848
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:37,500
When I say "hot," you all should say "passion."

849
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:38,969
Hot!

850
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:46,339
What? A fire?

851
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,350
- What? - What?

852
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:50,508
- It's a fire! - There's a fire.

853
01:00:50,509 --> 01:00:52,079
- There's a fire. - There's a fire.

854
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,080
- Hurry. - A fire!

855
01:00:53,081 --> 01:00:54,989
- Go. - A fire.

856
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,548
- A fire! - A fire!

857
01:00:56,549 --> 01:00:58,118
- Move out of the way. - A fire.

858
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:00,219
What's going on?

859
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,959
It's a fire!

860
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,329
- It's a fire. - Where is it?

861
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,829
- What's going on? - It's a fire.

862
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,499
- What happened? - Where's the fire?

863
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,238
- Where's the fire? - Where's the fire?

864
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:12,368
- The fire. - The fire.

865
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:13,999
Gosh. What is it?

866
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,508
The pervert in a black hoodie and mask.

867
01:01:17,509 --> 01:01:18,678
- He went that way. - That way?

868
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:21,079
- Okay. Let's go that way. - Let's go.

869
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,380
- I thought you were the pervert. - What? I was with you guys.

870
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:26,379
Then where is the fire?

871
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,989
There is no fire.

872
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,549
I saw the pervert.

873
01:01:30,889 --> 01:01:31,988
- There's a pervert? - The pervert.

874
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:34,319
Then why did you say there was a fire?

875
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:35,829
What happened?

876
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:37,659
You heard my lie, right?

877
01:01:38,259 --> 01:01:39,329
I'm sorry.

878
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:41,730
I thought no one would help if I didn't say that.

879
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,928
Okay.

880
01:01:42,929 --> 01:01:45,869
Okay. The part-timer looks okay.

881
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:48,408
Let's report it to the police and have them deal with it.

882
01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:51,939
I think we'll be able to find him if we all look together.

883
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,109
Let's try catching him.

884
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:54,849
He's right. We should catch him, now that he appeared.

885
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:56,979
We never know who will be the next victim. Right?

886
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,579
- You're right. - You're right.

887
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,448
Miss Koreas, if you tell me your address, I'll take you home.

888
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:01,519
- It's okay. - It's okay.

889
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,149
- We should report this. - No.

890
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:04,889
- I think we can find him. Yes. - No, we need to look for him.

891
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:12,000
I got you.

892
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,569
- What are you doing? - You pervert.

893
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:15,929
Hey, you pervert!

894
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:21,270
Gosh. I'm so sorry.

895
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:22,769
- It wasn't on purpose. - Okay.

896
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:24,109
- What's with your boxers? - Darn it.

897
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,479
- Put your pants back on. - I will.

898
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,480
- I'm so sorry. - Let go.

899
01:02:26,481 --> 01:02:27,739
- All right. - I didn't do it on purpose.

900
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:29,679
Hey.

901
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:33,020
- He's over there. - The pervert.

902
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,618
Hey.

903
01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:41,928
You're still trying to look for him after what he did to you?

904
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:44,599
It's okay. The last tarot card I picked was good.

905
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,329
If I just sprayed my pepper spray properly,

906
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:48,468
I could've caught him in one try.

907
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:50,699
But why did you have pepper spray with you?

908
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:54,440
Because even the most preparations are not enough in life.

909
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,980
We caught the pervert!

910
01:02:58,980 --> 01:02:59,980
Hey.

911
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:04,150
He looks like a pervert.

912
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:10,088
- Is it him? - How scary.

913
01:03:10,089 --> 01:03:12,689
A black hoodie and a black mask. It's him.

914
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:13,859
You're terrible.

915
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,690
- Don't do this, sir. - Don't hit him.

916
01:03:17,889 --> 01:03:19,000
Why are you doing this to me?

917
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,000
It's not me.

918
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:22,900
Take off his mask.

919
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,500
You're right. Let's take a look at his face.

920
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:28,839
No, don't.

921
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:33,580
It's not him.

922
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:35,610
He's not the culprit.

923
01:03:36,049 --> 01:03:37,110
What?

924
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:39,420
How are you so confident?

925
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:44,219
If I say so, then it is.

926
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,440
If I say so, then it is.

927
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:26,759
(My Lovely Liar)

928
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,429
(A Liar Hunter who serves the spirit of truth)

929
01:04:51,049 --> 01:04:52,389
He's not the culprit,

930
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,488
- She shouldn't be able to see me. - but he's strange.

931
01:04:55,489 --> 01:04:57,960
You know he's the culprit!

932
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:00,928
Why do you always have a mask on?

933
01:05:00,929 --> 01:05:01,969
You're on the run, right?

934
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:05,338
What? He was a Liverpool fan.

935
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:06,540
Shoot. Goal!

936
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:08,670
My gosh.

937
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,779
Can you please meet Park Moo Jin just once?

938
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,739
What lie do you want to know?

939
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,849
Could it be? Kim Do Ha?

940
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,380
Hey.

941
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:21,150
It's because I think I'll kill them.
