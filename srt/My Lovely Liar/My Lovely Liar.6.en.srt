(The guardians of child actors were present at the filming.)

(Episode 6)

11
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,559
Get in.

12
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,539
What? What's gotten into him?

13
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,079
- Shouldn't you put on the seatbelt? - What?

14
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:32,319
Right. Yes.

15
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,989
By the way, where are we going?

16
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,470
Hello.

17
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,000
This way.

18
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:15,759
Why are you staring at me like that? You're making me uncomfortable.

19
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,169
Because I'm grateful.

20
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,600
You're grateful to me? For what?

21
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,299
I'm here thanks to you.

22
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,370
Was I responsible for that?

23
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,180
Yes.

24
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,880
Then I'll let you treat me to this meal.

25
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,090
- Ms. Mok. - Yes?

26
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:51,769
Are they...

27
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,870
taking pictures of us?

28
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,739
The people at the next table.

29
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,539
We should eat this now.

30
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,979
What? Is it a bad photo?

31
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,549
Let's take another one.

32
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,280
No. They're taking pictures of the food.

33
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,519
Hey.

34
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,460
Okay.

35
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,530
What?

36
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:38,780
Are you okay?

37
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:42,950
She keeps looking at us. Right?

38
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:49,989
She's checking on the customers in case they need something.

39
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,030
I don't think so.

40
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:55,900
Right? She's coming to us, right?

41
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,770
Gosh.

42
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,350
Right. People can't change overnight.

43
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,189
Let's finish the main dish quickly and go.

44
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,489
But I hear this restaurant has excellent desserts.

45
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:24,859
I know a suitable dessert shop around here.

46
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:34,128
Isn't this a bar?

47
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:35,839
(Chicken Chicken Chicken)

48
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,999
Just come with me.

49
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:42,809
Thank you.

50
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,178
After eating greasy food like that,

51
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,320
you have to eat spicy food to cleanse the palate.

52
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:51,820
But aren't you full?

53
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,220
Do you really think we're here for the food?

54
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,789
No waitresses will be staring at us here.

55
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,228
Everyone is drunk here,

56
00:05:58,229 --> 00:05:59,559
so they don't care about other people.

57
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,629
Right. Should I order Coke for you?

58
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,770
I want to drink today.

59
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,059
(Along the railroad, along the liquor)

60
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:37,200
By the way, how should I call you?

61
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,070
What do you mean?

62
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,799
Kim Seung Ju is your real name, right?

63
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,470
Kim Do Ha must be a stage name.

64
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,879
If I call you by that name outside, people might recognize you.

65
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,049
Should I call you by your real name?

66
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,820
No. Just call me Kim Do Ha.

67
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,369
Tell me.

68
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,439
Why did you suddenly tell me I should mind my own business?

69
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:19,239
Why did you suddenly leave your house?

70
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,780
You acted like a total stranger. Why?

71
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
I remembered a difficult part of my past.

72
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,350
It was a girl problem, right?

74
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,760
No. If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to tell me.

75
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,530
But it was about Syaon, right?

76
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,339
You and Syaon dated for a long time, but you guys had a bad breakup.

77
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,738
But she regretted breaking up with you rather late.

78
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,510
So she got you to come all the way to Gangneung.

79
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,080
That's it. Isn't it?

80
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,150
No.

81
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,080
Then what about the thing I saw on your phone?

82
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:04,819
There was a picture of you two.

83
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,748
You added hearts to her name.

84
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:08,090
Oh, that.

85
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,590
She did that without my permission.

86
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,799
Then Syaon had a crush on you from the beginning.

87
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:21,229
By the way, have you ever liked anyone?

88
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,809
Yes, I have.

89
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,010
Are you nice to a woman if you like her?

90
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,150
You seem cold-hearted.

91
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,779
Gosh, how beautiful.

92
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:08,279
Pardon?

93
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,080
Are you talking about the shrimp?

94
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
No.

95
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,060
Your hands.

96
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,710
You're very drunk. Eat this.

97
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:45,820
What? What does this heart mean?

98
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,790
When did you get so drunk?

99
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:53,690
What are you talking about?

100
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,029
I'm perfectly fine.

101
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,769
Hey, Ms. Mok.

102
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,639
Are you okay?

103
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,310
Ms. Mok.

104
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,450
What?

105
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,409
(Motel)

106
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
(Hotel)

107
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:19,420
Where are you taking me?

108
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,690
(Hotel)

109
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,930
Mr. Kim?

110
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,800
Is this a dream?

111
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,560
I'm home.

112
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,580
Are you all right?

113
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,269
Gosh.

114
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,909
Hey, wipe your jacket. Okay?

115
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,989
Ice cream.

116
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,830
What?

117
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:08,259
Ice cream.

118
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,070
Ms. Mok.

119
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,420
Ice cream.

120
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,330
Here.

121
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,999
More.

122
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,050
Mr. Kim.

123
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,090
You have feelings for me, right?

124
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,389
What?

125
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,920
You bought me ice cream.

126
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:12,190
You got me my favourite too. Vanilla.

127
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,300
You picked that yourself.

128
00:13:45,229 --> 00:13:46,290
Let's stop eating and go home.

129
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,330
Put in your passcode.

130
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,170
Let's see.

131
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:00,040
What?

132
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,979
Try putting in the passcode slowly.

133
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,450
There.

134
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:08,820
What?

135
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:12,049
You can't remember it?

136
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,220
Seven, zero, zero, four, two, eight. I put it in correctly.

137
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,489
Why isn't it working?

138
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:26,600
Seven, zero, zero, four...

139
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,739
Yes. We got it.

140
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,040
I thought you were a nice guy.

141
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,050
What...

142
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,080
I...

143
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:33,729
No.

(Syaon's Manager Kim Min Soo)

145
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,959
What was on Syaon's schedule today?

146
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,199
A pre-recording for "Music Show" and "Stars' Special Interview."

147
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:21,169
She's probably not herself right now.

148
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,879
What should I do? She's not answering her phone.

149
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,218
What could we do at this point?

150
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,090
Cancel all of her schedule.

151
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,790
Right. She slipped on the stage and hurt her leg a while ago.

152
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,428
Tell them the injury got worse, so she needs absolute rest now.

153
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:42,530
Give them an excuse about her health.

154
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:46,729
Why must we break up?

155
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,739
If there's something I did,

156
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,310
Will you give me one more chance?

157
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:58,209
I will be better next time

158
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:03,418
I will stop doing things

159
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,850
That you didn't like

160
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:12,659
Please come back to me and give me a deep hug

161
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,899
I like you as a singer.

162
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,469
And as a friend.

163
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,800
But not as a woman.

164
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:27,040
He likes me...

165
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:31,780
as a singer and as a friend.

166
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,679
So technically, he does like me.

167
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,320
Right?

168
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,980
- No way. - I told you.

169
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,709
I guess she loved it.

170
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,340
Hello.

(Ready-One, Ggaejukkang)

173
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:46,850
I heard oriental raisin tree tea was good for hangovers.

174
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,859
This one has it too.

175
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,879
Young Jae, I'm sorry. Can you break this bill for me?

176
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:13,549
I told you the other day.

177
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,878
I go to the bank every morning...

178
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,678
and wait in line to change them into coins.

179
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,149
I'm sorry. I'll return the favour. I promise.

180
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,249
But you always bring me bread instead.

181
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,119
I have a lot of tasty bread. Some of them are new.

182
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,369
Do you like cream buns?

183
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
What?

184
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,500
I have better cream buns at my bakery.

185
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,510
Much better than that.

186
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,080
- Okay. - Take your coins.

187
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,280
Okay.

188
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,119
Here.

189
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:51,249
This cream bun will be on another level.

190
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,250
Try it.

191
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,119
I'll eat it at home.

192
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,358
No. It tastes better when it's warm.

193
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,990
That makes a huge difference.

194
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,060
Try it.

195
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:10,799
It's really good.

196
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,810
You're really good-looking.

197
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,039
- What? - If I were to compare your face...

198
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,438
to my bread,

199
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:18,379
my face would be the bread from the convenience store.

200
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,550
You're good-looking too.

201
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:25,218
I'm happy that I can seek perfection with my bread...

202
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:26,250
at least.

203
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:30,159
By the way, you don't have a common face.

204
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,020
For some reason, you look familiar.

205
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,260
You gave me those twisted doughnuts the other day.

206
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,500
I enjoyed them.

207
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:37,699
I did?

208
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,330
Hold on.

209
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:55,009
I think I've seen you before.

210
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,319
Stop following me!

211
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,519
I was going to come here anyway. You stop following me.

212
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,049
I'm hungry. You put aside a pollack roe baguette for me, right?

213
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,050
Yes.

214
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:08,060
I'll see you again.

215
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:11,060
Oh. Bye.

216
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,639
Hey, who was that?

217
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,339
Who's that handsome guy?

218
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,409
He looks like a prince, with his milky skin and all!

219
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:22,608
You like tanned men who look good in a leather jacket.

220
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,740
No, that's my type.

221
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,949
He does have the face of a prince,

222
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,608
but I don't think he's had a lot of good food.

223
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:29,849
- Why? - Come on. What do you mean?

224
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,549
He's wearing designer clothes from head to toe.

225
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,849
The thing is, it doesn't even suit him.

226
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,320
It suits me better, don't you think?

227
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,589
If he comes here again, you have to call me.

228
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,820
- Okay? - Cut it out.

229
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,060
Give me my pollack roe baguette.

230
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,260
Hey.

231
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,770
I don't have any appointments in the morning, right?

232
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:50,469
I drank too much last night.

233
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,040
I'll be late. Sorry.

234
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,750
Gosh, I'm so hungover.

235
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:04,919
Shoot. What's this sound?

236
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,119
Ms. Mok Sol Hee.

237
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,230
Ms. Mok Sol Hee.

238
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,629
What?

239
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,800
Oh, no.

240
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,830
Is he here to talk to me about yesterday?

241
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,070
What do I do?

242
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:31,010
My gosh.

243
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:33,879
Yes. I'll just act like I don't remember anything.

244
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,949
What is it? It's still so early.

245
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,189
It's noon now.

246
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:48,859
What brings you by at noon?

247
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,669
What is this?

248
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,699
The hangover soup we had together.

249
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,540
I also picked up a few other hangover cures.

250
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,250
And...

251
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:15,090
you should change your passcode because I know the current one.

252
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,560
Wait, are you all right?

253
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,230
Your cheek here...

254
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:29,669
Oh, was it the other side?

255
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:32,340
You don't need to worry about that.

256
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:35,209
But there's another problem.

257
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,080
What is it?

258
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,619
How do I get rid of a tteokbokki stain?

259
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:47,919
What?

260
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,899
(Ready-One, Good Morning Care)

261
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,280
Sir, there's an official letter for the Criminal Investigation Division.

262
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,619
- Kang Min. - Yes?

263
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:20,719
- Oh, yes. - Hey.

264
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,319
I'll take that.

265
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,590
Oh, sure.

266
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:31,199
Great, thank you.

267
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,169
(Violent Crime Unit Team 1)

268
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,580
- Isn't she pretty? - Who?

269
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,409
Oh.

270
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,980
Everyone says she's the prettiest officer here.

271
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,619
For some reason, I've been seeing her very often.

272
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,059
Is there something going on between you two?

273
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,218
What are you saying?

274
00:25:57,219 --> 00:25:58,560
Try hitting on her if you're interested.

275
00:25:59,689 --> 00:26:00,990
Hey, look.

276
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:03,530
He's wearing slippers.

277
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,199
He must live in the area, right?

278
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:08,770
Shall I introduce you to her?

279
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,439
- Are you here to play? - No, I'll look.

280
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:16,209
Look, those slippers...

281
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:19,580
Low waves are predicted for most coastal regions.

282
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,948
Dense fog conditions are expected over the western coast,

283
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:24,979
Jeju Island, and the southern coast.

284
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,289
I never iron my own clothes like this.

285
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,289
The highest daytime temperature will reach 25°C.

286
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,888
- Expect wide temperature gaps. - Well, this was my fault anyway.

287
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:33,060
That's it for today's weather.

288
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:36,858
An A-match friendly game between the Korean national soccer team...

289
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:38,559
and Uruguay will take place in Seoul...

290
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,399
at 10pm tomorrow.

291
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,638
Uruguay's national team...

292
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:44,339
has many star players...

293
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,539
who are currently playing in the European leagues.

294
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,378
The Korean team stated that their goal was to win the game.

295
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:50,480
They're determined to win.

296
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,509
This A-match will be an all-out war...

297
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,750
I watch soccer games alone.

298
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,490
Why? Don't you have friends who love soccer?

299
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:02,889
No, it's not that. I don't have any friends.

300
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:04,759
I don't have any friends either.

301
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,560
But I don't watch every soccer game alone.

302
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:09,300
I go to a pub to watch A-match games.

303
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,969
I like the vibe where everyone is rooting for the same team together.

304
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,849
- My gosh. - I had to iron my clothes,

305
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,050
so I figured I should iron this too.

306
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,850
Thank you.

307
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:35,350
Thanks to you, my hangover is gone.

308
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:53,270
Are you busy tomorrow?

309
00:27:54,209 --> 00:27:55,209
Sorry?

310
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,179
Tomorrow?

311
00:27:58,179 --> 00:27:59,449
Well...

312
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:02,080
I have to work and... You know, the usual stuff.

313
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,419
Why?

314
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,750
What time do you get off work?

315
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,889
Around 8pm?

316
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:11,959
Around 8pm?

317
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,889
But I'm the owner, so my schedule is flexible.

318
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,629
I can wrap up a little earlier.

319
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,199
Later would be better.

320
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,439
Oh, I've been a little swamped, so I might have to work late...

321
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:30,539
Gosh. What are you doing?

322
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,510
You need to pick a date and time before you ask me out.

323
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:35,379
Who asks a woman out on a date like this?

324
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:45,820
Oh, my word choice was wrong. Instead of "date,"

325
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,959
I should call it an appointment.

326
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,429
Tomorrow at 10pm. How about we meet at a pub with a big screen...

327
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,800
and watch the national soccer team's game together?

328
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,040
- A soccer game? - A warm-up match.

329
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:03,980
You said you always watched the national team's games at a pub.

330
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,080
Did I say that?

331
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:09,619
I'll find a good place.

332
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:17,760
- You're not up for it? - It's not that.

333
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,629
I know a place that has a big screen.

334
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,189
You don't need to look into it.

335
00:29:27,469 --> 00:29:28,469
Talk soon.

336
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,050
Nice.

337
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,179
What shall I wear?

338
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,780
No.

339
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,850
Not these.

340
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,520
Hey.

341
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,850
Did I just see you screen my call?

342
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:27,689
What's up? Is it about the money?

343
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:31,230
Hey.

344
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,929
I heard you came to the office without covering your face.

345
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,499
Goodness. You think you can get away with anything because my brother...

346
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,939
takes care of it whenever you cause trouble?

347
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,169
You've got some nerve.

348
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,810
What will you do if the company goes bankrupt because of you?

349
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,879
Who'd want to listen to songs written by a murderer?

350
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,480
Use your brain and think.

351
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:58,719
Right.

352
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,859
If people find out that a murderer wrote the songs,

353
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,859
you can't make money either. Am I wrong?

354
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,939
I refuse to give you more money.

355
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,810
I believe I've repaid you and don't owe you anything anymore.

356
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:21,949
We should thank you.

357
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,250
Okay. Then please consider it in a good light.

358
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:28,590
Okay, will do.

359
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:33,459
Mr. Jo?

360
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:37,500
Mr. Jo! Are you all right?

361
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:40,270
I'll call you back later.

362
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,560
What was that?

363
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:15,669
Deuk Chan.

364
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,340
(Watta Logistics)

365
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,080
Were you trying to kill me?

366
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,520
Too bad. You failed.

367
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,060
What brings you here?

368
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,260

Who's calling? Answer it.

370
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,340
I asked you why you were here.

(J Entertainment, Songwriter Kim Do Ha)

372
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,040
This guy is Kim Seung Ju, isn't he?

373
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,719
That's not Seung Ju.

374
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,350
He's just one of our songwriters.

375
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:12,158
Kim Seung Ju played the piano too,

376
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,589
so I'm sure he can write songs.

377
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,989
I'm sure he's still playing the piano in Germany.

378
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,899
Classical piano music and K-pop are very different.

379
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,570
Is that so?

380
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:22,999
I don't know stuff like that.

381
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,839
There was something fishy about this guy. That's why I'm here.

382
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,469
You're wrong.

383
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,878
Even if I'm right, you can't say so.

384
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,749
You knew that and still came all the way here?

385
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,750
Yes.

386
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,449
To see how you'd react.

387
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:44,219
And I saw it.

388
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:46,760
Bye.

389
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,740
Gosh, that startled me.

390
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:01,369
Who are you?

391
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,639
What happened here?

392
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,540
Did you do this?

393
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,780
I'm sorry.

394
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,178
Hey, Deuk Chan.

Hey, Do Ha.

00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,250
Everything's okay, right?

397
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,089
Yes. Why? What's going on?

398
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,219
Are you in Yeonseo-dong now?

399
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:50,619
Yes.

400
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,389
Okay.

401
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,088
Well, I'm saying this just in case.

402
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:58,560
Don't visit the office again without calling me first.

403
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:01,799
Last time, I had no choice.

404
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,039
I'd never cause you harm.

405
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,068
Hey, that's not what I meant.

406
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:07,338
Because of your impostor,

407
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,368
so many people want to know what you look like.

408
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:11,940
We don't want to deal with any headaches.

You know what I mean, right?

410
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,179
- Yes. - All right. I have to go.

00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,920

412
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:33,330
Come and try our salad.

413
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,069

I was just giving out some flyers.

425
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,049
Right. But why did you put the flyer on someone else's car?

426

Why not?

467

The café is just a cover-up.

468
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,310
There's a shrine hidden inside.

469
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,709
A shrine?

470
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,409
It means that she's a shaman.

471
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,580
But they're keeping it on the hush-hush,

472
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,380
so it can't be a normal business.

473
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,080

00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,719
It's your birthday. You should have some seaweed soup.

480

This is nothing.

- Do you like croissants? - Yes, I do.

490
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,089
My wife had stomach cancer.

491
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,529
She became a vegetarian to heal herself with food.

492
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,730
After that, I became a vegetarian too.

493
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:10,169
Oh, I see.

494
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,139
And you're a vegan too, Bo Ra.

495
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,779
I'm so happy that we're compatible in every aspect.

496
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:33,460
What time do you have breakfast?

497
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:35,829
I usually wake up at 6am and...

498
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,860
What?

499
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,569
You wake up at 6am?

500
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,068
I don't mind eating bread for breakfast.

501
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:45,170
Although I can't do it every day.

502
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,609
A couple of days a week is fine, if you're tired.

503
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,439
However, make sure...

504
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,480
to only get whole wheat bread as it's low in calories.

505
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,750
Whole wheat bread?

506
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:04,388
I must say, you're quite chubby...

507
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:07,659
for someone who only eats rabbit food and whole wheat bread.

508
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:10,699
But then again, elephants are herbivores too.

509
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,730
Sorry?

510
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,069
Oh, I was just kidding.

511
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:19,270
A big belly means you're a generous man.

512
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,810

514
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,380
Here.

515
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,118
All right. Let's do this!

516
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,020
One per person!

517
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,758
Nice!

518
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:41,889
- Nice one. - Let's go.

519
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,559
We're the police.

520
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,500
Stop what you were doing and put your hands up.

521
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:48,729
- What? - Darn it.

522
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,069
Don't move. Stay still!

523
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
Who are you? Hey.

524
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:54,940
What's your deal?

525
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,139
Why that...

526
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,980
Darn.

527
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,619
Come here.

528
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,949
What? Don't move.

529
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:16,960
Darn you.

530
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:23,940
(Let's leave for the Maldives!)

531
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,639
The Maldives, my foot.

532
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,338
- Let's just go to prison, okay? - Hurry up.

533
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,710
Hey, you're bleeding.

534
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,579
Take pictures of the scene and take them to the station.

535
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,650
Move.

536
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,759
It looks too lame.

537
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,330
All right.

538
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:05,679
No, not this. It's not appropriate for cheering.

539
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:11,679
Right.

540
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,480
Gosh, no.

541
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,049
Am I dolled up too much?

542
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:43,619
This won't do.

543
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,420
I'll be waiting on the first floor.

544
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:51,759
Darn it.

545
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,819
You don't look like you're off to watch a soccer game.

546
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,389
Well...

547
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:24,690
I had to dress up for work today,

548
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:28,159
and I was too busy to get changed.

549
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:30,960
What about you?

550
00:45:32,759 --> 00:45:33,869
I just...

551
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:36,100
wanted to win your favour.

Let's go. We're running late.

553
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,678
(Closed Temporarily)

554
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:52,949
(We're going to watch the warm-up match at the arena!)

555
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,048
(Hof Hof)

556
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:57,360
What do we do now?

557
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:05,159
I think it's over there. Right?

558
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,429
I think so.

559
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:08,400
Let's hurry there.

560
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:14,969
We have no tables available at the moment.

561
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,469
Oh, really?

562
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:18,639
- Let's try someplace else. - Sure.

563
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,509
The third batter, Kim Hyun Soo.

564
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:26,349
He hits the ball.

565
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,589
Off he goes!

566
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:31,258
- Goodness. - Amazing!

567
00:46:31,259 --> 00:46:33,690
- Yes! - Great.

568
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,059
- Let's go! - This is it!

569
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,729
He's great!

570
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,600
Way to go!

571
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:51,040
- South Korea! - South Korea!

572
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:54,310
- South Korea! - South Korea!

573
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,618
They have a big screen. Should we watch it here?

574
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:03,250
- Go! - Goodness.

575
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:04,960
- Come on. - Nice.

576
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,329
- Nice move. - Go.

577
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:09,629
- Go! - Come on.

578
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,330
There are a lot of people watching.

579
00:47:14,429 --> 00:47:15,529
You don't like it?

580
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,869
I do. Let's go inside.

581
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,839

582
00:47:21,469 --> 00:47:22,669
Go!

583
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:23,979
Welcome.

584
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,380
You're so pretty today.

585
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,880
You're stunning.

586
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,548
As stunning as the sun.

587
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:29,749
One might need sunglasses to look at you.

588
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,080
We have a table available just in time. Have a seat here.

589
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,149
Great job coming here.

590
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:36,350
Welcome. I'm sorry, but all tables are taken.

591
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,429
Oh, you're with her?

592
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:42,029
Yes.

593
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,659
Have a seat here.

594
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:45,928
You have a tiny face.

595
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,199
That seems to be better.

596
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:56,138
Hey, I swear I've seen it.

597
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,778
- Hey. - There's something in that café.

598
00:47:57,779 --> 00:47:59,040
This is crazy. Guess who came.

599
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:01,749
I memorize all their numbers.

600
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,810
Really?

601
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:06,219
What on earth? I guess they're really close.

602
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:08,089
A handsome customer!

603
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,319
Hey, what are you doing?

604
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:12,560
They're a man and a woman alone on a date.

605
00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:16,259
I've never seen her smile like that before.

606
00:48:16,489 --> 00:48:17,900
You can do it like that?

607
00:48:21,069 --> 00:48:23,330
Kicking the ball low. To his head!

608
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:25,298
- There! - Yes!

609
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:26,939
A tie goal!

610
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,839
- Yes! - Amazing.

611
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,939
- It went inside, - What?

612
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,310
- but the referee held up his flag. - Why?

613
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,350
- Oh, no. - Goodness.

614
00:48:35,351 --> 00:48:38,520
The ball bounced down into the post. His focus led to this goal.

615
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,088
It's a great situation for us.

616
00:48:41,089 --> 00:48:43,519
It's declared to be offside...

617
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,789
Son Heung Min is changing the flow.

618
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,388
- That way. - To Lee Jae Sung on the other side.

619
00:48:47,389 --> 00:48:48,588
- Please. - Please...

620
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:50,028
Lee Jae Sung passes it to the center.

621
00:48:50,029 --> 00:48:51,329
- Yes. - Lee Jae Sung.

622
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,459
- Passing to the other side. - Shoot.

623
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,469
- Goal! - Yes!

624
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,500
Goal!

625
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:02,739
- Yes! - Great!

626
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:07,548
All right, guys!

Nice to meet you.

In.

647
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:16,730
Out.

00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,839
It's okay.

It was in.

653
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,860
Out.

654
00:52:45,861 --> 00:52:48,500
You're a little too inflexible.

655
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:55,569
It was in.

656
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:58,380
It was out.

Why don't we play just one game?

658

661
00:53:58,199 --> 00:53:59,698

You were cool.

Ma'am.

668
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,730
When is the death anniversary of your late husband?

669
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:24,630
Must you ask that kind of question?

670
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,629
I mean, once you get married,

671
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,399
you'll go on a trip together and stuff.

672
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,029
It's better to avoid that day.

673
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,900
She has a point.

674
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:39,580
It's April 28.

675
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,759
His daughter is behind this, isn't she?

676
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,170
How much did she agree to pay you?

677
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:04,969
Once I marry him, I'll pay you twice more. No, three times more.

678
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:09,040
How could you turn Dad's birthday into his death anniversary?

679
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,909
It was so sudden, I couldn't think of another date.

680
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,408
I haven't seen your dad for more than ten years.

681
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:16,750
I probably won't get to see him even in the future.

682
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,920
He's as good as dead.

683
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,619
You've wronged me in many ways.

684
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:25,690
Let it slide this once,

685
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,929
and I'll forgive you for everything.

686
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:32,759

And I want my father to find his true love again.

696
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:19,380
You shouldn't say such a thing out in the open.

697
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:20,980
Tell me about it.

Do you love my father?

700
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,560
Answer me, please.

701
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:45,239
I love him,

702
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:48,009
truly.

703
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,380
Thank you.

704
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,259
I'm ashamed...

705
00:57:41,389 --> 00:57:43,790
that my dad got deceived by a woman like her.

706
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,199
Are you sure you'll keep this a secret?

707
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:49,230
Yes.

708
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,739
I'm envious that you never let anyone deceive you.

709
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:56,769
My family has gone through this a few times...

710
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:58,679
because of the wealth we have.

711
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,779
Anyway, I can protect my family thanks to you.

00:59:42,909 --> 00:59:44,480
You were an enemy in my past life, weren't you?

Because of you, I was divorced.

731

Now you even ruined the chance to change my life!

I begged you!

01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:11,580
To let it slide this once!

738
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:15,580
You lied when you said you loved him.

739
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:18,750
Yes, it was a lie. So what?

740
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,488
Hey, think about what your dad did.

741
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:24,089
Love doesn't put food on the table.

742
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:27,588
You probably don't know because you make money so easily.

743
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:29,060
Are you that jealous about this?

744
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:31,658
I wish I could cut my ears off.

745
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:34,429
I'd cut them off and give them to you if I could!

746
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:44,639
Mom.

747
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:48,210
Do you even love me?

748
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,520
Don't change the subject.

749
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:55,319
I'm here to scold you, not be scolded.

750
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:00,619
A mom saying she loves her daughter. How is that being scolded?

751
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:03,329
You just hate me, don't you?

752
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,730
You're scared of me, aren't you?

753
01:01:06,259 --> 01:01:08,270
You little...

754
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:19,209
I see you're dating someone...

755
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,850
after the mess you caused your mom.

756
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,380
Do you know she's a shaman?

757
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:31,359
If you don't know,

758
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,319
it means you obviously don't know that.

759
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:35,630
Please...

760
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,199
Please stop now!

761
01:01:48,069 --> 01:01:49,069
Goodness.

762
01:02:03,049 --> 01:02:04,049
I'm sorry.

763
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:06,118
I didn't mean to eavesdrop. I was just worried.

764
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:07,860
Don't talk to me. I'm embarrassed.

765
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:10,360
At least take this umbrella.

766
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,868
It's not going to work between us anyway.

767
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:22,369
(Luni Tarot Café)

768
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:27,339
Because of this darn power,

769
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:30,610
I drifted apart from my family and can't even date a guy.

770
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,080
What is that power you have?

771
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,790
I...

772
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,600
can detect...

773
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:52,799
lies.

774
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,529
(My Lovely Liar)

775
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,258
Why did I tell him, really?

776
01:03:53,259 --> 01:03:54,600
Goodness!

777
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:58,798
If a woman dates a guy who doesn't tell lies like you,

778
01:03:58,799 --> 01:03:59,869
she will find it comfortable.

779
01:04:00,969 --> 01:04:03,210
You two are not dating, right?

780
01:04:04,369 --> 01:04:05,380
It's a little strange.

781
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,179
Must this person be alive?

782
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:10,380
I'm not going.

783
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:12,448
I have a more urgent and important business here.

784
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:14,019
Because that's his weakness.

785
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:15,889
Only then, he will pay attention to me.

786
01:04:16,589 --> 01:04:17,850
What is...

787
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:20,219
his weakness?
