00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:46,305
(The guardians of child actors were present at the filming.)

10
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:50,136
So you're saying he's tall and has fair skin?

11
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:51,646
Yes?

12
00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:56,415
Gosh, sweetie!

13
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:15,365
What took you so long?

14
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:29,876
Those guys came looking for you.

15
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:33,046
Is that Kim Do Ha?

16
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:40,656
What took you so long, sweetie?

17
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:49,736
They seem like a cute couple.

18
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:54,706
(Episode 4)

19
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:02,115
Do you know who they are? And is that why you did this?

20
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:06,016
Yes. I do.

21
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:11,225
They are your creditors.

22
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:22,235
Is that what they said?

23
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:23,936
That they were my creditors?

24
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:25,735
No.

25
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:28,235
They were looking for the guy living in Unit 502.

26
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:29,506
So I got a bad vibe from them.

27
00:02:32,575 --> 00:02:33,975
Let's go up and ask her.

28
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:41,045
Gosh. Come on.

29
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,556
All right. Let's go inside.

30
00:02:46,286 --> 00:02:47,325
Wait.

31
00:02:49,355 --> 00:02:50,825
- Yes? - Since you live next door,

32
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,026
you must have seen him.

33
00:02:53,026 --> 00:02:54,635
The guy who lives in Unit 502.

34
00:02:55,195 --> 00:02:58,205
No. I thought no one lived there.

35
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:00,836
- What? - You should double check.

36
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:02,406
Wait.

37
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:29,795
Gosh. It looks like they're going to camp out there.

38
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:34,936
What are you doing? Come on in.

39
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:37,506
Sweetie, let's eat.

40
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,586
Wait.

41
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:05,105
It's just today. Usually, my house is pretty clean.

42
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:20,546
You can sit over here.

43
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:30,155
Sit.

44
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:44,205
I'm too full. I can't eat anything.

45
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:45,845
I'm full too.

46
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:49,976
Regardless of how it happened, you're a guest in my house.

47
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:52,145
Not doing anything will be awkward.

48
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:53,285
So I'm peeling this apple.

49
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,496
- Give it to me. - I got it.

50
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:04,325
Let me.

51
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:39,325
Thank you.

52
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:07,186
(Unit 501, Dream Villa, Mok Sol Hee)

53
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:08,256
"Mok Sol Hee."

54
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:12,825
That's a unique name.

55
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:14,796
Then what about you?

56
00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:16,195
What's your name?

57
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:21,006
My name is Kim...

58
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:23,575
No. You don't have to tell me your name if you don't want to.

59
00:06:27,676 --> 00:06:28,876
It's Kim Seung Ju.

60
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:32,015
I see. What?

61
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:35,556
I didn't hear you well.

62
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:38,285
Could you tell me your name one more time?

63
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,856
It's Kim Seung Ju.

64
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,436
It's cold here. And I'm sleepy.

65
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:57,205
I'm hungry.

66
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,176
It must be warm inside.

67
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:07,046
(Kim Do Ha and Kim Seung Ju)

68
00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:08,556
(There are no results under Kim Do Ha and Kim Seung Ju.)

69
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:09,955
As long as there's some space,

70
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:11,356
- they can make a mid-range shot. - Of course.

71
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:13,385
Yes. The players are aware of that.

72
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:28,275
We will get your confidence back!

73
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:30,275
Your confidence will be stronger than ever!

74
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:33,176
It can improve your prostate health and your stamina as well.

75
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:35,676
Gong Sil has to live her life...

76
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:37,046
while hiding her gift of seeing ghosts.

77
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:41,416
- I... - But when she touches Joong Won,

78
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:43,385
the ghost disappears.

79
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:45,885
Then she realizes that her gift goes away...

80
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:47,926
when she's with this man.

81
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:53,426
Wait. Let's watch it a bit longer.

82
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:54,666
Okay.

83
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,996
But I can't see or hear anything when I grab you.

84
00:07:59,635 --> 00:08:01,135
I've never met anyone like you.

85
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:06,046
That's why you're special to me.

86
00:08:08,215 --> 00:08:11,945
When I'm with you, I can sleep well too.

87
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:14,385
I can live like a normal person.

88
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:21,525
By the way,

89
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:24,895
do you rarely lie?

90
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:29,135
No one in the world lives without lying. Everyone lies.

91
00:09:02,135 --> 00:09:04,165
(My Dear Do Ha)

92
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:11,905
Let me check outside.

93
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:16,675

94
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:21,785

(Syaon)

96
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:29,655
What is this?

97
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:33,395
You're dating Syaon, right?

98
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:35,736
No. Just as the article states,

99
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:37,765
we're just good colleagues.

100
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:41,905
Is that when my ability stopped working?

101
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:45,376
(Syaon)

102
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:57,185
I like you because you're clear as water.

103
00:09:57,785 --> 00:10:00,756
My body should always be hydrated.

104
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:04,226
Keep my heart hydrated too.

105
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,826
Hydrate your body.

106
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:14,765
What do you think about Syaon?

107
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:17,805
What do you mean?

108
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:20,275
She's an ideal type for a lot of men.

109
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:23,116
She's so gorgeous.

110
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:27,515
She's an excellent...

111
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:30,285
singer.

112
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,956
Wait. Not like that.

113
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:37,956
What about as a woman?

114
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:44,895
I had never thought about her like that.

115
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:05,885
Hey, wake up. He's here.

116
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:07,726
- Get ready. - Gosh.

117
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:09,055
Three, four...

118
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:11,925
- Take pictures now. - Okay.

119
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:13,425
Gosh.

120
00:11:14,795 --> 00:11:15,795
What are you guys doing?

121
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:17,635
Gosh. Come on.

122
00:11:17,895 --> 00:11:19,065
- Delete the pictures. - Okay.

123
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:21,305
Why did you take pictures of me?

124
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:23,706
- Give me the cameras. - Hey.

125
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:25,946
We're journalists. Okay?

126
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,346
Journalists.

127
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:28,815
- Don't put your hand on my camera. - Hey.

128
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:30,315
I told you to get that hand away from me.

129
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,915
I don't care who you are.

130
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:33,586
I'll make sure you delete my pictures.

131
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:35,716
I'll delete them. Mind your own business. Got it?

132
00:11:35,716 --> 00:11:37,216
Gosh, seriously.

133
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:39,525
I can't believe this jerk. Hey.

134
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:40,785
- Why did you do that? - Let me just check.

135
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:42,226
I told you not to touch that.

136
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:47,525
My lens...

137
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:50,366
Do you know how much this costs?

138
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:56,935
The two of them realize that they are destined to be together.

139
00:11:56,935 --> 00:11:58,805
He makes a romantic confession to her.

140
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:01,246
Without me, your world would be crushed.

141
00:12:01,246 --> 00:12:02,815
(Without me, your world would be crushed.)

142
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:04,076
I'm your sun.

143
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,885
("Quick Drama Recaps")

144
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:23,236
How would you feel?

145
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:28,935
If there's a woman who can't see ghosts when she's with you?

146
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,946
I wouldn't be confident.

147
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:36,915
I knew it.

148
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:40,685
The gift of seeing ghosts can be a bit scary.

149
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:41,685
No.

150
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:44,856
I'm not confident that I can be with her for the rest of my life...

151
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:47,655
when I'm the only shot she has.

152
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:54,525
There's nothing I could do...

153
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:58,096
to stop my feelings from changing.

154
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:04,076
Then you must have tried really hard.

155
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:10,045
When I think something doesn't seem right, I give up right away.

156
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:13,815
And when would that be?

157
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:17,456
When people lie.

158
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:24,925
Then you must meet someone who's really good at lying.

159
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:29,736
Everyone lies.

160
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,246
Darn it.

161
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:40,976
Can you even afford to buy me a new one?

162
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:42,545
Do you even have money to buy me a new one?

163
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:44,045
- You're unbelievable. - Gosh. Stop it.

164
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:45,545
- Get your hands off me. - Enough.

165
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:46,885
- You'll ruin my clothes. - Gosh.

166
00:13:46,885 --> 00:13:48,586
You're ruining my day. Darn it.

167
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:52,425
Gosh. This is who I am.

168
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:55,456
That guy damaged my camera lens.

169
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:56,496
Damage?

170
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:57,525
(Police)

171
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:59,366
You took pictures of me first!

172
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:00,395
I can't believe this jerk.

173
00:14:00,395 --> 00:14:02,435
- You broke my camera! - Hey.

174
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:04,065
- You... - Gosh.

175
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:05,966
Goodness.

176
00:14:07,336 --> 00:14:08,736
If you took them without his consent,

177
00:14:08,736 --> 00:14:10,175
you did take pictures illegally.

178
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:11,576
What?

179
00:14:12,246 --> 00:14:13,846
You did damage the lens.

180
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:15,246
If you keep this up here,

181
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:17,045
you'll be charged with public nuisance too.

182
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:19,086
Let's talk about this at the station.

183
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:21,086
At the station?

184
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:23,385
You want us to go to the police station?

185
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:26,925
Sir, I'm working right here.

186
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:28,226
Yes, I'm also working.

187
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:29,826
I'm a journalist.

188
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:36,866
- Take them to the station. - Yes, sir.

189
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:38,635
Hurry. Let's go.

190
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:40,836
- Come on. This is crazy. - Gosh.

191
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:46,645
This isn't right.

192
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:49,446
(Dream Villa Notice Board)

193
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:52,045
You go down first. I'll take the stairs.

194
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:53,086
Yes, sir.

195
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:13,435
(Mok Sol)

196
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,476
Hey, Sol Hee.

197
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:32,956
What are you doing here?

198
00:15:33,626 --> 00:15:37,596
I recently got transferred to Yeonseo Police Station.

199
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:39,126
I came out because we received a report.

200
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:41,025
I see.

201
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:43,535
Are you all right? It was pretty loud outside, right?

202
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:45,966
Yes. I'm fine.

203
00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:50,836
Gosh. I can't believe I ran into you like this.

204
00:15:55,515 --> 00:15:56,545
Have you been well?

205
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:03,055
Yes. Well, I've been well.

206
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:14,496
Are you married?

207
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:16,866
No.

208
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:22,076
I see.

209
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:27,576
Senior Officer Lee, are you coming down?

210
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:28,645
I have to go now.

211
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:30,275
Okay.

212
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:33,216
Get back inside.

213
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:35,315
Make sure to lock up.

214
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:40,155
I missed you a lot.

215
00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:56,506
Bye.

216
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:27,506
He might have gotten the wrong idea after seeing my shoes.

217
00:17:29,476 --> 00:17:30,835
You should explain that when you see him again.

218
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:33,746
What?

219
00:17:34,676 --> 00:17:35,716
I'll get going now.

220
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:07,075
I missed you a lot.

221
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:26,726
Syaon came to me first. I'm telling the truth.

222
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:29,835
Why would she go to a burger joint in the middle of Namyangju?

223
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:33,805
What if people find out that this was a sponsored ad?

224
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:35,575
How is this a sponsored ad?

225
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:37,305
It's not like I paid her.

226
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:42,146
Then...

227
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:44,375
did you do her a favour?

228
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,785
Well, I gave her...

229
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:50,156
some information.

230
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:52,825
Like what?

231
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:54,785
- Where Kim Do Ha lives. - What?

232
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,926
I only told her he was in Yeonseo-dong. I'm serious.

233
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:59,396
How did you know he was in Yeonseo-dong?

234
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:04,035
I checked the history of your GPS locations.

235
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:08,736
You little...

236
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:11,676
You used Do Ha to make a deal with her now?

237
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:17,545
But Do Ha owes us a lot.

238
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:19,746
Can't I get some help from him in return?

239
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,285
What are you talking about?

240
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:24,055
He doesn't owe us anything.

241
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:25,585
I'm sure you know.

242
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:28,386
- About the alibi... - Shut your mouth.

243
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:31,125
If you bring that up again...

244
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,196
Okay. I'm sorry.

245
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:45,845
It was Jae Chan.

246
00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:48,406
He told Syaon.

247
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:51,515
And the reporters who were following Syaon...

248
00:19:52,216 --> 00:19:53,686
came all the way here.

249
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:56,886
I'm sorry as always.

250
00:19:58,785 --> 00:19:59,825
It's okay.

251
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,236
You're odd.

252
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:11,236
Given how the reporters came all the way here,

253
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:12,936
you should be making a fuss about moving to a different place.

254
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:14,035
How come you seem fine?

255
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:17,176
They probably don't know I live here.

256
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:19,075
My next-door neighbour helped me.

257
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:20,075
Again?

258
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:23,815
Gosh. At this rate, she'll be your guardian angel.

259
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:26,716
Hey.

260
00:20:28,545 --> 00:20:30,756
Seeing how she even protected you from the reporters,

261
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:33,156
she must know that you're Kim Do Ha.

262
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:36,226
She thinks they aren't reporters, but my creditors.

263
00:20:36,956 --> 00:20:38,426
She thinks I lost all of my money...

264
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:40,065
and moved here.

265
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:41,696
Is that so?

266
00:20:42,736 --> 00:20:43,736
That's a relief.

267
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:51,006
She has no idea that we met...

268
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:53,275
in Hakcheon a long time ago.

269
00:20:54,446 --> 00:20:55,476
What did I tell you?

270
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:58,146
You're the weird guy for remembering her.

271
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,295
- Here's your coffee. - Thanks.

272
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:21,136
Hey.

273
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,835
Is there a question you have to lie when you answer it?

274
00:21:25,206 --> 00:21:26,246
We have to lie?

275
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:31,075
The spirit doesn't help me when I'm with this person.

276
00:21:31,345 --> 00:21:33,585
I'm not sure if it's because this person isn't lying...

277
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:35,585
or the spirit's gift doesn't work on this person.

278
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,916
I don't know which one it is.

279
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,486
Or they could be both wrong. Is it possible that...

280
00:21:39,486 --> 00:21:42,025
the spirit isn't using the gift only on that person?

281
00:21:42,496 --> 00:21:43,555
Is it...

282
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:45,525
a guy?

283
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,295
Well... Yes, it is a guy.

284
00:21:53,305 --> 00:21:55,236
The spirit sent you a signal...

285
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:57,335
to tell you that he's your soulmate.

286
00:21:58,176 --> 00:22:01,605
Let's be honest. If the spirit keeps telling you when people lie,

287
00:22:01,605 --> 00:22:03,916
how will you date?

288
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:06,746
That's why you're still single.

289
00:22:06,746 --> 00:22:08,646
I think you need to talk to him more.

290
00:22:08,646 --> 00:22:10,886
Keep talking to him, and the spirit will appear.

291
00:22:10,886 --> 00:22:12,285
Or bring him here.

292
00:22:12,285 --> 00:22:15,055
We'll play the Mafia game or something to help you.

293
00:22:15,055 --> 00:22:17,555
- Yes, you'll be the host. - Yes! I can totally do it!

294
00:22:17,555 --> 00:22:19,265
- Nice! - Let's do this!

295
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:39,845
It's nice.

296
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:41,515
Well, then...

297
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:44,416
the concept for Syaon's next album should be...

298
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,656
Deuk Chan.

299
00:22:49,696 --> 00:22:51,025
Do I have to keep working with her?

300
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:52,966
What?

301
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:56,236
Now, there are many songwriters who can write good songs for her.

302
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:00,736
Hey, but the two of you have always worked together.

303
00:23:02,335 --> 00:23:04,375
I think that's precisely why we ended up like this.

304
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,075
She relies on me musically, so...

305
00:23:10,315 --> 00:23:12,515
I can't keep playing dumb when I know how she feels about me.

306
00:23:13,315 --> 00:23:14,515
I'll talk to her.

307
00:23:14,785 --> 00:23:15,815
No!

308
00:23:18,486 --> 00:23:20,085
Well, I got your point.

309
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:21,726
But let's not tell her right away.

310
00:23:21,726 --> 00:23:23,396
She's promoting her album now. She'll flip out.

311
00:23:23,396 --> 00:23:24,825
We don't know what she'd do.

312
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:33,305
Hold me tight

313
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:36,305
The emotion I've never felt before

314
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:39,105
I just want you, baby

315
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:41,075
Just a little more

316
00:23:41,075 --> 00:23:42,916
Let's go, we need

317
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,815
To fly higher

318
00:24:02,896 --> 00:24:03,936
Five, six!

319
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:09,636
- DP's card! - What's that?

320
00:24:09,636 --> 00:24:10,936
- Director Park! - Your credit card.

321
00:24:10,936 --> 00:24:11,976
All right, sure.

322
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:16,946
You have an event in Gangneung this weekend, right?

323
00:24:16,946 --> 00:24:18,115
How about dinner after the event?

324
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:19,916
There's a sashimi restaurant I frequent in Gangneung.

325
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:23,956
I have to be on my best behaviour.

326
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:26,186
I've gotten myself into trouble a number of times, so Deuk Chan...

327
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,686
I mean, Mr. Jo is keeping a watchful eye on me.

328
00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:32,795
I guess you think I'm hitting on you.

329
00:24:33,226 --> 00:24:34,466
That's why you're being so careful.

330
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:36,966
Sorry?

331
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:42,835
I have to practice. Please leave.

332
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:47,976
Hey!

333
00:24:54,216 --> 00:24:56,555
You wouldn't even have been able to make your début without Kim Do Ha.

334
00:24:56,956 --> 00:24:59,855
Be humble, or you'll lose everything in a flash.

335
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:14,206
What is this? Isn't this water?

336
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:16,006
Oh, that's an energy drink.

337
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:20,746
I told you to put away everything that had calories!

338
00:25:30,615 --> 00:25:31,656
What?

339
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:37,295
("We Are Lucky to Work With Songwriter Kim Do Ha")

340
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:41,595
Oh, you have a guest.

341
00:25:41,595 --> 00:25:44,095
Is she that neighbour of yours...

342
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:45,906
you told me about?

343
00:25:47,765 --> 00:25:48,765
Hello.

344
00:25:49,406 --> 00:25:50,835
I'm a close friend of his.

345
00:25:50,835 --> 00:25:52,035
I see. Hello.

346
00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:55,105
You told your friend about me?

347
00:25:56,315 --> 00:25:59,216
He told me that you helped him out a lot.

348
00:25:59,345 --> 00:26:03,115
I'd like to treat you to dinner.

349
00:26:03,656 --> 00:26:04,686
Oh, no.

350
00:26:05,285 --> 00:26:06,825
This isn't my business card.

351
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:09,525
J Entertainment?

352
00:26:10,055 --> 00:26:11,926
I guess you work in the entertainment industry.

353
00:26:11,926 --> 00:26:12,966
No.

354
00:26:13,525 --> 00:26:15,996
Oh, I'm...

00:26:16,696 --> 00:26:18,035
(Daejung Real Estate Office)

356
00:26:18,765 --> 00:26:20,305
I'm a realtor.

357
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,136
I don't have my business card on me now.

358
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:24,575
I see.

359
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:25,835
This is...

360
00:26:26,946 --> 00:26:27,976
what I do.

Drop by, and I'll give you a free tarot card reading.

You two should come together.

363
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:42,125
Come to think of it, I don't even know what you do for a living.

364
00:26:42,525 --> 00:26:44,825
Do you work in real estate too?

365
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:46,125
- He's unemployed. - I make music.

366
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:51,595
You're studying to be a musician.

367
00:26:53,006 --> 00:26:54,035
I see.

368
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:56,906
There are various genres.

369
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,035
- What kind of music? - Classical music.

370
00:26:59,506 --> 00:27:00,775
You probably don't know much about it.

371
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:05,476
Is your friend telling the truth?

372
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:12,756
I did study classical music.

373
00:27:13,486 --> 00:27:15,585
Oh, you studied it in the past?

374
00:27:15,855 --> 00:27:17,956
- Then what about now... - Excuse me.

375
00:27:19,025 --> 00:27:20,095
Sorry to interrupt,

376
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:22,996
but we have somewhere to be.

377
00:27:23,396 --> 00:27:24,535
Hey, let's go.

378
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:26,136
Wait.

379
00:27:32,646 --> 00:27:33,676
It's nothing.

380
00:27:44,756 --> 00:27:45,756
Hey.

381
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:48,025
She's weird.

382
00:27:49,525 --> 00:27:51,125
Why did she interrogate us like that?

383
00:27:52,226 --> 00:27:54,325
And you. You should've just made something up.

384
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:56,065
Why did you say your job was to make music?

385
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,236
What about what you said? How could you say I was unemployed?

386
00:28:01,535 --> 00:28:02,736
Hey, what is this?

387
00:28:02,906 --> 00:28:04,835
Do you want to impress her or something?

388
00:28:07,446 --> 00:28:09,075
No. Why would I want to impress her?

389
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:11,375
She thinks I have creditors chasing me anyway.

(Free Tarot Card Readings, Luni Tarot Café)

391
00:28:15,015 --> 00:28:16,686
Is it because she runs a tarot café?

392
00:28:17,615 --> 00:28:20,125
For some reason, I feel like she can see right through me.

395

Gosh, no!

396
00:28:40,006 --> 00:28:42,006
He'll move again at this rate.

397
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:45,676
When the CEO lied, I could tell right away.

398
00:28:46,386 --> 00:28:47,545
What should I do?

399
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,825
Shall I ask him to have a meal with me tomorrow?

400
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,795
You're my sun

401
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:06,865
You make me shine

402
00:29:08,906 --> 00:29:13,805
You make me smile

Wherever you are

404
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,726
- How about 10 dollars? - No, 15 dollars.

405
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:30,996
Twenty dollars.

406
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:38,996
Oh, no! What should we do?

407
00:29:38,996 --> 00:29:40,636
How much did you put in?

408
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:44,605
All right. Come and have a look!

409
00:29:48,775 --> 00:29:49,775
Excuse me.

410
00:29:51,815 --> 00:29:53,785
You murderer.

411
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:55,986
I saw you on TV and got so angry that I came all the way here.

412
00:29:56,886 --> 00:29:59,555
It is you. You look just like the guy in the photo on the Internet.

413
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:03,226
Hey, where is the body?

414
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:05,825
Tell us, and we'll let you go. Okay?

415
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,236
Gosh, stop. It's not even confirmed yet.

416
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:21,605
Die, you scumbag.

417
00:30:22,305 --> 00:30:23,916
How could you kill a person?

418
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:25,746
Does it hurt? Does it?

419
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:26,986
It was him, wasn't it?

420
00:30:30,015 --> 00:30:31,355
Hey, go ahead and stomp on him.

421
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:34,355
- You little... - Scumbag!

422
00:30:34,355 --> 00:30:36,226
- Does this hurt? - You deserve it!

423
00:30:36,226 --> 00:30:37,226
Excuse me.

424
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:41,996
You dropped your wallet.

425
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:47,666
Thank you.

426

Hold on. You're that pervert...

427
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:53,075
No, I mean... You're that guy, right?

428
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:56,775
- Yes. - I'm so sorry about that.

429
00:30:56,775 --> 00:30:58,615
It really wasn't intentional.

430
00:30:59,486 --> 00:31:00,646
Here, take this.

431
00:31:01,785 --> 00:31:02,986
Take this.

Oh, this place looks quiet.

436
00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:27,476
Right, I don't have his number.

- I'm sorry. - I see. It's okay.

441

What?

442
00:31:52,835 --> 00:31:53,835
It's you, right?

443
00:31:56,406 --> 00:31:59,236
By the way, can't you at least wear a mask that stands out?

444
00:31:59,305 --> 00:32:00,506
It's confusing.

445
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:03,775
I wear a mask because I don't want anyone to notice me.

446
00:32:07,515 --> 00:32:09,656
My, twisted doughnuts.

447
00:32:14,156 --> 00:32:15,386
Do you want one?

448
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:17,625
No.

449

Yes, just one.

450
00:32:31,335 --> 00:32:33,545
You kindly gave me a twisted doughnut. Thank you so much.

451
00:32:33,545 --> 00:32:34,646
Let me buy you dinner.

452
00:32:36,176 --> 00:32:37,315
That's not necessary.

453
00:32:37,315 --> 00:32:38,446
Are you free this evening?

454
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:40,785
I don't eat out.

455
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:43,486
That's not true. You had hangover soup the other day.

456
00:32:43,486 --> 00:32:44,756
That day, the situation was...

457
00:32:47,085 --> 00:32:48,656
There were only a few customers inside,

458
00:32:50,855 --> 00:32:52,325
and the hangover soup was pretty tasty.

459
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,335
So if I manage to find a quiet restaurant that has good food,

460
00:32:57,335 --> 00:32:58,436
you might consider it, right?

461
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:00,906
No, I won't eat out again.

462
00:33:04,706 --> 00:33:06,176
That day, you took off your mask.

463
00:33:10,015 --> 00:33:12,146
That day, right before you met with the creditors.

464
00:33:14,746 --> 00:33:17,456
Be honest. You want to take off the mask too, don't you?

465
00:33:25,256 --> 00:33:26,325
Punch in your number.

466
00:33:28,025 --> 00:33:30,835
Well, I might find another good restaurant.

467
00:33:31,236 --> 00:33:33,466
And I'll let you know if creditors show up.

468
00:34:05,865 --> 00:34:06,865
It's good.

469
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:08,605
Thank you.

470
00:34:08,765 --> 00:34:11,636
Oh, right. About the tickets for Syaon's concert.

471
00:34:11,636 --> 00:34:13,045
It made the chairman very happy.

472
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:14,875
I heard they were for front-row seats.

473
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:16,346
How did you get them?

474
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:18,915
An acquaintance of mine works in the industry.

475
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,946

But if I'm given the opportunity,

480
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:39,136
I'll do my very best.

481
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:44,006
Well... Your son is still in Germany, right?

482
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,446
Yes, let's drink.

483
00:34:51,346 --> 00:34:54,085
You see, I want to give you all the support you need,

484
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:56,145
but I can't deny that there are people...

485
00:34:56,245 --> 00:34:58,455
who are concerned because of the case from years ago.

486
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:02,685
But my son had nothing to do with it.

487
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:03,756
People are still talking about it?

488
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:05,426
If the body was found,

489
00:35:05,426 --> 00:35:07,295
it wouldn't have remained as a cold case.

490
00:35:07,295 --> 00:35:08,926
It'll never be found.

491
00:35:08,926 --> 00:35:11,136
It must've been eaten by all the fish in the ocean.

Yes.

Oh, this is where you work.

497
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:58,116
You opened a café. This is so cool.

498
00:36:03,216 --> 00:36:04,216
Back then,

499
00:36:04,616 --> 00:36:07,056
you travelled to clients to give tarot readings.

500
00:36:08,426 --> 00:36:10,756
Yes, I did.

501
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:23,435
Do I make you uncomfortable?

502
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:24,975
I'm not exactly comfortable around you.

503
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:27,446
You can go.

504
00:36:36,415 --> 00:36:37,415
I'm sorry.

505
00:36:40,955 --> 00:36:42,025
I wanted...

506
00:36:42,556 --> 00:36:44,895
to apologize to you first as soon as I met you again.

507
00:36:51,495 --> 00:36:52,966
What are you sorry for?

508
00:36:54,036 --> 00:36:56,366
For changing your mind just a month after proposing to me?

509
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:00,306
For moving as soon as you broke up with me?

510
00:37:00,446 --> 00:37:02,676
- Sol Hee. - Did you hate me that much?

511
00:37:03,216 --> 00:37:05,216
You changed your number and even moved away.

512
00:37:05,545 --> 00:37:06,616
Sol Hee.

513
00:37:07,846 --> 00:37:09,185
I've never once hated you.

514
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,685
How could I hate you?

515
00:37:10,815 --> 00:37:12,915
You didn't call me once for the past three years.

516
00:37:12,915 --> 00:37:14,556
We ran into each other by chance.

517
00:37:14,685 --> 00:37:16,995
You missed me, and you're sorry? Cut the nonsense.

518
00:37:16,995 --> 00:37:18,256
It wasn't a coincidence.

519
00:37:22,165 --> 00:37:25,065
I asked around and heard you lived in Yeonseo-dong.

520
00:37:25,065 --> 00:37:26,236
So I came here,

521
00:37:26,236 --> 00:37:27,866
hoping I'd run into you.

522
00:37:31,236 --> 00:37:33,406
Why didn't you contact me directly if you had time to do that?

523
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:34,906
Then would you have met me?

524

Besides, I thought you could be seeing someone too.

526
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:55,625
He might have gotten the wrong idea after seeing my shoes.

527
00:37:57,165 --> 00:37:58,435
You should explain that when you see him again.

528

Yes, I have a boyfriend.

No, it's not like that.

He's a good guy.

547
00:40:30,156 --> 00:40:31,585
Then why did you have to do that to him?

548
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:37,225
Don't avoid him. Just be straightforward with him.

549
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:41,295
And this.

550
00:40:44,565 --> 00:40:45,835
I found it on the floor.

551
00:40:48,506 --> 00:40:49,536
Bye.

552
00:41:24,406 --> 00:41:26,946
I bet you were late today because of your next-door neighbour.

553
00:41:27,975 --> 00:41:29,306
How did you know?

554
00:41:29,306 --> 00:41:31,576
I could tell that something was up...

555
00:41:31,745 --> 00:41:33,815
when you stormed off without even wearing your sunglasses.

556
00:41:35,645 --> 00:41:37,786
So? What's going on now?

557
00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:40,585
Have you two held hands yet?

558
00:41:40,886 --> 00:41:42,056
Gosh.

559
00:41:42,056 --> 00:41:43,225
It's not like that.

560
00:41:43,355 --> 00:41:45,656
Come on. She's your next-door neighbour.

561
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:47,466
How convenient.

562
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:50,935
When you want to see her, you can just open the door.

563
00:41:51,335 --> 00:41:52,995
And you don't have to take her home.

564
00:41:53,435 --> 00:41:54,536
It really isn't like that.

565
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:58,205
Come on. I've been a jazz musician for 20 years.

566
00:41:58,775 --> 00:42:00,375
You can't fool me.

567
00:42:00,775 --> 00:42:02,645
What does jazz have to do with it?

568
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:06,176
You don't need to know.

569
00:42:47,886 --> 00:42:48,926
Come out.

570
00:42:50,295 --> 00:42:51,556
I said to come out!

571
00:43:01,306 --> 00:43:03,205
Did you think I wouldn't know if you brought a different car?

572
00:43:03,806 --> 00:43:05,105
You're tailing me now?

573
00:43:05,105 --> 00:43:06,775
Did you think I was meeting Do Ha?

574
00:43:06,946 --> 00:43:09,775
I really want to see him.

575
00:43:13,315 --> 00:43:16,216
Do Ha doesn't want to work with you anymore.

576
00:43:17,915 --> 00:43:18,915
What?

577
00:43:18,915 --> 00:43:20,386
He wanted to tell you directly.

578
00:43:20,386 --> 00:43:22,025
I barely managed to talk him out of it.

579
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,295
No way.

580
00:43:24,525 --> 00:43:27,795
I'm nothing without Do Ha, and he needs me too.

581
00:43:27,795 --> 00:43:30,696
I want the two of you to keep working together,

582
00:43:30,696 --> 00:43:31,995
but he's already made up his mind.

583
00:43:32,636 --> 00:43:35,835
If you continue acting like this, it'll actually be over.

584
00:43:38,806 --> 00:43:41,605
I'll wait for the right time to convince him.

585
00:43:42,346 --> 00:43:44,346
So don't do anything strange.

586
00:43:45,045 --> 00:43:46,116
Gosh.

587
00:43:47,685 --> 00:43:49,915
Hey, come to the parking garage.

588
00:43:51,156 --> 00:43:52,516
Drive Ji On home.

589
00:44:07,636 --> 00:44:10,536
That's what I think

590
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:15,975
Even if I try to ignore my feelings

591
00:44:16,306 --> 00:44:19,815
I can't do anything about it

592
00:44:20,016 --> 00:44:24,886
My heart keeps telling me

593
00:44:24,886 --> 00:44:30,025
It keeps telling me it has to be you

594
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:35,826
Goodness.

595
00:44:37,065 --> 00:44:39,596
Ji On, you have a powerful voice.

596
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:41,406
Thank you.

597
00:44:41,835 --> 00:44:43,536
Maybe it's because you have a big build.

598
00:44:44,076 --> 00:44:47,475
Se Hee, why does your voice sound so weak?

599
00:44:48,506 --> 00:44:50,815
But you're pretty, so you pass.

600
00:44:50,975 --> 00:44:53,716
You lost so much weight. You must've gone on an extreme diet.

601
00:44:53,946 --> 00:44:55,886
Good job. You pass.

602
00:45:00,556 --> 00:45:02,756
Are you not going to sing? Are you in your right mind?

603
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:05,156
Give it to me.

604
00:45:06,696 --> 00:45:08,025
Go inside and practice.

605
00:45:10,636 --> 00:45:13,806
Give it back. Give it to me.

606
00:45:14,036 --> 00:45:16,036
I said give it to me.

607
00:45:16,036 --> 00:45:18,176
Who are you to stop me?

608
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:22,105
Are you not going to début?

609
00:45:23,076 --> 00:45:24,516
It's only you.

610
00:45:25,315 --> 00:45:27,815
You're the only one...

611
00:45:28,045 --> 00:45:29,915
who tells me I can début!

612
00:45:34,955 --> 00:45:35,955
You are also...

613
00:45:36,786 --> 00:45:38,955
the only one who can sing my songs properly.

614
00:45:48,605 --> 00:45:49,665
I...

615
00:45:50,736 --> 00:45:52,475
I'm going to make it big...

616
00:45:53,136 --> 00:45:55,745
so I can say your name when I win an award.

617
00:45:57,716 --> 00:46:00,415
You're not going to be the 2nd or 3rd person I mention.

618
00:46:00,415 --> 00:46:02,815
You're going to be the first. I promise.

619
00:46:34,645 --> 00:46:35,986
That's the "Wheel of Fortune."

620
00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:38,716
A card that predicts a sudden change,

621
00:46:38,716 --> 00:46:40,926
which could either be bad luck or good luck.

622
00:46:42,685 --> 00:46:44,025
It's the guy in the mask, right?

623
00:46:45,025 --> 00:46:47,395
- What? - The guy you're thinking about.

624
00:46:47,826 --> 00:46:50,665
It's the guy with a mask who was mistaken as a pervert.

625
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,366
Gosh. You're slightly scaring me.

626
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:56,866
I saw you two talking in front of the café.

627
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:58,806
Why don't you try drinking with him?

628
00:46:58,806 --> 00:47:00,775
- Drinking? - Alcohol...

629
00:47:02,205 --> 00:47:05,716
lowers people's inhibitions.

630
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:08,116
He drinks Coke with chicken.

631
00:47:12,716 --> 00:47:14,955
It's quiet without Chi Hoon.

632
00:47:15,025 --> 00:47:16,225
Where did he go again?

633
00:47:16,225 --> 00:47:17,495
Syaon's autograph event.

634
00:47:28,835 --> 00:47:32,676
(Autograph Event for Construction Completion Ceremony)

635
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:40,415
It's Syaon!

636
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,216
Syaon!

637
00:47:45,216 --> 00:47:47,486
- She's so pretty. - Oh, my gosh.

638
00:47:47,486 --> 00:47:49,926
- What in the world? - She's so pretty.

639
00:47:50,156 --> 00:47:51,225
What?

640
00:47:51,455 --> 00:47:52,995
Hey, you're here.

641
00:47:53,426 --> 00:47:54,625
Her eyes look sad.

642
00:47:55,495 --> 00:47:57,165
She's a goddess.

643
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,866
(To Lee Mi Dam)

644
00:48:00,136 --> 00:48:02,136
Okay. Thank you for coming.

645
00:48:02,136 --> 00:48:04,536
Thank you. This doll is for you.

646
00:48:04,536 --> 00:48:05,736
- Thank you. - Thank you.

647
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:11,216
Hello. What's your name?

648
00:48:12,145 --> 00:48:14,145
Baek Chi Hoon.

649
00:48:14,915 --> 00:48:16,346
Baek Chi Hoon?

650
00:48:19,256 --> 00:48:22,025
Do you happen to remember me?

651
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:24,125
Sorry?

652
00:48:31,795 --> 00:48:33,196
I'm so sorry.

653
00:48:33,196 --> 00:48:35,705
It's hard for me to remember all of my fans.

654
00:48:37,006 --> 00:48:38,536
- Are you giving this to... - No.

655
00:48:39,105 --> 00:48:40,176
It's mine.

656
00:48:40,745 --> 00:48:41,775
I see.

657
00:48:42,605 --> 00:48:44,745
- Thank you for coming. - Thank you.

658
00:48:47,176 --> 00:48:48,216
Next person.

659
00:48:49,045 --> 00:48:50,286
Something happened, right?

660
00:48:51,156 --> 00:48:52,386
You look like you cried.

661
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:54,125
Sorry?

662
00:48:57,525 --> 00:48:59,756
Wait. Syaon, hang in there.

663
00:48:59,756 --> 00:49:01,596
Syaon, you got this!

664
00:49:08,806 --> 00:49:10,506
- Hello. - Hello. What's your name?

665
00:49:28,685 --> 00:49:29,756
What are you up to?

666
00:49:29,955 --> 00:49:31,196
Do you want spicy braised monkfish?

667
00:49:31,495 --> 00:49:32,556
This is a good restaurant,

668
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:34,326
but there is only one table of customers right now.

669
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:36,295
It says you read my message.

670
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:38,165
See you in front of the elevator in five minutes.

671
00:49:39,196 --> 00:49:41,105
What? I didn't even say yes.

672
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:43,036
(Mok Sol Hee)

673
00:49:50,676 --> 00:49:51,915
Enjoy.

674
00:49:51,915 --> 00:49:53,016
Thank you.

675
00:49:54,415 --> 00:49:55,446
It looks good.

676
00:50:12,196 --> 00:50:13,366
You're good at this.

677
00:50:13,366 --> 00:50:15,435
See? You can eat outside too.

678
00:50:29,846 --> 00:50:30,855
You...

679
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,096
You got it on your face.

680
00:50:42,826 --> 00:50:44,096
Thank you.

681
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:49,966
Sweetie,

682
00:50:50,565 --> 00:50:52,205
you look pretty when you eat.

683
00:50:52,205 --> 00:50:54,176
You look so sexy when you eat.

684
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:58,576
Sweetie, I fell for you again.

685
00:51:08,256 --> 00:51:09,286
Excuse me.

686
00:51:09,926 --> 00:51:12,326
Can you try lying to me?

687
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:15,165
Lie to you all of a sudden?

688
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:17,065
Just one lie.

689
00:51:17,295 --> 00:51:19,866
Why don't you try telling me I'm pretty?

690
00:51:27,236 --> 00:51:28,346
You're pretty.

691
00:51:31,815 --> 00:51:34,185
I would say you're pretty.

692
00:51:51,536 --> 00:51:52,636
Do you want to drink?

693
00:51:54,065 --> 00:51:55,236
I quit drinking.

694
00:51:56,065 --> 00:51:59,205
Right. When I fell asleep in the parking lot,

695
00:52:00,406 --> 00:52:02,105
it was because I drank for the first time in forever.

696
00:52:02,406 --> 00:52:03,506
Why did you quit?

697
00:52:05,846 --> 00:52:07,116
There was a time in my life...

698
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:10,286
when I drank enough alcohol to last a lifetime.

699
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,855
I thought I shouldn't drink anymore,

700
00:52:15,656 --> 00:52:16,786
so I replaced it with this.

701
00:52:18,455 --> 00:52:19,696
I see.

702
00:52:25,636 --> 00:52:28,736
Then should we finish our conversation from last time?

703
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:31,576
You said you do music.

704
00:52:31,935 --> 00:52:34,346
That's so cool. Can you tell me in more detail?

705
00:52:46,216 --> 00:52:47,216
Hello?

706
00:52:47,656 --> 00:52:49,625
You finally picked up my call.

707
00:52:53,225 --> 00:52:54,225
Don't hang up.

708
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:55,966
If you do,

709
00:52:56,826 --> 00:52:58,466
you'll lose the chance to hear my voice for the last time.

710
00:52:59,495 --> 00:53:00,596
What do you mean?

711
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:04,835
Thinking about how I won't be able to sing your songs anymore...

712
00:53:06,406 --> 00:53:08,545
makes me feel like a useless person.

713
00:53:10,076 --> 00:53:11,216
Thank you...

714
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:14,045
for putting up with my toxic personality all this time,

715
00:53:15,216 --> 00:53:16,216
Do Ha.

716
00:53:19,556 --> 00:53:20,616
What do...

717
00:53:25,525 --> 00:53:28,625
The number you are calling is currently switched off. Please...

718
00:53:33,696 --> 00:53:34,736
Where are you going?

719
00:53:35,335 --> 00:53:36,366
Hold on.

720
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:40,406
(Spicy Braised Monkfish)

721
00:53:40,406 --> 00:53:42,806
Deuk Chan, do you know where Syaon is right now?

722
00:53:43,645 --> 00:53:44,946
She's at a schedule in Gangneung.

723
00:53:46,076 --> 00:53:47,076
Gangneung?

724
00:53:47,216 --> 00:53:48,745
Why? What's wrong?

725
00:53:49,145 --> 00:53:50,446
You said you wanted to break up with me!

726
00:53:50,545 --> 00:53:52,415
I'd rather die than live without you too.

727
00:53:55,085 --> 00:53:58,225
Thank you for putting up with my toxic personality all this time.

728
00:53:59,596 --> 00:54:00,625
She said she'd die.

729
00:54:01,495 --> 00:54:02,665
She said she wanted to die.

730
00:54:05,366 --> 00:54:07,466
Hello?

731
00:54:11,435 --> 00:54:13,576
What's wrong? Are you okay?

732
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,125
Get out.

733
00:54:33,926 --> 00:54:35,565
You can't drive in your current state.

734
00:54:37,966 --> 00:54:39,266
Move. I'll drive.

735
00:54:45,435 --> 00:54:48,506
Shouldn't you go to the hospital first?

736
00:54:51,815 --> 00:54:53,176
Promise me one thing.

737
00:54:54,286 --> 00:54:55,645
That you'll keep this a secret.

738
00:54:56,616 --> 00:54:58,386
I will. Tell me.

739
00:55:01,056 --> 00:55:02,855
I'm the songwriter, Kim Do Ha,

740
00:55:04,395 --> 00:55:06,326
and I'm on my way to meet Syaon right now.

741
00:55:08,665 --> 00:55:09,966
No matter what she looks like,

742
00:55:11,236 --> 00:55:13,136
please don't take pictures or spread rumours.

743
00:55:15,036 --> 00:55:17,975
Okay. Don't worry about that.

744
00:55:18,475 --> 00:55:20,835
But Syaon has a manager...

745
00:55:20,835 --> 00:55:22,406
and a lot of people around her.

746
00:55:23,176 --> 00:55:24,946
Can't you just ask someone else to check on her?

747
00:55:25,116 --> 00:55:26,645
Do you have to go yourself?

748
00:55:27,016 --> 00:55:28,415
If that's all you have to say, get out.

749
00:55:28,915 --> 00:55:30,085
I'll drive.

750
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,315
Fine. I'll keep my mouth shut.

751
00:56:13,556 --> 00:56:16,065
(Gangneung Beach)

752
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:33,576
- Let go! - Why are you doing this?

753
00:56:33,576 --> 00:56:34,815
You said you wanted to break up with me!

754
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,545
I'm just going to die.

755
00:56:36,545 --> 00:56:37,585
Eom Ji.

756
00:56:38,386 --> 00:56:40,216
Let go of me.

757
00:56:43,185 --> 00:56:44,185
Stop the car.

758
00:56:44,995 --> 00:56:46,895
- Sorry? - Stop the car!

759
00:57:00,536 --> 00:57:01,545
Do Ha?

760
00:57:04,475 --> 00:57:05,915
What's going on?

761
00:57:09,946 --> 00:57:12,156
Gosh. It hurts.

762
00:57:21,395 --> 00:57:22,466
Put on your shoes.

763
00:57:23,295 --> 00:57:25,665
I can't. I hurt my foot.

764
00:57:58,065 --> 00:57:59,165
Where are you going?

765
00:58:02,136 --> 00:58:03,136
Let go.

766
00:58:15,216 --> 00:58:16,245
Oh, my gosh.

767
00:58:16,915 --> 00:58:17,986
Hello.

768
00:58:19,085 --> 00:58:20,156
Who are you?

769
00:58:22,156 --> 00:58:25,495
I live next to Mr. Kim Do Ha.

770
00:58:25,495 --> 00:58:26,556
Here.

771
00:58:28,766 --> 00:58:29,866
Don't mind me.

772
00:58:31,096 --> 00:58:32,565
You even know his name.

773
00:58:35,466 --> 00:58:36,806
Your manager is here. Get out.

774
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,605
Do Ha, who is she?

775
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:57,256
You should've just let me die if it was going to be like this.

776
00:58:58,096 --> 00:59:01,665
I really wanted to die.

777
00:59:06,466 --> 00:59:07,866
Tell me who she is.

778
00:59:07,866 --> 00:59:09,665
- Excuse me, I'm just... - Get out!

779
00:59:34,295 --> 00:59:35,366
Let's go.

780
00:59:57,415 --> 00:59:58,516
Are you okay?

781
01:00:01,185 --> 01:00:02,225
I'm sorry.

782
01:00:05,426 --> 01:00:06,525
Get some sleep.

783
01:01:16,196 --> 01:01:17,766
(Dream Villa)

784
01:01:35,145 --> 01:01:36,946
We're here. You should get up.

785
01:02:07,045 --> 01:02:08,786
Come on. Wake up.

786
01:02:25,636 --> 01:02:26,696
Mr. Kim Do Ha.

787
01:02:27,435 --> 01:02:28,966
Wake up now.

788
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:34,906
Kim Seung Ju.

789
01:02:37,076 --> 01:02:38,145
Kim Seung Ju!

790
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:42,016
Kim Seung Ju! What did you say?

791
01:02:42,085 --> 01:02:43,685
You said you killed Choi Eom Ji.

792
01:02:45,185 --> 01:02:46,386
Why are you saying something different now?

793
01:02:47,315 --> 01:02:48,386
You remember these shoes, right?

794
01:02:52,295 --> 01:02:53,525
Why was there so much blood?

795
01:02:54,025 --> 01:02:55,096
What did you stab her with?

796
01:02:55,665 --> 01:02:57,725
Did you prepare your criminal tool beforehand?

797
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:03,406
It wasn't...

798
01:03:06,335 --> 01:03:07,406
What did you say?

799
01:03:10,045 --> 01:03:11,245
I didn't...

800
01:03:18,185 --> 01:03:21,685
kill her.

801
01:03:22,056 --> 01:03:26,625
I didn't kill her.

802
01:04:11,705 --> 01:04:15,875
(My Lovely Liar)

803
01:04:40,966 --> 01:04:42,966
Is he hiding something?

804
01:04:43,466 --> 01:04:45,536
I have a confession to make.

805
01:04:45,536 --> 01:04:48,176
He isn't Kim Do Ha.

806
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:49,346
Don't worry about me anymore.

807
01:04:51,076 --> 01:04:52,745
Just consider me a person who doesn't exist.

808
01:04:52,745 --> 01:04:54,076
Why do you do that?

809
01:04:54,076 --> 01:04:55,516
You always have your face covered,

810
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,116
and you run away and disappear all the time.

811
01:04:57,446 --> 01:04:58,986
I said stop! You don't know anything about me!

812
01:04:58,986 --> 01:05:00,056
Of course, I don't know!

813
01:05:00,056 --> 01:05:01,656
How am I supposed to know when you don't tell me anything?

814
01:05:02,256 --> 01:05:04,486
Who would want to listen to a song written by a murderer?

815
01:05:05,725 --> 01:05:07,056
I am the songwriter, Kim Do Ha.

816
01:05:07,056 --> 01:05:08,225
("RUN" by Woody has been released!)

817
01:05:08,225 --> 01:05:11,395
I hope you can come at 8pm tonight.
