(The guardians of child actors were present at the filming.)

10
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,090
Tell me. Did you kill Eom Ji?

11
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,090
Did you kill her?

12
00:00:57,389 --> 00:00:59,929
Who are you? Get your hands off me.

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,069
Oh, it's you! Weren't you Eom Ji's boyfriend?

14
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:10,000
Just tell me if you killed her or not.

15
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,140
I didn't do it. I didn't kill her.

16
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,130
Well,

17
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,030
I did hope that someone would kill her.

18
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,630
My creditors told me...

19
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:43,399
that they were going to sell her organs to settle my debt.

20
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,369
They told me not to be shocked if she suddenly turned up dead.

21
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:50,839
But I had to get something out of this, you know?

22
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,380
I paid into that expensive insurance policy.

23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,979
But they said she killed herself. Darn it.

24
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,520
Why aren't you home? When are you coming back home?

25
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,890
I don't have any money to give you even if I go back home.

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,330
You little brat.

27
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,458
If you don't want to die, you'd better come home right now.

28
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,100
Who said I didn't want to die?

29
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:13,229
If I die, don't even hold a funeral for me.

30
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:16,769
I hate the thought of you collecting the condolence money at my funeral.

31
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,549
Why didn't you tell the police about that?

32
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,650
Are you kidding me?

33
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,780
I couldn't get the insurance claim if she killed herself.

34
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,418
You're her dad. How could you...

35
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:37,519
But I didn't kill her.

36
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,699
You're the one who killed her. Right?

37
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,669
He didn't kill her.

38
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:48,940
Who are you now?

39
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,669
Is she going to be your next victim?

40
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,310
I've had enough.

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,049
How dare you speak to her that way?

42
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,850
She said he didn't do it, then he didn't do it.

43
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:04,449
Hey, who's the real culprit?

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
Spill it.

45
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,518
How would I know that?

46
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,719
You jerk. I should knock out all of your teeth.

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,759
Spill it!

48
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,699
That guy.

49
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,069
That guy used to follow Eom Ji around all the time.

50
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,210
He was basically a stalker.

51
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,609
- Get that punk! - Get him!

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
Darn it.

00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,519
(Singing Club)

54
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,220
Hey, what are you doing?

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,359
Hey! You jerk!

56
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,738
Ms. Hunter, hop in.

57
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:56,069
- Hurry! - Okay.

58
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,618
Tell me. Did you kill Eom Ji?

59
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:24,629
Hey!

60
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:27,558
Why do you keep chasing me?

61
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:30,830
And when did you get so cozy with the thugs from the gambling house?

62
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:32,600
Did you kill Eom Ji?

63
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,609
Darn it.

64
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:43,539
Fine.

65
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:46,179
I killed her.

66
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,890
You really fell for it.

67
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:54,590
I was joking.

68
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,489
Hey, Jo Jae Chan.

69
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,090
You don't have to do this.

70
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:01,999
Eom Ji...

71
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,260
was dating me too.

72
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,299
Did you think she just sat around and waited for you?

73
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,200
She didn't.

74
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,669
She and I were great too.

75
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,309
He's lying.

76
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,129
Tell me the truth.

77
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:36,030
Did you kill Eom Ji?

78
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,539
Don't come any closer,

79
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,609
or I'm going to stab her.

80
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:52,780
It's okay. He's lying.

81
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,179
Go and get that jerk.

82
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,549
Come on. I'm fine.

83
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,660
I won't come after you.

84
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:06,059
Just let her go and leave.

85
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,499
Hey, give me your car key.

86
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,760
Toss it to me.

87
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,239
Don't move.

88
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:28,280
Get him.

89
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,289
Why did you do that?

90
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,168
(Episode 13)

91
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:49,399
Gosh. Had I gotten there earlier,

92
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,570
I could have heard if he was lying or not.

93
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,270
But...

94
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,280
why do you think he joked about killing her?

95
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,710
It was also odd that he lied about secretly dating her.

96
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:02,379
Right?

97
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,289
- Sol Hee. - Yes.

98
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,950
Thank you.

99
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,260
For what?

100
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,489
For everything.

101
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,460
Once this is all over,

102
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,200
I'll make sure you won't have to go through anything difficult again.

103
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:18,400
I promise.

104
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:26,439
If I didn't have my ability, it would have been tough.

105
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,379
Everyone claims to be innocent,

106
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:34,080
and not being able to verify the truth would've been frustrating.

107
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,579
All my life,

108
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,220
I thought being able to listen to people's lies made my life hard.

109
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:44,830
But lately, I'm so relieved that I can.

110
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,930
That is why...

111
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,200
this isn't tough on me at all.

112
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,129
That guy used to follow Eom Ji around all the time.

113
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,369
Fine.

114
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,040
I killed her.

115
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,300
I was joking.

116
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,149
(Dream Villa)

117
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,909
Do Ha.

118
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,249
I was just going to wait for a bit, and then I fell asleep too.

119
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,859
Let's go inside. You should sleep at home.

120
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:24,960
Well, I'm planning to go and talk to Deuk Chan.

121
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,359
Now?

122
00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:27,989
Yes.

123
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:29,930
He's probably the best person to know where Jae Chan would go...

124
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,499
and what he would do.

125
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,368
I think he might get angry...

126
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:35,700
if he finds out you're suspecting his brother.

127
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,409
Why don't I ask him that?

128
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,268
What?

129
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:42,209
You can pretend that you don't believe he did it.

130
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,779
But I can pretend to be suspicious of Jae Chan.

131
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,450
You don't have to go that far.

132
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,180
You don't have to worry about him.

133
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,619
I know that you two are like brothers,

134
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,060
but Mr. Jo and Jae Chan are real brothers.

135
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:00,430
I know Deuk Chan well.

136
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:02,930
Remember what you told me before?

137
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,700
Deuk Chan said he believed me, and he was telling the truth.

138
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:08,029
That bothers me too.

139
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,009
Maybe he said that because he knew Jae Chan was the real culprit.

140
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:14,979
- So let me go with you. - Sol Hee.

141
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,479
I will handle Deuk Chan on my own.

142
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,279
I don't want you to suspect him like that.

143
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,659
Okay. I understand.

144
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,999
You're not upset, right?

145
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,830
Why would I be upset?

146
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:40,430
Drive safely then.

(Hakcheon Police Station)

150
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,888
No. The higher-ups won't let me run the story.

151
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,190
So, I'll investigate on my own and post it on my personal channel.

152
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,960
No. My personal channel... I'll call you later.

153
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,029
Excuse me. You're Detective Kwak Jin Hyuk, right?

154
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,429
I have a few questions for you.

155
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,669
You're a TV producer, right?

156
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,469
Shouldn't you search the hill where Choi Eom Ji's body was found...

157
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,138
a little more?

158
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:23,979
There's a possibility of finding her belongings or other items.

159
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,879
You need to formally request for our cooperation.

160
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,179
It looks like you don't seem that interested...

161
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,549
in solving this case like five years ago.

162
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,690
Is there a reason you're not investigating more thoroughly?

163
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,889
Detective Kwak!

164
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,460
Will you at least take my card?

165
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,790
Let me just give him my card.

166
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,969
Please call me if you have anything to share. Please!

167
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,040
(Clean Store)

168
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:51,469
You said you saw...

169
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,009
the late Choi Eom Ji with Kim Seung Ju, right?

170
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,408
Gosh. When I made the report all those years ago,

171
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,638
the police weren't even interested.

172
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,310
Why are you asking these questions now?

173
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,978
(The owner reported it to the police, but it was ignored.)

174
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:05,850
You can't trust the police officers who are native to Hakcheon.

175
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,059
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,930
Can you tell me what you saw again in more detail?

177
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:16,629
I saw them when I parked my car to get some fresh air.

178
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,268
Gosh, I feel carsick.

179
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:25,440
Take a deep breath.

180
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:27,070

182
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,648
Then I saw a man...

183
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,810
wearing a red uniform walk toward her.

184
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:37,319
I feel better now.

185
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,089
Since we're here, should we take a walk along the beach?

186
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,858
What are you talking about? I have to watch the soccer game. No.

187
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:43,859
Let's go back.

188
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,330
Then, you didn't see Kim Seung Ju's face.

189
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,399
I was too far away to be able to see his face clearly.

190
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,440
But that woman definitely said, "Seung Ju."

191
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,268
Then it had to be him.

192
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,040
I heard that they were dating.

193
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,210
Then, did you see what happened after that?

194
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,440
No. Well, I left right away.

195
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,149
But I know this for sure.

196
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:10,550
It looked like the guy left before and then came back for her.

197
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,849
But according to the news,

198
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,259
he said he left the girl there and went to watch the soccer game.

199
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,489
I found that odd.

200
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,600
What? Isn't that Kim Do Ha?

201
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,399
- Isn't that Kim Do Ha? - Yes, it is him.

202
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,909
- What? - It's him, right?

(CEO Jo Deuk Chan)

204
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,409
Come in.

205
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:43,720
It's been a while, Deuk Chan.

206
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:48,090
Hey. It's been a while.

207
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,060
Sit down.

208
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,600
Do Ha. As for the last article,

209
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,600
a lot of things got misunderstood.

210
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,070
It must have been tough for you to do damage control because of you.

211
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,879
I'm sorry.

212
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,479
Gosh, no.

213
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,710
This must have been tougher on you.

214
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,050
I went to Hakcheon.

215
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:23,619
Why?

216
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,090
Did the police ask you to come down?

217
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:28,129
No.

218
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:30,600
I went there because I wanted to find my culprit myself.

219
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:32,369
And...

220
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,670
I ran into Jae Chan there.

221
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,009
Was he gambling there again?

222
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,909
Did you know about that?

223
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,680
Yes.

224
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,149
You know those delinquent kids he hung out with in high school?

225
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,850
They still work there.

226
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,649
He swore he would never go back.

227
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,590
Then, did you also know that Jae Chan liked Eom Ji?

228
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,499
I'm sure you knew that...

229
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,199
you were the only one she liked.

230
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,969
Jae Chan just had a crush on her.

231
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,470
- You would've been uncomfortable... - Do you know where he is right now?

232
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,540
Why do you ask?

233
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,479
Don't tell me...

234
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:19,479
you're suspecting him.

235
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:21,749
I am.

236
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Hey.

237
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,129
I know that he causes a lot of trouble.

238
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,699
But he wouldn't kill anyone. He's not like that.

239
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,700
I met Eom Ji's father in Hakcheon.

240
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,470
He said he suspected Jae Chan.

241
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,439
He's an alcoholic. Do you actually believe him?

242
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,268
Even I found him suspicious on many accounts.

243
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:47,310
Do Ha.

244
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,680
Of all people, you can't do this to us...

245
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,979
after everything we've done for you.

246
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,180
Deuk Chan.

247
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,249
I'm so disappointed in you.

248
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,690
You should leave.

00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,080
(Beloved and Respected Hakcheon Police)

250
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,359
On the day of the incident,

251
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:44,499
there was a witness who saw Kim Seung Ju.

252
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,698
But you ignored it.

253
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:46,800
Who said that?

254
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,500
I saw it in Choi Eom Ho's notebook.

255
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:51,300
I followed it up with the witness and confirmed it.

256
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:54,310
Why did you do that?

257
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,280
Did you really take money from Jung Yeon Mi?

258
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,178
You're crossing the line right now.

259
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:02,179
I...

260
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,919
like you and respect you.

261
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,519
When I came back after my sick leave,

262
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,159
everyone looked at me with concern.

263
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:11,820
But only you believed in me.

264
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,059
I still don't think you're a bad person.

265
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,060
I'm sure you had your reasons.

266
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:20,270
But it's been five years, and the body was found.

267
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:22,139
We can correct this.

268
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,000
Stop it.

269
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,468
Why are you so interested in this case?

270
00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:28,678
"Why?"

271
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,709
Being interested in our cases is our job.

272
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,520
This isn't your case.

273
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,458
If you come back here again, I'll call your station...

274
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:44,459
and tell them to formally request to join my case.

275
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,709
Why isn't he calling me? I'm getting worried.

276
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,540
Hey.

277
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,179
A guy kept checking out your café.

278
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,289
- A guy? - I asked him who he was,

279
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,419
but he didn't tell me.

280
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:49,990
Is he a client?

281
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:52,289
By the way,

282
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,958
if you're temporarily closed because of your boyfriend,

283
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,599
you should open your café again.

284
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,059
We don't care about that.

285
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,459
We also think he didn't do it.

286
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,510
Yes. That's the guy. Him, over there.

287
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,290
Dad?

288
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,520
Here.

289
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,429
I wanted to buy you a nice meal. Why did you want to come here?

290
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,159
I like humble places like this.

291
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:29,629
What would you like?

292
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,959
I'll take doenjang stew. What about you?

293
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,368
Today's special comes with doenjang stew, right?

294
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,868
- Yes. - We'll take two specials then.

295
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,840
Gosh. That's expensive.

296
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:41,138
I'll just take doenjang stew.

297
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,179
Okay.

298
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,509
Don't spend money on me.

299
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,580
You worked hard to make that money. It's too precious.

300
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,878
Dad, but why are you wearing sunglasses?

301
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:50,919
Oh, these?

302
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,089
I got stung by a bee.

303
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,090
A bee?

304
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,489
- Let me see. - I'm okay. It's all healed.

305
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,189
Gosh. I got used to wearing them.

306
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,290
It looks good, right?

307
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:03,060
This could've been much worse.

308
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:08,500
Anyway, where were you until now and how have you been?

309
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:10,169
Have you been well?

310
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:12,969
I...

311
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:16,179
I'm here because of your boyfriend.

312
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,080
Mom must've told you.

313
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:25,149
It wasn't him. I heard it loud and clear.

314
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:31,060
Because of what I passed down,

315
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,060
you lost out on so much while growing up.

316
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,159
You never got to believe in Santa,

317
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,129
you didn't have any friends in school.

318
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:41,500
Your mom wasn't there for you when you needed her the most.

319
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:48,340
It's why I wish you to be with a man who is disgustingly normal.

320
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:52,080
It's more than enough hardship with you alone being unique.

321
00:21:56,949 --> 00:22:00,550
But he doesn't see me as unique though.

322
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,790
He wasn't fazed by what I could do.

323
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,629
On top of that, he doesn't lie.

324
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,530
It's why I feel normal whenever I'm around him.

325
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:13,929
But we sure are wired differently.

326
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,300
My first instinct is to be sceptical,

327
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,540
but not an ounce of doubt exists when he chooses to believe someone.

328
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,409
I envy that in some way, although it can be frustrating.

329
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:27,750
When it comes to believing someone, it is either all or nothing.

330
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,820
You can't say you believe him if there's even a hint of doubt.

331
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:36,290
So, if you're going to believe him, do so with every fibre of your body.

332
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,859
Let's eat.

333
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,500
The doenjang stew is eight dollars, right?

334
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,868
Dad, let me.

335
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:55,169
- No, I have the money. - Stop it. It'll be on me.

336
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,439
- Here. - Please don't.

337
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,780
- This really isn't necessary. - Save it.

338
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,810
Gosh.

339
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:03,118
Have a good day.

(Jimyeori Transport Café)

341
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:08,320
- Dad. - Yes?

342
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,490
Take this.

343
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,859
Forget it.

344
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,830
Just take it.

345
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,429
I said I was fine.

346
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,600
You know I meant it.

347
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,369
Exactly. But why do you always mean it...

348
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,639
when Mom constantly asks for more?

00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:39,619
Hey, Mom.

352
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,590
Wire 5,000 dollars into my account.

353
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:43,919
What?

354
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,159
I'll give you five minutes. It's urgent.

355
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:51,399
Stop demanding money from her. Is she your personal bank?

356
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,569
You took 10 to 100 times more...

357
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,740
than what we spent raising her.

358
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:57,799
Having her was our choice,

359
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,139
and she did her part by growing up in perfect health.

360
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,240
Don't make her bankroll you.

361
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,379
Block her number.

362
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,149
Are you kidding me?

363
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:17,659
What gives him the right to patronize me?

364
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,729
Living with a young brat...

365
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,330
must've gone to his head.

366
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,868
Goodness.

367
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:28,128
I'm so sorry. I apologize for my tardiness.

368
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:30,698
It's hardly an issue. Please have a seat.

369
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:32,810
Gift-wrapping this...

370
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,639
took longer than expected.

371
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,780
My gosh.

372
00:24:38,949 --> 00:24:40,509
What could this be?

373
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,379
Please don't tell me it's for me.

374
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:45,889
- Open it. - Goodness.

375
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,649
My gosh.

376
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:49,859
I wonder what it is.

377
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,590
Goodness.

378
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,770
Oh, my gosh!

379
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,070
- Do you like it? - It's...

380
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:06,209
It's...

381
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,540
so shiny.

382
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:11,239
Is that so?

383
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,780
Then, may I put it on you?

384
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:17,919
Sorry? No, it's all right...

385
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,850
Just a second.

386
00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:22,719
My vision has gotten worse with age.

387
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:25,520
Gosh. Same here.

388
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:34,330
- You look stunning. - Gosh.

389
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,100
Is that so?

390
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,368
Let me also put this bracelet on you.

391
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:40,010
It's all right. I can...

392
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,340
Gosh.

393
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:48,250
I'm astonished to know that this suits you...

394
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:50,378
beyond my expectations.

395
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:52,790
I owe it all to you for choosing such delicate pieces.

396
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,290
Gosh.

397
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,090
Over here. Can we have the menu?

398
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,300
Do Ha.

399
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:11,569
Of all people, you can't do this to us...

400
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,310
after everything we've done for you.

401
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,618
The call cannot be connected. Please leave a message...

402
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:58,879
after the tone.

403
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,760
Was I too harsh?

404
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,830
Sol Hee.

405
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,830
We should talk.

406
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
Sol Hee?

407
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,810
I apologize for earlier.

408
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:28,810
I should've listened to you.

409
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,619
Sol Hee,

410
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,790
what's wrong?

411
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:39,189
Luni's missing.

412
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,830
Normally, they're found in dark, secluded areas.

413
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,570
In places like under the desk, the bed, or the fridge.

414
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:54,909
But Luni has never been missing before.

415
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,980
Could she have fallen down the drain?

416
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,080
The bathroom.

417
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:22,169
Gosh.

418
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:34,510
What on earth is this?

419
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:51,129
No way.

420
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,300
Wait. Where did you find this?

421
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,600
Under the couch.

422
00:29:10,219 --> 00:29:11,250
Hold on.

423
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,349
What if she...

424
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,159
dropped off the balcony?

425
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,560
I doubt it.

426
00:29:22,189 --> 00:29:23,629
I'm sure she's inside the house.

427
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:26,030
I'll help with the search.

428
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:30,570
Luni.

429
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,639
Luni?

430
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:35,840
Luni?

431
00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:39,250
Luni.

432
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,189
Luni?

433
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,709
I'm sure she's here somewhere.

434
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:17,580
Don't worry too much.

435
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:30,500
Sol Hee!

436
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,800
Luni!

437
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,540
Where were you?

438
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,740
She was under the sink.

439
00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:43,209
I looked for you everywhere.

440
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,540
Don't you leave the tank again.

441
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:59,358
I've lived with Luni since middle school,

442
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,159
and all my problems were for her to hear.

443
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,459
I still believe Luni understands everything I say.

444
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,600
Why did you talk to Luni about your problems?

445
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,770
Because Luni's tight-lipped.

446
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:15,939
Being able to detect lies teaches you...

447
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,080
that there isn't a true friend who keeps all your secrets.

448
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,879
I'm not saying that's how you and Jo Deuk Chan are though.

449
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:29,790
Actually,

450
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,889
I couldn't figure out where Dae Chan was,

451
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,260
and Deuk Chan gave me an earful.

452
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:38,859
So much for saying I could do it, right?

453
00:31:41,469 --> 00:31:42,570
I bet I upset you earlier.

454
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:48,169
I was a little annoyed at first,

455
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:50,810
but that feeling soon turned into envy.

456
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,149
I've never fully believed in anyone.

457
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,790
I'll be your first, then.

458
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:12,869
I should probably feed Luni.

459
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,439
This is Lee Kang Min.

460
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,810
I'd like to meet up.

461
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,550
But don't tell Sol Hee.

462
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,030
What is this about?

463
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,060
I'll cut right to the chase.

464
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,069
There are witnesses...

465
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,600
who saw you approach Choi Eom Ji at the beach...

466
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,840
the day she disappeared.

467
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:55,209
I approached her?

468
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,639
Actually, I accompanied her there.

469
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:00,510
Who is this so-called witness?

470
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,009
What took them so long to come forward?

471
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,580
You didn't go to the soccer game that day, did you?

472
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,119
I didn't.

473
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:15,859
When did you part ways with Ms. Choi?

474
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,030
Relatively early.

475
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,299
And I said I couldn't see her anymore.

476
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,969
I then walked all the way home.

477
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:26,510
Then,

478
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:29,979
you weren't at that pub.

479
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,240
All I did that night was walk down a quiet country road.

480
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:34,550
There was no one at home,

481
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,580
so I couldn't provide an alibi.

482
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,020
That's why Deuk Chan and Jae Chan...

483
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,149
opted to be my alibi.

484
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:43,159
I see.

485
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:45,459
So you're saying...

486
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,060
that the man caught on camera...

487
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,230
was Jo Jae Chan.

488
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:53,669
That's right.

489
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,438
And I spoke of all that when I testified recently.

490
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:58,740
Look here, Mr. Kim.

491
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:01,669
Jo Jae Chan and Jo Deuk Chan...

492
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,178
were waiting for you at the pub.

493
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:07,780
And according to the witness, someone in a red soccer jersey...

494
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:10,649
approached Ms. Choi when she was alone.

495
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,150
Who do you think that was, then?

496
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,889
Then I guess it really could've been Jo Jae Chan.

497
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:21,630
What?

498
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,560
I wasn't aware of this,

499
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,429
but he liked Eom Ji a great deal.

500
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,068
Hold on. Are you suspecting the man...

501
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:35,670
who fabricated your alibi?

502
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:38,980
Yes, and it's the same as how you're suspecting me.

503
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,709
I want to catch the killer just as much.

504
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,379
So, rather than trying to find what makes me look guilty,

505
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,679
looking for the real killer...

506
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,690
will help the case get solved.

507
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:52,619
From now on,

508
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,730
don't ask me to meet you in secret again.

509
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,960
I'm a terrible liar,

510
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,299
and I don't have the ability to fool Sol Hee.

511
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,179
How is he so confident?

512
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,949
Min Ji.

513
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,790
What's going on?

514
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:21,719
Min Ji...

515
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:23,758
Min Ji.

516
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:24,859
(Intensive Care Unit)

517
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,290
Min Ji...

518
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:31,630
Why is this suddenly happening to her?

519
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,569
She developed this illness seven years ago,

520
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,229
and respiratory distress manifests commonly...

521
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,299
during the latter half of the disease.

522
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,298
I suggest you brace yourself for what could come.

523
00:35:39,299 --> 00:35:41,239
What on earth are you saying?

524
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:42,979
Please don't say that.

525
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,579
We'll do our best.

526
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,449
(Restricted Area Intensive Care Unit)

527
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,698
What brings you all this way?

528
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:07,928
Being busy seemed like a lousy excuse...

529
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:10,040
for putting off seeing you this long.

530
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:16,440
I wanted to show my appreciation...

531
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,710
for how you neatly handled my son's case...

532
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,980
and got rid of the evidence.

533
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:25,649
If all goes well at the election,

534
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,190
your promotion could be in the works.

535
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:31,190
Although you might have to transfer out.

536
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,559
You already know that my daughter...

537
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,690
will make it impossible for me to leave Hakcheon.

538
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,460
Still,

539
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,270
you could leave this city someday.

540
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,699
That's how her illness works.

541
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:45,799
Are you saying...

542
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,779
that my daughter will die?

543
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,009
Were you...

544
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,279
already aware that she was in critical condition?

545
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,919
Of course, I wasn't.

546
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,549
You know...

547
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:02,449
you can't use her hospital bills as leverage anymore,

548
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,819
so you're threatening to keep me on a leash in some other way...

549
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,459
so that I wouldn't turn against you.

550
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,860
I've been threatening you?

551
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,130
All this time, I thought we were helping each other out.

552
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:13,770
This is wrong.

553
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:16,369
I know I'm a dirty cop...

554
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:19,239
who's been on your payroll.

555
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,670
But how could you come at me like this...

556
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,339
when my daughter's fighting for her life?

557
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:39,690
(Out of business)

558
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,170
I guess he's not here.

559
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,270
I was hoping he'd be here.

560
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,920
- Darn it. - Excuse me, sir.

561
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,249
What brings you to this place?

562
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,319
Who are you looking for?

563
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:09,718
Who else...

564
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:11,290
but the punks who robbed me of my money?

565
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:12,919
Punks?

566
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,588
Doesn't the place have one sole owner?

567
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:15,888
It does,

568
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:18,199
but another punk also took off with this money.

569
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,799
Could you happen to have his number?

570
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,730
I doubt he'll pick up.

571
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,600
Anyway, who's asking?

572
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,239
I'm also...

573
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,980
one of his victims.

574
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:34,009
What could've made me leave my money with him?

575
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:37,379
I've been too angry to eat...

576
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,619
or sleep.

577
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:42,089
Same here.

578
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:45,420
And my wife's always on my case.

579
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:47,929
This is his number.

580
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,399
Let's get our money back no matter what.

581
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,529
- Good luck. - Good luck.

582
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,880
Hello?

583
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,920
I'm a victim too.

584
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,589
Do you know where Jo Jae Chan is?

585
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:20,690
Hello?

586
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:27,899
I can't believe that was your opening line.

587
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,699
Even I would hang up without saying anything.

588
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:31,900
Unbelievable.

589
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:34,909
Wait for me.

590
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:42,350
I want to catch the killer just as much.

591
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,278
So, rather than trying to find what makes me look guilty,

592
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:46,888
looking for the real killer...

593
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:48,520
will help the case get solved.

594
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:52,690
(Chief Kwak Jin Hyuk)

595
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:56,429
Yes, Chief Kwak.

596
00:39:58,699 --> 00:39:59,759
Right now?

597
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,369
Where exactly are you?

598
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,869
(Producer Cha Se Kwang)

599
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,480
Chief, what brings you all the way here?

600
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,150
Here.

601
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:20,589
It was found alongside Choi Eom Ji's body.

602
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,158
My guess is that...

603
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:27,088
it's one of the matching rings she got with Kim Seung Ju,

604
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:28,989
but only a man's ring was found.

605
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,130
It's true...

606
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,730
that I was receiving money from Jeong Yeon Mi.

607
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,238
This won't hold up as evidence anyway,

608
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:40,270
so look into the weapon Kim Seung Ju used...

609
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,810
or check if he possesses any of the victim's belongings.

610
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,210
I know it's a long shot, but it's the only move we have.

611
00:40:52,279 --> 00:40:53,290
Chief.

612
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:54,989
I'm sorry about this.

613
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,659
I only did it to help my daughter,

614
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:00,589
but it seems like she's being punished for my actions.

615
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,360
I will be held accountable for this.

616
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,440
(Choi Eom Ji, Missing since June 24, 2018)

617
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,819
Could it be a ring of a similar design...

618
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:30,790
that belongs to someone unrelated to the case?

619
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,029
What's with that ring?

620
00:41:34,389 --> 00:41:35,460
Is it yours?

621
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:37,500
No, it's someone else's.

622
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,699
As in, who?

623
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,429
You don't need to know.

624
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:45,069
Can I take a look?

625
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:48,040
I've been meaning to get matching rings with my girlfriend,

626
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,369
so maybe I could use that as a reference.

627
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,679
Be careful with it.

628
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,520
Okay. I'll be careful.

629
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,960
The design is unique.

630
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:09,290
Really? Is this unique?

631
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:12,929
I bet this person designed this ring themselves.

632
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:15,230
There are a lot of workshops in the neighbourhood.

633
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:16,869
It's pretty.

634
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:20,170
Should I do something like this too?

635
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:24,839
If this was really designed as you said,

636
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,080
that means there is only one ring in this world with this design.

637
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:32,020
Well, I guess so.

638
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,630
(Mr. Boss)

639
00:42:47,529 --> 00:42:48,969
Yes, I'm listening.

640
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,409
Ms. Hunter, I found out where Jo Jae Chan is.

641
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,440
Where is he?

642
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,079
There is a gambling house I own in Gangnam.

643
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,908
He was visiting that place,

644
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:02,609
but my men caught him and confined him nearby.

645
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,849
I'll send you the address.

646
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,420
Okay. So he's in Gangnam, right?

647
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:09,719
(Gold Zone)

648
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:26,369
I'm not sure.

649
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:29,270
You won't be able to find out like this.

650
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:30,839
There isn't even a logo on the ring.

651
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,239
That's what everyone told me.

652
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,409
Do you know when it was made?

653
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:38,650
It was probably about 6 or 7 years ago.

654
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,089
The most popular store back then was...

655
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,560
That store across the street.

656
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:46,830
That store had the most customers.

657
00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:48,360
You should try out that store.

658
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:52,500
Okay. Thank you.

659
00:43:58,339 --> 00:43:59,940
We're here for Jo Jae Chan.

660
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:01,540
Where is he?

661
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:03,810
He's not here.

662
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:06,639
Sorry? We were told he was here.

663
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:13,049
He ran away when we weren't paying attention. I'm sorry.

664
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,818
How long has it been?

665
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,290
He didn't run away.

666
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,060
Or was he never here to begin with?

667
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:22,989
What are you saying?

668
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,429
He was here just a second ago, but he ran away.

669
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,739
If he was here, but he didn't run away,

670
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,369
did you let him go?

671
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:35,838
What? Why would we let him go?

672
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,079
Come on. Stop the nonsense.

673
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,879
If you're done here, you may leave now.

674
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,449
I don't think your boss told you who I am.

675
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,278
Should I call him?

676
00:44:46,279 --> 00:44:47,350
(Mr. Boss)

677
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:50,989
We had no choice.

678
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:52,690
Hey.

679
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:55,460
He borrowed a lot of money from us,

680
00:44:55,489 --> 00:44:58,699
but someone paid us back for letting him go.

681
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,770
- So... - Who was it?

682
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:03,469
I don't know that much.

683
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,610
By any chance,

684
00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:14,710
was it this person?

685
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,020
Yes, that's right.

686
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,249
I can tell from the craftsmanship.

687
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:22,889
Only our store can do this.

688
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,659
Can I obtain relevant details about this person?

689
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:26,819
Why?

690
00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:31,029
I am a detective at Yeonseo Police Station.

691
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:32,929
This ring was found at a crime scene.

692
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:35,600
We need to identify the person who made this ring,

693
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,830
so your cooperation would be appreciated.

694
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:40,339
There are so many rings that were made at our store.

695
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:42,569
It will probably take me several days.

696
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,850
You don't know the person's name, do you?

697
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,520
Kim Seung Ju. Can you try looking up Kim Seung Ju?

698
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:58,889
I have never seen his face before.

699
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,360
No, it's not him.

700
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:03,929
It is.

701
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,400
Jo Deuk Chan is the one who took him.

702
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,170
Why did you lie?

703
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:20,350
Did Jo Deuk Chan ask you to act like he ran away?

704
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,679
That's not it...

705
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,020
So it was.

706
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:29,089
All right. I understand.

707
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,889
Is something wrong with your ears? I said that's not true.

708
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,259
Why do you keep saying the opposite...

709
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,600
If I say so, then it is.

710
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:42,869
Let's go.

711
00:46:43,429 --> 00:46:44,469
What?

712
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,540
Hey...

713
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:48,639
Darn it. Gosh.

714
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:50,880
I found it.

715
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:53,949
Looking at this, I remember clearly.

716
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:56,580
The man who ordered the rings was quite fastidious.

717
00:46:56,779 --> 00:46:58,949
"Order placed by Kim Seung Ju. Couple rings."

718
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:03,889
But he ordered another men's ring.

719
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:05,790
Sorry?

720
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:08,488
"The man lost his ring in a week, so he reordered."

721
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:11,460
"He asked to keep it a secret since his girlfriend would get mad."

722
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,060
We have some memos recorded here.

723
00:47:13,259 --> 00:47:16,699
And when he reordered the ring, he changed the size...

724
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,100
from a 16 to a 17.

725
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,239
Then I guess it really could've been Jo Jae Chan.

726
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:22,339
He liked Eom Ji a great deal.

727
00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:26,738
Do you think it could have been another man?

728
00:47:26,739 --> 00:47:28,380
I can't be certain of that.

729
00:47:28,509 --> 00:47:30,519
This happens from time to time with men...

730
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,819
because the ring is too tight at first.

731
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,489
What size is this ring?

732
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,719
This one is...

733
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:39,819
a size 17. The one that was reordered.

734
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:45,060
What about his phone number when he reordered the ring?

735
00:47:45,259 --> 00:47:46,400
Was it the same as the first time?

736
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,400
That time, it wasn't a mobile phone. It was a landline number.

737
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,040
Here you go.

738
00:48:08,589 --> 00:48:11,119
The number does not exist.

739
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:15,529
Thank you.

740
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,330
Goodbye.

741
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,469
(Deuk Chan)

742
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:43,190
Hey.

743
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,790
Deuk Chan, where are you?

744
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,730
I'm not feeling well, so I'm at home.

745
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,330
I see.

746
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,600
Are you with your wife and daughter?

747
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,469
They're at my parents-in-law's. I'm by myself.

748
00:49:00,509 --> 00:49:01,509
What is it?

749
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,880
I'm sorry about the other day.

750
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:11,679
Don't worry about it.

751
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,790
I'm sorry too.

752
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,049
About Jae Chan...

753
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,790
I haven't heard anything either.

754
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:25,000
After his restaurant went under, I haven't even seen his face.

755
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,440
I see. All right.

756
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,190
Gosh, Deuk Chan. I was slightly touched.

757
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,719
You actually feel like my brother for the first time. Thanks.

758
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:58,000
How long are you going to stay here like this?

759
00:49:59,759 --> 00:50:01,000
It hasn't even been that long.

760
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,670
I'll stay here for a bit.

761
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:04,839
This place is the safest.

762
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,580
Do you think...

763
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,350
Deuk Chan is hiding Jae Chan, knowing he is the culprit...

764
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,949
or not?

765
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:23,619
There's no way for me to know...

766
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,259
until I hear his voice in person.

767
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:34,569
(Kang Min)

768
00:50:35,429 --> 00:50:37,170
Hey, Kang Min. What's the matter?

769
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,310
With Do Ha?

770
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,210
You had matching rings with Choi Eom Ji, right?

771
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,409
What did you do with it?

772
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,719
This is my third time saying this.

773
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,388
Did you find that ring or something?

774
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:58,759
Let me hear your answer first.

775
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:04,360
After Eom Ji went missing, I threw it into Hakcheon Beach.

776
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:08,169
Did you ever reorder the ring because you lost it?

777
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,029
No, I haven't.

778
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:14,469
So you're saying you only ordered two, right?

779
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:17,040
Of course. They were rings for a couple.

780
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,389
This is not your ring.

781
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,429
It's the culprit's ring.

782
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,330
"The culprit's ring?"

783
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,730
What do you mean by that?

784
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:43,400
- Who is the culprit? - It was probably...

785
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,339
someone who was very close to you...

786
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:49,009
because they knew where the ring was made.

787
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,679
Also,

788
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:54,650
someone who faced unrequited love toward Choi Eom Ji.

789
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,989
This is the phone number left by the culprit at the time.

790
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:08,429
I looked into it, and it was the number of a wine bar...

791
00:52:08,589 --> 00:52:10,830
in Cheongdam-dong called JJ, which shut down six years ago.

792
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:14,029
Do you know it?

793
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,440
It was run by Jo Jae Chan.

794
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:28,149
Assemblywoman Jung Yeon Mi, is still in the lead...

795
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:32,080
in the midst of her son's controversy.

796
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:36,149
According to the recent calculation of approval ratings,

797
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,959
Jung Yeon Mi has an approval rating of 41 percent,

798
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,189
while Kim Joong Jin has an approval rating of 33 percent,

799
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:45,659
which confirms Jung Yeon Mi's popularity.

800
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,399
I, Jung Yeon Mi,

801
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,000
am here thanks to everyone's trust.

802
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,698
Rather than being swayed by suspicions with no evidence,

803
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:56,169
please look at the incontrovertible accomplishments...

804
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:59,039
that have been achieved by me thus far.

805
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,350
Please make me your representative!

806
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,350
Then what should we do now?

807
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,290
Should we grab Jo Jae Chan and have him confess?

808
00:53:08,949 --> 00:53:12,159
A confession alone cannot prove anyone to be guilty.

809
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,029
There needs to be confirmatory evidence.

810
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:20,830
Then, this could have been evidence.

811
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,509
So this is the most important part.

812
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:32,278
We have to check to see if he still has...

813
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:35,080
the weapon he used or anything left behind by the victim.

814
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:39,719
Although it is highly unlikely that he'll still have anything.

815
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:44,960
I should meet Jo Jae Chan.

816
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,758
I'm Jung Yeon Mi.

817
00:53:47,759 --> 00:53:50,158
- Good luck. - Good luck.

818
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:51,459
- I will make Gyeonggi a safe place. - Jung Yeon Mi!

819
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,629
Ms. Jung!

820
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,329
Goodness. Thank you.

821
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:57,769
- Jung Yeon Mi! - Thank you.

822
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:58,838
It's delicious.

823
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:00,099
- I'll take the rest home... - Yes.

824
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,638
- to eat. - Of course.

825
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:03,639
Thank you. I'm candidate number one.

826
00:54:05,279 --> 00:54:07,109
Isn't this you?

827
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,880
Look at the way she talks.

828
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,380
I've been threatening you?

829
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,649
All this time, I thought we were helping each other out.

830
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,790
- Listen to this. - Move out of the way.

831
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,629
A Chinese restaurant in Hakcheon.

832
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,559
(Proof of Jung Yeon Mi bribing a police officer revealed!)

833
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,899
This is the conversation that was held...

834
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,829
during the secret meeting between Jung Yeon Mi...

835
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,500
and the investigator in charge of the Hakcheon Beach Murder Case.

836
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:34,169
(Video Confession from the Hakcheon Beach Murder Case Detective)

837
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,169
I wanted to show my appreciation...

838
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,539
for how you neatly handled my son's case...

839
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,339
and got rid of the evidence.

840
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,009
This isn't right.

841
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,149
I know...

842
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,549
I am filthy for accepting your money up until now...

843
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,859
("What You Really Want to Know")

844
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,190
After much convincing,

845
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:59,159
we were able to hear the detective's confession.

846
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:02,429
To be honest, at the scene where the skeleton was found,

847
00:55:03,429 --> 00:55:06,639
I also found a ring that likely belonged to suspect Kim.

848
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:09,170
The matching ring he wore with Choi Eom Ji, who died.

849
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:13,279
But I concealed this piece of crucial evidence.

850
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:16,710
I'm sorry.

851
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,290
(Temporarily closed for personal reasons)

852
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:31,860
I also rapidly closed the case...

853
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,500
without sufficient investigation five years ago.

854
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:39,739
What do we do now?

855
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,710
Everyone thinks that ring belongs to you.

856
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,489
Sol Hee.

857
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:04,029
I want to be your client.

858
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:07,968
So you want to know...

859
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:10,270
Jo Jae Chan's whereabouts, through Jo Deuk Chan, right?

860
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:11,839
Yes.

861
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:15,339
I would also like to know how much he knows about Jae Chan.

862
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,270
All right.

863
00:56:17,469 --> 00:56:20,239
But you need to be good at acting.

864
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:21,880
Do you think you can lie?

865
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,080
I have to.

866
00:56:29,089 --> 00:56:32,219
One vibration for the truth, two vibrations for lies.

867
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,529
Where would be a nice location?

868
00:56:56,949 --> 00:56:58,719
Deuk Chan, I'm sorry.

869
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,150
Let's meet up and talk.

870
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:14,529
Yes, I'm in.

871
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,799
I'll just use the place for an hour.

872
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:20,569
Thank you.

873
00:57:25,639 --> 00:57:27,980
I can probably listen over there.

874
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:29,350
Okay.

875
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,589
Do Ha.

876
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:39,190
It could end without anything happening.

877
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:41,790
If that happens,

878
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,889
you can continue to trust Jo Deuk Chan as you do now.

879
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,670
(Deuk Chan)

880
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:56,709
- Hey. - Hey.

881
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:57,779
You're here.

882
00:57:58,810 --> 00:57:59,909
What is this place?

883
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,409
Did you rent out the whole place?

884
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:03,449
I come here...

885
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,319
from time to time to play the piano.

886
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:09,489
You do?

887
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:11,759
You play the piano here?

888
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,520
Yes.

889
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,830
To be honest, I've been doing it for a while.

890
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:21,330
Hey, why didn't you tell me sooner?

891
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:23,730
I would've come to watch.

892
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:25,839
I know, right?

893
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,670
For some reason, I just wanted to keep this place a secret.

894
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,909
So you had a secret you didn't share with me.

895
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:37,549
I thought about it,

896
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:42,319
and I did have a secret that I hid from you.

897
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,830
I bet the music will sound great here.

898
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,060
There are nice equipment.

899
00:58:56,929 --> 00:58:57,940
Deuk Chan.

900
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,739
I'd like to apologize again for what happened the other day.

901
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:06,540
I thought you were hiding Jae Chan...

902
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:07,909
and suspected you.

903
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,250
That's absurd.

904
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,150
If he was at my house, I would've told you right away.

905
00:59:30,469 --> 00:59:32,540
I wonder why my ring was found at the scene.

906
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:35,069
Do you know anything?

907
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:37,710
I read the articles,

908
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:40,380
and apparently, the evidence is inadmissible.

909
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,179
Do you also think...

910
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:49,819
that ring is mine?

911
00:59:51,989 --> 00:59:54,529
It's yours, isn't it?

912
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:11,610
Jo Jae Chan...

913
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:13,739
Where is he right now?

914
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,610
Just be honest with me.

915
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,319
You...

916
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:26,319
So this is why you called me.

917
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:41,810
Sure.

918
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,080
I guess I can tell you now.

919
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,080
Jae Chan...

920
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,580
has probably arrived by now.

921
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,389
Where?

922
01:00:55,889 --> 01:00:58,790
He went to Hakcheon.

923
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,060
Excuse me.

924
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:06,960
Can I help you?

925
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,239
Why did he go to Hakcheon?

926
01:01:18,009 --> 01:01:19,080
To turn himself in.

927
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:53,880
(My Lovely Liar)

928
01:02:24,469 --> 01:02:27,009
It's strange. The culprit has been identified,

929
01:02:27,779 --> 01:02:29,380
but I still feel very uneasy.

930
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,449
I left her shoes at the beach.

931
01:02:32,179 --> 01:02:33,949
I threw away the clothes into the ocean.

932
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:36,749
What?

933
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,520
There has to be another reason.

934
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,719
I will make an important announcement.

935
01:02:40,989 --> 01:02:41,989
Mr. Kim Do Ha?

936
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:44,658
If I'm acquitted due to insufficient evidence, that's a matter of law.

937
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:46,060
Nothing can be done about it.

938
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,799
Where is it? Tell me.

939
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,069
Sol Hee.
