(Choi Eom Ji and Kim had been long time high school sweethearts.)

15
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:07,099
Whenever we fought, she kept saying she wanted to break up.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,740
So I did it in the heat of the moment.

17
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:11,168
I was only going to threaten her. But she...

18
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:13,869
You stabbed her three times just to threaten her?

19
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,349
He was with her until her last moment, and they had a big fight.

20
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,679
On top of that, her blood was found on his clothes.

21
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:24,648
Where is she right now? Let me talk to her in person.

22
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:26,850
The victim is in the ICU right now.

23
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,990
Get her here.

24
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:31,589
I won't talk until she gets here.

25
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:34,089
Bring her here.

26
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,799
- Gosh, this is so comfortable. - Hey, get up.

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,269
- Bring her here. - Get up right now!

28
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,969
So get her down here then.

29
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,568
I won't say a word until she gets here.

30
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,198
I'll just lie here.

31
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:44,910

What did you do with Eom Ji?

36
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,698
Where is Eom Ji?

37
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,359
Tell me, please!

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
Eom Ho.

39
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,039
I didn't harm Eom Ji.

40
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,410
There are a lot of things I did to her that I should apologize for.

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,650
But I didn't kill her.

42
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,410
I didn't kill her.

43
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,250
Are you saying she killed herself again?

44
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,190
I'm sick of hearing that. Why would she kill herself?

45
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:12,789
Because I was her dream.

46
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:16,930
But I told her...

47
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,829
we should break up.

48
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,508
- Why did you cut him loose? - Hey.

49
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:03,539
What? Were you trying to climb up the ladder after releasing him?

50
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,750
We feel sorry that your sister has not been found yet.

51
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,620
Yes, you're that detective from Hakcheon.

52
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,949
Did you bring a cop with you?

53
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:15,789
I need to take both of you to the station.

54
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,090
No.

55
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:21,629
There's no need for that.

56
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,640
Hey, Choi Eom Ho!

57
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:40,910
Darn it.

58
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,260
- Go! - Let go of me. What are you doing?

59
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:55,429
Let go of me!

60
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
The knife...

61
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,210
He's carrying that because of me.

62
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,320
He won't stab other people, so don't worry.

63
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,090
Do you think that makes it okay? Because you're okay with it?

64
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,849
Once he started carrying a knife,

65
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,059
you can't stop me from charging him.

66
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:27,559
What is it?

67
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,129
Are you scared that people might find out who you are?

68
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:33,070
Mr. Kim Seung Ju.

69
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,049
I went to your building because I was worried about Sol Hee.

70
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,289
I saw you leave urgently, so I followed you.

71
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,460
Does Sol Hee know that you're Kim Seung Ju?

72
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:03,859
Yes.

73
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:06,330
But she's still dating you?

74
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,200
Because she doesn't believe that I did it.

75
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,070
Anyway,

76
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,309
thank you for your help.

77
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,080
No need to thank me.

78
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:20,209
If anything happens to her,

79
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,749
I won't let Choi Eom Ho kill you. It will be me.

80
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:27,249
Do you still have feelings for her?

81
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:34,129
Sol Hee...

82
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:36,960
had gone through a lot.

83
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:39,599
She needs nothing but happiness in her life.

84
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,938
So you can't be a murderer...

85
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,910
or get killed by someone.

86
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,140
Make sure to cover up the wounds on your face too.

87
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,280
Don't let her find out.

88
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,619
I can't hide things from her.

89
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,320
Not from Sol Hee.

90
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,919
Is this about how she can hear people's lies?

91
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,260
You must not believe her.

92
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,270
I know where you're coming from,

93
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,869
but I will make her happy in my own way.

94
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,410
Don't worry.

95
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:40,859
Go!

96
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,869
Because I was her dream.

97
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,549
Score!

98
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:09,260
You hid this in the freezer? Gosh, that was clever.

99
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,889
Dad, no! Not that!

100
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,989
Get your hands off me!

101
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,590
You little...

102
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,330
I told you not to lay a finger on her.

103
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:20,599
Look at this rude punk.

104
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,239
I'm your father. Where are your manners?

105
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:23,769
What? Are you going to hit me?

106
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,070
Go ahead. Do it.

107
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,270
You crazy punk.

108
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:30,410
No!

109
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,178
No!

110
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,710
You can't catch him. Forget it.

111
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,680
I saved all of the money I earned in that bank account!

112
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,560
He'll come back tomorrow and the day after that.

113
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,460
That jerk will even show up at your work too.

114
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
Why did you save up money?

115
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,670
To go to college.

116
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,080
College?

117
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,310
Do you want to go to college?

118
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:09,950
I want to have dreams too.

119
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,420
I feel so small in front of Seung Ju.

120
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,700
Why do you need dreams?

121
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,070
Seung Ju is your dream.

122
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,040
The surest person who can get you out of this miserable place...

123
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,509
is only Seung Ju. Do you understand?

124
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:04,540
Do Ha.

125
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,409
- Are you all right? - Yes.

126
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,279
What about you? Are you okay?

127
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,149
I'm fine.

128
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:16,149
I'm so glad.

129
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,649
Where and how did you meet that guy?

130
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,090
I don't know.

131
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,590
He suddenly showed up in the parking lot of my apartment.

132
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:25,930
I'm terrified.

133
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,128
Are you alone right now? What about your manager?

134
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,129
I didn't tell anyone.

135
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,330
I didn't want to put you in a tight spot.

136
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,300
You should have.

137
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:38,369
Ask him to get you more bodyguards.

138
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,310
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

139
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,680
No.

140
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,979
I'm fine now that I heard your voice.

141
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,149
I realized something today.

142
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,759
I'd rather have you alive with another woman...

143
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,800
than not have you in this world at all.

144
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,769
That's 100... No, it's 1,000 times better that way.

145
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,810
I'm sorry. Please don't die.

146
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,350
Make sure to lock up.

147
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:22,450
Always be safe.

148
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:25,720
Bye.

149
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,170
Take care, Do Ha.

150
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:41,800
Hey.

151
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:49,570
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

152
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,239
I was ordering sandwiches, and I got one for you too.

153
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:54,940
Here.

154
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,850
But why are you suddenly wearing your mask again?

155
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,749
This looks good. Thank you.

156
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,090
Did you catch a cold?

157
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:09,960
Gosh, I knew it. It was chilly at the campsite.

158
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,790
It's not a cold.

159
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,759
Thank you for the food.

160
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,259
Wait. I wanted to see you.

161
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:22,139
The sandwich was just an excuse.

162
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:23,940
I'm here because I wanted to see you.

163
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,239
I'd like to see your face.

164
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:45,029
What happened to your face?

165
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,029
What were you thinking? Why did you go and see him?

166
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,929
You're lucky it's nothing serious.

167
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,070
Eom Ho even went to Syaon.

168
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,009
I thought it would be better to meet him in person once.

169
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,509
There was something I wanted to say to him too.

170
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,378
Look what he did to your face.

171
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,850
I doubt that he gave you a chance to talk.

172
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,080
You should have called the police.

173
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,320
I didn't call the police,

174
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,590
but a police officer did show up.

175
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,330
What?

176
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,399
Are you talking about Kang Min?

177
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:27,269
He found out that I was Kim Seung Ju.

178
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,898
He came to our building because he was worried about you.

179
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,070
Then he followed me.

180
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,040
He helped me.

181
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:37,040
That's why he wanted me to call him.

182
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,050
Did you catch that guy?

183
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:44,450
No. I told him to let Eom Ho go.

184
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:46,549
Why?

185
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,320
I think I got through to him.

186
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,590
And I doubt...

187
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,659
he will...

188
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:55,060
come back again.

189
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,430
Don't worry.

190
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,040
Let's draw two cards first.

191
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,949
Hello.

192
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,690
Hey, come here.

193
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,460
What is it?

194
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,018
Didn't you say you majored in security management?

195
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,029
Yes.

196
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,898
Do you know anyone who would be interested in being a bodyguard?

197
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,700
Of course. I have a long list I can think of.

198
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,470
But who needs protection?

199
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,800
Well, the guy next door.

200
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:37,070
The guy next door?

201
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,609
- Are you talking about Kim Do Ha? - Yes.

202
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:43,080
How much do you think it would cost?

203
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,109
Do they get paid hourly? Or do they have a fixed daily rate?

204
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:47,908
Why don't I just do it? I'll give you a good rate.

205
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:49,450
You're working for me.

206
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,819
I guess you have a lot of time.

207
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,950
Well, I just...

208
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:55,090
Hello.

209
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,499
I heard you helped him. Thank you.

210
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:10,498
Sol Hee. But...

211
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:11,499
Kang Min.

212
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,909
He really didn't do it.

213
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,310
I know.

214
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,249
I know that he was acquitted. I know everything.

215
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,350
But he's your boyfriend.

216
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,049
He lives next door to you.

217
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,519
And he has meals with you.

218
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,920
I know I'm being nosy, but I'm so worried. I can't...

219
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:33,529
stop thinking about it.

220
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:39,930
Do you remember our first date?

221
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,170
When I told you I liked coffee,

222
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,940
you told me that you liked it too and ordered the same one.

223
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,909
I liked that lie.

224
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:58,149
I thought that once you stopped telling me that lie,

225
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:00,720
our love would be over too.

226
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,920
I used to think that to myself.

227
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,859
- Sol Hee. Back then... - I know.

228
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,930
I know that now.

229
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,359
But back then, it felt like all the pieces were coming together.

230
00:17:13,469 --> 00:17:14,929
The reason we broke up is...

231
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:17,939
because I can hear lies.

232
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:28,679
Are you telling me...

233
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,250
- you believe him? - Yes.

234
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,290
So you shouldn't worry about me.

235
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:53,310
(Syaon barges into a lounge bar. I thought I was at a concert.)

236
00:17:58,409 --> 00:17:59,509
(CEO Jo Deuk Chan)

237
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,510
Okay.

238
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,520
Please take it away.

239
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,490
You should check this part too.

240
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:08,958
(- I love you. - She has a great voice.)

241
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:11,020
Surprisingly, people seemed to like it.

242
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,030
I never know what the public will like or not.

243
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:24,898
But this is great if it's a one-time thing.

244
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:27,769
But if she keeps doing this, it will lower her brand value.

245
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,810
I know that.

246
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,939
This cannot happen again.

247
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,550
I'll have a talk with her.

248
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,550
Okay.

249
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,359
Hey, Ji On.

250
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:49,330
The live performance was quite nice.

251
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,929
I could totally understand why you did that.

252
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,669
It's because of Do Ha, right?

253
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,510
What's wrong with your voice?

254
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:07,409
What?

255
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:29,800
It's a miracle that you're still alive.

256
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:34,469
How can you smile right now?

257
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,939
I was implying that he might kill you next time.

258
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,949
Why didn't you call me?

259
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:42,480
I'm sorry.

260
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,850
I was afraid you might try to send me away someplace far again.

261
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,790
Are you...

262
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:54,189
not going to move out of here?

263
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
No.

264
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,929
I'm comfortable here.

265
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,270
I heard this from your mother the other day.

266
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,209
Someone called her office...

267
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,350
and left a memo under Kim Do Ha's name.

268
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:16,050
It's probably Eom Ho, right?

269
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,889
- Deuk Chan. - Yes.

270
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,530
I shouldn't work with you anymore.

271
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,500
What do you mean all of a sudden?

272
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:40,070
If people find out who I am because of Eom Ho,

273
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,510
the news will hit the company the hardest.

274
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,649
Hey.

275
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:48,850
Why are we suddenly talking about that?

276
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,349
Wouldn't you be in a tight spot too?

277
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,290
If people find out, things will be the worst for you.

278
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,389
And it's only right that I bear the burden alone.

279
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,560
I'm done inconveniencing people around me.

280
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:02,429
Then what about Sol Hee?

281
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,330
Don't you think you'll be inconveniencing her if you stay?

282
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:07,730
I'll stay here...

283
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:10,369
by her side and protect her.

284
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:13,509
Look at your face. You got beaten up.

285
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,040
How will you protect her?

286
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,010
You're right.

287
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:20,379
It's just an excuse.

288
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,379
I need her.

289
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:27,090
I just want to be with her.

290
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,070
Hey, you're still here.

291
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,439
Yes. I'm almost done here.

292
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:45,339
Why did you buy porridge?

293
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,608
Oh, this? It's for someone else.

294
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:48,669
I see.

295
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,879
Right. You know,

296
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:55,449
your mother came by yesterday.

297
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,780
Really?

298
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,888
- Why? - She asked if you had a boyfriend.

299
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:01,850
I lied and said I knew nothing about it.

300
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:03,959
I see. Well done.

301
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,260
Wait, you lied?

302
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,560
Why is that a lie?

303
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,830
You're kind of seeing your next-door neighbour, aren't you?

304
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,969
It's so obvious. I mean, this too.

305
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:22,279
No, I'm not "seeing" him.

306
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,340
What? Then...

307
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,079
Are you two officially dating?

308
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,679
My gosh! Since when?

309
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,520
Well... Come to think of it, it's a little odd.

310
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,119
He never officially asked me out.

311
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,060
Then why did you think you were dating...

312
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,459
Oh, I see.

313
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:46,070
You two got physical first?

314
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:47,429
No, it's not that.

315
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,119
- Hello. - Yes, hello.

316
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,829
If you brought the non-disclosure agreement you had mentioned...

317
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,699
That's okay. We don't need it anymore.

318
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,869
Sol Hee.

319
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,810
Do you really trust Do Ha?

320
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:33,409
Yes.

321
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:35,780
What about you, Mr. Jo?

322
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:38,119
I trust Do Ha too.

323
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,790
I heard...

324
00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:48,929
that you two were dating.

325
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,770
Congratulations.

326
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,980
- Oh. - Sol Hee.

327
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:07,609
What are you two doing here?

328
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,250
We were just chatting. I'm off.

329
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,389
I can come in, right?

330
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,699
What is all this?

331
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,799
I got this for you.

332
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,230
I figured you couldn't eat solid food.

333
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,570
It'll help bring down the swelling too.

334
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,070
Well, I'm not in that much pain.

335
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,869
Anyway, thanks.

336
00:24:34,469 --> 00:24:38,209
Just now, I asked Mr. Jo if he trusted you.

337
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,709
He said he did.

338
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:42,580
And he meant it.

339
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:51,060
Also, I heard from him...

340
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:53,189
that we were dating.

341
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,800
Yes.

342
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,730
This looks delicious.

343
00:25:00,969 --> 00:25:04,340
Do couples automatically start dating after one kiss?

344
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,060
What?

345
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:41,270
Would you be my girlfriend?

346
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,340
Forget it.

347
00:25:45,949 --> 00:25:47,679
- Why? Come on. - Forget it!

348
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,060
This is my favourite. I'll give you this.

349
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,590
No, thanks.

350
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,060
Give me your hand.

351
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,800
What is it?

352
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:11,239
This? No.

353
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,969
- No? - No. No way.

354
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,708
So you'll be my girlfriend?

355
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:20,080
Okay, all right.

356
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,309
Fine, let's date.

357
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,820
So we really are a couple now, right?

358
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,020
Yes, let's be a couple.

359
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:35,389
Hello.

360
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:41,169
Hey!

361
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:48,869
What brings you here out of the blue?

362
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,010
The place I go to for my vocal lessons is around here,

363
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,350
so I was in the area.

364
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,379
Doesn't the agency take care of stuff like that?

365
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:57,849
I felt that it wasn't enough,

366
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,919
so I started taking additional lessons on the side.

367
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,889
Why? You're already such a talented singer.

368
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,520
You'll be done soon, right? I'll take you home.

369
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,730
Oh, I have a few more hours left.

370
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,559
I had nothing else to do,

371
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,030
so I took up the night shifts too.

372
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:19,570
I'll be back in a moment.

373
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:21,909
Hello.

374
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:24,540
Can I get headache medicine?

375
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,359
Is that Mr. Jo?

376
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,070
He must have a terrible headache.

377
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,209
He's the CEO of my agency.

378
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:55,879
Really?

379
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,580
Yes. What's he doing in this neighbourhood?

380
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,619
Songwriter Kim Do Ha lives in this neighbourhood too.

381
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:06,019
- What? - He looks like a jobless punk,

382
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,850
but his name is Kim Do Ha.

383
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,020
Then ask him to write me a song.

384
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:12,419
One song by Kim Do Ha...

385
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,929
will be enough to catapult Atlantis to stardom.

386
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,129
Gosh.

387
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,340
(Yeonseo-dong Shopkeepers' Co-op)

388
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:29,040
Because of the unsavoury incident we all know about,

389
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,510
I was appointed to replace the owner of Yeonseo Real Estate.

390
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,250
I am So Bo Ro from Yeonseo Bakery.

391
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:36,519
I look forward to working with you all.

392
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,689
Yes! So Bo Ro!

393
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:47,030
The recent incident...

394
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:49,800
was the biggest crisis of my life to date.

395
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:52,128
When I was about to give up,

396
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:54,128
- many people helped me... - You know, that realtor.

397
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:55,729
When he picks his ears, flour still comes out of them.

398
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,100
That's why I can be here today.

399
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,968
I still think it's such a mystery.

400
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:00,569
How did the tarot café owner find out?

401
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,969
He got a tarot reading from her.

402
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,050
Anyway, what's going on? It feels so empty today.

403
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,250
The realtor's wife owns many buildings in the area.

404
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,089
Everyone who works in those buildings is siding with them.

405
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,850
Even after witnessing the cockroach incident?

406
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:18,888
They were mean to Bo Ro, but they were nice to everyone else.

407
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:20,290
I'll do my very best!

408
00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:23,229
It's my first time doing this, so I still have a lot to learn.

409
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,358
Wait and see. Some might say they won't participate in the festival.

410
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:27,069
Please tell me how I can improve,

411
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,529
- No way. - and I'll learn from your advice.

412
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,639
Thank you!

413
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:35,139
First, we'll talk about...

414
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:37,279
the upcoming Yeonseo-dong Festival...

415
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,340
Please count me out.

416
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:42,108
- Okay. - Sorry.

417
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:44,049
I can't participate either.

418
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,389
- Same here. - Me neither.

419
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,418
Please take turns and tell me one by one...

420
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,359
- I can't do it either. - Same here.

421
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,519
- Count me out too. - Okay.

422
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,889
- Me too. - Me too.

423
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:55,429
What is happening?

424
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,069
Darn it. Is he still asleep?

425
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,699
This is nuts.

426
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,209
Hello!

427
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,290
So you'll pay me in cash, right?

428
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:22,089
What do you mean? I already sent the money to your account.

429
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,290
I was told I'd get paid in cash upon delivery today.

430
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:26,188
You guys nearly begged me, so I trusted you.

431
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:28,958
What do you mean I begged you? Check your account now.

432
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:31,330
Not you. The other guy. The one who cooks.

433
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,830
He told you that?

434
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:38,739
- Excuse me. Can you come out? - Okay, fine.

435
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,740
Goodness. I'll give you the money.

436
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:42,809
But check your account, and if you already received it,

437
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,740
you'll have to pay me back twofold. You got that?

438
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,389
What?

439
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,359
Darn it.

440
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,389
Hurry up and pay me. I'm a busy man.

441
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,359
It's gone.

442
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,030
What?

443
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,800
- Hey. - All the money is gone.

444
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,369
What is the matter with you?

445
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,469
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

446
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:23,149
Darn it! My coins!

447
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:24,850
My coins!

448
00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:28,789
Someone called her office...

449
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,859
and left a memo under Kim Do Ha's name.

450
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,560
It's probably Eom Ho, right?

451
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,070
(Mother)

452
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,709
(Mok Sol Hee)

453
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,379
Can you come to the café now?

454
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:56,719
He's here.

455
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,879
Hello!

456
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:00,250
- You're here. - Hey.

457
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:02,958
Oh, what happened?

458
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,990
Oh, this. It's nothing.

459
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,090
Come here.

460
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,330
Sit here.

461
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:13,699
All right.

462
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,999
This guy was the top student in my department.

463
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,240
His specialty is jujitsu.

464
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:19,270
Doesn't he look so friendly?

465
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,579
- Next. - And this guy here...

466
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,439
mainly works as a bodyguard at concerts.

467
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:28,909
Oh, right. You've probably seen him a few times at Syaon's concerts.

468
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,080
But I'm not sure if he'll have time.

469
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:34,089
All right, next. He's my junior.

470
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,250
Wait, hold on.

471
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,820
What's this about?

472
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,830
I heard bad people were after you.

473
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,359
They're your bodyguard candidates.

474
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,168
I don't need a bodyguard.

475
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:50,169
Why not?

476
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,270
Well, it'll be uncomfortable and...

477
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:56,280
Gosh, that's not important now.

478
00:32:56,379 --> 00:32:58,709
Do Ha, if they'd make you uncomfortable, how about I do it?

479
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:04,550
I'm really okay.

480
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:06,590
That's it, right?

481
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,419
- But... - Gosh, why...

482
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,830
No, I understand.

483
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,299
- Yes, I'm sorry. No, it's okay. - Take care.

484
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,800
Yes, have a good day!

485
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,879
(Luni Tarot Café)

486
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,779
- Hello. - Hello.

487
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,090
Will you be participating in the festival?

488
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:45,659
No. As always, I won't be participating.

489
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,760
(List of Participants, Mok Sol Hee)

490
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,129
Oh, okay.

491
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,399
Would you consider participating in the festival?

492
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:56,500
Why?

493
00:33:56,899 --> 00:33:59,708
I've been appointed as the new chair of the co-op,

494
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:01,209
so many people don't want to participate.

495
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:04,939
I need more than 50 percent to be on board for the festival to happen.

496
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,879
Right now, it's exactly half and half.

497
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:12,579
The thing is, I have a lot to take care of these days.

498
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,619
I'm sorry.

499
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,589
Gosh, don't be. I'm sorry.

500
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:17,888
Take care! Thank you.

501
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,020
Bye.

502
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:23,199
I can help you prepare for the festival.

503
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,860
You saw Do Ha's face.

504
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:27,929
I don't have time to worry about a festival now.

505
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,798
I know he got hurt,

506
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:31,500
but he seemed a little depressed.

507
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,468
Working on the festival together...

508
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:35,009
will help lift his spirits. Won't it be nice?

509
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:36,639
Together?

510
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,009
Gosh, no.

511
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,380
I'm sure he feels anxious even when he's home alone these days.

512
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,149
But staying home will make him even more depressed.

513
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,290
During the festival, I'll stay right by his side with my eyes wide open.

514
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,759
Yes.

515
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,529
My gosh. You must be getting tired.

516
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,000
Are we not there yet?

517
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,469
Oh, boy.

518
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,310
We still have a long way to go, Mi Na.

519
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,440
- Let's go. - Okay.

520
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,909
My, what a beautiful day!

521
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,810
My gosh.

522
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,420
Mr. Mok.

523
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,589
- Can you come inside? - My gosh.

524
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,219
My goodness.

525
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:14,509
Oh.

526
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,440
You started wearing that again?

527
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,009
I don't want to scare people.

528
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,190
Oh, this. It's from my dad.

529
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,830
Does he only send you photos?

530
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,339
Yes. These are like letters.

531
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,270
My dad took these photos.

532
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,369
This means he's doing well.

533
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,739
Anyway, where are you going?

534
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,380
The convenience store.

535
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,150
Then I'll come with you.

536
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,588
Hello.

537
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:10,659
Hello.

538
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,420
Oh, that's...

539
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:38,360
Give it back.

540
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,770
Not many people write music by hand these days.

541
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:48,529
Are you attending music school?

542
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,170
We'll get these too.

543
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,210
Your total comes to 25.80 dollars.

544
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,719
You can take your card.

545
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:07,619
- Thank you. - Bye.

546
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,589
I don't go to music school.

547
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:15,029
I'll sing it at the festival.

548
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,909
We can't fall asleep anyway. Let's just have a beer.

549
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,049
I guess a singing contest will take place during the festival.

550
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:43,520
Yes.

551
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,460
But this year's festival might get cancelled altogether.

552
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,029
Why?

553
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,659
Not many businesses want to participate.

554
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:52,258
It has to be over 50 percent.

555
00:38:52,259 --> 00:38:53,699
Right now, it's half and half.

556
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:56,130
Really?

557
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:58,299
What about you, Sol Hee?

558
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,670
I'm still undecided.

559
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
You should do it.

560
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,949
Why?

561
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,250
I want to hear the song that guy wrote.

562
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,119
It looked like an interesting song.

563
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,560
But I've never participated in a festival like this before.

564
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:22,060
I could do it if I had a helper.

565
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,060
You have your employees.

566
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,630
Come on. I'll need someone else who can help me.

567
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,500
Help me, please.

568
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:31,400

569
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:34,610

570

but it could be fun...

571

572

573
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,158
Yes, totally. Of course, it will.

574
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,719
Then let's do it. We'll do it together.

Sure.

581
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,980
I have a question for Ms. Jung Yeon Mi.

582
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:20,618
We can't deny that the suspicions about your son...

583
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:22,749
still remain a concern.

584
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,460
If the suspicions turn out to be true,

585
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,329
could we really trust you with Gyeonggi Province,

586
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,258
knowing you failed as a mother?

587
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:30,829
People are voicing concerns over this matter.

588
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,158
Could you please answer?

589

(Leadership Debate)

590
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,099
Mr. Yoo, do you know...

591
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,909
what the court's decision was regarding my son's case?

592
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,540
Yes, he was acquitted.

593
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,949
So you know that. That's correct.

594
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,949
The prosecutor concluded that he was not guilty.

595
00:40:50,049 --> 00:40:51,949
So why are people still talking about it?

596
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:57,219
I believe it's because we still don't know who the real culprit was.

597
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,630
In my son's case, it was suicide, not murder.

598
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:04,060
Which means, there's no such thing as a real culprit.

599
00:41:04,259 --> 00:41:06,198
There's a possibility that it wasn't suicide.

600
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:08,428
Just like this, people will point the finger at him...

601
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:10,500
and call him a murderer until the day he dies.

602
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,770
I will not criticize those people.

603
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:16,408
However, I cannot accept the unfair criticism...

604
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:18,638
that I am a failed mother and that I am not qualified...

00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:21,349
to lead Gyeonggi Province...

606
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,779

So shall we just sell coffee...

609
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,929
and offer tarot card readings as usual?

610
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:37,499
We should stick to the Newtro concept.

611
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,229
How about we also sell rice punch and dalgona coffee?

612
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,629
Oh, good idea.

613
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,468
As for the tarot readings, let's make sure it's under five minutes.

614
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,408
We don't want to see a long line just in front of our booth,

615

Okay.

617
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,178
But it'd be nice to offer a daily horoscope reading...

with Kim at a pub owned by his parents.

633
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,229
He even submitted security footage as evidence,

634
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,369

Yes, that's right. Why are you asking?

It's nothing like that.

907
00:59:09,509 --> 00:59:11,080
Gosh. Where did I see him?

908
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:31,399
Give it to me. I'll do it.

909
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,569
You should eat. I'll cook the meat.

910
00:59:34,569 --> 00:59:35,969
It's been ages.

911
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,278
You don't drink that much, right?

912
00:59:39,279 --> 00:59:41,210
I have to watch over my daughter on my days off.

913
00:59:42,409 --> 00:59:43,549
It must be tough.

914
00:59:44,819 --> 00:59:45,980
By the way,

915
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:48,589
I have something to ask.

916
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:50,250
What is it?

917
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:52,989
About the Hakcheon Beach missing persons case...

918
00:59:53,659 --> 00:59:55,790
Did she really commit suicide?

919
00:59:56,389 --> 00:59:59,729
I took a look, and the alibi footage was so blurry...

920
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,428
that it was hard to tell who it was.

921
01:00:01,429 --> 01:00:03,869
Even if his alibi is fake,

922
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,270
there is no evidence that points to Kim Seung Ju being the culprit.

923
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:13,279
You're in Seoul now.

924
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,179
Why are you suddenly curious about that now?

925
01:00:16,509 --> 01:00:17,549
Just because.

926
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:19,650
He seems suspicious.

927
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:21,150
It was suicide.

928
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,960
The girl's family situation wasn't great.

929
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:28,928
Her mother passed away from a car accident when she was little.

930
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:31,330
Her father was always drinking and gambling.

931
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:34,600
I heard she injured herself on purpose multiple times as well.

932
01:00:35,429 --> 01:00:37,469
On top of all that, her boyfriend wanted to break up with her,

933
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:39,469
so she killed herself.

934
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:45,278
You all have waited for a long time.

935
01:00:45,279 --> 01:00:47,738
We only have first place left to announce.

936
01:00:47,739 --> 01:00:51,779
The winner of the Street Music Festival is...

937
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:53,520
Who is it?

938
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:57,319
the contestant who sang "24 Hours," Lee Young Jae!

939
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:02,829
(Grand Prize)

940
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,600
- Congratulations. - Bravo!

941
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,529
(Grand Prize: 2,000 dollars)

942
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:10,770
- Yes, congratulations. - Thank you.

943
01:01:11,029 --> 01:01:14,239
Mr. Lee Young Jae, you won the grand prize. Any words?

944
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:16,710
Well, yes.

945
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,509
Thank you for this big award.

946
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,850
I will work harder in the future.

947
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:25,980
(The 5th Street Music Festival Grand Prize)

948
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:28,650
Thank you.

949
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:33,258
Okay. Please look forward. We're going to take a picture.

950
01:01:33,259 --> 01:01:34,319
That was cool.

951
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:36,459
- Right? - One, two, three.

952
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,588
He wrote a good song.

953
01:01:37,589 --> 01:01:38,899
Again. One, two, three.

954
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:39,960
I was talking about you.

955
01:01:41,569 --> 01:01:43,670
I wouldn't know if a song was well-written or not.

956
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:46,299
Let's go clean up.

957
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,369
We have somewhere to go before that.

958
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,110
(Elegant Flea Market)

959
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,679
Gosh, I was worried you wouldn't come.

960
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,279
- Here you go. - Thank you.

961
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:02,819
- Here. - Okay.

962
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,420
Here.

963
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:07,889
What is this?

964
01:02:08,259 --> 01:02:09,589
I bought it in secret earlier,

965
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,100
but I'm not sure if it's authentic.

966
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,469
Gosh.

967
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:28,079
What? I was wondering who bought my ball.

968
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,179
It's nice to meet you.

969
01:02:31,179 --> 01:02:33,448
Did you really get this ball autographed by Rooney?

970
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:35,089
Of course.

971
01:02:35,549 --> 01:02:38,419
I went to Old Trafford myself in 2010...

972
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,819
to receive it from him.

973
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,190
Consider yourself lucky.

974
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,199
So was she telling the truth?

975
01:02:53,299 --> 01:02:54,770
Yes, she was.

976
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:56,770
What a relief.

977
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,179
What? The fireworks started.

978
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:03,750
Let's go.

979
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,089
(Ronaldo)

980
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,759
Gosh. How pretty.

981
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,339
Gosh. What is this?

982
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:09,380
Is there a stone here or what?

983
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,020
Gosh!

984
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:45,549
(My Lovely Liar)

985
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,679
She was found on a hill, not in the sea?

986
01:05:15,949 --> 01:05:18,350
Eom Ji.

987
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:21,080
You had matching rings with Choi Eom Ji, right?

988
01:05:21,279 --> 01:05:23,750
- What did you do with it? - I threw it in the Hakcheon ocean.

989
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:27,360
Its side effects are a decline in cognitive skills and memory loss.

990
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:31,089
J Entertainment will no longer work with composer, Kim Do Ha.

991
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:33,360
Eom Ji.

992
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:36,270
Today, you...

993
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:38,770
are going to die.
