(The guardians of child actors were present at the filming.)

10
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:49,319
I have...

11
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:51,590
something to tell you.

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,490
Me too.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,420
I have something to tell you too.

14
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:04,160
I heard something strange earlier today.

15
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,140
That you killed someone.

16
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,809
I'm sorry I'm bringing this up. You're offended, aren't you?

17
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:25,520
I was a murder suspect.

18
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,229
But...

19
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:36,559
it wasn't me.

20
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:39,069
I didn't kill anyone.

21
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,838
I see.

22
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:43,899
I didn't kill anyone.

23
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,479
I didn't...

24
00:01:56,949 --> 00:02:00,149
kill her.

25
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:21,579
What is it?

26
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,479
Do Ha!

27
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,219
- Deuk Chan. - Why didn't you answer your phone?

28
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,288
I went to your house, but you weren't there.

29
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,289
So I had to come here.

30
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:38,859
Hello.

31
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:42,060
I need to take him with me.

32
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,560
What's going on?

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,329
I'm in the middle of an important conversation.

34
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,239
We can talk later.

35
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,539
- What's this about? - Just come.

36
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:08,358
(Episode 8)

37
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:09,759
What important conversation?

38
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,060
Did she ask you if you killed someone?

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,400
Syaon told her.

40
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,430
I was in utter shock. I almost got into a car accident.

41
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,239
Gosh. Sa Ji On. That troublemaker.

42
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:28,609
Okay.

43
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,448
We don't have to worry about Ji On since she'd do anything for you.

44
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:32,509
But Ms. Mok...

45
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:39,190
Just tell her that Syaon was lying to her.

46
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:40,620
Let's move out of here.

47
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
What?

48
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,019
You need to move out.

49
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,358
To tell you the truth, it didn't feel right...

50
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,060
when she found out that you were Kim Do Ha.

51
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,698
But now, she knows that you're Kim Seung Ju.

52
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,069
The moment she starts talking, both of us will be ruined.

53
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,069
She wouldn't do that.

54
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,069
Don't you remember what happened in Hakcheon?

55
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,279
The people in the village adored you.

56
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,680
But how did they change after the incident?

57
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,149
What about your school friends who followed you around?

58
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,719
Remember what they did to you?

59
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,220
Did you know they would turn their backs on you?

60
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,680
You didn't!

61
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,489
Ms. Mok won't do that.

62
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:16,590
She'll believe me.

63
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,989
You...

64
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,510
It can't be.

65
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,970
Him? A murderer?

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,340
I probably heard it wrong.

67
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,919
But what if it comes out as a lie again?

68
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,830
Fine.

69
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:57,869
Then let's get her to sign an NDA, so she doesn't tell anyone.

70
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,330
Deuk Chan.

71
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,770
Even without Syaon's involvement,

72
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,669
I was going to tell Ms. Mok.

73
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,710
We don't need a contract.

74
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:08,739
And I won't move out of here either.

75
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,850
Why?

76
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:14,479
Why were you going to tell her?

77
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,280
Don't tell me...

78
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,150
you like her.

79
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:23,090
I do.

80
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:29,729
Okay. I get it.

81
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,530
But shouldn't you think about the company?

82
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,129
What about Syaon?

83
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,769
What about your mother?

84
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,239
I'm really sorry to say this.

85
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,039
I don't want to think about other people.

86
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,379
How could you say that?

87
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:47,710
Don't worry.

88
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:49,979
I know what you're worried about.

89
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,150
But it won't happen.

90
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,320
Don't you think you're trusting her a bit too much?

91
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:58,429
You shouldn't trust people that easily!

92
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,030
You just met her!

93
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:06,128

98
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,089
(Kim was the last person to be with the missing girl, Choi.)

99
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,519
(Kim and Choi had been dating for a long time.)

100
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,160
(Kim suddenly changed his testimony and said she committed suicide.)

101
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:37,869
I remembered a difficult part of my past.

102
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:40,299
- I'm sorry. - It was a girl problem, right?

103

- You're here. - Ms. Hunter.

106
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,280
Ms. Hunter.

107
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:31,419
Then does it mean that Syaon is our VIP client?

108
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:34,419
What's the case then? Please?

109
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,289
I bet you were dying to ask me that and couldn't get any sleep.

110
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,390
How did you know?

111
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,289
Does my skin look dry?

112
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:43,799
Hey, my skin looks drier. I barely got any sleep.

113
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,270
What are you eating?

114
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,280
I need to wake up.

115
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,950
Here.

116
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,249
What did you and Syaon talk about?

117
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:04,618
What's the case?

118
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:05,689
Listen up.

119
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,849
She's not our VIP client.

120
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,260
And she'll never come back here.

121
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,989
Come on. You're lying to me again, right?

122
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,959
I won't tell anyone. I promise.

123
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,299
Can you just tell me what her case is?

124
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,429
This is for your ears only.

125
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:21,229
- Okay. - She's...

126
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,369
a total nutcase.

127
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,419
Gosh. What? A nutcase?

128
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,519
You...

129
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,560
When exactly did you find out?

130
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,529
About a week?

131
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,028
A week ago?

132
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:54,970
No. About a week after meeting Do Ha.

133
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,970
His face looked familiar.

134
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,970
That was a famous case.

135
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,940
But why didn't you tell us?

136
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,149
He wouldn't have liked it if he knew that I knew.

137
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,580
I was going to take it to the grave.

138
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,790
But that woman kept bothering me. So I just blurted it out.

139
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,149
Gosh.

140
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,219
It's my fault.

141
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,559
You're crazy about Do Ha.

142
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,528
So I could have overlooked your crazy behaviours.

143
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,629
But you can't cross the line. If people find out about him,

144
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:23,829
no one will listen to your songs.

145
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,300
Are that shortsighted?

146
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,540
What did Do Ha say?

147
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:32,540
He's furious, isn't he?

148
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:35,210
Don't ever call that woman again.

149
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:38,609
Don't even go near Yeonseo-dong. Understood?

150
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,819
(Kim Do Ha)

151
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:51,790
(Can you call me after work? Let's talk in person.)

152
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:55,259
(Sure.)

153
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,570
That's not enough to sigh up a storm.

154
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,409
- What? - You've been sighing all day today.

155
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,680
We don't have any appointments with VIP clients. Just go home.

156
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,550
No. I'll work. I want to work.

157
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,128
You know that I can't live without you!

158
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:36,638
I'm going to die. I'm serious!

159
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,810
Fine. If you want to die, then do it. Die!

160
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,528
Your daughter said her phone broke...

161
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:07,299
and asked you to send money, right?

162
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Yes.

163
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,008
She said she was calling me with a temporary phone.

164
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:13,638
Okay. Hold on.

165
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,940
Mom, come on!

166
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,978
I rarely call you.

167
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:19,408
Why did you fall for this?

168
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:20,549
It's been a while since you called.

169
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,648
I was happy to hear from you, so I sent the money.

170
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,720
Hey, your mother was scammed. How can you yell at me now?

171
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,320
Gosh. I told you to be careful about these things.

172
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,228
I was careful.

173
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:33,388
- Get your hands off me. - Calm down.

174
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:35,529
- Sit down. - Hey, do you want to die?

175
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:38,169
Falling in love isn't a crime!

176
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,330
- Goodness. - Gosh.

177
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,299
Look at your ugly face.

178
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,539
What are you staring at?

179
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,738
- Unbelievable. - I didn't do anything wrong!

180
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:46,869
(Police)

181
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,679
Sol Hee.

182
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,579
Sol Hee.

183
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,709
I'm her daughter.

184
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,779
Let me apologize to you on her behalf. I'm sorry.

185
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,350
What are you doing? You should be siding with me.

186
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,089
Can you make sure she's punished?

187
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,849
I want her to pay for what she did.

188
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,119
That way, she won't do it again.

189
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,618
You must not have heard the news.

190
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:06,289
People don't get punished for adultery now.

191
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,359
You... What?

192
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,758
It's okay. You can file a civil lawsuit.

193
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,199
You don't have to go easy on her.

194
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,898
Hey, are you really my daughter?

195
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,138
- Hey! Come here. - No.

196
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:17,868
- How can you do this to your mom? - You didn't do anything right!

197
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:20,169
- You can't be my daughter! - You can't do this.

198
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,778
You should be siding with me.

199
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,439
- Gosh, stop it! - Isn't that the right thing to do?

200
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,709
Hey! You!

201
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,979
- Hey! - Stop it!

Please read this.

203

Kang Min, I'm going out to buy coffee.

206
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:50,739
Do you want to come with me? We can go to the tarot café.

207
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:55,479
I'm good. You can go and have your coffee.

208
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,149
If everything looks good, you can write down your name.

209
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,749
I need your thumbprint too.

Or tea?

213
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,779
I'll have the tea.

214
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,249
Okay.

215
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,369
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,739
I couldn't tell you sooner. No.

217
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,670
I decided not to.

218
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,479
You can tell me now.

219
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,590

223

Come here.

224
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,060
Hold on.

225
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,399
I got curious, so I looked you up.

226
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:40,310
I would have done the same if I were you.

227
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:44,909
That girl...

228
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,310
You didn't kill her,

229
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,550
right?

230
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:01,800
Did you hear...

231
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,499
what I told you last night as a lie?

232
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,300
Is that why you're asking me again?

233
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,909
Yes.

234
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:24,850
But I think I was wrong.

235
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:30,659
I just need you to tell me that one more time.

236
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,340
I didn't...

237
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,239
kill her.

238
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:11,899
Unbelievable.

239
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,540
That's the worst lie.

240
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,080
Why did you do it?

241
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,320
No. How could you...

242
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,889
Say something.

243
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:38,090
Do something. Make an excuse or whatever.

244
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:43,760
I can't.

245
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:48,939
I can't say anything because...

246
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,270
I'm afraid you might hear it as a lie again.

247
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,149
Okay.

248
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:05,619
I don't need to hear anything else.

249
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,889
I heard the most important thing.

250
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:16,959
Then...

251
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:20,830

It's late.

258
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,060
It's the same shrimp.

259
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,859
But how come this tastes awful?

260
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,560
The shrimp you peeled for me was tasty.

261
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:39,709
There must have been a reason. Right?

262
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,240
No. Even if there was, I still can't understand you.

263
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,980
Something must have happened.

264
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,480
Right?

265
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,859
Where are you? I'll go over there.

266
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,389
No. Can you just...

267
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,030
tell me on the phone?

268
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,359
Are you scared...

269
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,199
to hear my answer in person?

270
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,730
It's important. You should've told me before we started dating.

271
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,529
Why should I tell you that in advance?

272
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,368
It's not like I was married. We lived together, but so what?

273
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,968
You were together for three years, so you were practically married.

274
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,540
What about you? Do you have a clean past?

275
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,668
- You said you'd dated 20 women. - What?

276
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:49,608
So you slept with all of them at motels.

277
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,040
- Compared to that, I'm cleaner. - What?

278
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:54,679
Come on. It's not even a big deal.

279
00:21:56,149 --> 00:22:00,389
Put the past behind and let it go, okay?

280
00:22:01,449 --> 00:22:02,519
What's your problem?

281
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,820
Leave her be. She's weird.

you can keep your ears open...

286
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,909
but shut your mouth.

287
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,369

288
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:22,679
What's this now?

289
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,480
Darn it. What do you want?

290
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,119
What's your deal?

291
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:34,750
Hey, who are you?

292
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,688
- Hey, who are you? - Let's just go.

293
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,790
Gosh.

294
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,530
Darn it!

295
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,159
Get up.

296
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,260

297
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,490
Was there another bar where I peeled shrimp for you?

298
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,679
What are you doing tomorrow?

299
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:37,719
I'll probably be hungover tomorrow.

300
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,919
Let's go have some hangover soup together.

301
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,659
You want to eat with me?

302
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,659
Are you sure that's okay?

303
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:51,030
Come on. How many meals have we had together?

304
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:52,799
But things are different now.

305
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,270
If you don't want hangover soup, jjajangmyeon is fine too.

306
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:58,040
Apparently, the grease in it coats the stomach lining or something.

307
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,169
I hear it helps relieve your hangover.

308
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,969
- Ms. Mok. - Let's...

309
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,240
just decide what to get for breakfast tomorrow.

310
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:07,709
We won't talk about anything else.

311
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,419
Are you afraid?

312
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,149
That what I say would sound like a lie again?

313
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,619
I never said I was afraid.

314
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:27,469
You can't hear your own lies, can you?

315
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,879
So you can't.

316
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,990
Can't you just feign ignorance?

317
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,119
My head is about to explode because of that lie of yours.

318
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:53,389
I find it so hard to believe, and I do not want to believe it.

319
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,959
If I hear again that it's a lie, I can't even ignore it anymore.

Hello, I'm Assemblywoman Jung Yeon Mi.

321
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,969
I'm delighted to meet you all.

322
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:17,709
Before we get started,

323
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:21,350
I'd like to let you know...

324
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,050
that I can relate to your struggles to a certain extent.

325
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,149
My husband passed away years ago.

326
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,820
I had to raise my child all by myself,

327
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:31,859
and I struggled as a single mother.

328
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:34,260
You really are a politician now.

329
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,759
After Father passed away, you gained many votes...

330
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,129
using your image as a single mother.

331
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,550
This conference was organized...

332
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,019
to discuss single mothers' financial independence...

333
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,389
and emotional well being as well as how to improve...

334
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,020
the social perceptions on single parenting.

335
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:03,458
Thank you for your support.

336
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:04,520
I'm rooting for you.

337
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,330
- Thank you. - Thank you.

338
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,399
- Well done. - Thank you.

339
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,769
About what the party leader said, don't take it to heart.

340
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,198
Nothing's been decided yet.

341
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:20,469
A woman provincial governor. It won't be easy.

342
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,540
What?

343
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:23,709
You're talking as though you've already given up.

344
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,149
Come on. They're not making strategic nominations this time.

345
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,949
You never know until the election takes place.

346
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:31,820
But there are so many strong candidates this time.

347
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:34,649
The party leader is supporting someone else, after all.

348
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:36,688
You have me.

349
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:38,060
I'll give you all the support you need.

350
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:41,959
Thank you.

351
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:46,069
I'm saying this just in case.

352
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,929
Just make sure...

353
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,300
your son doesn't cause trouble for us.

354
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,509
Just take care of that,

355
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,139
and I believe you can totally win the election this time.

356
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:57,879
Put your worries to rest.

357
00:27:58,679 --> 00:27:59,679
All right, then.

358
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,580
I need my phone.

359
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,530
Yes, hi.

360
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,530
Can we meet today?

361
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:30,639
- Hello, Ms. Jung. - It's been a while, Deuk Chan.

362
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,790
- Germany? - Yes.

363
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:44,260
He always wanted to study. It's time he went for it.

364
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,929
I talked to Do Ha about it too,

365
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:56,139
but he seemed hesitant because of you.

366
00:28:56,939 --> 00:28:59,438
The thing is, you don't really need Do Ha anymore.

367
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:01,010
The company has grown.

368
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:08,350
The election is coming up, right?

369
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,148
It's not just about that.

370
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:13,419
I'll talk to him.

371
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:18,590
If Do Ha goes to Germany for a bit...

372
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,600
It'll help me out too, in many ways.

373
00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:27,199
All right, then.

374
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:39,850
Now, that's funny.

375
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,080
What do those two have to talk about?

376
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,560
(Syaon)

377
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:07,609
Hey.

378
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:09,439
Where are you?

379
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,810
I'm sorry.

380
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,290
How did you find that café?

381
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,619
Just by chance.

382
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:31,159
Believe me. While waiting for you,

383
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,669
I stumbled upon the café and walked in to avoid people,

384
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,139
and that woman was there.

385
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,039
If you want, I'll go back there...

386
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,179
and tell her that I was mistaken. Okay?

387
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,879
Don't go back there again.

388
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,609
And you don't need to tell such a lie.

389
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,719
Okay, I won't.

390
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,290
I no longer live in Yeonseo-dong,

391
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:56,820
so stop going there too.

392
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,989
Then where are you staying now?

393
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,159
It's none of your business.

394
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,699
I have nothing more to say to you.

395
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,560
Why? Is she afraid of you?

396
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,600
I bet that's why you moved out. Am I right?

397
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:13,510
Don't even be curious.

398
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:16,079
Why would you be all stressed out because of a woman like her?

399
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,609
This makes me so upset.

400
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,609
I can understand everything.

401
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,618
I don't care, no matter what happened in the past.

402
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:26,050
It really doesn't matter.

403
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,429
So you think I killed her.

404
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,219
She really should get some rest today.

405
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,830
Listen, Ms. Hunter.

406
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,929
Come on. He wasn't right for you from the start.

407
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,799
As a fellow fan of Syaon, I'm guessing...

408
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,769
that man, Kim Do Ha,

409
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,138
probably likes women who are lovely, cute,

410
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,079
and bubbly like Syaon.

411
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,480
But you're the quiet, cool type.

412
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,480
You're not chatty, and you look like you'd be cold-blooded.

413
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,448
Anyway, you and Syaon are total opposites,

414
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:33,490
so I bet...

415
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:34,820
What?

416
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,060
Ms. Mok.

417
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:44,030
Thanks to you, my sales numbers are back to where they were.

418
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,499
Oh, these aren't leftovers.

419
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,730
I made a new batch for you.

420
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,369
Sorry?

421
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:52,139
These are leftovers?

422
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:54,469
No, I made a fresh batch for you.

423
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,070
Thank you.

424
00:32:56,939 --> 00:32:59,339
One's for you, and the other one is for him.

425
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,409
Please make sure he gets it.

426
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,419
By the way, I haven't seen him in a while. Is he away or something?

427
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,719
This bread is good.

428
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:13,230
Really?

429
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:14,829
It's a new recipe.

430
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,599
I was worried that it might be too sweet.

431
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,629
No, it should be sweet like this.

432
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,399
What's the name of this bread?

433
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,070
Fluffy Honey Sweet Mont Blanc.

434
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:25,669
Right.

435
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:36,949
Wait, Ms. Hunter!

436
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,449
Are you sure you want to keep this appointment?

437
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:45,260
- Why? - You don't look so well.

438
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:47,428
What if the spirit can't find you?

439
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:49,389
Don't worry. I'm totally fine.

440
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:51,060
You're fine?

441
00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:53,199
Then you wouldn't have left this.

442
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:56,500
Thanks.

443
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:02,740
- Thanks. Bye. - Bye.

Excuse me. I'm Lee Kang Min's guardian.

I see, yes.

451

What's his condition now?

Pardon me?

453
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,118
He's here for his follow-up tests.

454
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:55,060
His doctor will tell him the details in a moment.

For gastric cancer?

456
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,830
Yes. You said you were his guardian.

457
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,169
How long has this been going on?

458
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,400

463

I'm sorry. I'm coming now.

Everything looks good.

465

Gosh, I'm so relieved.

466
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:42,939
I heard stage three cancers were more likely to return,

467
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,778
so I get nervous whenever I come back for follow-up tests.

468
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:45,839
Right, I understand.

469
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,679
No complications such as the dumping syndrome?

470
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,279
- No, none at all. - Your blood sugar levels are good.

471
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,618
And you've gained quite a bit of weight.

472
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:54,819
You look great.

473
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:57,019
I owe it all to you, Doctor.

474
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,860
It's all because you've been taking good care of yourself.

475

I heard Mr. Chairman's surgery went well.

479
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,339
I'm here to congratulate him.

480
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,610
Thank you.

481
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:26,750
Anyway, are you sure the surgery went well?

482
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,150
Yes, I'm sure.

483
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,459
You've already asked me this several times.

484
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,129
Just stick to your treatment plan,

485
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,989
and you'll recover in no time, Father.

486
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:44,869
How are you feeling, sir?

487
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:47,440
Gosh. I feel like I'm dying, Doctor.

488
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,040
Are you sure my surgery went well?

489
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:53,109
Why am I in so much pain?

490
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,580
The surgery was a success.

491
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:59,179
It's natural to feel pain or discomfort after the surgery.

492
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,290
Well, we'll give you some analgesics.

Yes.

495
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,799
I knew it.

496
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:19,710
What will you do now?

497
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:21,339
They're all trying so hard.

498
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,940

Then why did you get in touch with me?

This is your specialty, so you must know this already.

502
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,319
There are some things you must hide even if you know about it.

503
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,659
Sometimes, you should pretend not to know...

504
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,259
and act like you believe them.

00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:54,520
Hey, just insert your card.

546
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:07,929
- What is this? - Why is this here?

547
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,138
Oh, you've got a girlfriend?

548
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:11,468
It's my cousin.

549
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,068
Yes, she is his cousin. I met her too.

550
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:14,138
You guys looked like a couple.

551
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,368
- No, not at all. - No. A couple, my foot.

552
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:17,838
- Let's go. - Her cheekbones looked like yours.

553
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,048
Come on. So many women have cheekbones that look just like mine.

554
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:22,178
Once, I saw a woman...

555
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,619
who looked just like me and nearly fainted.

556
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:25,448
Gosh, I should burn this.

557
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,119
- Hey, what are you doing? - What?

558
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,988
Why do you still have this?

559
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:31,789
Men don't organize their wallets.

560
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,560
And I didn't even know this photo was in my wallet.

561
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,798
I still can't believe we ended up working in the same neighbourhood.

562
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:39,459
If people find out that we dated in the past,

563
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,198
one of us would have to close down our business.

564
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,099
Just because people find out? That's unnecessary.

565
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,638
You've practically hit on every woman in this neighbourhood.

566
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:46,639
It's so embarrassing.

567
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,008
I only hit on them after we broke up.

568
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:51,080
Also, they're all way better than you.

569
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,609
Don't let anyone find out that you worked at that weird bar.

570
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,080
Hey, you'd better not tell anyone.

571
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:58,919
I thought it was an ordinary bar,

572
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,448
and I quit the next day.

573
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:02,318
And you give up so easily too.

574
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,789
Way to go!

575
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,059
I get so upset whenever I have a lengthy conversation with you.

576
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,959
- Hey, give it back. - Hand it over!

577
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,289
I look good in this photo!

578
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,199
And I must keep this in my wallet to attract money.

579
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,000
Come on in.

580
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:31,778
Mr. Jo, Ms. Mok Sol Hee is here.

581
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:32,779
Thank you.

582
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,659
Sorry I made you come all the way here. I know you're busy.

583
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,819
You're busier than I am.

584
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,060
We're both busy, so why don't we get down to business?

585
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,560
(CEO Jo Deuk Chan)

586
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,239
Here.

587
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,069
What is this?

588
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,969
A confidential agreement.

589
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,310
Is this really necessary?

590
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,738
J Entertainment got bigger...

591
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:01,750
thanks to Do Ha and Syaon.

592
00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:05,049
You may not know much, but the songs he wrote...

593
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,219
have made the most profit.

594
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:10,290
So honestly, if his past goes public,

595
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,420
the company will suffer a great loss.

596
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,230
I know,

597
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,729
but I have no intention of telling this to anyone...

598
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,230
nor do I have anyone to share it with.

599
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:19,830
Right.

600
00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:22,130
It's not that I don't trust you.

601
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,369
Just consider this a formality.

602
00:43:39,549 --> 00:43:41,349
(To fulfill this agreement...)

603
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,959
Delete this part about the compensation.

604
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,989
I'll sign it then.

605
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,289
If you accept the compensation money,

606
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,758
it'll be easier for us to ask...

607
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:49,759
No.

608
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,129
If I sign this as is,

609
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,830
Mr. Kim could get the wrong idea.

610
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,170
Right, I understand.

611
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,179
Where has he been staying these days?

612
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:07,179
Is he coming back?

613
00:44:09,509 --> 00:44:11,319
No, he won't.

614
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,719
He's getting ready to leave for Germany.

615
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,889
Then I'll get back to you once the revision is made.

616
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:22,989
Sure. Bye.

617
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,969
(Jo Deuk Chan)

618
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,009
Hey, where are you?

619
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,880
What?

620
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:50,389
You really are...

621
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:53,560
How could you come here without telling me?

622
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:57,400
I get that you're worried about me,

623
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,899
but must I ask for your permission even on where I live?

624
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,969
Then you should've gone to a hotel or something.

625
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,699
This place...

626
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:08,409
What is with you?

627
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:12,080
Syaon's scandal died down now.

628
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:13,749
And no reporters wait for me anymore.

629
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,810
Eom Ho...

630
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,549
He came to see me.

631
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,719
He asked if Kim Seung Ju was Kim Do Ha.

632
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:26,020
That's why I told you not to come here and the company.

633
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,259
When?

634
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:32,330
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

635
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,529
Because you were enjoying an ordinary life.

636
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:40,000
I didn't want to ruin it.

637
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,739
Do Ha.

638
00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:49,949
Why don't you stay abroad for the time being?

639
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,020
You wanted to study in Germany.

640
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:54,449
- What? - And...

641
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,049
your mother's election is coming up soon.

642
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:58,588
If she finds out about this, you could be in trouble.

643
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,429
If people make an issue out of her son being a murderer...

644
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:02,060
Gosh, again...

645
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:06,759
A murderer?

646
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:09,469
What?

647
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,069
I mean...

648
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,109
A murder suspect, not a murderer.

649
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,610
You know what I mean, right?

650
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,819
I'll just face him.

651
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,889
I don't want to run away anymore.

652
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,330
So if he visits the company again,

653
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,259
tell him to just come here.

654
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,480
Where's Eom Ji?

655
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,380
Where are you keeping her?

656
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,670
I don't know.

657
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:17,770
I'm sorry.

658
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,830
(Jung Yeon Mi)

659
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,658
- Hello. - Hello.

660
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:21,499
Hyun Seo, the material I requested yesterday.

661
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,329
If it's ready, bring it to my office, please.

662
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:24,339
Sure.

663
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:28,839
Ma'am.

664
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:31,209
Someone made a call for you earlier today.

665
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,239
Thank you.

666
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,210
(I will be waiting at the café on the 1st floor. Kim Do Ha)

667
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,150
- When? - About 30 minutes ago.

668
00:49:02,469 --> 00:49:03,540
- Hello. - Hello.

669
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:16,489
So he's this wench's son.

670
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:18,690
Kim Do Ha.

671
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:33,400
How is the food? Do you like it?

672
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,170
Yes, it's good.

673
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,139
What a relief. I chose this place carefully.

674
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:50,689
Are you Moon Bo Ram?

675
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:53,060
- Yes, hello. - It's nice to meet you.

676
00:49:55,989 --> 00:49:58,428
I hear a lot of people do their blind dates here.

677
00:49:58,429 --> 00:49:59,860
Oh, really?

678
00:50:02,529 --> 00:50:05,170
How would it have been if we'd met on a blind date?

679
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:07,409
I might have asked you out on another date.

680
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,170
I'm not sure how it would've been for you.

681
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,080
Why did you like me?

682
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,448
My mom got dragged with her hair yanked...

683
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:19,279
for being a mistress.

684
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,420
My family was obviously a mess.

685
00:50:23,049 --> 00:50:24,360
You were kind in the midst of it.

686
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,659
Not many women are kind and pretty at the same time.

687
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:43,610
I can't do this.

688
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:46,110
I can't feign ignorance.

689
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,319
How long have you been sick?

690
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,889
What?

691
00:50:54,589 --> 00:50:56,089
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

692
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,560
You weren't visiting someone at the hospital back then.

693
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:03,529
You were there for your illness.

694
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:19,739
I had stage three stomach cancer.

695
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:27,020
But I'm okay now.

696
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,389
When you were diagnosed with it,

697
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,529
was I with you?

698
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:41,900
Tell me.

699
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:49,069
Yes, you were.

700
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,610
Why didn't you tell me?

701
00:51:57,549 --> 00:51:58,779
I didn't want you to suffer.

702
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,730
See?

703
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,759
You're crying even when I'm all better.

704
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,900
It would've been harder for you if you'd heard it when I was sick.

705
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:15,730
I'm sorry.

706
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,869
I had no idea.

707
00:52:20,139 --> 00:52:21,210
I'm sorry.

708
00:52:43,389 --> 00:52:44,400
You see,

709
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,699
I get that happiness doubles when it's shared.

710
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,568
But I don't really agree that sadness lessens...

711
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,699
when it's shared.

712
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:56,610
I thought it'd be even tougher...

713
00:52:57,639 --> 00:52:59,179
to see you struggle by my side.

714
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,380
How do you know without experiencing it?

715
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:07,119
It could've lessened.

716
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,060
Right.

717
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:15,860
Anyway,

718
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:18,699
what did you mean by what you told me...

719
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,199
at the end back then?

720
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,900
You said you could hear lies.

721
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:33,380
It's just as I said.

722
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,750
I can hear lies.

723
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,179
I was mistaken about your lie...

724
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:42,119
and broke up with you.

725
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:46,560
Gosh.

726
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:48,589
This is a little unfair.

727
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:50,758
You may be able to hear lies,

728
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:52,360
but I guess you can't hear why.

729
00:54:01,069 --> 00:54:02,139
Sol Hee.

730
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:06,940
Let's get back together.

731
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,719
I'll be better to you.

732
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,719
This is not a lie,

733
00:54:15,549 --> 00:54:16,589
isn't it?

734
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,270
If someone else comes to mind...

735
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,069
at a moment like this, does it mean I'm crazy?

736
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,290
Oh, come on.

737
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,360
I thought you were feeling sorry in tears.

738
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:01,130
You're not crazy. It's that you like him.

739
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,639
What about him?

740
00:55:08,569 --> 00:55:09,610
He doesn't like you?

741
00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:28,389
Thanks. Bye.

742
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,500
Just tell him how you feel soon.

743
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:37,569
Go out with him, and quickly come back to me.

744
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:39,900
I'll wait.

745
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:26,350
I can't.

746
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:29,150
I can't say anything because...

747
00:56:30,989 --> 00:56:32,489
I'm afraid you might hear it as a lie again.

748
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,428
You may be able to hear lies,

749
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:35,989
but I guess you can't hear why.

750
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,080
Which building and unit are you visiting?

751
00:57:00,819 --> 00:57:04,319
Well, I'm not sure. Just a moment.

752
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:10,900
(Mok Sol Hee)

753
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,210
Hello?

754
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,749
I'm at your apartment complex.

755
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:28,850
Which building and unit is your house?

756
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,319
You're here?

757
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:38,460
Where are you visiting?

758
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,429
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

759
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,429
I'm at the main gate.

760
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:52,940
She looks familiar.

761
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:55,368
Who was it next to you just now?

762
00:57:55,369 --> 00:57:56,409
Who are you?

763
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,380
Well, a security guard.

764
00:58:03,949 --> 00:58:06,379
They hired more staff to improve maintenance.

765
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,549
Didn't you hear it?

766
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:12,889
Is that right? Hold on.

767
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,460
That man tried to kill me.

768
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,330
Hurry back home.

769
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:25,600
Sol Hee.

770
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:27,909
Sol Hee.

771
00:58:33,139 --> 00:58:36,649
The phone is turned off. You'll be directed to voicemail.

772
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,650
After the beep...

773
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,480
What on earth?

774
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:13,650
The phone is turned off.

775
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:19,759
Will you knock it off?

776
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:22,659
The bus can't take off because of you. Get off.

777
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:24,290
What the...

778
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,429
You brought your new girlfriend all the way here?

779
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:41,750
Excuse me.

780
00:59:51,319 --> 00:59:52,389
Come on.

781
01:00:08,369 --> 01:00:09,639
That's him.

782
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:11,639
What?

783
01:00:27,759 --> 01:00:29,130
Where are you?

784
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:33,230
Where?

785
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:38,639
I can help you.

786
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:18,979
Hey, come here.

787
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,310
If you don't, I'll call the police.

788
01:01:24,819 --> 01:01:25,880
Okay.

789
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:46,069
You shouldn't have come here suddenly without notice.

790
01:01:47,569 --> 01:01:49,338
I suddenly got something to tell you.

791
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:50,839
Didn't you hear me?

792
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:53,009
- He's dangerous. - Exactly.

793
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,309
How was I supposed to just leave...

794
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:57,810
when such a dangerous man was around you?

795
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:03,350
Listen to me first.

796
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:05,460
I'll explain everything from start to finish.

797
01:02:07,989 --> 01:02:09,360
Everything you want to know.

798
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:12,360
Forget it.

799
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,400
You told me...

800
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:19,540
that you didn't kill her.

801
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,509
I don't need explanations.

802
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:31,580
I believe you.

803
01:02:34,989 --> 01:02:36,049
I do.

804
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:05,049
(My Lovely Liar)

805
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:35,110
What was she like?

806
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:36,809
I don't have any dream.

807
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:38,920
Fine. If you want to die, then do it. Die!

808
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:40,420
I still regret...

809
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,290
lying to her that time.

810
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,350
He sure is handsome.

811
01:03:45,259 --> 01:03:46,319
Are you sure about this guy?

812
01:03:47,759 --> 01:03:48,829
Sol Hee.

813
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:49,888
- What... - Gosh.

814
01:03:49,889 --> 01:03:51,258
I think you're the one for me.

815
01:03:51,259 --> 01:03:52,259
Ta-Da.

816
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:55,429
I like you more than anyone else.

817
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:57,330
What do I do?

818
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,540
Long time no see.

819
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:03,839
Tell me!

820
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,540
I'll repent for the rest of my life.
