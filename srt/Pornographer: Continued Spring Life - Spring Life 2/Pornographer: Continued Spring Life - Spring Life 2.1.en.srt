Hey there.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,790
So sorry I'm late. I overslept.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,290
It's fine. No worries.

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,500
I have free time on my hands, anyway.

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,870
Got a hangover?

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,050
I have been entertaining clients till morning.

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,240
You didn't have to come all the way here, then.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,410
Don't say that!

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,850
I thought you wouldn't come.

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,410
You're kidding me, right?

14
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,220
Right now,

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,740

Yoji, pass me the rice crackers.

18
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,890
Thank you for always inviting me over for food.

19
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,030
No problem at all.

20

Come, come, come.

21
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,450
I'm glad I have the chance to let you taste my cooking!

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,140
Rio had been a picky eater since young,

23
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,370
and he has a small appetite. Feeding him wasn't fun at all.

24
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,690
Is this you, Miyu?

25
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,620
Yup. And this is Mom, and this is Dad and Granny.

26
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,730
Then which one am I?

27
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,250
Rii and Haru are over here.

28
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,250

- Why should I?

32
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,310
I'm going outside for a smoke.

Hey, wait!

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,090
S-Sorry about that.

Well, she's still a kid, and kids say the darndest things.

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,170
I-It's fine.

00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,450
More wine? Oh, no need. Silly me.

38
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,360
Don't worry. Our family is pretty open to such things.

39
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,860
Huh?

40
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,600
W-Well...

41
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,350
I... feel kind of bad.

42
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,920
No, don't be.

43
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,790
We're the ones who should apologize.

44
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,330
Honestly speaking... what do you see in my brother?

45
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,860
Besides the fact that you're both men.

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,650
I mean, I'm sure you could find even better guys out there!

48

N-No, of course not.

49
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,600
So, what's good about him?

50
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,340
Come on, tell us!

51
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,670
You can't really find men like him.

52
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,150
He's special.

53
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,480
W-Well, I see.

54
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,140
I guess you're right.

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,430

56
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,310
Not at all.

57
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,380
I'm an only child, so I enjoy being with them.

58
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,090

- Yes.

64
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,360

65

But...

68
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,440
can you give me a little more time?

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,970
I've just started working on a new story.

70
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,850
Besides, I don't want to be a younger man's sugar baby.

71
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,060
I guess it boils down to this silly pride of mine.

72
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,500
Sorry, mind if I answer it?

73
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,180

Good, I guess. What's up?

77
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,600
Actually, Mr. Gamoda's "Orchid and Blood" is going to be adapted into a movie.

78
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,170
And in line with that, a special edition of "Spring Life" will be published.

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,590

Looks like he's someone who writes erotic novels.

00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,390
Kind of.

I'm sorry.

106
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:53,930
I met Mr. Gamoda half a year before he died.

107
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,380

He didn't.

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,090
I was the one who finished up the remaining 20 percent, in fact.

Of course you are.

If I hadn't met Gamoda-san,

146
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,700
I probably would have given up on being a writer.

147
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,610
And meeting Kido, too.

148
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,810
We went through a lot together,

149
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,980
but he was the only one who didn't forsake me.

150
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,920
I shall pretend I didn't hear the part about "a lot together".

151
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,970
It's definitely better that you do that.

- I'm sure of it.
- Maybe.

Likewise.
