00:00:00,688 --> 00:00:03,922
"CHASER GAME W2: Celestial Love"
Wow, I miss it so much.

2
00:00:04,445 --> 00:00:06,547
(Episode 6)
Wait a second.

3
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:09,070
- Is anyone allowed to
- Huh?

4
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:10,437
just walk into this university?

5
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:11,507
Don't worry.

6
00:00:11,523 --> 00:00:13,187
We still look like students.

7
00:00:13,211 --> 00:00:15,086
It's been six years since we graduated.

8
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,523
- We'll be fine. Come on.
- Really?

9
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:17,797
Yeah, let's go.

10
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:20,156
- Hello.
- Hello.

11
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,873
Today I'm too lazy to go to class.

12
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:24,852
Right?

13
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm so sleepy.

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,640
Hey, have you done your report yet?

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,742
I haven't even started yet.

16
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:30,469
The professor probably won't be angry.

17
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:31,672
I guess so.

18
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:33,765
(Welcome new students 2015, club PR)

19
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:35,109
This looks fun.

20
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,938
(Concert to welcome new members)
Interested in joining the music club?

21
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:39,656
Let's play basketball.

22
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:40,797
(Basketball club)

23
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,188
- Are you interested in the tennis club?
- It's okay.

24
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:48,398
- So cute.
- Are you a new student?

25
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:48,938
Yes.

26
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:50,124
Have you chosen a club yet?

27
00:00:50,156 --> 00:00:51,141
Not yet.

28
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:53,805
Hey, listen to me.

29
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:55,273
- Sorry.
- Tell me your contact information.

30
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,180
- Yeah, yeah.
- Please.

31
00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:57,820
Sorry I'm late.

32
00:00:58,086 --> 00:00:59,203
- Is that your friend?
- Your friend?

33
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:01,320
My boyfriend wouldn't let me come.

34
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,378
Haa...

35
00:01:25,082 --> 00:01:25,910
Ah.

36
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:30,879
Thank you.

37
00:01:31,496 --> 00:01:32,668
It's fine.

38
00:01:35,384 --> 00:01:37,900
Wow, you're from China?

39
00:01:38,038 --> 00:01:38,874
Yes.

40
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:41,244
I go back and forth to Japan often.

41
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,533
So I can speak Japanese.

42
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,400
Is that so?

43
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:49,275
I'm Harumoto Itsuki. Nice to meet you.

44
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:51,798
I'm Hayashi Fuyu.

45
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,697
Written in kanji for winter and rain.

46
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,197
It's pronounced ‘Dong Yu' in Chinese.

47
00:01:58,658 --> 00:01:59,767
- Dong Yu, huh?
- Yes.

48
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,658
That's a little hard to say.

49
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:05,736
I'll just call you ‘Fuyu'.

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,642
Alright.

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,939
So cute.

52
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,837
- Itsuki-san?
- Yes.

53
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:15,001
Itsuki.

54
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:17,587
You can call me Itsuki.

55
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:18,976
Yeah.

56
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:21,765
The name Itsuki sounds like

57
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:23,101
someone prim and proper.

58
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,562
Not at all.

59
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:26,929
My room's filled with game stuff.

60
00:02:27,117 --> 00:02:28,836
I'm a bit of a game otaku.

61
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:30,422
Ah, so am I.

62
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,195
I love anime and games.

63
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,219
What kind of games?

64
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:35,258
‘Clash of Clans'.

65
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:37,070
Oh, Kurakura, right?

66
00:02:37,484 --> 00:02:39,015
I like it too.

67
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:40,155
I've never played

68
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:41,101
a Japanese game though.

69
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:41,960
I'd like to try one.

70
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:43,890
Let's play together.

71
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:45,960
- Sure.
- Yeah, let's play.

72
00:02:47,812 --> 00:02:49,577
My room is a bit small.

73
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:51,344
Wow, that's great.

74
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:51,991
Ah.

75
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:53,375
Sorry for intruding.

76
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:55,734
Hey, what is it?

77
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:57,219
Sorry.

78
00:02:57,265 --> 00:02:58,062
Huh?

79
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,031
Alright.

80
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:01,491
Done. Welcome.

81
00:03:01,492 --> 00:03:02,289
Yes.

82
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:03,883
Excuse me.

83
00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:07,390
Oh.

84
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:08,867
So many games that it

85
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:10,523
looks bad, doesn't it?

86
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:12,039
What game is this?

87
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:14,383
That's Yokai Watch 2.

88
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,695
It's really popular.

89
00:03:15,765 --> 00:03:17,054
The picture is so cute.

90
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:19,172
Yes, it's cute.

91
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:20,469
What about this one?

92
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:22,648
That's a game called Ni no Kuni.

93
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:23,421
Is that so?

94
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:24,633
This one's fun too.

95
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:26,320
(A demon appears)
Come on, fight them.

96
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:27,726
(Gets a chance to attack first)

97
00:03:31,172 --> 00:03:31,875
Oh.

98
00:03:40,943 --> 00:03:41,826
Oh.

99
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:43,037
It's done.

100
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,927
Sorry for the wait.

101
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:47,076
Huh? What is it?

102
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:48,357
I made you stew.

103
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:52,489
Wow, that stew looks so yummy.

104
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:53,638
Thanks.

105
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:54,513
Please eat.

106
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:57,146
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

107
00:04:04,404 --> 00:04:05,162
Mhmm...

108
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:07,318
It's delicious!

109
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:08,177
- Is it delicious?
- Yes.

110
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:09,310
I'm relieved.

111
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:13,037
Do you usually cook for yourself?

112
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:14,794
Yeah, I live alone.

113
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:18,537
Mhmm.

114
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:21,380
I'm so full.

115
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:22,326
Mhm...

116
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:24,325
- Hey, Itsuki.
- Hmm?

117
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,685
- Next time...
- Yes?

118
00:04:25,763 --> 00:04:27,701
Why don't you come to China with me?

119
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:31,622
I'm a poor student. I can't afford

120
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,833
international trips.

121
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:34,185
Huh?

122
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,888
My dad can cover the costs.

123
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,748
Let's go together, please.

124
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:39,888
No.

125
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:41,989
No. I want to go to China with you

126
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:43,466
when I can afford it myself.

127
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:45,982
So please wait for me.

128
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:47,578
Hmm?

129
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:49,263
How long will it take?

130
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:50,896
Mhmm...

131
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:53,451
Well...

132
00:04:53,763 --> 00:04:56,068
With my student loans… probably a while.

133
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:00,482
I got it.

134
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,185
I'll be waiting.

135
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:03,669
Thanks.

136
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,755
Mhm.

137
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:08,505
You're so serious, Itsuki.

138
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,646
I'm not that serious.

139
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:12,279
I'm fine using the same towel

140
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:13,901
for two days straight.

141
00:05:13,926 --> 00:05:15,029
I once accidentally fell asleep

142
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:15,848
while playing a game.

143
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:17,396
I even ate grapes with the skin on.

144
00:05:17,482 --> 00:05:18,794
I'm pretty lazy, actually.

145
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:22,380
What is it?

146
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:23,615
No, it's nothing.

147
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:26,240
That's why I thought you were serious.

148
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:28,904
Wait, that's not true.

149
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:30,443
- I'm serious?
- Mhm.

150
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:32,029
That's not true.

151
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:36,503
You invited me over the same day we met.

152
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:38,646
That was pretty bold of you.

153
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:40,989
You were the one who wanted

154
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,286
to see my place!

155
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:45,193
And I was just...

156
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,115
excited to have a new friend.

157
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,677
Hmm...

158
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:51,895
So, when did you start thinking

159
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:54,755
of me as more than a friend?

160
00:05:57,383 --> 00:05:58,571
Do you remember when

161
00:05:58,587 --> 00:05:59,983
we went to the movies, and it suddenly

162
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:01,602
started raining on the way home?

163
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:03,001
Yeah, I do.

164
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,305
That we ran back to the

165
00:06:04,337 --> 00:06:05,305
apartment together, right?

166
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:06,344
Yes.

167
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,203
Oh no.

168
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,610
This way.

169
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:12,914
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

170
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:16,617
- Come in quickly.
- Thanks.

171
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:18,704
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

172
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:19,977
It's fine.

173
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:22,110
The weather forecast said it'd be sunny.

174
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,320
Right? I was shocked

175
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:24,928
that it was raining.

176
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:26,251
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

177
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:28,501
It's okay if it's not new.

178
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:31,133
It's okay if it's not new.

179
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:32,422
We're soaked.

180
00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:35,587
Right? I hope we don't catch a cold.

181
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:45,676
Hm? What's wrong?

182
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:48,043
Huh? Oh, it's nothing.

183
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:51,105
Here, sit down. I'll dry your hair.

184
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:52,246
You sure?

185
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:53,324
Yeah, of course.

186
00:06:54,074 --> 00:06:55,666
So you don't catch a cold.

187
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,806
Good. Thank you.

188
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:59,355
Not at all.

189
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:13,592
I like you, Fuyu.

190
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,795
I like you.

191
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,404
I like you.

192
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:30,428
What was that?

193
00:07:30,506 --> 00:07:31,404
Hmm?

194
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:33,194
It's nothing.

195
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:34,936
Mhm.

196
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:36,998
Is that so?

197
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,373
Yeah.

198
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:47,131
You really didn't say something earlier?

199
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:48,295
Hmm?

200
00:07:49,483 --> 00:07:51,076
I didn't say anything.

201
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:52,654
Hmm?

202
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:56,045
No way.

203
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,959
You definitely said something earlier.

204
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:00,506
Hmm?

205
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:03,873
By the way,

206
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:05,303
your birthday's coming

207
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:06,381
up soon, isn't it?

208
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:08,272
Huh?

209
00:08:08,686 --> 00:08:09,459
Ah.

210
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:10,928
Kurokawa-kun called.

211
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,389
Hello, Kurokawa-kun.

212
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:21,967
Anyway...

213
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,365
See you.

214
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:32,389
What's wrong, Fuyu?

215
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:36,826
(Lux Cafe)

216
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:45,404
What's so great about ‘Mr. Campus'?

217
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:46,858
He's just a playboy!

218
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,756
I should've punched him!

219
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:55,507
Are you okay, Fuyu?

220
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:56,780
Yeah.

221
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,241
I was surprised by how little I felt.

222
00:09:02,882 --> 00:09:05,053
Besides, it's more fun to be

223
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:08,968
with you than with him.

224
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,626
Huh?

225
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:14,689
When I'm with you,

226
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:18,032
my heart feels fluffy,

227
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,611
I feel good.

228
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,900
I feel the same way when I'm with Fuyu.

229
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:25,689
I'm glad.

230
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,760
What's wrong?

231
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:45,502
I...

232
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:48,971
like Fuyu.

233
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,221
Can I kiss you?

234
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:19,619
Happy birthday to you.

235
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,455
- Thanks.
- Happy birthday to you.

236
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:26,041
- Blow out the candles.
- Yeah.

237
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:31,119
Happy birthday.

238
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:32,267
Thank you.

239
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:33,416
I'm 19 now.

240
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:34,376
That's right.

241
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:35,962
From now on, I'll be in your care.

242
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:37,072
I'll be in your care.

243
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:38,416
Looks delicious.

244
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:39,689
You like strawberries, don't you?

245
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,830
Yeah.

246
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,028
Here, Fuyu.

247
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:44,263
Hmm?

248
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:46,982
Do you want to stay over tonight?

249
00:10:49,263 --> 00:10:51,989
I'd like to.

250
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,692
But I live in a dorm.

251
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:54,880
They don't allow me to stay

252
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:56,020
overnight outside.

253
00:10:56,044 --> 00:10:58,802
Then can I stay at your place?

254
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:02,267
I have a roommate, so I can't.

255
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:04,892
Is that so?

256
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:09,193
Sorry.

257
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,177
Not at all.

258
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,349
- I'm sorry for saying something weird.
- No.

259
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:15,857
Then...

260
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:17,230
I'll cut it.

261
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:17,942
Yeah.

262
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:19,544
Do you want me to help you?

263
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,317
It's okay. Sit down.

264
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,496
Thanks.

265
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:28,332
No problem.

266
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:30,325
- I'm off.
- Yeah.

267
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:31,176
See you later.

268
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,332
Be careful when you get back.

269
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:33,168
Yeah.

270
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:35,063
Get plenty of rest.

271
00:11:35,086 --> 00:11:37,047
When you arrive, call me.

272
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:38,265
Sure, good night.

273
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,805
Good night.

274
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:40,774
See you later.

275
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:42,132
Excuse me.

276
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:46,516
Bye-bye.

277
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:56,688
Fuyu...

278
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:01,883
(Friday, November 6, 2015
Happy Birthday Itsuki)

279
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:14,437
Itsuki,

280
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:16,976
- are you alright?
- Yeah.

281
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:19,437
I'm sorry, Fuyu.

282
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,515
Why are you apologizing?

283
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:22,898
Well, you...

284
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:27,802
made dinner reservations, didn't you?

285
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,148
Don't worry about that.

286
00:12:32,195 --> 00:12:33,529
I'm sorry.

287
00:12:33,592 --> 00:12:34,639
No problem.

288
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:37,576
Here, can you eat?

289
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:38,272
Huh?

290
00:12:38,498 --> 00:12:39,388
Alright.

291
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:40,920
Are you going to feed me?

292
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:42,240
Yeah, one, two...

293
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,404
Alright.

294
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:46,318
- Thanks.
- Are you okay? You can lean on me.

295
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:48,357
Huh? Are you going to feed me?

296
00:12:48,397 --> 00:12:50,365
Yeah, but it's a bit hot.

297
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:56,795
Here. Aah...

298
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,529
Mhm...

299
00:13:01,787 --> 00:13:03,092
How is it?

300
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,522
It's your thoughtfulness that matters.

301
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:07,380
Huh?

302
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:08,342
Is it bad?

303
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:09,451
No.

304
00:13:09,803 --> 00:13:12,240
But it's a little strong.

305
00:13:12,287 --> 00:13:13,647
No way, really?

306
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:19,264
I think I put too much salt in.

307
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:22,802
- Sorry.
- Fuyu's love flavor is so strong.

308
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:24,348
But you're sweating a lot.

309
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:26,053
Eating this might help.

310
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:28,519
- Yeah, thanks.
- Here.

311
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:29,872
Aah...

312
00:13:37,364 --> 00:13:39,200
Here, let me change your cloth.

313
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:41,372
Thanks.

314
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:49,364
If you don't hurry back,

315
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:52,091
you'll miss curfew.

316
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:54,156
It's fine.

317
00:13:55,672 --> 00:13:56,367
Huh?

318
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:57,843
I'm staying here tonight,

319
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:58,976
to take care of you.

320
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:05,063
You're staying?

321
00:14:57,117 --> 00:14:59,555
Sorry if I passed my cold to you.

322
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:01,000
It's fine.

323
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:02,938
If I catch a cold from Itsuki,

324
00:15:02,954 --> 00:15:04,234
I'll be happier.

325
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,664
If that happens,

326
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,391
I'll take care of you next time.

327
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:13,370
Yeah.

328
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:17,235
How would you take care of me?

329
00:15:20,813 --> 00:15:21,602
Huh?

330
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:22,766
Huh? What are you...

331
00:15:22,836 --> 00:15:24,555
Wait, stop!

332
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,047
Stop, it tickles!

333
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:29,851
I got it!

334
00:15:31,828 --> 00:15:33,008
Hey.

335
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:35,352
Is it time to find a job already?

336
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:36,851
That's fast huh, there are

337
00:15:36,859 --> 00:15:38,476
so many announcements.

338
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,203
- Oh, look! DD Corporation is hiring!
- Hmm?

339
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,812
You're right!

340
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:44,546
I saw the announcement here,

341
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:46,257
so I went for the interview.

342
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:47,609
You remember?

343
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:48,695
I remember.

344
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,406
I was so nervous about the interview.

345
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:54,320
(December 2015)

346
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:01,967
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Huh?

347
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,797
When you're gaming,

348
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:07,221
you forget I even exist, don't you?

349
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,994
That's not true.

350
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:11,510
Huh?

351
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:15,220
- If you love games this much,
- Yeah.

352
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:17,182
you should work at a game company.

353
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,307
I haven't ruled it out.

354
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:22,260
You should!

355
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:23,939
I love seeing you

356
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:25,689
so happy when you play.

357
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:28,283
Fuyu.

358
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:30,049
Jiayou! (You can do it!)

359
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,611
Fuyu, I love you.

360
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:33,814
Same!

361
00:16:33,838 --> 00:16:35,400
I love you too, Itsuki!

362
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:37,268
Fuyu.

363
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:39,900
We fell.

364
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:43,697
Oh, you're so cute.

365
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:49,106
If it's a room like this,

366
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:50,872
it would be better if it had a balcony.

367
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:51,982
- That's right.
- Right?

368
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:53,950
For those who are not yet of legal age,

369
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,403
a parent or guardian's consent

370
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:56,702
is required to sign a rental contract.

371
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:57,726
Will that be a problem?

372
00:16:58,052 --> 00:16:58,787
Ah...

373
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:00,880
I'm good.

374
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:04,510
Do we absolutely need it?

375
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:05,443
Yes,

376
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,982
it's a legal requirement.

377
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,318
Sorry, Itsuki.

378
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:15,529
My mom would never agree to it.

379
00:17:18,794 --> 00:17:20,435
Is that so?

380
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,210
I want to stay like this forever.

381
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:49,210
Yeah.

382
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:58,077
Next time, let's live together.

383
00:17:58,093 --> 00:17:59,373
The three of us.

384
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:00,991
Yeah.

385
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:03,847
I'll be in your care

386
00:18:03,856 --> 00:18:05,355
for the rest of my life.

387
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,316
Likewise.

388
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:15,144
Let's grow old together.

389
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:19,386
Yeah.

390
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:45,647
There are crow's feet...

391
00:18:47,787 --> 00:18:49,005
Two months later,

392
00:18:49,224 --> 00:18:51,739
Fuyu and Kou-san finally divorced.

393
00:18:52,818 --> 00:18:54,514
Yes, yes, very good.

394
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,678
Tsuki will stay with Fuyu-san,

395
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,149
who is her mother.

396
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:02,897
I will also help raise her

397
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,233
as a father.

398
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:06,983
Is that acceptable?

399
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,897
Of course.

400
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,397
I'll be in your care.

401
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:15,686
Likewise.

402
00:19:17,097 --> 00:19:18,238
Umm...

403
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:21,936
Kou-san, are you going back to China?

404
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,334
No.

405
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,686
I'll continue to stay in Japan

406
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:28,077
and make my dream come true.

407
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:30,053
What is your dream?

408
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:33,693
To work with animals.

409
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,646
It's my dream.

410
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:39,390
I want to try until I succeed.

411
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:42,084
Seeing Fuyu-san made me think that way.

412
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:43,850
Huh?

413
00:19:44,662 --> 00:19:46,053
For the dream of being

414
00:19:46,077 --> 00:19:47,517
with Harumoto-san,

415
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:50,756
you fought and sacrificed.

416
00:19:52,717 --> 00:19:54,873
That picture gave me courage.

417
00:19:58,491 --> 00:19:59,452
Thank you.

418
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:08,280
The person who should thank

419
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:11,014
is me.

420
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:17,795
I fought because of you,

421
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:21,608
Kou, who always encouraged me.

422
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,272
So...

423
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,350
Thank you very much.

424
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,592
Alright, this is the last piece.

425
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:55,772
Mama.

426
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:58,772
Carry it over there.

427
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:00,616
So tired.

428
00:21:01,037 --> 00:21:02,006
Thank you.

429
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:04,006
Thank you, it's done.

430
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:05,475
Let's take a break.

431
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:06,389
Tsuki-chan, come here.

432
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:08,537
Come on, come on.

433
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:10,029
This way.

434
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:15,084
Hey, hold on carefully.

435
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:16,967
Go that way.

436
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:20,824
Alright.

437
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:22,702
- One, two...
- One, two...

438
00:21:22,725 --> 00:21:25,608
- Happy Birthday!
- Happy Birthday!

439
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:27,458
- Huh?
- Yay!

440
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,263
- How did it get here? That's amazing.
- Here, put it down.

441
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:31,217
Wow!

442
00:21:31,218 --> 00:21:32,873
Sit down. Here.

443
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:36,241
- Blow it.
- Yeah.

444
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,131
You can't blow it all at once.

445
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:44,810
- Thanks.
- Surprise, huh?

446
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:46,178
Yeah.

447
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:48,272
Thank you for being born.

448
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,772
Thank you.

449
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,998
- Yeah.
- Huh?

450
00:21:51,217 --> 00:21:53,287
Thank you? Shouldn't it be

451
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:55,577
Happy Birthday instead?

452
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:58,022
Yeah but for me...

453
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:00,600
Thank you for being born,

454
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:02,998
for meeting me,

455
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:07,811
for spending your birthday with me,

456
00:22:08,514 --> 00:22:10,725
for living together,

457
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:12,584
and thank you for always

458
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:13,685
telling me you love me.

459
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,623
Geez, that's enough.

460
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,866
Thank you.

461
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,366
Thank you.

462
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,827
Mama.

463
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,162
Thank you for being born.

464
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:25,983
Thank you.

465
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:30,436
I'm so happy!

466
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:34,795
Let's eat.

467
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,360
(Thank you for being born)
Right? Let's eat.

468
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,840
(Thank you for being born)
There are so many strawberries.

469
00:22:37,842 --> 00:22:38,942
Right?

470
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,013
(Next episode)

471
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:47,623
(The three finally start living together)
Bon appétit.

472
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:49,233
(The three finally start living together)
Wanna take a bath together?

473
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:50,678
Tsuki-chan's mama.

474
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,811
Nice to meet you.

475
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,452
I'm a relative of Tsuki's mom.

476
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:55,788
My name is Hayashi Fuyu.

477
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:57,437
I look forward to working with you.

478
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,840
(The girl in red comes to visit)
