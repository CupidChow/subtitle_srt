1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,046
You're always waiting for someone,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,757
right?

3
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:04,414
I felt like if I stayed here,

4
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,203
I'd be able to see you again someday.

5
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:09,336
I want to be honest with everyone,

6
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:12,266
so please wait a little longer.

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,953
Ah!

8
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,703
Itsuki.

9
00:00:18,578 --> 00:00:19,469
Huh?

10
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:21,109
I missed you so much!

11
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:23,508
The one who appeared

12
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:27,711
was my first love.

13
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:37,219
Yoreum?

14
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:40,234
I knew it was you, Yoreum-san!

15
00:00:40,938 --> 00:00:42,000
You know her?

16
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:42,898
Of course.

17
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:45,500
Here. Her speech went viral!

18
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:48,227
I am a lesbian.

19
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:54,070
It took a lot of courage

20
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:56,781
to say that here today.

21
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,913
What I understand is that someone

22
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,960
has to be the first step of the staircase.

23
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:04,999
So, I've decided to

24
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:06,695
become that first step.

25
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:12,602
Do you know Itsuki-san?

26
00:01:12,836 --> 00:01:13,664
Yes.

27
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:15,882
In high school, I stayed at

28
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:16,937
Itsuki's house as part

29
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:18,241
of a homestay program.

30
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:22,765
Ah, you're right!

31
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:24,219
Huh?

32
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:28,258
We shared a roof, and a bed, didn't we?

33
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:30,125
It was a futon,

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,336
a futon!

35
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:32,563
Yes, a futon.

36
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:33,391
Futon!

37
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:34,789
Huh?

38
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:37,351

42
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:58,516
- Huh? For me?
- Yes.

43
00:01:59,523 --> 00:02:01,375
It's so cute! We're actually matching!

44
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,687
Wow, it's true! That's amazing!

45
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:05,477
- I'm so happy!
- I'm so happy.

46
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:13,672
Why would you do that?

47
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:17,265
Because you shattered my feelings!

49
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:40,570
- Manager.
- Hmm?

50
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:42,391
Yoreum-san said she wanted to do

51
00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:43,718
a live broadcast in the store.

52
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:44,664
Oh.

53
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:45,953
Sure.

54
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:48,280
You should join too, Itsuki!

55
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:48,906
Huh?

56
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:50,141
Up there.

57
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:51,313
Ah...

58
00:02:52,602 --> 00:02:53,492
Fuyu.

59
00:02:53,742 --> 00:02:54,578
Hmm?

60
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:56,578
You've gotten more

61
00:02:56,602 --> 00:02:58,086
beautiful since we last met.

62
00:02:59,758 --> 00:03:01,500
Wouldn't the table seats be better?

63
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:03,047
Nope, that spot is perfect.

64
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:07,938
Ah...

65
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,758
Umm, watch your steps.

66
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:14,835
In last week's video,

67
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:15,788
umm...

68
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:18,500
Yoreum-san, you mentioned you wanted to

69
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:20,925
confess to your first love, right?

70
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:22,141
You watched it?

71
00:03:22,445 --> 00:03:23,594
Have you confessed yet?

72
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:25,492
Soon, I think.

73
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:26,563
Do your best!

74
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:27,766
I'll do my best!

75
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:36,797
Huh?

76
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,234
Huh?

77
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:41,461
Huh? I'm happy.

78
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:47,313
- Oh no.
- Are you alright?

79
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:49,008
Ah, I'm sorry.

80
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,445
Thank you very much.

81
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:51,781
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:55,578
Ah.

83
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,094
- Yuina?
- Fuyu-san...

84
00:03:58,516 --> 00:04:00,101
Huh?

85
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,063
When did you come back?

86
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:03,930
The day before yesterday.

87
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:06,063
Have you met Itsuki-san yet?

88
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:08,039
Yeah, yesterday.

89
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:09,940
That's great.

90
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:12,675
Come visit the company sometime.

91
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,479
Is that okay?

92
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:15,581
Of course!

93
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:18,228
How about tomorrow?

94
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,979
Tomorrow?

95
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:20,886
Ah, yeah.

96
00:04:22,057 --> 00:04:23,275
Ah, ah!

97
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:24,675
Sorry.

98
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:33,401
Hi, it's Yoreum!

99
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:35,065
Today, I'm doing a live stream

100
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,081
from the Mellow Café in Japan!

101
00:04:37,182 --> 00:04:39,307
And guess what, the café's manager is

102
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:41,330
the daughter of my homestay host

103
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:43,422
when I studied abroad in Japan.

104
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:45,245
She's grown into such a beautiful woman.

105
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:47,901
This must be fate!

106
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,378

107
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:52,448

00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,425
I missed you!

(Can I go see you at the store?)

113
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:09,651
(I bought something that suits you)

114
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:11,064
(Hey, are you busy?)

115
00:05:11,065 --> 00:05:12,283
(You must be busy, right? Good job)

116
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:13,259
(But I really want to see you soon)

Mhmm.

123
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:46,198
Delicious?

124
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:47,417
Delicious.

125
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:20,604
Thank you. Take care.

126
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:21,456

164
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:31,424
Choose me.

165
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:35,065

The younger sister of Zhang Shulin,

193
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,768
the original creator of Tennyo Sekai.

194
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:14,956
Her sister?

195
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:16,214
A high school student?

196
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,159
Yes.

197
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,049
The real identity of Zhang Shulin is

198
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:21,143
actually a 17-year-old high school girl.

199
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:22,441
She's preparing for

200
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:23,447
college entrance exams, her sister is

201
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:24,636
acting as her representative.

202
00:10:24,652 --> 00:10:25,784
Is that so?

203
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,292
The casting for the roles of

204
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:28,917
the black and white heavenly maidens

205
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:30,111
in the Tennyo Sekai drama

206
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:31,613
still hasn't been approved by her.

207
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:33,902
I see.

208
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:44,656
Wait!

209
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:46,874
You mixed up the salt with sugar!

210
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:47,710
Huh?

211
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:49,811
I don't know what happened.

212
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:51,774
But I can help you look after the shop.

213
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:52,664
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:54,180
I'll do the rest myself.

215
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:57,063
- Thank you.
- Please go rest.

216
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:09,766
I watched the livestream yesterday,

217
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:12,540
and Yoreum was all over Itsuki-san.

218
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:14,876
Itsuki-san looked really uncomfortable.

219
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,743
Here you go.

220
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:17,727
Thank you.

221
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,985
Fuyu-san misunderstood.

222
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:21,134
Yeah.

223
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:23,610
Itsuki is still head over heels for you,

224
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:24,635
Fuyu-san.

225
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:25,579
Right?

226
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:26,665
That's right.

227
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,703
Just the other day, we suggested

228
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:30,008
she try a dating app and

229
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:31,250
find someone new,

230
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,648
but all the preferences she listed

231
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:33,696
were exactly like you.

232
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Is that true?

233
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:36,423
- Yes.
- Yes.

234
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:39,040
Haa...

235
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:41,524
Ah!

236
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:43,734
Yoreum has an insane number

237
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,799
of followers.

238
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:46,477
Is she a beauty influencer?

239
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:48,391
Actually, not at all.

240
00:11:48,602 --> 00:11:49,953
Seems like she came from

241
00:11:49,969 --> 00:11:51,649
a super poor family.

242
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:53,571
Here.

243
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:55,102
She shows the meals

244
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:56,567
she ate as a kid.

245
00:11:57,727 --> 00:11:59,282
Bon appétit.

246
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:01,149
- Ah! She ate it.
- Oh!

247
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:05,509
- Huh? That's impressive.
- Right?

248
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:06,438
That's it.

249
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:07,828
When I was a child,

250
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:09,399
due to some necessities so

251
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:11,414
I once had to live under a bridge.

252
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:13,727
Huh?

253
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:15,016
How pitiful.

254
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:18,235
Good night, then.

255
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:22,946
That's amazing.

256
00:12:24,782 --> 00:12:26,117
And apparently she has

257
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:27,781
a black belt in Taekwondo.

258
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:28,969
She's even planning to enter

259
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:30,078
a martial arts competition.

260
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:33,024
She's beautiful, strong,

261
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:34,626
and smart too.

262
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:36,750
I heard she graduated

263
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,235
at the top of her class

264
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,563
at Seoul National University.

265
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:40,759
But I think,

266
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:42,790
when you look carefully...

267
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:44,789
it seems like she has a bad personality!

268
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,250
Yes! She looks so spoiled!

269
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:49,852
Yes, and her bangs

270
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:52,163
aren't styled properly either.

271
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,766
- Right?
- Her makeup is really heavy.

272
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:55,617
Not Itsuki-san's type at all.

273
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:57,376
- Not at all.
- Nope.

274
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,532
- Definitely not.
- Absolutely not.

275
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:00,821
Fuyu-san is much cuter.

276
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,587
Yeah, Fuyu-san is the best.

277
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:07,899
I have something I want.

278
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,735
So, I'll stay in Japan until I do.

279
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:14,391
Oh, and

280
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:16,907
there's someone I want you

281
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:17,992
to look into for me.

282
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:22,937
(Lin Dongyu)

283
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,462
Fuyu.

284
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:33,540
There's nothing going on with Yoreum.

285
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,944
She stayed with my family as

286
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:36,380
an exchange student in high school,

287
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:37,952
and we just happened to meet again.

288
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:39,438
That's all there is to it.

289
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,516
Then why were you letting her hug you?

290
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:43,329
That's...

291
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,516
You must have been happy being embraced

292
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:47,782
by such a beautiful woman, right?

293
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,727
The only person I love is Fuyu!

294
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:08,055
The only person I love is Fuyu!

295
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,496
The elevator is currently out of service.

296
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,512
There is also signal disruption,

297
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,879
so mobile phones may not work well.

298
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:40,684
We apologize for the inconvenience!

299
00:14:45,614 --> 00:14:46,715
How long do we have to wait?

300
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,393
The safety center is currently

301
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:50,559
taking care of the safety issue...

302
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,700
(Safety center)

303
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:53,748
There's a woman trapped in the elevator,

304
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,084
and she has claustrophobia.

305
00:14:55,108 --> 00:14:57,842
I need to talk to her and calm her down!

306
00:14:57,928 --> 00:14:58,983
I'm sorry!

307
00:15:00,592 --> 00:15:01,811
Fuyu, can you hear me?

308
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:05,381
Itsuki?

309
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:07,967
Why?

310
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:11,420
Let's talk about anything.

311
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,099
Umm...

312
00:15:15,303 --> 00:15:16,686
I don't know.

313
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:19,865
I'm scared of small spaces.

314
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:22,233
I know.

315
00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:26,162
Since when did you know?

316
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:29,053
During our first year of university,

317
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:30,466
on the first Golden Week trip

318
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,014
we took with everyone.

319
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:33,975
Seems like the next puzzle is here.

320
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,698
Ah, that's it!

321
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:36,979
What's this room?

322
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,272
Great! That's right.

323
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,116
(Put them in the right order)
Great! That's right.

324
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:42,537
- What's this?
- How is that?

325
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:44,006
Put them in the right order...

326
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,709
Huh, Itsuki, can you guess?

327
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:47,225
Huh?

328
00:15:55,264 --> 00:15:59,232
Did you know that back then?

329
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,350
Yes.

330
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,819
So just relax.

331
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,834
Yeah.

332
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,326
Breathe slowly.

333
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:15,631
Yeah.

334
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:23,826
Ah.

335
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:26,912
What happened?

336
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:29,013
It's scary.

337
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:30,646
It's dark.

338
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:34,671
Ah.

339
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:36,934
It looks like it's a power outage.

340
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:38,426
What can we do?

341
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:40,457
Ah. Well...

342
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:53,809
Fuyu!

343
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:55,395
Itsuki?

344
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,879
Fuyu, wait for a bit!

345
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:07,129
Ah.

346
00:17:10,168 --> 00:17:11,808
Just a little more, hang on!

347
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,866
Fuyu!

348
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:26,858
Itsuki!

349
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:43,146
Excuse me...

350
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:45,591
May I have a word?

351
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:49,130
Yes.

352
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:51,974
Umm...

353
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,560
So, who broke the elevator?

354
00:17:58,146 --> 00:17:59,637
Then, I'm going to need you

355
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,068
to come with me for a bit.

356
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:05,115
Ah...

357
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:06,443
This way please.

358
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:08,060
I'll contact you later.

359
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,259
All done.

360
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:39,290
Yes?

361
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:41,298
A call for you from Harumoto-sama.

362
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:42,626
Itsuki?

363
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,516
Boo! Sorry.

364
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,813
It's Yoreum.

365
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,399
There's something I want to say to you.

366
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:51,423
What is it?

367
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:53,808
Stop deceiving Itsuki

368
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,633
while you're still married.

369
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,067
I'm going to finalize my divorce soon.

370
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:02,418
But you're still not separated.

371
00:19:02,512 --> 00:19:04,043
That means it's an affair.

372
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:06,450
You're just hurting Itsuki.

373
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:09,559
Poor Itsuki.

374
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:18,465
What would you know?

375
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,207
Sorry for the wait.

376
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,246
Hey.

377
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:36,668
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,059
Why are you apologizing?

379
00:19:40,895 --> 00:19:42,356
Because being with me

380
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:45,286
is causing you pain.

381
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:53,989
It doesn't hurt me at all.

382
00:19:56,451 --> 00:19:57,357
Really?

383
00:19:58,912 --> 00:19:59,795
Yes.

384
00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:10,389
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

385
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:15,522
Mhmm!

386
00:20:15,686 --> 00:20:17,155
- It's delicious.
- Really?

387
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:18,171
Mhmm!

388
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,279
Thank you for taking the time

389
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:20,171
to prepare the food.

390
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:21,593
No, I was looking forward to it.

391
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,007
Looks delicious.

392
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,553
Here, ahh...

393
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:26,678
Ahh...

394
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:29,616
Mmm, it's delicious!

395
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,397
Is it delicious? What a relief.

396
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,280
Mmm, this is delicious.

397
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:38,561
Ah.

398
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:40,757
They're a perfect match.

399
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:41,897
I'm so happy.

400
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:43,116
Thank you.

401
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:45,311
It suits Itsuki very well.

402
00:20:45,624 --> 00:20:47,335
It suits Fuyu even more.

403
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:49,186
I bought it because it'd suit Itsuki.

404
00:20:49,225 --> 00:20:50,936
Huh, I'm so glad.

405
00:20:58,155 --> 00:20:59,968
- This one, please.
- This one.

406
00:21:00,022 --> 00:21:02,319
Here you go.

407
00:21:02,772 --> 00:21:03,897
Mhmm!

408
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:07,803
Which one?

409
00:21:09,374 --> 00:21:10,435
- This one.
- This one?

410
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,671
- Mhmm.
- Sure.

411
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:13,132
Here.

412
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:14,866
Ahh...

413
00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:18,154
I'm full.

414
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:19,397
Are you full?

415
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:21,725
- Wow, you ate a lot.
- Mhmm.

416
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:20,402
- I'll be right back.
- Mhmm.

417
00:22:31,161 --> 00:22:32,356
Itsuki.

418
00:22:32,473 --> 00:22:34,551
Hide. My mom is here.

419
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:35,880
Huh?

420
00:23:45,036 --> 00:23:45,520
(Next Episode)

421
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,948
(Separated by class again)
We are not your dolls, mother.

422
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,442
No matter how noble your family is,

423
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,536
stop dragging my Itsuki into this.

424
00:23:51,645 --> 00:23:55,121
Being with Itsuki makes me feel happy.

425
00:23:55,145 --> 00:23:56,380
It feels good.

426
00:23:56,531 --> 00:23:57,945
Whether it's normal or not,

427
00:23:57,961 --> 00:23:59,140
decide for yourself.
