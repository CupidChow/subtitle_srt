1
00:00:01,156 --> 00:00:03,383
Thank you for saying it.

"CHASER GAME W2: Celestial Love"
(Episode 5)

3
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:06,891
I don't know.

4
00:00:08,992 --> 00:00:11,125
But it doesn't matter anymore.

5
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:13,539
I...

6
00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:17,055
I'm living my life with you,

7
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:20,195
therefore,

8
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:23,023
I've said that I'd cut ties.

9
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:27,727
Fuyu…

10
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:32,393
Itsuki.

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,760
Please say you love me again.

12
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:43,776
Fuyu,

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,378
I love you.

14
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,330
Yeah.

15
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:00,597
Can I ask you something?

16
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:05,395
Yeah.

17
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,987
Where

18
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:09,673
were you last night?

19
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:15,659
I heard you didn't stay at the shop

20
00:01:16,386 --> 00:01:18,276
or your place.

21
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:35,487
You didn't stay with Yoreum, did you?

22
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:41,056
Yeah.

23
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,167
But in separate rooms, right?

24
00:01:52,143 --> 00:01:53,534
Did you...

25
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:57,214
sleep in the same room?

26
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,167
We did.

27
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,581
But nothing happened.

28
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,831
At least, I think so.

29
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,776
"You think?"

30
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:22,667
I drank too much that night...

31
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:30,979
While I was struggling about us,

32
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:32,937
you were drinking with her?

33
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,300
I'm sorry!

34
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:37,852
But...

35
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,392
You weren't answering your phone

36
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:42,511
or my messages.

37
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:44,440
It was just one day.

38
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:48,018
When I thought that

39
00:02:48,026 --> 00:02:49,706
you went back to China,

40
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,714
I was terrified.

41
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:53,916
I thought our relationship

42
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,141
was impossible.

43
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,362
But still…

44
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:09,917
I want to be alone for a while.

45
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:34,542
Hello.

46
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,683
Yes. That's right.

47
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:43,339
Huh?

48
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,112
I'll be there right away!

49
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:50,259
(Where are you, Itsuki? Let's meet.
Please answer me.)

50
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:07,132
(Itsuki, I'm sorry)

51
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,211
Itsuki.

52
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:16,476
Itsuki!

53
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:18,593
Itsuki!

54
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:22,273
She's not here.

55
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:23,797
She was here, wasn't she?

56
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:29,608
Did you two fight?

57
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:31,313
Was it because of me?

58
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,578
It's none of your business.

59
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,047
I'll tell you something interesting.

60
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,265
Interesting?

61
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:49,609
I'm going to propose to Itsuki.

62
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:51,015
Huh?

63
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:53,171
We're going to Sweden

64
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,726
to get married.

65
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:56,820
And we'll live happily ever after.

66
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,662
Huh?

67
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:10,812
I've done my research.

68
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:12,398
Your father is in a crucial

69
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:13,561
position right now.

70
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:15,687
If people find out his daughter is gay,

71
00:05:15,703 --> 00:05:18,226
it's game over for him.

72
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:21,607
I'm no longer a part

73
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:23,412
of the Hayashi family.

74
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:26,461
What do you mean?

75
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:38,273
I love Itsuki.

76
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:41,300
So I'll live my life with Itsuki.

77
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:43,847
I told my mother that.

78
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:46,401
I've cut ties with my family,

79
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:49,089
and I'm not going back to China.

80
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:50,511
Are you sure?

81
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:52,331
Yes.

82
00:05:57,151 --> 00:05:58,534
Then that means we have

83
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,041
to compete equally, right?

84
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:03,276
(Soju)

85
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,823
Excuse me.

86
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,487
I've been in love with

87
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,112
Itsuki for 12 years.

88
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:26,698
Itsuki is my first and last love.

89
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:29,712
I'll make sure

90
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:30,838
Itsuki never has to suffer

91
00:06:30,863 --> 00:06:32,863
no more, poverty or hardship.

92
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:36,244
Money has nothing to do with it.

93
00:06:36,502 --> 00:06:38,103
Itsuki and I have pledged our love

94
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:39,525
to each other countless times.

95
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:41,494
Our life together is just beginning.

96
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:44,470
So it hasn't started yet?

97
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,479
That means I still have a chance.

98
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:48,619
I'm sorry, but you don't.

99
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:50,354
I've decided to stay with Itsuki,

100
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,525
even when we're both old and gray.

101
00:06:52,549 --> 00:06:53,557
Impossible.

102
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:55,237
You're only good at making her anxious.

103
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:56,314
I won't do that anymore.

104
00:06:56,314 --> 00:06:58,088
Because I love seeing her smile.

105
00:06:58,096 --> 00:06:59,987
I also love Itsuki's smile too.

106
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,612
I love everything about her.

107
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:03,362
I love even her flaws.

108
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,744
How clumsy and needy she is.

109
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,135
I love everything about her too.

110
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:07,228
I love how indecisive,

111
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:08,939
overly accommodating, and naive she is.

112
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:11,268
I'll protect all of her.

113
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:12,682
Even now, I want to see her.

114
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,807
I can't stand being apart

115
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:15,041
for even one more second.

116
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:16,642
If the amount of soju I drink

117
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:18,323
represents my love for Itsuki,

118
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:21,924
I'll drink every bottle in the world.

119
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:34,315
Not bad for a sheltered rich girl.

120
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,752
You too.

121
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:38,338
Just a YouTuber who just

122
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:40,306
goes about her day but is courageous.

123
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,994
Sorry for not getting back to you.

124
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:54,010
I have been at the hospital

125
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:54,892
in my hometown since morning.

126
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:56,011
The doctor is still examining.

127
00:07:56,463 --> 00:07:57,385
Huh?

128
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,791
Itsuki is at the hospital?

129
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:09,924
Where are you going?

130
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:13,658
(Shizuoka Prefecture, Ito City)

131
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,174
Itsuki!

132
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:19,807
Are you okay?

133
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,041
Fuyu!

134
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:23,080
I heard you were in the hospital!

135
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,268
It's not me, it's my grandmother.

136
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:26,814
She had a fall and hurt herself,

137
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:27,977
so she's been admitted.

138
00:08:28,002 --> 00:08:30,353
Oh, is that so?

139
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:32,401
Grandma.

140
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:33,557
Yoreum!

141
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:34,541
Oww...

142
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:35,916
Are you alright?

143
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:40,268
Annyeonghaseyo.

144
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,479
Are you living in Japan now?

145
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:44,338
No, I'm just visiting.

146
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,299
I missed you, grandma.

147
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:50,574
Yoreum!

148
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:52,315
You've grown into

149
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,174
such a beautiful woman.

150
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:56,277
Thank you.

151
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,941
And who might this young lady be?

152
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:02,558
Ah.

153
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,074
I'm Hayashi Fuyu.

154
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:10,332
"Fuyu is a friend from university.

155
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:12,449
We've been close for a long time.

156
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,683
Yes.

157
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:16,761
It's nice to meet you.

158
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:20,073
How's your injury?

159
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,502
We just got the results.

160
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:22,940
They said it was nothing serious.

161
00:09:22,964 --> 00:09:24,386
I'm so relieved.

162
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:27,394
By the way,

163
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:31,831
how did you two end up here together?

164
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:34,159
Oh.

165
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,222
It's a long story.

166
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,230
Thanks for coming.

167
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:45,925
Are you okay, grandma?

168
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:48,644
My back still hurts a little bit.

169
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:51,652
Since you're all here,

170
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:53,394
why don't you show them around, Itsuki?

171
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:55,464
There's not much to see in this town.

172
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,784
It's been a while since

173
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,276
Yoreum visited, hasn't it?

174
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,597
Yeah, I'd like to see the school.

175
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:02,761
That's a great idea!

176
00:10:03,456 --> 00:10:06,277
You can take the bikes.

177
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:10,003
Let's ride!

178
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:11,909
Go ahead.

179
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,261
What's wrong?

180
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:18,964
Be careful not to fall.

181
00:10:20,113 --> 00:10:21,566
Don't worry about it.

182
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:37,636
Are you okay?

183
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,354
Yeah. I think I'll manage.

184
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,409
Thanks again for coming all this way.

185
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,667
Of course.

186
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:49,425
I was really worried.

187
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:54,183
Fuyu.

188
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:56,425
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,784
Yeah. I'm sorry too.

190
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:08,595
- Be careful.
- Huh?

191
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:11,072
Ah, are you okay?

192
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:16,290
Finally.

193
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:20,001
I missed it.

194
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,051
Right?

195
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,886
This is the high school

196
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,510
you went to, Itsuki?

197
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,144
Yes.

198
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,082
Let's go in.

199
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,293
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

200
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,933
The field is over here.

201
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:34,136
- Ah.
- Are you okay?

202
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:35,965
It's still the same.

203
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:37,565
Speaking of which, Itsuki was in the

204
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:38,722
track and field club, right?

205
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:39,573
That's right.

206
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:40,761
I came here to run every day.

207
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:42,543
I run super fast.

208
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:44,105
Huh? Really?

209
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:44,746
Yeah.

210
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:46,043
Wow, I miss it so much.

211
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,152
- Wow.
- Wow.

212
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,597
- A swimming pool.
- A swimming pool.

213
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:52,691
Amazing.

214
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:54,996
Yeah, it's summer already.

215
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,136
It feels good.

216
00:11:58,761 --> 00:11:59,910
Right!

217
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,456
It's great, right?

218
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:04,488
Feels good.

219
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,238
- My legs feel cool.
- Right?

220
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:07,832
- Be careful.
- Mhm.

221
00:12:10,185 --> 00:12:11,818
Wait! Be careful...

222
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:15,950
Itsuki! Sorry! Are you alright!?

223
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:18,951
- Are you okay?
- Hey!

224
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,818
Ah, but it's so comfortable.

225
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,451
Both of you come down too.

226
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,060
Eh, no way.

227
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,146
But I fell down because of Fuyu.

228
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:30,567
Come on, I'll help you.

229
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:31,278
Huh?

230
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,919
- Fine.
- Yeah.

231
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:35,329
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

232
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,168
Are you okay?

233
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:43,817
You tricked me!

234
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,653
Are you okay?

235
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:21,701
Where's the other one?

236
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,248
In the shower.

237
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:25,959
She takes forever.

238
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:31,975
I lost.

239
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:33,958
Huh?

240
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:36,514
Look.

241
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,678
It's a great picture, isn't it?

242
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:41,529
Yeah.

243
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,342
I'm pretty popular, you know.

244
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,381
I'm a well-known influencer.

245
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:52,514
I know.

246
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:57,526
I should've come back for you

247
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:59,151
before you met her.

248
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:04,613
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:08,441
No,

250
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:11,651
I only have one request.

251
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:15,463
What is it?

252
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,915
Tell your grandmother properly.

253
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:31,121
Yeah.

254
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:42,026
It's done.

255
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:43,885
Thanks.

256
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:48,244
Eat up, Grandma!

257
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:50,034
Kamsahamnida.

258
00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:51,299
No, Grandma,

259
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:54,142
you can just say komawo.

260
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:54,822
Komawo.

261
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:56,704
- Yeah.
- Is that so?

262
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:59,064
When eating, wrap the pork

263
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,423
in lettuce like this.

264
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:02,557
- Yeah.
- Here.

265
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,659
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

266
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:09,666
Yoreum.

267
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,494
Do you have someone

268
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:12,525
special in your life?

269
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:16,104
I got dumped.

270
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,549
Whoever let go of someone as wonderful

271
00:15:20,705 --> 00:15:23,150
as you has no sense.

272
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,409
Right?

273
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:26,448
Thanks, Grandma.

274
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:30,588
Itsuki?

275
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:33,166
And you, Itsuki?

276
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:36,205
If you don't get married soon,

277
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,303
I'm going to have to apologize

278
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:39,648
to your mother.

279
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:46,936
Grandma, actually...

280
00:15:48,554 --> 00:15:50,054
Regarding that...

281
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:53,476
Yes?

282
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:00,444
I

283
00:16:02,515 --> 00:16:03,718
have someone I like.

284
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,187
Really?

285
00:16:06,273 --> 00:16:07,640
Who's the lucky person?

286
00:16:12,273 --> 00:16:13,554
It's Fuyu here.

287
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:15,241
I...

288
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:18,093
I love Fuyu.

289
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,796
Huh?

290
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:27,382
Itsuki?

291
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:34,176
I'm a lesbian, Grandma.

292
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:38,192
I can only love women.

293
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:43,242
I'm sorry if this shocks you.

294
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:45,374
I've been wanting to tell you

295
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,430
for so long,

296
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:49,203
but I was too scared.

297
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:51,577
Had I told you...

298
00:16:53,132 --> 00:16:55,476
it might only make you sad.

299
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:00,538
But I can't lie

300
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:03,476
to you anymore.

301
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,312
Even though I'm a lesbian,

302
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:10,140
But I want you to know

303
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,679
that I'm happy being with Fuyu.

304
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:16,656
And I want you to accept us.

305
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:33,265
If that's the case...

306
00:17:36,695 --> 00:17:39,132
You should've told me sooner, Itsuki.

307
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:42,523
Huh?

308
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:46,660
No matter who you are,

309
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:52,863
you're still my precious granddaughter.

310
00:17:54,144 --> 00:17:55,433
Besides,

311
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:56,879
for me,

312
00:17:57,558 --> 00:17:59,222
what matters to me most

313
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,081
is that you're happy.

314
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,222
I would be the most happy.

315
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:10,277
Grandma...

316
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:15,300
In the past...

317
00:18:17,238 --> 00:18:18,698
When I said I wanted to see

318
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:20,253
my great-grandchild quickly,

319
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:23,542
I didn't realize how much

320
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:25,087
it was hurting you.

321
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:27,746
I'm sorry.

322
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:36,478
Fuyu-san.

323
00:18:41,345 --> 00:18:42,814
Please take good care

324
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:47,415
of Itsuki.

325
00:18:56,774 --> 00:18:57,673
Yes.

326
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:19,172
Alright.

327
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:20,649
It's going to get cold.

328
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:21,837
Let's eat up, everyone!

329
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:22,945
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

330
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,876
I'll wrap it up for you, Grandma.

331
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:26,282
Oh!

332
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:28,071
Koma...

333
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:28,774
Komawo.

334
00:19:28,797 --> 00:19:29,485
Komawo.

335
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,712
Yoreum-san.

336
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:07,609
Did I wake you? Sorry.

337
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:09,626
No,

338
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:12,156
I had a feeling you'd try

339
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:13,845
to sneak out quietly.

340
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,641
I've got to get back to YouTube.

341
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:21,266
I'll look forward to it.

342
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:22,571
Yeah.

343
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:32,087
Don't worry, nothing happened.

344
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,047
But Itsuki talks in her sleep.

345
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:36,016
Kept saying your name over and over.

346
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:37,860
Huh?

347
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:41,337
Bye-bye! Bepeu.

348
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,118
"Bepeu?"

349
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:44,993
It means best friend.

350
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:17,126
You're awake, Itsuki.

351
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:19,047
Yeah.

352
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:21,180
Yoreum

353
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:22,876
is a really great person.

354
00:21:23,641 --> 00:21:26,110
I always admired her.

355
00:21:27,977 --> 00:21:29,024
Yeah.

356
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:32,016
Should we go somewhere together today?

357
00:21:32,243 --> 00:21:33,305
Ah...

358
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:34,672
What about Tsuki-chan?

359
00:21:35,688 --> 00:21:38,094
Kou-san is watching her until tonight.

360
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,047
I see.

361
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:42,094
So, where should we go?

362
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,274
Hmm...

363
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:44,797
How about we both write down

364
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,109
where we want to go?

365
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:47,430
Sounds fun!

366
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:48,743
Is there a paper?

367
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:50,540
Is there any?

368
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:51,712
Hmm...

369
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,922
Found it! Oh, Let's write it here.

370
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:54,774
Yeah.

371
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:55,516
Here.

372
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,610
Thanks.

373
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:59,188
Where should we go?

374
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:02,993
There are so many places, huh?

375
00:22:03,024 --> 00:22:04,712
Right? Where should we go?

376
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:05,626
Ah, I know.

377
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:06,766
- You already chose one?
- Yeah.

378
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:08,305
- You got it?
- Yeah.

379
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:09,102
Oh!

380
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:13,532
Done.

381
00:22:13,563 --> 00:22:14,571
Huh? That's fast.

382
00:22:15,657 --> 00:22:17,188
Count one, two, and show it together.

383
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:19,407
- One, two...
- One, two...

384
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,844
Wow, it's the same place!

385
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:23,305
The same indeed!

386
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,109
I'm glad.

387
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:25,382
Right? I drew Itsuki.

388
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:26,499
Huh?

389
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,837
I only have three hairs.

390
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:28,813
Sorry.

391
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:29,922
Then, shall we go?

392
00:22:29,977 --> 00:22:30,790
Let's get ready.

393
00:22:30,837 --> 00:22:32,992
- Come on, one, two.
- Huh, you're rushing too much.

394
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:34,305
Let's go!

395
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:35,391
Alright, let's go!

396
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:39,422
(University)

397
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:45,914
(Next episode)

398
00:23:45,914 --> 00:23:46,660
Itsuki...

399
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,624
(Rewind to university days)
Since when did you think of me

400
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:50,313
as more than a friend?

401
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:51,578
I like you.

402
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:52,641
What did you say?

403
00:23:53,046 --> 00:23:54,791
(Heading towards a new type of relationship)
I fought through it because

404
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:57,360
Kou-san has been cheering me on.

405
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,585
This time, the three of us

406
00:23:58,602 --> 00:23:59,554
will be together.
