1
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:21,977
Itsuki.

2
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:25,906
Fuyu.

3
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,209
Every morning,

4
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:46,428
as soon as I wake up alone,

5
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:48,647
the pain strikes me.

6
00:00:50,404 --> 00:00:51,092
Amazing!

7
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,412
- I'm glad.
- I'm glad.

8
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:54,122
The days when I laughed with her

9
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:55,592
will never come back again.

10
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:57,764
There will never be those days again.

11
00:00:58,327 --> 00:00:59,764
I just want to say that.

12
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:01,725
Me too.

13
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:19,371
Go on.

14
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:20,748
(One year ago)
Tsuki-chan is waiting for you.

15
00:01:20,756 --> 00:01:21,764
One year ago...

16
00:01:30,518 --> 00:01:31,674
I won't forget.

17
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:34,509
Me neither.

18
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,189
Even though we both decided

19
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:41,347
that separating is the best way...

20
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,783
Hurry up and forget about it.

21
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:51,002
I thought it would be easier.

22
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,940
Next is the number one zodiac.

23
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,729
(There will be a wonderful encounter)
For Scorpio, today, you'll meet

24
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,291
(Lucky item: Black clothes)
someone you've been waiting for.

25
00:01:57,674 --> 00:02:00,330
- The next zodiac...
- I lied.

26
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,275
I take back what I said.

27
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:03,064
For those born under the sign of Cancer,

28
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:04,541
this is a bad omen.

29
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:07,236
Today, be careful about what you do.

30
00:02:08,518 --> 00:02:10,471
- Oh, it's Tennyo Sekai!
- Right!

31
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,447
Amazing!

32
00:02:11,502 --> 00:02:13,901
- Hey, let's take a picture.
- Right, let's take a picture.

33
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:15,783
So amazing!

34
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:16,716
Wow!

35
00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:23,064
Great! Let's take a selfie!

36
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:24,190
(Tennyo Sekai)
Every day,

37
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:25,236
(Tennyo Sekai)
every hour,

38
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:26,283
every minute,

39
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:27,229
every second,

40
00:02:27,306 --> 00:02:28,501
every split second,

41
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:29,939
I'm secretly hoping,

42
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:31,251
somewhere deep down.

43
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:34,541
For example, maybe she'll be

44
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:36,103
just around this corner.

45
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:37,760
Come have some tea with me.

46
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:40,541
- I'd rather not.
- By the way, your skin is super white.

47
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:43,094
- It looks so smooth.
- Sorry. I'm late!

48
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:45,298
Oh, is this your friend? She's so cute.

49
00:02:45,313 --> 00:02:46,580
- Let's have some tea together.
- I'm sorry.

50
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:47,815
I had a fight with my boyfriend.

51
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:49,588
He thought I was meeting another guy.

52
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:51,385
He's a fighter in 'Breaking Down,'

53
00:02:51,393 --> 00:02:53,193
so he's pretty intense.

54
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:55,338
He's not following us, is he?

55
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:57,892
Uh, yeah, I've got something urgent.

56
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:59,174
Hey, what's the urgent matter?

57
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:01,423
Come on, I've got something urgent.

58
00:03:01,462 --> 00:03:02,619
Yes, yes.

59
00:03:05,963 --> 00:03:07,377
Are you okay?

60
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:09,385
Thank you.

61
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:11,088
Ah.

62
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:12,526
So similar.

63
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:14,650
(Ten years ago)
Are you interested in a tennis club?

64
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:16,041
(Ten years ago)
It's okay.

65
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,451
- So cute.
- You're a freshman, right?”

66
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:21,009
Yes.

67
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,322
Have you chosen a club yet?

68
00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:23,135
Not yet.

69
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:24,424
Here, listen to this.

70
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,736
Tell me your contact information.

71
00:03:25,776 --> 00:03:26,541
- Yes, yes.
- Please.

72
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,604
Sorry! I'm late!

73
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:29,845
My boyfriend wouldn't stop

74
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:30,970
telling me not to come.

75
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:32,400
He's a fighter in 'Rizin'

76
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:34,088
and gets pretty intense.

77
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,283
He's not following me, right?

78
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:37,572
Huh?

79
00:03:37,588 --> 00:03:38,876
The other day, he also beat

80
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,798
someone in a fight.

81
00:03:39,822 --> 00:03:41,432
His punches are really heavy.

82
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:42,791
Ah.

83
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,979
That was my meeting with her.

84
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:52,392
Would you like to exchange

85
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,616
LINE contacts?

86
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:55,018
Huh?

87
00:03:55,846 --> 00:03:57,049
Ah...

88
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:58,447
Oh, I...

89
00:03:58,565 --> 00:04:00,752
I'm the manager of that café over there,

90
00:04:00,963 --> 00:04:03,166
so if you'd like, please come by.

91
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,752
Yes, absolutely!

92
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:07,533
(Mellow café)

93
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:08,338
Good morning.

94
00:04:08,354 --> 00:04:10,010
- No way a miracle can happen.
- Good morning.

95
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,432
I know that deep down.

96
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:12,791
Because...

97
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:15,869
She's not in this country anymore.

98
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:19,190
Sorry for the wait.

99
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:20,291
- Strawberry parfait.
- Looks delicious.

100
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:21,369
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

101
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:23,947
Um, could you take a picture for me?

102
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:24,869
Sure.

103
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:26,275
- Thank you.
- Yes.

104
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:28,213
Ready?

105
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:30,268
Alright, cheese.

108
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:38,799
This restaurant is delicious.

109
00:04:39,057 --> 00:04:40,556
- It looks really cute.
- Mhmm.

110
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:42,923
Remove the mint leaf first.

111
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:45,244
The cafe we usually go to.

112
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:47,399
Mmm, it's delicious.

113
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:48,408
- Is it delicious?
- Mmm.

114
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:49,323
I'm relieved.

115
00:04:49,518 --> 00:04:51,056
Do you like this?

116
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,744
Yes, I'm a regular customer.

117
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:55,564
What part do you like to eat?

118
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:56,705
Strawberry.

119
00:04:57,447 --> 00:04:58,752
- Strawberry?
- Yes.

120
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:00,088
Would you like some?

121
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:01,393
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

122
00:05:02,197 --> 00:05:03,267
Ahh...

123
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:06,830
- Is it delicious?
- Yes.

124
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:12,088
Now, I

125
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:14,190
work as a manager at that restaurant.

126
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:16,971
- The more you eat, the more delicious it is.
- Yeah.

right?

140

as you know, the game was a huge hit.

153
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:19,911
It was released by DD Corporation,

154
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:21,911

No, not at all.

173
00:07:00,716 --> 00:07:02,661
Fuyu is 156 cm tall.

174
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:04,599
And she's more cold than tsundere.

175

Plus, her hair looks brown in the light.

176
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:08,997
- Yeah, not similar at all.
- Got it.

177
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:10,567
Regardless,

See you tomorrow. Kamsahamnida.

189
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:34,810
Looks good.

190
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,052
Put it here.

191
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:37,497
Kamsahamnida (Thank you).

192
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,833
Did you get to talk to Harumoto Itsuki?

193
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:46,607
Yes.

194
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:48,848
She has a very beautiful voice.

195
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:52,750
- Hey.
- Is that...

196
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:57,294
Are you by any chance, Yoreum?

197
00:07:58,661 --> 00:07:59,817
Yes, I am.

198
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,364
Your speech at last year's

199
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,098
awards ceremony was so moving.

200
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,021
Kamsahamnida (Thank you).

201
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:17,239
Our recommended menu is this set.

202
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,528
As for the daily menu,

203
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:19,661
it will be pancakes.

204
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:20,614
As for the water,

205
00:08:20,623 --> 00:08:21,810
please feel free to help yourself.

206
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,208
Thank you.

207
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,489
- Allow me. Sorry for making you wait.
- Thank you very much.

208
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:46,888
Make yourself at home.

209
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:16,583
I miss you so much.

210
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,879
Me too.

211
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,153
Long time no see.

212
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,333
Long time no see.

213
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:53,271
Itsuki-chan!

214
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,911
Ah! Tsuki-chan!

215
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:07,841
I'll explain what happened after that.

216
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:15,403
Hey, be careful.

217
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,271
When we returned to China,

218
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:22,935
my mom was waiting for us.

219
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:24,349
She had been in contact

220
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:26,045
with Chief Producer Ro

221
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:27,442
and knew everything that

222
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,147
had happened in Japan.

223
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,114
Quit your job

224
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:35,778
and focus on raising your child.

225
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:45,646
I will quit my job

226
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,161
and focus on raising my child.

227
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:52,317
Good.

228
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:55,107
Hand over your phone.

229
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:56,880
Huh?

230
00:10:57,106 --> 00:10:58,669
You don't need it for raising a child,

231
00:10:58,677 --> 00:10:59,677
do you?

232
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,028
Hand over your phone.

233
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:29,177
I'm home.

234
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:30,989
You're back.

235
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:32,754
Tomorrow, VIPs from

236
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,676
Japan's business world are coming.

237
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:38,144
Kou-san, I'll need you
to act as an interpreter.

238
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,067
Yes.

239
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:41,145
Mhmm.

240
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:44,934
For more than half a year,

241
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,639
this routine continued.

242
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,716
My heart was dead.

243
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:53,833
And then, one day...

244
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,224
Tsuki, do you have that book?

245
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,497
Mhmm.

246
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:03,919
Thank you.

247
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:07,935
Here.

248
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,591
What's this?

249
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,614
(Tangtangtanggo has two fathers)
They had it at kindergarten.

250
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,435
- I see.
- I see.

251
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:19,833
Tangtangtanggo has two fathers?

252
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:21,982
Read it to me.

253
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:23,021
Okay.

254
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,552
But these two penguins

255
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:29,028
look a little strange.

256
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:31,216
Their names are Roy and Silo.

257
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:33,185
They're both boys.

258
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:35,646
And they always like to be together.

259
00:12:37,294 --> 00:12:39,622
After seeing Roy and Silo like that,

260
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,567
Gramsy-san, who was the caretaker,

261
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,943
also noticed that

262
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:46,747
"Those kids must be in love"

263
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,740
When night fell,

264
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,481
Tango and his two fathers

265
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:53,186
went back to the nest.

266
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:55,482
Tango and the others

267
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:57,982
cuddled up close in there

268
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:00,607
and fell asleep soundly.

269
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,466
The end.

270
00:13:05,982 --> 00:13:07,771
This penguin

271
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:09,825
has two dads, right?

272
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:13,614
Yes, that's right.

273
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:19,395
Can boys marry boys too?

274
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:24,430
Usually, boys can't marry boys...

275
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:25,220
Mhmm.

276
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:27,157
If they love each other,

277
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:29,165
in some countries, they can get married.

278
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:31,438
If it's two boys

279
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,906
or two girls,

280
00:13:33,274 --> 00:13:34,243
it doesn't matter.

281
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:36,555
Hmm...

282
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:47,884
I'm home.

283
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,977
Where did you go so late?

284
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:55,972
Let's go to Japan.

285
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:57,649
Huh?

286
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:00,165
I know how you feel.

287
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:06,087
I want to be a father

288
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,415
Tsuki can be proud of.

289
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:10,196
Thank you.

290
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,438
But my mom...

291
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,329
I'll talk to your father

292
00:14:16,798 --> 00:14:18,938
about working in Japan for a while to

293
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:20,899
help him gather more investors.

294
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:36,345
Thank you.

295
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,095
What do you think, Tsuki-chan?

296
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:42,977
Papa and Mama

297
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:45,759
are the best friends,

298
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:48,376
and the one Mama really wants to marry

299
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:50,321
is Itsuki-chan, right?

300
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,060
Today, the two of you should have

301
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:56,443
time to talk at your own pace.

302
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,053
Thank you very much.

303
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:01,998
Thank you.

304
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:03,553
Alright, Tsuki.

305
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:04,771
Let's go and eat.

306
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:06,342
- Yeah.
- What do you want to eat?

307
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:08,068
Hamburger.

308
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,193
Hamburger?

309
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,936
- You've come all the way to Japan.
- Mhm.

310
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:12,037
Sure, let's go eat.

311
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:14,193
- Oh, say bye-bye first.
- Bye-bye.

312
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:15,521
- Bye-bye.
- Have a good trip.

313
00:15:15,553 --> 00:15:17,467
- I'll be going now.
- Thank you very much.

314
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:20,131
Let's go.

315
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:25,530
(Hilton)

316
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,436
You're really here.

317
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,851
Mhm.

318
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:01,763
I felt like if I stayed here,

319
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:03,686
I'd be able to see you again someday.

320
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:07,928
I thought the same thing,

321
00:16:08,404 --> 00:16:11,787
that if I came here, I'd meet you again.

322
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:16,186
Welcome back.

323
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:19,342
Mhm.

324
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:20,428
Oh,

325
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:22,076
- Hmm?
- did you bring me a souvenir?

326
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:23,826
Huh?

327
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,201
A souvenir.

328
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:27,217
Oh.

329
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:29,732
I did.

330
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:30,631
Huh?

331
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:31,818
What is it?

332
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:35,975
It's me.

333
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:38,568
Oh, come on.

334
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:39,951
Too cute.

335
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:41,763
Sorry. How embarrassing.

336
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:43,857
What did you say, geez.

337
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:54,068
Itsuki,

338
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:58,881
please wait just a little longer.

339
00:17:00,068 --> 00:17:02,139
I'll talk to my mom properly.

340
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:07,529
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore.

341
00:17:08,881 --> 00:17:12,170
I want to be honest with everyone,

342
00:17:13,256 --> 00:17:14,123
so please

343
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:18,482
wait a little longer.

344
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:23,115
Got it.

345
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:25,092
I'll wait.

346
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:27,006
Mhm.

347
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:29,670
Honestly,

348
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:32,451
I had already given up.

349
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:34,928
Don't give up.

350
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:36,670
I thought I had given up,

351
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:40,568
but I guess I hadn't.

352
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:43,021
Mhm.

353
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:44,732
Thank you.

354
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:47,975
Likewise.

355
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:56,639
No, you can't.

356
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,045
Huh?

357
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,053
Is this not okay too?

358
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:01,334
Mhmm.

359
00:18:02,811 --> 00:18:05,428
This much is okay.

360
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:07,951
Mhmm.

361
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:10,256
Fuyu.

362
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,264
Hmm?

363
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,256
You've gotten more

364
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:14,740
beautiful since we last met.

365
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:17,982
No, you surprised me.

366
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:19,787
You're the one who's gotten more pretty.

367
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:20,959
No, it was you who

368
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:22,943
became so pretty that I was surprised.

369
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,943
Huh? No, it's you, Itsuki.

370
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,537
No, it's you, Fuyu.

371
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:27,974
Why? I said you're the one

372
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:29,122
who got more pretty.

373
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:30,005
No.

374
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:34,037
Let's just say we both got more pretty.

375
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:35,248
Right.

376
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:55,502
Is this not okay?

377
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:58,603
No.

378
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:00,259
It's fine.

379
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:07,322
Is this not okay?

380
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:09,439
It's fine.

381
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,642
Is this not okay?

382
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:18,978
That's alright.

383
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:28,916
Is this not okay?

384
00:19:29,673 --> 00:19:30,588
No.

385
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:32,697
Sure.

386
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:38,838
Is this not okay?

387
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:42,033
It's fine.

388
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,931
That's out.

389
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:52,064
Right.

390
00:19:54,345 --> 00:19:55,439
I figured.

391
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:56,877
No.

392
00:19:57,181 --> 00:19:58,532
Get a grip.

393
00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:00,119
Mhm. No.

394
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:00,931
- Mhm.
- Mhm.

395
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,353
I almost gave in too.

396
00:20:03,478 --> 00:20:05,291
Mis you.

397
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,103
Ah, I made a mistake.

398
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:08,619
I miss you.

399
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:10,298
What are you saying?

400
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:12,353
Japanese is so difficult.

401
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,759
Have you forgotten?

402
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,892
I guess so.

403
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:16,439
I've forgotten.

404
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,736
I'll teach you next time.

405
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,985
(I'll leave it to you, Itsuki-sensei)

406
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:25,806
Mama.

407
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,041
Smiling all by yourself. It's strange

408
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:31,267
I didn't do that.

409
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:33,588
Can I take Tsuki out tomorrow?

410
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:35,008
Tsuki said she wanted to

411
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:36,212
go see the zoo in Japan.

412
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:39,298
Tsuki wants to see Penguin-san.

413
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:43,806
Don't worry about us.

414
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:47,002
Thank you.

415
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:48,345
Mhm.

416
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:58,173
Good night.

417
00:20:58,181 --> 00:20:58,820
Good night.

418
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,166
- Good night.
- Good night.

419
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:08,720
(Today, the entire shop was
rented for filming)

420
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,399
- Manager.
- Hmm?

421
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,814
I'm also studying Korean these days.

422
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:14,548
Huh?

423
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:16,017
Then maybe I can have you

424
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,540
handle the interview, Hikaru?

425
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:19,205
Ne algesseumnida.

426
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,556
Oh, amazing!

427
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:22,298
- You're reliable.
- I'll do my best.

428
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:23,642
Thanks.

429
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:26,970
Ah.

430
00:21:30,884 --> 00:21:31,743
Annyeonghaseyo.

431
00:21:31,752 --> 00:21:32,541
Annyeonghaseyo.

432
00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:33,845
I'll be in your care.

433
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,548
I'll be in your care.

434
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,611
Can I introduce today's reporter?

435
00:21:37,642 --> 00:21:38,330
Ah.

436
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,619
Of course.

437
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:44,861
Ah!

438
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,204
Itsuki.

439
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:47,994
Huh?

440
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:49,744
I missed you so much!

441
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:52,297
The one who appeared

442
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:56,392
was my first love.

443
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:04,345
Wait, is that Yoreum?

444
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:19,005
Ah.

445
00:22:21,892 --> 00:22:23,416
Looking good.

446
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:26,759
Haa...

447
00:22:27,353 --> 00:22:30,158
I can't wait to see you, Itsuki.

448
00:23:45,111 --> 00:23:45,547
(Next episode)

449
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:47,845
(The arrival of a new love triangle)
I've liked Itsuki since 12 years ago.

450
00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:49,775
Yoreum and I are nothing to each other.

451
00:23:49,806 --> 00:23:51,767
Then why did she hug you?

452
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:53,713
You're making Itsuki heartbroken.

453
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:55,259
Itsuki is pitiful.

454
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:57,344
Fuyu is the only one I like.

455
00:23:58,037 --> 00:23:59,944
(The elevator is stuck again.
This is a fictional work)
