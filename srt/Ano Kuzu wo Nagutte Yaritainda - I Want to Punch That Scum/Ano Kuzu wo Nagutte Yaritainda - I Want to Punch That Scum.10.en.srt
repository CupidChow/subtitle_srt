00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,140
Wait! Mr. Kairi!

185
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,150
Ms. Sato.

186
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,160
Sir.

187
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,850
I'm sorry for the long break.

188
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,680
I...

189
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,550
I want to continue boxing after all.

190
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,060
Yui. Yui!

191
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,540
What?

192
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,070
- Ms. Sato's here.
- What?

193
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,480
Hokomi?

194
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,790
Hokomi!

195
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,490
Thank goodness...

196
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,150
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,790
Although...

198
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,080
Well...

199
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:27,600
There's something I must tell you both.

200
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,130
See...

201
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,700
Whenever I think back to the spar...

202
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,520
I get terrified.

203
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,160
I even flinch whenever someone's hand approaches my face.

204
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,110
What?

205
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,310
I want to overcome this fear.

206
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,240
Please teach me a way.

207
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,380
I want to have a proper match, as soon as possible.

208
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,200
I'll train hard and get back in shape.

209
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,550
Next time, I'll stay on the ring.

210
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,910
Slow down, Hokomi.

211
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,620
You don't need to sweat it.

212
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,000
She's right, Ms. Sato.

213
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,520
I can't book a match immediately.

214
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,750
I know I'm asking the impossible.

215
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,440
But I want to have a match soon.

216
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,270
Otherwise,

217
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,280
it will be too late for that scumbag.

218
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,480
Are you talking about Kairi?

219
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,600
Ms. Sato.

220
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,690
What about Akemi?

221
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,680
What did she say about this?

222
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,830
For Kairi?

223
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,620
Yes. I want him to see how serious I am, in a real match.

224
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,810
You can't honestly mean that, right?

225
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,210
Do you remember what just happened to you?

226
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,800
- We were both so worried-
- Please.

227
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,600
Please, let me do this.

228
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,090
I know I'll cause you both to worry.

229
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:08,080
But I need to do this, now.

230
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,260
Sayami, Mom. Please.

231
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,180
You certainly are my daughter.

232

Once your mind is set, there's no going back.

233

You'll see to it, no matter what.

234
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,770
Mom, I've always hated it.

235
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:47,740
I couldn't stand watching you date scumbag after scumbag.

236
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,780
Even so...

237
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,810
If you fall for someone with all your heart,

238
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,580
it doesn't matter if they're a scumbag.

239
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,420
Exactly.

240
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,360
You're a woman of the Sato family after all.

241
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,780
Now that I'm older...

242
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,020
I'm proud to say I'm your daughter, Mom.

We just need to conquer the left hook.

303
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,510
Mr. Kairi, I have a question for you today.

304
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,680
I watched some of your old tapes and was wondering.

305
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,820
When you were cornered along the ropes by a rush,

306
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,340
you guarded the opponents punch

307
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,080
and proceeded to punch them with that guarding hand.

308
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,340
But if we were to follow Newton's third law of motion,

309
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,950
you would want to toss a punch from the other side. So-

310
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,370

So refreshed.

549
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,530
You can't get enough of this, huh?

550
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,580
Of course not! I love this stuff!

551
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,950
There he goes again.

552
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,540
Can't help it.

553
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,570
What's up, Mimi?

554
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:28,010
"Love, love, I'm in love".

555
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:31,250
Mimi, you have a crush on this, "Eito"?

556
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,220
What's he like?

557
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,410
He's really kind.

558
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:40,080
But he's always charming all the girls.

559
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,630
<i>A scumbag!</i>

560
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:47,700
Daichi, Kairi's doing fine work out here.

561
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,400
Mr. Hanegi.

562
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:57,080
I'm terribly sorry for all the trouble I've caused you.

563
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:02,770
Thank you for never giving up on me.

564
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,880
Of course.

565
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,170
Listen up.

566
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:12,330
You and Daichi will always be my sons, got that?

[Kanato Oba]

571
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:31,270
And since you're joining,

572
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:33,380
why not buy a shirt to boot?

573
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,410
Kanbe, I'll take over.

574
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,360
Thanks.

575
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,440
You can't enroll by jumping like that.

576
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,110
- Actually, I enrolled earlier.
- Not officially.

577
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:48,540
If you can't jump this 500 times in a row in two weeks,
our gym rescinds your enrollment.

578
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,810
You do?

579
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,650
You're so honest, Mr. Oba.

580
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,090
I only want to learn more.

581
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,340
About boxing...

582
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,400
And about you too, Ms. Yui.

583
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,760
What?

584
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,970
500 times, yes?

585
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:13,130
I'll do my best.

[Boxing Photography Exhibition: "Zenshin", by Kairi Kuzuya]

587
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,700
It's so large.

588
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,700
Seeing it so front and center is a bit embarrasing.

589
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,870
You think?

590
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:39,480
But this is my favorite shot.

591
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,510
What? I'm allowed to say that, right?

592
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,590
Let's head out.

593
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:58,060
Hokko, you're cramming in too much practice.

594
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,830
Oh? Did you miss me that much?

595
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,700
Maybe you like boxing more than me.

596
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,560
Don't tease. You know that's not true.

597
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,960
Ouch.

598
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,970
Your punches are too strong.

599
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,620
I went easy on you.
