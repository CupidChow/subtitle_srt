00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,540
<i>Everyone else was moving on, so I tried.</i>

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,260
<i>And yet every time I tried, I got a dose of reality.</i>

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,580
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,570
<i>I will be by your side.</i>

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,880
<i>So, please don't destroy yourself.</i>

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,940
<i>And when you need to move on, despite it all,</i>

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,210
<i>I will give you a solid punch.</i>

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,680
<i>Because I love you.</i>

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,470
What a sleeping beauty.

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,350
Do you think he'll wake up with a kiss?

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,140
What are you doing?

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,800
That's what we'd like to know.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,810
Why is a good man like him sleeping in our bar?

14
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,160
Are we keeping him?

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,590
Don't be ridiculous.

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,840
He got himself dangerously drunk last night.

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,420
I didn't know what to do, when-

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,710
Oh my god!

19
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,150
Where...

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,350
Nori?

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,610
Akemi.

22
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,010
What's going on?

23
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,380
I bumped into Hokomi late last night.

24
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,640
She was in a real bind

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,000
'cause this lad drunk himself to sleep, so I brought him here.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,480
Wait, sleep?

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,230
It's morning already? This is bad.

28
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,950
I've gotta get home, fast.

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,530
Nori, here. Your bag.

30
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,720
Thanks.

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,430
Take care.

32
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,870
Don't trip on your way out.

33
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,590
By the way, wanna know where I found those two?

34
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,030
In front of a love hotel.

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,040
- A love hotel?
- A love hotel?

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,470
- Oops.
- Oh my gosh, a love hotel?

37
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,360
Good job.

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,010
No! No, it's nothing like that at all.

39
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,720
Yes, we went to a hotel. But nothing happened!

40
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,370
Aw, no need to be embarrassed.

41
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,750
Exactly.

42
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,540
I'm not lying.

43
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,010
Nothing happened, really!

44
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,550
- Is he awake?
- He's awake.

45
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,070
- Good morning.
- Morning.

46
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,870
Hello there.

47
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,550
Are you hungover?

48
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,550
I'll go and buy you some turmeric. It works wonders.

49
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,590
- Mom.
- Then I'll go and grab you some clam soup.

50
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,370
I already got the clam soup.

51
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,780
Then I'll start the bath.

52
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,870
Are you all right?

53
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,760
Here.

54
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,620
Drink some soup.

55
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,720
It's filled with clams.

56
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,470
I hear this works like a cure for hangovers.

57
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,100
We only have the instant stuff, though.

58
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,340
I appreciate it.

59
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,560
Thanks.

60
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,520
For yesterday.

61
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,010
So...

62
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,990
Yeah?

63
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,660
What do you say?

64
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,430
I confessed, as you may recall.

65
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,390
So, I would like an answer of sorts.

66
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,580
An answer.

67
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,170
Yes.

68
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,910
Like we could go out, or we don't.

69
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,690
We could go out.

70
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,580
Okay.

71
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,780
Is there any need for that?

72
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,740
I like our relationship now.

73
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,400
Huh?

74
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,080
What?

75
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,920
Is that...

76
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,160
Is that your answer?

77
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,020
Yeah. Why? Is that not allowed?

78
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,630
Do you realize how I felt, when I...

79
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,530
I... You're...

80
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,300
This soup is delicious.

81
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,630
No more soup for you.

You're spirited today.

85
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,760
Looking good, Ms. Sato.

86
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,110
Say, want to try going against someone next weekend?

87
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,920
- What?
- A gym I'm acquainted with reached out,

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,490
and they want to send someone over for away training.

89
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,380
Away training?

90
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,270
They want to spar with someone outside their gym.

91
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,570
It preps them better for an actual match.

92
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,460
Ms. Sato, would you like to try sparring with this individual?

93
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,430
Yes, sir.

94
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,980
Great answer.

95
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,920
I need to punch these feelings out.

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,250
And boxing's the only solution.

97
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,900
I'm ready.

98
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,210
Hokomi.

99
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,570
Yeah?

100
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,960
That's fine, right? I am your personal trainer, after all.

101
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,630
Right.

102
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,110
Yes, it's fine.

103
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,940
So, about this sparring match.

104
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,280
Yes?

105
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,160
Why not invite Kairi to come and watch?

106
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,720
Huh?

107
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,500
Oh, don't mind me.

108
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,130
I'm not trying to make things awkward or anything.

109
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,270
Well...

110
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,680
If that guy decides to drop by again,

111
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,300
I know I'd be happy to see a familiar face.

112
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,720
You're stiff, Miss.

113
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,680
That's what I get for juggling several part-time jobs.

114
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,250
All in a day's hard work.

115
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,370
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

116
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,880
Hokomi, I heard Kairi was here this morning.

117
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,560
I wanted to meet him, too.

118
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,110
Oh...

119
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,750
Is Kairi chasing his dreams or something?

120
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,370
He used to.

121
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,520
But things happened.

122
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,050
So, he's that type.

123
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,350
Mommy sure loves her dream-chasers.

124
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,500
Indie guitarists, rookie actors,

125
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,950
even Daddy was an unsuccessful comedian.

126
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,830
Then he made it big and two-timed you.

127
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,030
You don't need to bring that up again.

128
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,280
Why not?

129
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,770
Anyway, how'd it go with Kairi?

130
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,910
Nothing happened.

131
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,430
Why are you so mad?

132
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,040
He said we had no reason to date each other.

133
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,510
What?

134
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,770
It's okay, I have boxing to worry about.

135
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,790
I'll go and take a bath.

136
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,270
Sure.

137
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,820
Feeling less hungover?

138
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,310
Yeah.

139
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,320

00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,500
You dog.

141
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,420
What happened with Ms. Hokomi after we left you?

142
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,740
Nothing.

143
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,580
Nothing at all.

148
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,890
Well, we went to a hotel...

Seriously?

150
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,150
Nothing happened though.

151
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,360
We aren't in a relationship, after all.

152
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,240
But let's talk this out over lunch.

153
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,780

154
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,760
Oh, okay.

155
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,020
Give me the full details later.

156
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,490
Mr. Oba.

157
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,020
- Mind if I take this seat?
- Go ahead.

158
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,940
You're not eating with Sato today?

159
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,210
I think Hokomi's lost in her own happiness right about now.

160
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,670
Seems like there was development between her and Mr. Kuzuya.

161
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,530
Development?

162
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,520
Oh my gosh, don't make me say more.

163
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,510
It's too embarrassing.

164
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,730

I heard you told my sister there was no reason for you two to go out.

177
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,280
Could I ask what that means?

178
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,790
It means I want us to maintain our status quo, that's all.

So, you are one of them.

180

You certainly look the part.

181

Listen. Unlike me, Hokomi's an earnest girl.

182
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,420
If you're only playing around with her, I want you to quit it.

183
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,730
I know I'm being a hypocrite for saying this,

184

Please take my sister's feelings seriously.

186
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,770
See you.

187
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,700
Yum.

188
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,740
I see you have a sweet tooth.

189
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,490
I do. But it's hard to order these things alone as a guy.

190
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,000
Kairi never joins me either.

191
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,770
So, feel free to hit me up any time.

192
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,450
Mr. Kuzuya has no interest in dating Hokomi, does he?

193
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,670
He hasn't told me anything.

194
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,960
Ah, well. I told Mr. Oba they were getting it on anyway.

195
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,080
I guess that's more than enough.

196
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,740
You really shouldn't sabotage Ms. Hokomi's love life.

197
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,480
What's your plan if she actually ends up with Kairi?

198
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,210
That would leave me equally as miffed.

199
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,300
You'd get Kairi involved in your mess.

200
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,800
Aw, don't be like that, Satoru.

201
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,170
Be on my side, okay?

202
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,890
I want to stay good friends with you, Ms. Nade.

203
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,860
Bummer.

204
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,680
Let's go and grab some parfaits together next time.

205
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,450
- Fine.
- Cool.

206
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,340
- I'm taking a strawberry.
- Hey.

207
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,510
Not cool.

208
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,840
Welcome. Here are your towels.

209
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,630
Call us to order.

210
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,390
What was it you wanted to discuss?

211
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:07,070
I actually have a job I'd like to extend to you personally.

212
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:12,110
My friend's looking for a photographer, and I'm wondering if I could refer you to him?

213
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,020
I would greatly appreciate it. But why?

214
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,460
I told you, didn't I?

215
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,070
I'm a big fan of your work.

216
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,670
You'd be taking photos for an elementary school basketball game.

217
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,640
Does that work for you?

218
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,480
Yes. I'd love to take the job.

219
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,820
Thank goodness.

220
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,710
I'll send you the details another day.

221
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,660
Thank you.

222
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,700
And one more thing.

223
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,140
I wanted to ask about you and Sato.

224
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,220
Are you going out with her?

225
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,630
What?

226
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,880
No, we are not.

227
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,000
Sato is a very important junior of mine.

228
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,660
If you make her cry, I won't forgive you.

229
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,570
Wasn't that smooth?

230
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,110
This is where you're supposed to laugh.

231
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,140
It's getting toasty in here.

232
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,590
Did you want a beer?

233
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,070
Yes, please.

234
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,840
Excuse me.

235
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,380
<i>[Hokomi Sato]</i>

236
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,960
- I'm ready for drills.
- Great.

237
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,650
- Welcome.
- Hey there.

238
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,280
Don't let it get to you, yeah?

239
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,450
You were a bit restless throughout it.

240
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,920
Will you be taking the next one?

241
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,420
I'll think about it.

242
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,120
Sure. Let's talk about it.

243
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,910
Ms. Yui.

244
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,040
What happened to Mr. Kuroki?

245
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,730
He wasn't able to pass the official exam to go pro.

246
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,780
Is acquiring a professional license difficult?

247
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,740
What?

248
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,360
I mean, I don't wish to apply. I was simply curious.

249
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,420
If we were to get you on track for the exam,

250
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:36,950
we'd have to double your training, and keep at it for at least half a year.

251
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,360
Sounds tough...

252
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,370
It's not easy going pro.

253
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,610
Again.

254
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,610
- Only the folks who are serious about boxing take the exam.
- Again.

255
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,250
Give me your best shot.

256
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,910
Again.

257
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,850
Makes sense.

258
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,500
Great job.

259
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,640
So, what'd he say?

260
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,450
- Huh?
- Kairi.

261
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,160
Is he coming to watch?

262
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,570
No. I'm sorry.

263
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,170
Did he turn you down?

264
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,200
It's fine, though.

265
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,950
Wait, did something happen?

266
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,980
Hokomi, I'm your personal trainer.

267
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,820
If something's on your mind, hit me with it.

268
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:29,410
So... I confessed to him.

269
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,340
But he said we had no reason to date each other.

270
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,040
- Say what?
- Woah.

271
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,140
That dirtbag.

272
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,850
- Ms. Yui, calm down.
- If I'm a demon, I'll show him hell.

273
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,160
I'll make him do 100 sit-ups, 100 push-ups, and 100 squats.

274
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,020
I'll also make him do 100... 500? No, a thousand jump rope reps.

275
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,630
- Ms. Yui...
- What?

276
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,010
Nothing.

277
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,700
What?

278
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,170
It's fine.

279
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,420
Don't bother.

280
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,810
I feel better already.

281
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:12,100
I'll do my best at the sparring match.

282
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,670
Please run me through my drills.

283
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,830
What're you taking pictures of?

284
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,710
- Let me see.
- I wanna see, too!

285
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,350
Woah!

286
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,950
Did you play basketball?

287
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,940
Not basketball.

288
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,140
But I have dabbled in other sports.

289
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,550
Makes sense.

290
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,370
I had a feeling you might have.

291
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,130
Say, do you know Shutaro Asakura, the sports photographer?

292
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,680
I've heard the name. Why?

293
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,740
Mr. Asakura was looking for photographers who could become his assistant.

294
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,090
Would you be interested in the opportunity, Mr. Kuzuya?

295
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:13,350
<i>[Shutaro Asakura Photography Studio]</i>

296
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,820
- Mr. Kuzuya?
- Yes, ma'am.

297
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,270
Welcome. Please, come on in.

298
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,640
Our staff will be with you shortly.

299
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,640
Thank you.

300
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,170
Do you feel drawn to that photo?

301
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,650
These are nice shots.

302
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,820
But that's all they are.

303
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,790
What?

304
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,260
Your photos do not capture your subjects.

305
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,160
They do not consider how your subjects move or feel.

306
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,540
You must face your subjects with your whole self.

307
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,220
Don't run from them.

308
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,710
If that's impossible for you, then I can't hire you.

309
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,650
My name is Miya Sakamoto. I look forward to our spar today.

310
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,740
Hokomi Sato. The pleasure is mine.

311
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,630
Now, shake hands.

312
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,550
Here's to a good match.

313
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,440
Likewise.

314
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,120
She's much larger than I am.

315
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:53,700
Practice spars aren't always with people in your weight class.

316
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,230
It's not rare for the other gyms to send someone much larger.

317
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,330
I see.

318
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,990
Want to call the sparring off?

319
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,350
No.

320
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,980
I'll do this.

321
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,640
Good.

322
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,260
Use your legs and keep your guard up.

323
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,320
Don't forget your drills.

324
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,430
Yes, ma'am.

325
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,910
All right, go for it.

326
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,600
<i>Yikes!</i>

327
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,820
<i>What do I do again? Erm...</i>

328
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,770
<i>Again.</i>

329
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,320
<i>I want to get a good punch in.</i>

330
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,400
<i>Just like I practiced.</i>

331
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,570
Hokomi!

332
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,750
I'm sorry.

333
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,200
I was no match for her.

334
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,120
Where did I go wrong?

335
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,340
- I know I can do better.
- You're boxing like a perfectionist.

336
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,190
Close the gap and move forward, even if you get hit.

337
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,920
Don't run away.

338
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,900
Ms. Sato.

339
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,520
This is where the real fight begins.

343

Yes, sir. I'll be there.

Good afternoon.

Please wait until we call for you.

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,580
Excuse me.

347
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,390
You're Mr. Oba, from City Hall, yes?

348
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,670
And you're Ms. Yui, from Hanegi Gym.

349
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,400
Thank you again for assisting our event.

350
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,380
It was my pleasure.

351
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,660
Is that...

352
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,730
Oh, this?

353
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,000
I bought it at the bookstore just now.

354
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,750
As a trainer, I want to be there for my athletes in their personal lives as well.

355
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,130
Hence the romance advice book.

356
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,350
Yeah.

357
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,970
That's not a book of advice though.

358
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,190
It's not?

359
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,770
The author, Stendhal, wrote about his experiences with unrequited love,

360
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,210
and analyzes the sorts of emotions people go through

361
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,470
when experiencing love.

362
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,450
Why would he write about that?

363
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,460
Great question.

364
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,100
Perhaps he excelled at coming to logical conclusions,

365
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,190
but struggled when it came to the actual act of love.

366
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,570
His love was always to be unrequited,

367
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,390
because he lacked the courage to take initiative.

368
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,310
Is there something on your mind?

369
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:33,230
- Huh?
- You were sighing pretty heavily earlier.

370
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,510
You saw that? How embarrassing.

371
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,570
My boss asked me to do something I'm not great at.

372
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,070
The pressure of succeeding has been really weighing on me.

373
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,680
If I were in your shoes,

374
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,850
I'd destress by pummeling a sandbag.

375
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,000
I admire that.

376
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,960
Your stance is a bit off.

377
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,210
Right goes to the jaw, left goes out front.

378
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,880
- My right goes to the jaw?
- Yes.

379
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,340
So, it's like this.

380
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,340
You're still a bit off.

381
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,150
Raise your right fist a bit higher.

382
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,870
And your left fist goes a bit more forward... Exactly.

383
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,720
Now harden your expression.

384
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,450
- Harden?
- Tuck in your jaw.

385
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,260
Perfect. Looking great.

386
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,520
Thank you.

387
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,960
An acquaintance of yours?

388
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,030
I have no clue who that was.

389
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,800
I'm full already?

390
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,670
My appetite gets smaller by the year.

391
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,280
Everything okay?

392
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,730
She lost badly at a practice match.

393
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,890
Oh my.

394
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,640
Is that all?

395
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,020
Why not just call it quits?

396
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,130
I don't see what boxing will ultimately achieve.

397
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:58,660
Mommy, it's not like Hokomi is going pro.

398
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,310
Right?

399
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,650
I think I've had enough dinner.

400
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,960
Me, too.

401
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,670
- Mimi, don't forget your homework.
- Okay.

402
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,860
I'll be heading to the bar downstairs.

403
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,620
Sure.

404
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,810
I'm done with dinner, too.

405
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,710
- Here, I'll grab your plates, Mimi.
- Thanks.

406
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,530
- This.
- Okay.

407
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,890
Has Kairi gone to see you since then?

408
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,320
Huh?

409
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,810
I guess not.

410
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,880
Not that I'm surprised.

411
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,160
What?

412
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,310
You began boxing because of Kairi, right?

413
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,660
That's why I'm saying you should quit.

414
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,480
My ex-husband said the same things as Kairi, you know.

415
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,330
"What's the point in dating?"

416
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,210
"Do we need to get married?"

417
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,160
But I stayed because I loved him,

418
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,250
and even forced him into marriage when we had Mimi.

419
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,740
Except, he never changed.

420
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,610
Scumbags are scumbags for life.

421
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,150
It's not too late for you to back out, Hokomi.

422
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,170
<i>You must face your subjects with your whole self.</i>

423
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,870
<i>Don't run from them.</i>

424
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,390
Woah.

425
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,040
Are you all right?

426
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,960
Yes, thank you.

427
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,520
Mr. Kuzuya?

428
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,730
Sorry, you've caught me at a bad time.

429
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,820
Are you unable to ride a bicycle?

430
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,300
Unfortunately, yes.

431
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,290
The mayor has asked me to attend an SDG's event with him,

432
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,570
which we are to oversee on bike.

433
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,040
Are you practicing on your own?

434
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,530
Yes, albeit unsuccessfully.

435
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,170
- I'll hold you steady.
- No, it's fine...

436
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,240
- Just face forward.
- Right.

437
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,800
- Peddle before you lose your balance.
- Okay.

438
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,980
- Keep peddling.
- Sure.

439
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,440
- Don't get stiff.
- Don't get stiff. Got it.

440
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,200
- Now peddle slowly.
- Right.

441
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,560
I think I'm getting it.

442
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,890
You are.

443
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,700
- Remember to relax.
- Right, relax.

444
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,310
So speedy!

445
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,440
- Go at your own pace.
- Right.

446
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,680
I think I've almost got the hang of this.

447
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,710
Almost.

448
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,440
Please don't let go just yet.

449
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,460
You've already got it.

450
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,460
You're right! I have! Woah!

451
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,600
How do I stop?

452
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,760
It only took 31 years, but I can finally bike.

453
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,570
- You're 31?
- Yes.

454
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,220
So am I.

455
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,920
Wait, we're the same age?

456
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,140
- You don't look it.
- Neither do you.

457
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,250
I owe this success to you, Mr. Kuzuya.

458
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,230
It's the least I could do for you since you introduced me to a job.

459
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,100
My friend said your pictures from the match were great.

460
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:13,020
I actually used to play for that team when I was younger, too.

461
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:19,610
Back then, my dream was to become Japan's star basketball player.

462
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,120
But plenty of guys were better than me.

463
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,310
I realized I couldn't hold a torch against them.

464
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,480
So, I wracked my brain thinking about what I could do,

465
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,400
and decided to focus on studying, before choosing a career.

466
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,200
Say, what inspired you to become a photographer?

467
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,570
I was talked into it by an acquaintance, that's all.

468
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,340
But why have you kept up with it?

469
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,470
I wonder.

470
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,490
Still, I've come to appreciate photos over time.

471
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,580
I like seeing people happy and smiling.

472
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,830
It's nice to see people enjoy my pictures, as well.

473
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,830
And because photography has so many specific techniques,

474
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,380
it makes overcoming those seemingly impossible challenges all the more fun.

475
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,130
You must really like it.

476
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,710
- Huh?
- Taking photos.

477
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:22,760
I'm also glad I landed the job I work now.

478
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,530
Although it's not the dream I was chasing,

479
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:31,130
it's where I've settled on because of my failures. Funny, right?

480
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,920
I thought you'd be here.

481
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,410
Hokko.

482
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:01,270
- Earth to Hokko.
- Can't you see?

483
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,680
I'm ignoring you.

484
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,720
How did your sparring match go?

485
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,040
I lost terribly. Anything else?

486
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,130
Then please leave me be.

487
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,830
I lost, too.

488
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,990
Huh?

489
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,860
I was told my pictures didn't truly capture my subjects.

490
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:28,040
What? Who said that?

491
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,600
So, you'll get mad for me.

492
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,100
No, I mean...

493
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,200
It's fine. I agree with them.

494
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,830
In comparison, this person's photographs were amazing.

495
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,910
I was floored.

496
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,090
If you lost, why are you still practicing?

497
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,650
At first, I was depressed.

498
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,340
I wasn't mentally prepared to fight in the slightest.

499
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:01,000
I even questioned if I was allowed to continue boxing as is.

500
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:07,110
But I thought long and hard about everything.

501
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,370
And I came to a decision.

502
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,100
I can't let things end like this.

503
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:24,120
I asked Mr. Hanegi to book a rematch next Saturday.

504
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,380
You're strong, Hokko.

505
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,190
I'm persistent.

506
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:48,000
But I've become more persistent, no thanks to you.

507
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,360
I decided to pick up boxing

508
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,990
all to give you a good punch.

509
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,450
But now...

510
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,360
Now, I genuinely enjoy boxing.

511
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:12,080
I want to get better.

512
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,010
I want to get stronger.

513
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,050
You must really like it.

514
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,090
- Huh?
- Boxing.

515
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,800
Yes, I do.

516
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,300
I don't want to run from it any more.

517
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,910
My first mistake was trying to box perfectly

518
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:42,960
as a complete beginner.

519
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,740
What I should really focus on is stepping forward,

520
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,680
no matter how ugly it gets.

521
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,730
I shouldn't run from facing my opponent head-on.

522
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,790
That's the conclusion I came to.

523
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,020
Don't run away, huh?

524
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,160
Hokko.

525
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:38,680
Wha- Hey! What now?

526
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,570
I have a theory.

527
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,380
One-two.

528
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:56,240
One-two, hook.

529
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,500
Give me four.

530
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,390
A dodge and upper.

531
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,870
That was great!

532
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:07,100
That uppercut would be especially deadly during your spar.

533
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,620
- You think so?
- Yeah.

534
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:14,620
Sometimes righties like you have an easier time with a leftie's stance.

535
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,100
How'd you figure that out?

536
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,670
Huh?

537
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,280
Was it Kairi?

538
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,390
All right, let's cram all we can before your spar.

539
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,810
Yes, ma'am.

540
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,300
Kairi, your noodles will get soggy.

541
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,040
Give me another minute.

542
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,260
You're all about photography lately.

543
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,480
What about your gig at the bar?

544
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,160
I quit.

545
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,580
And what about your girls?

546
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,830
I broke up with them.

547
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,660
- All of them?
- Yeah.

548
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,450
I'm surprised that worked out.

549
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,650
Yeah, I managed.

550
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,730
However,

551
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,030
are you going to be able to make a living?

552
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,960
That might start affecting you too, Satoru. My bad.

553
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,950
Why the sudden change of heart?

554
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,410
What was wrong with the status quo?

555
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:23,240
It's not something I can maintain anymore.

556
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,220
I want to make photography my career.

557
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,490
I want to get better at it.

558
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:46,970
I'm heading out. Sorry about my noodles.

559
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:03,400
An action shot of Minagawa?

560
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,280
Yes, I have one here. I'll send it over right away.

561
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,320
Nice punch.

562
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,330
All right.

563
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,150
Daichi,

564
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,370
I work as a photographer now.

565
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,070
Although I didn't start the job for any special reason,

566
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,360
taking photos has become a passion of mine.

567
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,230
I met someone who takes the most awe-inspiring pictures.

568
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,570
I felt as floored as the first time I saw you box.

569
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,610
It made me want to take photos like that, too.

570
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,240
Daichi,

571
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
I've decided to move on.

572
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,590
I've chosen to go and live my own life.

573
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,400
I...

574
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,330
I won't run any longer.

575
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,660
Your opponent won't be used to a lefty's stance.

576
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,980
Once you step in, hit her with that uppercut.

577
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,430
Yes, sir.

578
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,010
All right. Good luck.

579
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,710
Give her all you've got, yeah?

580
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,360
Looks good.

581
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,140
Go, go.

582
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,480
Good going.

583
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,790
Yes, yes.

584
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,310
Forward, forward.

585
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,560

587
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,270
Hokko, get up.

♫ <i>"Let's kiss so hard that it hurts"</i> ♫

589
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,720
The match only starts once you feel cornered.

590
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,420
Now, it's a match against yourself.

591
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:31,170
♫ <i>With a special way of loving

<i>Forward, forward.</i>

594
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,000
Yes, you're doing great, Hokko.

595
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,990
Go.

596
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,980
Your counterattack after you scored that down was amazing.

597
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,510
Thank you.

598
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:19,970
Your down on the first round was unfortunate, though.

599
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:22,910
You fell because your punches threw you off balance.

600
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,550
But your legs were moving in the second round,

601
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,420
and your punches felt sharper, more frequent.

602
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,630
You won, fair and square.

603
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,170
Yes, sir.

604
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,000
- Kairi, I'll leave the rest of her check-up to you.
- Huh?

605
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,460
We have to walk the opponents out.

606
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,420
Remember?

607
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,730
Ah, right.

608
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,760
Let me see your hand.

609
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,580
Okay.

610
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:13,270
You were awesome up there.

611
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,450
Huh?

612
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:21,910
You look nothing like when you first began boxing.

613
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:26,220
Your expression, movements, muscles, everything has changed.

614
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,220
You've worked hard.

615
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,910
I...

616
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,120
I've decided to take the professional exam.

617
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:51,540
I know it's no easy task.

618
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:56,020
I know I'll have to train twice as hard as I do.

619
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,640
Even so...

620
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,220
It's something I want to aim for.

621
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,430
I'm going through something similar.

622
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:18,180
I've decided to pursue photography as a serious career.

623
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,810
I want to get better at it.

624
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,860
I know it won't be easy.

625
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,520
I know I'll have to put in twice the effort, if not more.

626
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,770
But I want to give it a shot.

627
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,860
You're seriously amazing, Hokko.

628
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,190
You're always making me have these revelations about myself.

629
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,990
You know...

630
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:53,670
I wasn't sure if going out normally would be any good.

631
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,850
Romance eventually comes to an end.

632
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:00,500
And...

633
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,910
I wanted to stay like this with you, forever.

634
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,920
But now...

635
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,880
I finally understand.

636
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:18,040
I was just making excuses.

637
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,500
I was running from your feelings.

638
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,460
But...

639
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,900
I'm done running.

640
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,900
Hokko,

641
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,970

I've decided.
