But she's working hard.

184
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,100
Wow, I commend her.

185
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,090
Say, were you able to resolve the issue you were worried about?

186
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,330
Yes, somewhat.

187
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,890
I wouldn't say the same for my love life, though.

188
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,770
Mr. Oba,

189
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:48,230
I believe all life lessons can be learned atop the ring.

190
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,570
You never know if you've won or lost until that gong sounds.

191
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,440
That's why you keep pushing to do your best and do what you can to win.

192
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,630
- Same goes with love, right?
- I suppose so.

193
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,170
I ended up losing my match.

194
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,420
But once you've given it your all, a loss doesn't feel so bitter.

195
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,320
Sorry, that sounded like I assumed you would lose.

196
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,150
But that's not what I meant.

197
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,030
What's important is that you take your fighting stance.

198
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,390
I see.

199
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,320
You've encouraged me.

200
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,470
As expected of a personal trainer.

201
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,230
No need to flatter me.

202
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,180
Here, I'll pour you something to drink.

203
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,820
How are they, Mr. Asakura?

204
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,330
Good shot.

205
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,790
- Thank you.
- Don't let it get to your head.

206
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,070
This is the only usable shot.

207
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,700
A professional must constantly strive for that quality.

208
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,260
Yes, sir.

209
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,420
- See you.
- See you tomorrow.

210
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,980
<i>You didn't bring the 400mm.</i>

211
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,340
<i>- I'll go grab it-</i>
<i>- Don't bother.</i>

212
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,460
<i>It's out of focus.</i>

213
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,670
- <i>Move it.</i>
- <i>Sorry, sir.</i>

214
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,060
<i>This is the only usable shot.</i>

215
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,910
Kojima, I've compiled our notes from the meeting today.

216
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,570
Give it a look when you have time.

217
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,690
That was fast.

218
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,340
Did something good happen to you recently?

219
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,650
- I suppose.
- Oh, Ms. Nade.

220
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,520
- Hey there, Nade.
- Did you need this room?

221
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,490
Yeah. My team needs to make physical copies of some manuals.

222
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,830
Like, paper copies? Sounds old school.

223
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,140
Elderly folk and people without access to the internet need it.

224
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,420
It's an important job.

225
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,940
Yeah, but anyone can do it.

226
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,130
Sorry, I didn't mean...

227
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,310
I'll be heading out.

228
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,530
So, how are things with Mr. Kuzuya?

229
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,850
Are you two dating?

230
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,900
We are.

231
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,680
Does that mean you'll quit boxing?

232
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,960
You don't exactly have a reason to punch him anymore.

233
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,320
I'll be keeping up with boxing.

234
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,040
- I'm taking the pro certification exam.
- You're going pro?

235
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,090
- What about your job?
- I'm not quitting.

236
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:02,210
Even if I get certified, being a professional isn't enough to make a living.

237
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,300
But I want to keep at it and aim to become a professional.

238
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,590
Sounds rough, especially with this workload.

239
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,810
Yeah.

240
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,580
That's why I'm crunching to leave on time every day.

241
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,980
Sounds like you need to get going then.

242
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,780
Yeah, thanks.

243
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,910
What are you doing?

244
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,680
- Sorry.
- Jeez...

245
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,580
Here.

246
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,850
- Thank you.
- Sure.

247
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,480
There.

248
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,170
See you!

249
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,620
She is so irritating.

250
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,690
Give it your all.

251
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,450
Your legs.

252
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,830
Watch your legs.

253
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,320
Lower your hips.

254
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,940
Guard.

255
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,140
Raise your guard.

256
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,680
Looking good, Kaori.

257
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,900
Hokomi, don't run.

258
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,960
Nice.

259
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,970
Exactly.

260
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,640
Time.

261
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,500
Ms. Sato might be a monster waiting to unleash herself.

262
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,110
Another.

263
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,570
Is this about Ms. Hokomi, again?

264
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,160
She's juggling work, boxing, and a man? Talk about selfish.

265
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,910
She's neglecting her job, and for what? Boxing?

266
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,110
She's totally just a deadweight.

267
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,120
Then tell your boss about it.

268
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,680
- What?
- Tell your boss.

269
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,550
Make them your allies.

270
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,300
Hell, conflate the story a bit. Nothing wrong with that.

271
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,410
You know you're working just as hard as she is.

272
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,840
But if you keep whining to me...

273
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,900
nothing will change.

274
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,360
You know?

275
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,740
Thank you.

276
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,860
Trust me, these are perfect.

277
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,510
How was the spar?

278
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,370
Yeah...

279
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,140
I was no match for her.

280
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,050
I thought I'd trained pretty hard,

281
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,270
but I only landed that last hit.

282
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,530
Call it a lucky punch, I guess.

283
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,410
Ah, well.

284
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,580
I'm used to it by now.

285
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:36,460
I've always loved to work by chipping away at things.

286
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,620
That's how I prepared for my college entrance exams and my wedding.

287
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,720
But I failed both of them.

288
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,900
My efforts have rarely paid off.

289
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,970
So, I'm used to losing.

290
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,340
There's no "lucky punch" in boxing.

291
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,180
That punch you got in

292
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,860
was the result of hundreds and thousands of hits

293
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,840
against a sandbag.

294
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,920
It wasn't luck.

295
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,130
You'll be fine.

296
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,740
Boxing will always reward your efforts.

297
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,490
Are you...

298
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,820
attempting to cheer me up?

299
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,240
Not really.

300
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,430
Just trying to defend the sport from a bad impression.

301
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,380
That's good.

302
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,030
I suddenly feel like I'll do better next time.

303
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,520
Simpleton.

304
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,390
Hey, today I only got one punch. But next time, I'll get two.

305
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,910
What keeps you motivated like that?

306
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,760
I wonder.

307
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,780
- What?
- You're dieting.

308
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,180
Huh?

309
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,450
No way.

310
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,120
Cheapskate.

311
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,250
Cheapskate. Cheap, cheap, cheap.

312
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,380
I heard you the first time.

313
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,450
Hey.

314
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,180
Mr. Kairi.

315
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,900
The pro certification exam...

316
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,670
will be held on November 3.

317
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,010
Please come watch me. Okay?

318
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,900
You're strong, Hokko.

319
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,860
It makes me want to come and see you whenever I'm down.

320
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,470
Is everything all right?

321
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,950
It's all right now.

322
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,760
I'm heading back to the studio.

323
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,250
All right.

324
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,790
See you.

325
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,390
You can do it.

326
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,040
Good morning.

327
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,110
- Good morning.
- Morning.

328
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,270
Morning.

329
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,020
Right then.

330
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,250
Huh?

331
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,540
Kojima, have you seen my laptop?

332
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,020
Your laptop? No, I haven't.

333
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,360
It's missing.

334
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,860
That's not good.

335
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,420
You have confidential information stored there.

336
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,490
<i>What are you doing?</i>

337
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,520
An apology's not going to cut it, Sato.

338
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,840
What will you do if there's a data leak?

339
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,610
Sir, I've had our tech team lock our systems.

340
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:26,240
They're also looking into any data leaks, so let's wait on their assessment.

341
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,280
Thank you.

342
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,620
If anything gets out, this is your responsibility.

343
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:38,300
We can't have you slack off because of boxing or whatever it is.

344
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,680
I'm terribly sorry for my mistake, sir.

345
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,420
Let's search around for your laptop again.

346
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,910
Right.

347
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,700
Nade...

348
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,660
Hokomi, I found it.

349
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,460
Voilà.

350
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,180
Jeez, I can't believe you forgot it.

351
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,560
Kojima told me what was up, so I started searching, too.

352
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,620
Thank you.

353
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,520
It's no sweat.

354
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,880
Where was it?

355
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,160
Right here.

356
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,200
Here?

357
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,920
That's strange, it wasn't here earlier.

358
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,670
Are you saying I did this?

359
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,200
That's awful.

360
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,160
Of course not, I just-

361
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,640
Look, Hokomi.

362
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,380
If you can't work overtime, request to be reassigned elsewhere.

363
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,420
What?

364
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:57,570
I don't care if you're preparing for an exam. This is your job.

365
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,390
Work when you're supposed to. It's starting to piss me off.

366
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,210
Don't act so conceited, just because you're Mr. Oba's favorite.

367
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,130
Conceited? No, I've never...

368
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:15,090
Honestly? I hate you the most out of all our coworkers, Hokomi.

369
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,920
Everyone's all "Hokomi this, Hokomi that."

370
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,160
They're all obsessed with you.

371
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,830
<i>You made an error in our calculations? Unbelievable, Ms. Nitta.</i>

372
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,220
<i>I'll revise the documents right away, sir.
[5 Years Ago]</i>

373
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,660
<i>- I'll help out as well.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

374
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,180
<i>I'm relieved to hear it, Ms. Sato.</i>

375
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,520
<i>Just get it together, all right?</i>

376
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,590
<i>We're sorry for our mistake, sir.</i>

377
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,470
<i>Let's do this.</i>

378
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,060
This is all your fault, Hokomi.

379
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:03,420
Hokomi's going out with Mr. Kuzuya now.

380
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,330
What?

381
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,540
This is what she gets for being on cloud nine.

382
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,240
What was it you wanted to discuss?

383
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,030
It's regarding the lost laptop, sir.

384
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:26,970
Ms. Sato is blaming the entire incident on me,

385
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,070
but I haven't done a thing.

386
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,450
Well, it has been found-

387
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,140
Sir, it's more than that.

388
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,510
This is not the only incident involving Ms. Sato.

389
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,630
She has been forcing me to take on her workload,

390
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,310
all so she may leave on time.

391
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,390
- What?
- Sir.

392
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:48,840
When Ms. Sato insists, I just can't say no to her.

393
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,880
I think boxing has changed her for the worse.

394
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,250
It's like she gets aggressive, and...

395
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,850
Oba.

396
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,550
I got word from our tech team.

397
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,130
No one has hacked or leaked any data from Sato's laptop.

398
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,820
- Good.
- Sir.

399
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,410
I shall take full responsibility for this incident.

400
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,980
I'll be sure to give Sato a strict word,

401
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,780
so could you please let this matter slide?

402
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,440
If you insist, I'll leave her to you.

403
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,410
Thank you.

404
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,230
Your emotions are clouding your judgment, sir.

405
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,000
If anything, I'd say this course of action is quite reasonable.

406
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,230
Anyone who knows Sato's work ethic would agree.

407
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,090
Then if you'll excuse me.

408
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,010
Mr. Oba...

409
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,440
Sato.

410
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,240
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

411
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,850
It's all right.

412
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,350
How are you holding up?

413
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,700
Just fine.

414
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,080
- Sato.
- This time,

415
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,580
could I ask you not to tell anyone else of this blunder?

416
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,340
What?

417
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,950
I don't want Ms. Yui or Mr. Kairi to know.

418
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,950
Sir, please.

419
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,010
All right.

420
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,250
Thank you.

421
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,160
Kairi, do you have a minute?

422
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,600
Yes, sir.

423
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,320
- Sit.
- Yes, sir.

424
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,050
Izaki's Second came to our studio with a request.

425
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,470
He'll be boxing in Las Vegas for the world champ title,
<i>[Project Izaki Yuya in LAS VEGAS]</i>

426
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,180
and they're looking for a photographer to document his journey.
<i>[Project Izaki Yuya in LAS VEGAS]</i>

427
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,870
Would you want to give it a shot?

428
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,140
- What?
- Although you're still an amateur photographer,

429
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,270
you're familiar with boxing.

430
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,640
This is a unique advantage of yours.

431
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,960
You really ought to consider becoming a boxing photographer.

432
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,460
This job would take at least half a year.

433
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,620
It'll take even longer for you to make it big.

434
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,570
You'll have to face not only your subjects,

435
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,500
but also boxing more than ever.

436
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,780
All that to say,

437
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,830
this is the opportunity of a lifetime.

438
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,880
Do you feel up to the challenge?

439
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,230
<i>In fact, I'm still chasing that dream.</i>

440
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,350
<i>What's your dream now, Kairi?</i>

441
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,640
<i>[Project Izaki Yuya in LAS VEGAS]</i>

442
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,290
Please let me take this opportunity.

443
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,840
You leave next week.

444
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,810
I'd suggest you start packing.

445
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,580
I'm back.

446
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,270
- Huh? You going somewhere, Kairi?
- Yeah.

447
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,750
I'll be in the States for a shoot.

448
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,730
<i>[Project Izaki Yuya in LAS VEGAS]</i>

449
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,650
A boxing shoot?
<i>[Project Izaki Yuya in LAS VEGAS]</i>

450
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:22,250
Yeah. The place is all yours until I'm back.

451
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,370
Will you be able to do this?

452
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,690
What?

453
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:30,820
I mean, you're always turning down shoots for sporting events.

454
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,420
True. It probably sounds like I'm just dreaming, huh?

455
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,990
Dreaming?

456
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,060
Satoru,

457
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,420
I want to become a boxing photographer.

458
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,840
Hilarious, right? Someone like me, having a dream.

459
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,070
You've changed, Kairi.

460
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,640
I suppose we owe that all to Ms. Hokomi.

461
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,630
Speaking of Hokomi, have you told her yet?

462
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,000
No, not yet.

00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,860
<i>I don't care if you're preparing for an exam. This is your job.</i>

464
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,580
<i>Work when you're supposed to. It's starting to piss me off.</i>

465
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,370
<i>I hate you the most out of all our coworkers, Hokomi.</i>

466
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,860
<i>This is all your fault, Hokomi.</i>

467
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,280
Okay.

468
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,970
Huh? Ms. Hokomi?

469
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:40,540
- Mr. Aizawa. Good evening.
- Evening.

470
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,080
What a coincidence.

471
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,070
A coincidence indeed.

472
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,870
Good seeing you.

473
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,440
That reminds me.

474
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,650
It'll get lonely around here once Kairi heads to America, huh?

475
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,660
America?

476
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,860
You haven't heard? He's leaving next week for a photography gig.

477
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,340
He'll be gone for at least half a year.

478
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,620
I guess it isn't an easy topic to bring up though.

479
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,030
Being in a relationship sure sounds difficult.

480
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:11,460
You can't be a burden to each other, or else you'll both end up unhappy.

481
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,150
Either way, I'm rooting for you, Ms. Hokomi.

482
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,560
See you around.

483
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,540
Kojima, where's Sato?

484
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,720
She took the day off. Pretty unusual, huh?

486
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,590
Hello?

00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:09,260
Great to see you again. I wanted to thank you for the biking lessons.

488
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,170
I'm the one who needs to thank you.

489
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:17,220
Your friend referred me to a famous sports photographer,

490
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,210
and now I even work under him.

491
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,700
So really, thank you.

492
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,970
That's amazing! I'm happy for you.

493
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,440
On that note, I'm headed to the States next week.

494
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:36,950
It's for a long-term shoot, so I'll be out of the country for a while.

495
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,590
You couldn't have picked a better time to meet up like this.

496
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,480
Does Sato know you're leaving?

497
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,120
No, I haven't been able to tell her yet.

498
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,430
I see.

499
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,460
Mr. Kuzuya,

500
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,880
this is a great opportunity for you.

501

You have to take the chance while you can.

502
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,580
But I'll make one request.

503
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,910
Try to make it back for the certification exam, will you?

504
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,630
Sato's working really hard to pass.

505
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,050
All right?

506
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,780
- Thank you again for treating me.
- Of course.

507
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:30,390
I wish you the best of luck in America.

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,070
I'm quite busy, you know.

540
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,810
With the exam coming up,

541
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,300
I have no time to spend with you.

542
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,120
I can't even go and eat ramen.

544

Hokko.

545
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:49,860
I promise I won't let my life remain stagnant.

546
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,320
I owe this all to you, Hokko.

547
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,750
Mr. Kairi.

548
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,240
Yeah.

549
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,120
Do you remember the other day?

550
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,070
When you asked me

551
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:46,930
what kept me motivated?

552
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,380
Well, it's you.

553
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,660
I...

554
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,740
promise to pass the pro certification exam.

555
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,160
In exchange,

556
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,680
go do your best in America, too.

557
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,130
I...

558
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,750
I won't be waiting for you.

559
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,920
In other words...

560
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,580
This is goodbye.

561
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,030

562
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,420
