<i>You began boxing with the sole intent of punching him, no?</i>

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,750
<i>Why is it I do boxing?</i>

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,770
<i>Boxing is all about respecting your opponent.</i>

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,830
<i>They went through a similar grueling regime to stand in the ring.</i>

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,910
<i>That's why you don't pull your punches, quite literally so.</i>

7

Congratulations!

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,550
Your match was so moving.

16
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,440
Her left cross to right hook was deadly.

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,980
Congrats, Kaori.

18
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,660

- All right folks.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,430
Our renowned Second is back on her feet.

22
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,680

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,800
- What?
- Ms. Yui!

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,150
No, no thanks.

Hey, you!

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,850
All right, bring it.

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,530
Bring it on.

28
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,910

I'm back.

32
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,190
Oh, Kairi. I didn't realize you were back.

33
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,650
Sorry, I missed lunch today.

34
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,870
It's fine.

35
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,450
So, how'd it go?

36
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,460
Your date.

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,490
Who was it today?

38
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,680
I wasn't on a date.

39
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,070
Oh yeah, Kairi.

40
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,690
The studio I work for is looking for a new photographer.

41
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,540
Did you want in?

42
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,050
I didn't think so.

43
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,250
I'll ask someone else.

44
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,320
Mr. Hanegi sure is late.

45
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,330
He's probably off visiting the cemetery.

46
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,000
To see Mr. Hirayama?

47
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,540
It's his routine to report back to Daichi every match.

48
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,440
He should be back soon.

49
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,510
What was he like? Mr. Hirayama, that is.

50
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,250
He was a bonafide boxing maniac,

51
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,300
a good cook, and loved to read, too.

52
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,940
He also liked flowers.

53
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,210
- Flowers?
- Yeah.

54
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,230
See that bouquet up there?

55
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,440
Apparently, those flowers symbolize victory.

56
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,300
Daichi put them up for good luck, and Pops has kept up the tradition.

57
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,920
He sounds like a kind individual.

58
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,130
Everyone here loved him.

59
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,940
There's a reason why Kairi hasn't moved on, seven years later.

60
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,900
Ms. Sato.

61
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,330
Yes?

62
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,830
Thanks.

63
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,350
Huh?

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,050
You're the reason Kairi came to the match today.

65
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,120
I wouldn't say that.

66
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,040
If anything...

67
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,660
He told me off good today.

68
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,880
<i>Knock it off already.</i>

69
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,560
<i>Quit stomping into my life.</i>

70
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,230
Don't let him get to you.

71
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,900
He just isn't being honest with himself.

72
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,210
May I use this?

73
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,900
Is that supposed to be Kairi?

74
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,550
It's a "scum"-bag.

75
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,250
Looking good, Ms. Sato.

76
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,810

77
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,490

78
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,080

79
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,460
All right.

80
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,600
You start sparring tomorrow.

81
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,000

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,520

83

Yes, sir.

87
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,780
First, we shall invite both professionals and amateurs alike

88
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,380
to submit their photos for the contest's promotional poster.

89
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,780

So, what's up?

The lady in this photo is at the receptionist desk.

99
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,760
She wants to see you.

100
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,190
Truth be told, my husband passed away the other day.

101
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,050
Don't worry, it was not the interview.

102
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,720
We received permission to leave from the hospital that day.

103
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,140
He was so excited for the interview, he didn't even hesitate.

104
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,860
I couldn't even tell...

105
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,210
You see, my husband absolutely adored this photograph.

106
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,720
He even joked about making it his photograph at the funeral.

107
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,950
If you have any more photographs of my husband, could I please have them?

108
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,800
Of course.

109
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,430
I'll be sure to inform the photographer of your request.

110
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,580
Thank you very much.

111
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,110
The one who took those photos was Mr. Kuzuya, right?

112
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,660
Yeah.

113
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,040
I heard he didn't show for your event the other day.

114
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,850
A true and tried scumbag.

115
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,490
Who told you?

116
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,270
Kojima. We're sort of best buds now.

117
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,970
Kojima...

118
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:25,510
It's not that he didn't show. Things just got complicated.

119
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,750
- What?
- You're getting defensive.

120
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,010
But I can't blame you for caring. You've kissed him twice now.

121
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,010
I'm telling you, we're not like that.

122
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,020
So, what're you going to do?

123
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,900
You should submit Mr. Kuzuya's photo to the contest for him.

124
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,040
You were considering it while putting up that poster, right?

125
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,190
No, I was not.

Sure.

The owner of a restaurant we interviewed has passed away.

139
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:03,030
His wife came today, asking for more pictures Mr. Kuzuya took of her husband.

This is the wife, Mrs. Sasaki's contact information.

Could you please tell Mr. Kuzuya to reach out to her?

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:19,510
I don't mind, but why not call him yourself?

143
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,700
Because he is currently avoiding me.

Sparring teaches you the flow of a match.

153

Although it looks difficult, the basic practice is simple.

154
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,990
Guard, dodge, and hit. That's all there is to it.

155

Yes, ma'am.

156

For now, you don't have to worry about weaving or ducking.

157

Just make sure your headgear stays on.

00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,820
Yes, ma'am.

159
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:04,470
When your opponent throws a punch, in other words when their guard is down, go for a hit.

160
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,410
Yes, ma'am.

161
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,260

If there's one lesson I want folks to take away from boxing,

197

it's to understand the pain of others.

and I think it's about time for you, too.

201
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,340
Would you come with me to Daichi's annual memorial service next week?

202

396
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:49,540

- Sing along!
- A mic for you.

546
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,500
You drank too much, man.

547
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,830
Kairi, are you okay?

548
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,260
Who're you?

549
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,700
Huh?

550
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,750
Just kidding.

Bathroom.

552
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,520
- Will he be okay?
- He'll be fine.

553
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,230
Sorry, he's seriously drunk.

554
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,590
Don't back down. Stay on the offensive.

555
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,160
Exactly. Perfect.

You drank way too much.

562
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,370
You all right, Kairi?

563
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,650
- I wanna go to Kairi's place.
- Me, too.

564
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,700
Shall we?

565
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,910
- Yeah!
- Let's go!

566
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,250
I'm totally down.

567
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:19,500
Miss, you're in our way.

568
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,790
Do you know her?

569
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,610
Do I? Let's go.

570
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,120
We'll meet you later.

571
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,150
Let's go, come on.

572
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,750
Come on.

573
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,090
I heard about the poster application.

574
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,520
I'm sorry.

575
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,410
- I shouldn't have recommended you to apply.
- Just leave me alone.

576
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,980
You followed me out here, and for what?

577
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,510
Now go home.

578
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,660
I can't leave you be.

579
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,720
What's that?

580
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,280
Is that pity? Are you comforting me?

581
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,930
No.

582
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:13,210
I've been thinking all this time, about what I can do for you.

583
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,830
Really now.

584
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,060
Then let me do you once.

585
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:37,480
My life has been in the pits ever since you showed up.

586
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,050
Fine.

587
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,360
Let's go.

588
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,640
You're too easy.

589
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,190
Even got us a room and everything.

590
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,460
This is why guys cheat you.

591
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,920
I don't care if this is a trick.

592
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,910
Because I know the truth.

593
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,810
I know you struggle.

594
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,880
And I know, deep down...

595
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,850
that you're strong and kind.

596
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,880
I know you don't want to cause others trouble.

597
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,580
So, you pull away on purpose.

598
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:34,650
You know...

599
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,560
I tried.

600
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,330
Everyone else was moving on, so I tried.

601
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,140
And yet...

602
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:01,780
Every time I try to move on, I get a dose of reality.

603
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,210
<i>The one throwing the punch may forget.</i>

604
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,740
<i>But the one taking the hit will always remember.</i>

605
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,730
<i>He had his whole life ahead of him.</i>

606
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,210
<i>Give me back my son!</i>

607
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,350
No matter how much I apologize.

608
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:19,370
No matter how much I regret.

609
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,970
I can't turn back time.

610
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:32,900
What am I supposed to do?

611
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,050
No matter what people say about you,

612
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,480
no matter what anyone in the world claims they know,

613
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,790
I will be by your side.

614
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,220
I will be your ally.

615
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,560
So, please.

616
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,020
Please don't destroy yourself.

617
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,920
And when you need to move on, despite it all...

618
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:47,510
I will give you a solid punch.

619
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:54,610
Because...

620
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,580
I love you.

621
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,890
So, I'll be right there to punch you.
