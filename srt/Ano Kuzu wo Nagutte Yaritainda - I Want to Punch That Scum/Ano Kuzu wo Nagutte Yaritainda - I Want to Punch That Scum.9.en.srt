1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,070
Kairi.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,200
It's Hokomi.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,250
Hokomi was...

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,540
Thank you.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,650
She's still asleep, but it was only a concussion.

6
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,030
She won't see any lasting effects,

7
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,760
but she'll remain for a couple more days to run more tests.

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,700
Thank goodness...

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,640
I was right there for her.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,710
I'm sorry I couldn't step in sooner.

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,870
It's not your fault, Nari.

12
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,120
After all...

13
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,540
Hokomi is a professional boxer now.

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,120
Yes, a professional.

15
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,350
Kairi.

16
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,840
How's Hokko?

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,960
She's still asleep, but she'll be fine.

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,100
We scheduled a spar with a boxer
who had also just become a professional,

19
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,920
but someone else was sent in day-of.

20
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,830
Turns out that opponent had a history
of three matches, three K.O.'s.

21
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,000
What?

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,380
Their difference in experience was clear.

23
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,580
Pops and I tried to stop her,

24
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,770
but Hokomi insisted on continuing the spar.

25
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,290
She was K.O.-ed in her first round.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,780
Why did they send in someone so strong?

27
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,050
Well...

28
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,430
I received a request.

29
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,460
They said they would pay me one million yen if I K.O.-ed Ms. Sato.

30
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,110
In any case, she's stable now.

31
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,080
I'm about to head home for the day.

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,360
What about you? Did you have work today?

33
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,850
Yeah.

34
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,900
Hokomi will be fine.

35
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,400
I know she'll be.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,760
Let's check our poses...

37
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,270
I apologize for being late.

38
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,750
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Kuzuya.

39
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,730
But we'll have to cancel your booking today.

40
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,500
Is everything all right?

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,270
Well, you see...

42
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,610
A tabloid journalist contacted our studio about it.

43
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,080
Apparently a woman claimed she was deceived by you,

44
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,300
and they wanted to get your side of things.

45
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,750
The woman in question is a model named Shino Kashiwagi.

46
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,530
You know her?

47
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,150
I was previous involved with her.

48
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm sure they're only trying to harass you.

49
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,250
But with the Photography Awards coming up,

50
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,870
stay sharp, and don't fool around, got that?

51
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,370
Mr. Oba?

52
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,460
Ms. Yui!

53
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,490
I heard Sato was taken to a hospital.

54
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,770
Is she all right?

55
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,350
She'll need to stay for a couple more days, but she's fine.

56
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,010
Really?

57
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,460
Thank goodness...

58
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,300
I'm terribly sorry for causing you to worry.

59
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,830
I am fully responsible for this incident.

60
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,420
If only I had properly cautioned her...

61
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,760
Again, my apologies.

62
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,480
Ms. Yui.

63
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,320
Say...

64
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,240
Are you doing all right?

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,680
It was my responsibility

66
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,210
to call it quits during Hokomi's spar.

67
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,420
I've failed her as a trainer.

68
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,520
While I'm no boxing expert,

69
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,760
I would say you're a fine trainer, Ms. Yui.

70
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,350
Being able to worry and get angry for others is a talent.

71
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,390
I admire you for it.

72
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,190
You really are a nice guy, Mr. Oba.

73
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,590
Oh no, I wouldn't call myself that. If anything...

74
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,160
- I'm boring.
- No, you're nice.

75
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,400
Very much so.

76
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,980
You're a bit... amusing as well.

77
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,550
What?

78
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,200
Long time no see.

79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,950
Shino.

80
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,590
I told you, you'd get what you deserved.

81
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,140
Although,

82
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,010
I personally wouldn't have taken it this far.

83
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,590
But he said I shouldn't go easy on you.

84
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,360
Who?

85
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,910
Aizawa.

86
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,470
Your housemate.

87
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,720
Satoru said that?

88
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,170
Kairi.

89
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,250
It seems like I was serious about you.

90
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,170
So...

91
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,810
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,670
[I Wanna Punch that Scumbag!]
[Round 9]

93
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,820
Ms. Sato. Ms. Sato.

94
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,790
Call the doctor.

95
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,400
She will be all right.

96
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,800
Thank you, Doctor.

97
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,350
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah.

98
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,050
We'll run another scan on your brain and ankle, just to be safe.

99
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,120
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

100
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,500
Hokomi!

101
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,050
Mimi...

102
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,390
Are you okay?

103
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,120
Yup, I'm fine.

104
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,740
Does your ankle still hurt?

105
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,980
A bit. But it'll pass.

106
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,820
Then you can get back to boxing.

107
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,980
Hokomi...

108
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,060
You don't have to keep at it anymore, right?

109
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,850
You've proven yourself already.

110
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,960
I'll be fine.

111
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,280
- Give me a week, and-
- Hokomi.

112
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,200
Aren't you scared?

113
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,680
What?

114
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,850
Because I am.

115
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,690
My daughter is up there, getting pummeled.

116
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,610
And that terrifies me.

117
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,400
Grandma, are you okay?

118
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,510
I'm fine, Mimi.

119
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,100
- Thank you.
- Mimi, you'll be late for school.

120
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,610
- Let Grandma take you.
- See you later.

121
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,990
Bye-bye.

122
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,870
Okay, let's get going.

123
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,030
I'm against it, too.

124
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,810
Sorry, I can't be your ally this time, Sis.

125
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,240
But after seeing Mom freak out

126
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,400
when she heard you had collapsed...

127
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,850
I knew I couldn't handle it.

128
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,810
A parent never wants to hear
that something has happened to their child.

129
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,760
I know our mom is like that,

130
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,610
but she still treasures her daughters all the same.

131
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,580
I'm sorry I caused you two to worry.

132
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,520
[Satoru Aizawa]

133
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,590
Hey, where's Hokomi?

134
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,590
You didn't hear? She lost consciousness while sparring
and was taken to the hospital.

135
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,730
No way. Is she...

136
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,800
She got a concussion. Leaves us with more work though.

137
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,330
But she's okay?

138
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,280
Yeah, she woke up this morning.

139
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,230
Martial arts sure is scary, huh?

140
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,830
[I'll be waiting for you at the usual shrine.]
[I'll be here until you arrive.]

141
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,990
<i>The number you have currently dialed is...</i>

142
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,740
Thank goodness she woke up.

143
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,930
I just hope she isn't pushing herself.

144
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,060
Huh?

145
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,160
After receiving a counter like that head-on,

146
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,650
most players would be left traumatized.

147
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:16,230
Not to mention Ms. Sato is still a beginner.

148
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:21,780
I've seen plenty of boxers leave the ring from incidents like this.

149
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,600
- Yui.
- Yeah?

150
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,860
Keep a careful eye on Ms. Sato, got that?

151
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,350
Yes, sir.

152
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,520
Excuse me, have you seen Aizawa by any chance?

153
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,020
- Satoru?
- Yes.

154
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,460
I haven't seen him around these days.

155
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,940
Anyone seen him?

156
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,290
- Not recently, no.
- I see.

157
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,270
Thank you.

158
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,510
I'm terribly sorry, but we're not open yet...

159
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,840
I'm sorry, Akemi.

160
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,860
I already told you, no more apologizing.

161
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,070
Apologize again,

162
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,400
and I'm charging you.

163
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,530
You know, I realized something.

164
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,450
This is the first time

165
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,780
Hokomi has proactively said she wanted to pursue something.

166
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,880
See, Sayami was different.

167
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,970
She always wanted to attend dance lessons
or learn piano like her friends.

168
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:42,230
But Hokomi? She never asked for anything of the sort.

169
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:48,160
Maybe it was because our household
was already cutting corners as is.

170
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,540
So...

171
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,380
When I saw my girl become so earnest about boxing,

172
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,850
I wanted to cheer her on.

173
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,770
I really did.

174
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,890
And yet...

175
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,650
I'm sorry, Nari.

176
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,590
I don't want her to box.

177
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,180
It's terrifying, isn't it?

178
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,000
That's the normal reaction to have.

179
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,740
I'm sorry.

180
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,850
- You apologized. Do I charge you?
- Right.

181
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,790
I forgot.

182
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,620
Whether she continues or not is her choice.

183

00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,780
My dream...

365
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,000
was to live with my brother and our mother.

366
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,230
We promised we'd move in together one day.

367
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,020
But...

368
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,420
That dream never came true.

369
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,730
<i>- Down!
- Big Bro!</i>

370
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,760
<i>Call a doctor!</i>

371
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,610
<i>Get a stretcher!</i>

372
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,930
<i>Hurry!</i>

373
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,730
<i>Call an ambulance!</i>

374
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,960
You were left, living life without care.

375
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,870
Laughing away.

376
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,590
How could I let you just do that?

377
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,520
Remember this, for the rest for your life.

378
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,810
Stay hurting forever.

379
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,840
Never forget what you've done.

380
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,540
Suffer, until your clock runs dry.

381
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,330
Mr. Asakura.

382
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,760
- Hello? Yes, sir.
<i>- That was my goal.</i>

383
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,320
- Yes, now is fine.
- <i>So I was always watching, with that intent.</i>

384
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,660
Yes...

385
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,870
And yet.

386
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,980
<i>They didn't include a spoon.</i>

387
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,360
<i>Voilà.</i>

388
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,640
<i>- Sorry, what?
- Whatever, take a spoon.</i>

389
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,430
<i>- That's good.
- Yeah.</i>

390
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,310
<i>Back to the basics.</i>

391
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,420
<i>- Hell yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

392
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,680
<i>Kairi, can you do this?</i>

393
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,800
<i>Sure can.</i>

394
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,420
<i>Satoru? Where'd you go?</i>

395
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,420
<i>Quit slacking.</i>

396
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,390
<i>I'm not.</i>

397
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,770
<i>- Work.
- You work.</i>

398
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,670
<i>You're not done either.</i>

399
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,720
<i>- Look.
- Yeah, yeah. Get working.</i>

400
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,930
<i>Damn it!</i>

401
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:34,600
<i>- Hey!
- Hah, get a lightning bolt to the face.</i>

402
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,300
[Passion in the Ring: Climax]

403
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,640
You always used to make yourself hurt.

404
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,500
You used to be an emotionless scumbag.

405
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,920
But you've changed.

406
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,570
You've moved on.

407
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,390
You're acting like the world's forgiven you.

408
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,750
Talking about dreams or whatever.

409
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,020
But you don't get a fun "do-over" at life.

410
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,600
That's just wrong.

411
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,110
It's so wrong, I have to laugh.

412
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,370
Why was it my brother?

413
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:08,410
Why did my brother have to die?

414
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,560
It should've been you.

415
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,050
You should have been the one to die.

416
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,660
<i>- See you.
- See ya.</i>

417
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,040
<i>This one here.</i>

418
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,780
<i>It's in though.</i>

419
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,770
- <i>Got you.
- Hey!</i>

420
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,090
<i>Say, Hanegi!</i>

421
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,660
Kairi?

422
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,920
Could I have a minute?

423
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,860
I've gotten more nostalgic these days.

424
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,580
I remember when Daichi first brought you to the gym,

425
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:45,120
and how happy I was when you said you wanted to box.

426
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,460
Daichi's younger brother dropped by our gym.

427
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,830
He took all of Daichi's belongings off our hands.

428
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,010
Kairi.

429
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,320
Look me in the eyes.

430
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,760
Your life isn't meant to be for the sake of someone else.

431
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,740
Where you go and where you return to

432
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,260
are both your choices.

433
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,390
Kairi.

434
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,500
You only need to live your life.

435
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,270
That's all you ever need to do.

436
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:58,200
I don't have that privilege.

437
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:14,220
It doesn't matter if you can't forgive yourself, or anyone else.

438
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,500
You still have to move on.

439
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,310
You have to get back up.

440
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,920
I just can't.

441
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,720
Kairi.

442
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,410
Kairi!

443
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,750
Mr. Kuzuya.

444
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,240
What did you need?

445
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,220
Mr. Oba.

446
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,570
I'll leave Hokko to you.

447
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,020
What?

448
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,660
What does that mean?

449
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,390
Sato's waiting for you.

450
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,000
Are you planning on running away again?

451
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,820
She rejected me.

452
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,300
I care about her as much as you do,

453
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,500
and I like to think I know her better, too.

454
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,600
I know how serious she is.

455
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,310
I know she's stubborn, and upright,

456
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:02,280
and cheeky, and loves chocolate...

457
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,440
And I know how much she loves you, too.

458
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,010
I'm not the one for her.

459
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,000
Hokko.

460
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,720
Hokko?

461
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,490
You're late.

462
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,140
Sorry.

463
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,540
How's your ankle?

464
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,370
I only sprained it.

465
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,160
It'll get better.

466
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,390
Don't push yourself.

467
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,460
I'll be fine.

468
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,130
This sort of injury is a given at the professional level.

469
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,800
It isn't, though.

470
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:31,260
At the very least, I've never lost consciousness from a K.O.

471
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,340
You just suck at this.

472
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:41,620
I'll let you know, my opponent was incredibly strong.

473
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,920
Besides, you weren't even watching.

474
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,050
I wish I was.

475
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,360
I would've loved to see you spar.

476
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,780
I'll get stronger

477
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,780
and jump right back in the ring.

478
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,150
Just kidding.

479
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,300
- Huh?
- I lied.

480
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,330
I've lost consciousness, too.

481
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,370
It was terrifying.

482
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,110
Anyone would be scared.

483
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,210
It's scary to punch and get punched.

484
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,620
It's scary to hurt and get hurt.

485
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,850
I ran from the ring because I lost to that fear.

486
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,950
But you'll be fine, Hokko.

487
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,480
You'll manage just fine.

488
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,840
You'll get up, no matter how many times you're knocked down.

489
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,900
I wanted to give you this.

490
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,360
The moon.

491
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,600
Please stay by Hokko's side,

492
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,040
and continue to protect her.

493
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,800
Thank you.

494
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,430
Hokko.

495
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,300
Yes?

496
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,810
Thank you.

497
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,550
I'm sorry.

498
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,380
Mr. Kairi?

499
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,730
I'll be off now.

500
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,570
Farewell, Hokko.

501
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,840
Mr. Kairi?

502
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,370
Mr. Kairi?

503
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,160
<i>[Finale]</i>

504
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,570
I promise to stand on the ring until the bitter end.

505
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:27,170
So, please come get a shot of me.

506
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,900
I'll be waiting.
