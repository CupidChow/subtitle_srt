00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,750
For missing your exam.

184
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,080
No, it's fine.

185
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,220
Really. It's no big deal at all.

186
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,610
Take care.

187
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,740
One more thing.

188
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,940
Good luck with your photography.

189
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,440
Surprise! I bought us the good ice cream.

190
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,650
It'll be a luxury dining experience.

191
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,630
To celebrate your return.

192
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,360
Thanks.

193
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,740
- Here.
- Yeah.

194
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,980
Did you meet Ms. Hokomi yet?

195
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,320
Yeah, I did.

196
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,850
How was the six-month reunion? Did you try to get her back?

197
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,760
I was being complacent.

198
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,150
Huh?

199
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,630
What's that?

200
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,080
A present?

201
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,170
For Ms. Hokomi?

210
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,100
<i>The earliest available flight will be tomorrow morning.</i>

211
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,240
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

212
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,390
So, that's why you couldn't make it to Ms. Hokomi's exam.

213
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,180
I'm the one who chose to go to America.

214
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,870
I thought I was prepared for the consequences.

215
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,900
But after seeing a smile like that...

216
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,840
You really are serious about her.

217
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,210
Ms. Hokomi's something else.

218
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,320
She must be real special, huh?

219
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,180
I'll pour us some coffee.

226
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,900
Yeah. These are definitely great shots.

227
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,890
Thank you, sir.

228
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,520
Follow me.

229
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,500
The "Boxing Beat" magazine wants to use your photos.

230
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,810
Getting published here is the mark of a first-rate photographer.

231
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,290
But, sir, I've only begun my career.

232
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,660
Don't deny your opportunities.

233
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,470
Yes, sir.

234
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:53,410
And one more thing. One of your works was a finalist...

235
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,860
at the World Sports Photography Awards.

236
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,090
- Really?
- Here's to hoping you score an award.

237
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,070
Yes, sir.

238
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,910
Listen up.

239
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,030
Make sure you take any offers you get.

240
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,130
Your career right now relies on momentum.

241
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,710
Your life outside these gigs means nothing right now.

242
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,480
Just cram in the work.

243
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,390
Yes, sir.

244
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,980
One-two.

245
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,050

246
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,230

247
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,410
Again.

248
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,720
All together now.

249
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,770
Nice.

250
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:35,270
- Thank you.
- Glad to see she's not getting lax after the exam.

251
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,900
Sir.

252
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,380
Please schedule my debut match as soon as possible.

253
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,480
Sorry about that, Ms. Sato.

254
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,650
It's difficult to get a women's match together.

255
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,320
Right, I understand.

256
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,510
There are already so few of you, and even then, the stronger gyms get priority.

257
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,400
So, how long will I wait?

258
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,660
- I'd say about a year.
- A year?

259
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,830
- But...
- Yes, sir?

260
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,560
We've managed to schedule a spar for you.

261
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,810
- Really?
- Yeah.

262
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,690
She's a boxer from the Masaki Gym. I think her name was...

263
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,240
Wakaba Itou.

264
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,340
She hasn't had her first professional match either.

265
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,660
You're on even grounds.

266
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,310
Great! Thank you, Mr. Hanegi.

267
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,420
I'll look forward to it.

268
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,680
Is something up?

269
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,240
- Huh?
- You're weirdly motivated today, so I was wondering.

270
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,840
I met Mr. Kairi.

271
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,380
- What?
- My expectations got the best of me.

272
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,140
I thought maybe we would try again.

273
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,630
But Mr. Kairi has already moved on.

274
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,760
That's why I want to follow suit and move on as well.

275
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,780
Thank you again.

276
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,950
Right then.

<i>[Professional Boxer Certificate]</i>

278
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:10,460
- Who would've thought Hokomi would pass.
- Yes...

279
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,460
Maybe breaking up with Kairi and focusing on boxing helped.

280
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,160
- Ta-da!
- Woah!

281
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,690
Can I take one?

282
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,940
Of course. I made too many.

283
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,410
- This is delicious.
- Right?

284
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,950
Eat as many as you'd like.

285
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,530
- Kojima.
- Oh, Mr. Oba.

286
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,890
- Where's Sato?
- She's out on some business.

287
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,530
She's apparently going to spar with a professional soon.

288
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,160
- That's impressive.
- But is that allowed, Mr. Kuramochi?

289
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,110
- Huh?
- Government employees aren't allowed to take side jobs.

290
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,750
You make a point there.

291
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,760
I don't think it will be an issue.

292
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,490
She simply has to refuse the prize money for herself.

293
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,890
We have employees who run for sport as well, no?

294
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,280
Add in a professional boxer,

295
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,780
and it could do wonders for our city hall's publicity.

296
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,280
Great point.

297
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,220
Yes?

298
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,220
Aw, don't look so scared.

299
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,850
I see Mr. Kuzuya has returned.

300
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:40,050
If you choose to dilly-dally, he'll snatch Hokomi right back up.

301
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,950
You like Hokomi, don't you?

302
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,420
No need to hide it, I know.

303
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,030
Ms. Nitta, you're free to dislike whomever you please.

304
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,960
I only ask that you keep your conflict outside the workplace.

305
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,720
I don't intend on intruding in your personal life either.

306
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,540
Someone's in a bad mood.

307
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,080
It's all just no fun.

308
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,650
Is this about Ms. Hokomi passing her exam?

309
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,550
It would've been more interesting if she failed.

310
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,760
She's so in her head, she's apparently going to spar with a pro.

311
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:36,410
I honestly owe my efforts to your advice from half a year ago.

312
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,360
<i>She's neglecting her job, and for what? Boxing?</i>

313
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,240

00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,010

315
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,070
<i>You know you're working just as hard as she is.</i>

316
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,230
Too bad nothing's changed.

317
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,180
Say, why did you give me advice back then?

318
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,170
- What?
- I know.

319
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,670
You feel like Hokomi's taking Mr. Kuzuya away from you.

320
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,790
- I get it, he's like your big brother after all-
- No!

321
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,560
Sorry.

322
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,350
Everything okay?

323
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,830
See...

324
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,810
I have an older brother.

325
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:29,210
We were separated as kids when our parents got a divorce.

326
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,580
But he always cared for me.

327
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,070
He's kind like that.

328
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,650
Do you see him often?

329
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,460
Only sometimes.

330
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,030
This stuff is good.

331
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,950
- Give it a try.
- I will.

332
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,430
You're right, it is good.

333
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,790
Guard. Exactly.

334
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,240
Nari.

335
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,190
Here's some tea for you.

336
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:15,120
Never expected to see you here, Akemi. It's sorta refreshing.

337
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,540
And you're like a different man entirely.

338
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,180
I own the place, see? I've got a reputation to upkeep.

339
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,940
So, what brings you here?

340
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,560
Well...

341
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,450
I wanted to ask about Hokomi.

342
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,100
Should she really become a professional?

343
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,220
Will she truly be all right?

344
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,550
Nari, you'll make sure to protect Hokomi, won't you?

345
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,890
I can't make any promises, not even to you, Akemi.

346
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,410
Of course, we'll help her however we can.

347
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:00,980
I'll support her to the best of my abilities.

348
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:06,330
But on the ring, anything can happen.

349
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,480
It's a battlefield up there.

350
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,960
A battlefield, is it?

351
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,830
It must be exciting for the ones up there.

352
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,460
It's just...

353
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,940
I wish she would think about her family, down here.

354
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:35,570
Who would've thought my Hokomi would take to martial arts?

355
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,450
Cheers.

356
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,080
- Hello?
- Hey.

357
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,110
Sorry to interrupt.

358
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,760
<i>It's fine.</i>

359
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,640
How's work been?

360
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,160
<i>Smooth sailing?</i>

361
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,040
You could say that.

362
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,340
<i>So, you're actually making strides. I'm happy for you.</i>

363
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,240
Thanks.

364
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,070
So? Was that all?

365
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,990
Can't you be a bit more sociable?

366
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,290
Yeah.

367
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,570
<i>Whatever, listen up.</i>

368
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,010
I need to ask you for a favor.

369
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,590
A favor?

370
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,210
Oh!

371
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,850
Thanks again for coming, Mr. Photographer.

373
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,920
Say something, why don't you.

374
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,990
Where's Hokko?

375
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,530
She isn't here. She's off training in Hakone with Kanbe.

376
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,920
I see.

377
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,150
You wanted to see her.

378
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,880
No.

379
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,010
There you are, Kairi. Thanks again.

380
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,250
Sure thing.

381
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,230
Hello, I'm Hokomi Sato's younger sister.

382
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,720
Hello there.

383
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,800
Oh!

384
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,960
Mr. Kairi!

385
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

386
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,210
- Welcome, Sayami and Mimi.
- Good to see you, Mr. Nari.

387
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,270
Pops, you know them?

388
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,580
He's a regular at our place.

389
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,260
- Right?
- Right.

390
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,870
Ms. Yui.

391
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,140
Thank you for training our Hokomi.

392
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,510
Of course, it's always a pleasure.

393
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,650
One-two. One-two. One-two.

394
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,010
You got it.

395
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,410
Twist your body, and throw that into a punch.

396
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,120
Yes, great pose!

397
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,900
You look adorable!

398
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,620
The absolute cutest!

399
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,750
Punch! Yes!

400
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,130
Amazing shot.

401
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:51,280
<i>Say, Hanegi!</i>

402
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,460
Got it.

403
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,280
All right, who here had fun today?

404
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,160
<i>Me!</i>

405
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,790
If you're ever interested in boxing, come again. Okay?

406
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,020
<i>Okay!</i>

407
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,430
Thank you for attending our workshop today.

408
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:07,390
<i>Thank you!</i>

409
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,960
Come and give me your gloves.

410
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,440
I'll take that banner, too. Thanks.

411
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,350
Did you get any good shots?

412
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,890
Looking good.

413
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,210
Thank you.

414
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,790
<i>Sato, I've always loved you.</i>

415
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,810
Why didn't you ask to have another chance?

416
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,920
Huh?

417
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,680
Hokomi was forcing herself to act okay.

418
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,190
So, why?

419
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,240
Don't tell me you're fine with letting things end like this.

420
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,720
Of course not.

421
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,710
What?

422
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,210
Ms. Yui.

423
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,180
- Hello there.
- What brings you here today?

424
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,470
Mr. Oba.

425
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,510
- Hello.
- What's the occasion?

426
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,430
Ms. Yui invited me to give boxing a shot.

427
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,270
Mr. Oba, boxing...

428
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,040
Hokomi would be delighted.

429
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,350
You think so?

430
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,800
Yes.

431
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,500
Excuse me one moment.

432
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,780
Hello?

433
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,440
<i>Sayami...</i>

434
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,850
<i>Help...</i>

435
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,540
Mom? What's wrong?

436
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,520
Mom?

437
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,110
Is everything okay?

438
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,320
What? Mom collapsed?

439
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,790
I'll be home right away.

440
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,990
<i>Don't bother.</i>

441
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,150
Huh?

442
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,200
She had a stomach ulcer.

443
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,350
A stomach ulcer?

444
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,200
She just needs to take it easy at home for a week.

445
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,940
I see.

446
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,170
<i>Besides, we've got some helpers on hand.</i>

447
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:52,370
<i>In any case, you don't have to rush home, Hokomi.</i>

448
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,830
Good luck training.

449
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,260
- "Helpers"?
- Goodness me.

450
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,270
You two, thanks for assisting me to the hospital.

451
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,290
Of course.

452
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:10,200
Mr. Oba, what a model gentleman you are.

453
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,820
You flatter me.

454
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,640
I'm the one who drove to the hospital though.

455
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,650
I certainly wasn't expecting to see you, Mr. Kairi.

456
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,780
I happened to be in the area when you called.

457
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,150
Then you're free to leave now.

458
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,530
I'll be staying to help open the shop.

459
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,200
You would? Really?

460
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,410
Of course.

461
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,150
You must rest, ma'am.

462
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,350
It isn't a "must".

463
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,300
She only needs to take it easy.

464
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,810
Oh, right.

465
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,050
- You're so adorable, Mr. Oba.
- So cute.

466
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,360
My mistake.

467
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,660
I'll help as well.

468
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,870
- Really?
- I'll do anything.

469
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:52,790
In that case, could I ask you two to start by sweeping the floors?

470
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,900
- Right.
- Of course.

471
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,740
- Please, stay seated.
- No, you can rest.

472
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,060
- I'll handle this.
- Leave it to me.

473
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,520
- You'll get tired.
- As will you.

474
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,750
- Please, I insist.
- I've got this.

475
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,760
- Let me.
- No, let me.

476
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,260
- Really.
- I insist.

477
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,930
Can someone just sweep the floors, please?

478
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,900
<i>[Bar Akemi]</i>

479
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,100
Thank you both for your hard work today.

480
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,930
You were a big help.

481
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,080
Here, drink. It's my treat.

482
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,500
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

483
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,240
Excuse me, the mayor is calling.

484
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,530
Good evening, sir.

485
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,640
What a put-together worker he is.

486
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,890
Say, Mr. Kairi.

487
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,270
I wanted to ask about Hokomi.

488
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,620
Huh?

489
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,300
Do you think she should truly become a professional boxer?

490
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,250
What do you mean?

491
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,810
To be frank with you, I'm a bit conflicted about it all.

492
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:03,210
And I don't know if I can support her with these worries of mine.

493
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,240
Because, you know.

494
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,140
Boxing can cause irreversible incidents.

495
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,090
Isn't that right?

496
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,840
Even so, please be there to support her.

497
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,140
Hokko is truly amazing, ma'am.

498
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:29,020
To be certified this quickly is an impressive and arduous feat.

499
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,270
You two broke up six months ago, yes?

500
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,650
You seem quite set on defending her.

501
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,650
Hokomi told me you've chosen to prioritize your job. Is that true?

502
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,360
That girl may act like she's allright,

503
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,940
but when you told her so, she was incredibly depressed.

504
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,530
It was honestly a struggle to watch.

505
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,930
Tell me the truth.

506
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,520
Mr. Kairi.

507
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,860
You still love Hokomi, don't you?

508
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,470
I see.

509
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,360
In that case...

510
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,190
Why won't you honestly tell her how you feel?

511
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,000
Maybe, somewhere deep down,

512
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,030
do you think Hokomi...

513
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,350
is better off with Mr. Oba?

514
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:50,100
She's always helping me, in one way or another.

515
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,380
Hokko has always been there to support me.

516
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,640
Her strong encouragement has allowed me to make strides.

517
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,240
But that makes me no match for her.

518
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:12,040
I've only made her cry

519
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,610
and harbor bitter feelings.

520
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,450
She would be happier with someone else.

521
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,040
After all...

522
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,780
I am a scumbag.

523
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:35,130
But it's all right, I know Mr. Oba is better for her.

524
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,440
What is this...

525
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,570
I feel so miffed right now.

526
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,080
- What?
- Don't go making those decisions on your own.

527
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,520
You see, I-

528
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,270
Not that my personal anecdotes really matter,

529
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:57,820
but I've dated many scumbags in my life.

530
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,960
And I've been hurt as many times.

531
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,720
But I've never regretted a single one of those relationships.

532
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,640
You know why?

533
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,480
- No.
- It's because all those men were men I chose.

534
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,440
I chose them. It was my decision, my life.

535
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,440
So, no matter what happened, I never regretted any of it.

536
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,590
Ever.

537
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,210
Hokomi is my daughter.

538
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,080
Even if we seem like complete opposites,

539
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,640
there are similarities if you look.

540
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,600
So, I know I'm getting my words twisted up.

541
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:40,140
But if you're backing off, that's just to shelter your own heart.

542
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,240
Hokomi's life is made of her decisions

543
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,410
and her choices.

544
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,110
You have no say in it.

545
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:57,890
All you can do is to tell Hokomi...

546
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,200
exactly how you feel.

547
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,280
That. Is. All.

548
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,950
Who she "ought" to stay with?

549
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:13,170
That is not your choice. That is Hokomi's choice.

550
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,860
But then...

551
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,580
Hokko won't be happy.

552
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,550
I already told you.

553
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,910
That is also Hokomi's choice.

554
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,630
This is important, so one moment.

555
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:41,480
Your standard for "happiness" is not universal.

556
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,730
Hokomi's happiness is something she will choose for herself.

557
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,840
But...

558
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,020
Who cares if you're a scumbag?

559
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:59,380
No one's perfect in this world.

560
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,170
And I must say.

561
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,230
Don't underestimate my daughter like that.

562
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,040
She began boxing to punch you.

563
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,540
She kept training while you were gone

564
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,340
and even got herself certified.

565
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,550
Do you realize how strong that makes her?

566
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:24,030
She's got more than enough spirit to accept a scumbag like you.

567
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:27,710
Is there any other girl like her out there?

568
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,630
Are you just...

569
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,770
going to let a girl like her go?

570
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,540
I don't want to let her go.

571
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:55,770
Then all you need to do... is tell her.

572
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,700
I feel relieved after letting that all out.

573
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,510
This is something she's serious about.

574
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:21,820
All I can do is cheer her on, no matter how terrified I am.

575
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,610
