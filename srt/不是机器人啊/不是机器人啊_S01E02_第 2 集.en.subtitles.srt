00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,226
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING
SANTA MARIA

2
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,067
The signal is unstable.

3
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,361
This is Team Alpha. We are in position.

4
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,989
Sending Wi-Fi signal.

5
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,116
Team Alpha?

6
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,286
You didn't check for her phone.
You don't deserve a team name.

7
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,413
We're on a special mission today.

8
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:39,330
All right.

9
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:40,999
Everyone, get ready.

10
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,440
I love you, master. How...

11
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,359
My goodness!

12
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,826
What happened?

13
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,620
Pai.

14
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,371
It wasn't me.

15
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,043
Is that the nasty jerk?

16
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,170
Why is he here?

17
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,381
Then, am I at his house?

18
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,051
Wait, what did I just say?

19
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,012
What should I do? Does he know?

20
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,102
DIRECTOR KIM MIN-GYU

21
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,021
Tell him I'm dead.

22
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,524
That I got a big bang to my face.

23
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,609
-Okay.
-No, don't.

24
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,031
Yes, Director Kim.

25
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,242
Instead of saying, "I love you, master,"

26
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,411
this robot just said, "My goodness!"

27
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,624
Was she just about to swear at me?

28
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,421
Well, let me explain.

29
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,425
The thing is...

30
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,802
FRIEND MODE

31
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,887
She's in Friend Mode. Yes, that's right.

32
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,681
Friend Mode.

33
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,184
Aji 3 has Operation Mode and Friend Mode.

34
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,896
But I think a small error
made Aji 3 suddenly operate

35
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,523
on Friend Mode.

36
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,150
"Friend Mode"?

37
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,903
And I think she picked up
a few swear words

38
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,575
from the researchers when they tried
to install Friend Mode on her.

39
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,287
There's a power button
on the back of her neck.

40
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,580
Try rebooting her.

41
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,499
Then I'm sure she'll go back
to Operation Mode.

42
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,543
Yes. Bye, then.

43
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,505
You heard what I just said, right?

44
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,965
Please don't mess up this time.

45
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,510
We're doomed.

46
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,345
He'll never believe that.

47
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,348
I know. He has an IQ level of 159.

48
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,312
"Friend Mode"?

49
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,981
How dare you?

50
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,109
Do you think I'll let you be my friend?

51
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,446
Should I just beat him up and quit this?

52
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,698
Ten million won.

53
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,700
Ten million won.

54
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,629
Let's just wait until this job is over.

55
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,965
I'm going to kill Hong Baek-gyun.

56
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,766
I love you, master. How may I help you?

57
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,604
I love you, master. How may I help you?

58
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,066
Rebooting worked.

59
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,902
I thought you were supposed to be
an AI robot.

60
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,779
But you're no different
from a household appliance.

61
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,781
Aji 3.

62
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:04,661
How can you prove that you're an AI robot?

63
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,748
How can you prove that you're human?

64
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:13,253
How can you prove that you're human?

65
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,216
That's a nice answer.

66
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,219
But your Operation Mode started off
with an error.

67
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,305
You already got minus points.

68
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,894
I can't believe he just bought that.

69
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,483
Ssanip, he already saw
the real robotic figure of Aji 3.

70
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,318
So he probably can't even imagine

71
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,570
that what's in front of him
is a human being.

72
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,115
He can't see the truth
because he's too sure of himself.

73
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,992
Invisible Gorilla Experiment!

74
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,660
OVERLOOKING SOMETHING
BY FOCUSING ON ANOTHER

75
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,537
Doctor Hong, there's an input error.

76
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,456
That's because Ji-a didn't read
what she was supposed to at first.

77
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,458
Aji 3 has been confused ever since then.

78
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,295
Pai, set Ji-a's answers
as the preferred value.

79
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,254
Okay.

80
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,758
Now, it won't be too difficult for her
to pass the test.

81
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,137
You're right. Let's hope
the electricity doesn't go out.

82
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,600
No.

83
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,771
What?

84
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,942
What's going on? Why isn't this working?

85
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,036
Aji 3.

86
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,664
From this moment on...

87
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,667
I'm going to be testing your hardware.

88
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,171
What? Do I have to answer his questions
on my own?

89
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,381
My gosh, what do I do?
What am I supposed to say?

90
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,052
Yes, master.

91
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,011
Sit down.

92
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,807
Stand up.

93
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,101
Raise your right foot.

94
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,271
Keep it there and raise your left hand.

95
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,314
Raise your right hand.

96
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,483
Raise your left hand twice
and raise it again.

97
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,401
Raise your left hand twice
and raise it again.

98
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,788
You...

99
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,923
You are more and more disappointing.

100
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,716
Minus two points.

101
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,385
Next.

102
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,520
Ji-a seemed like a tenacious person.

103
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,647
I'm sure she'll do well.

104
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,191
She has an IQ level of 94.

105
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,361
Our fate is in the hands of someone
with an IQ level of 94.

106
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,904
I must have been crazy.

107
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,531
We're going to get caught.

108
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,158
He's definitely going to find out.

109
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,787
I'm going to test your cognitive

110
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,124
and problem-solving ability
with just one task.

111
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,384
First, solve this calculus problem.

112
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,803
Multiply the total numbers of each fruit.

113
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,306
Find out how many ingredients
were used to make that pasta.

114
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,851
Then add up all the results
and divide that by three.

115
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,562
When you have the answer,
round it off to the nearest whole number.

116
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,772
That's the passcode of that lock.

117
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,234
I want you to find out what's in that box.

118
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,822
My IQ level is 94.

119
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,657
I'll give you three minutes.

120
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,326
You'll get minus points
every exceeding second.

121
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,204
I gave up on learning mathematics
a long time ago.

122
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,664
Ready...

123
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,541
go.

124
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,404
I just need to get the answer right.

125
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,240
The answer is an egg, master.

126
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,333
How can a robot have the ability
to solve a problem

127
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,876
like Nicolaus Copernicus?

128
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,878
I can't believe this.

129
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,006
Whatever that means,
it sounds like a compliment. Let's smile.

130
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,510
Okay, fine.

131
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,470
Let's see if you can do this as well.

132
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,932
I want you to peel that egg
in ten seconds.

133
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,475
But you can't use any tools--

134
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,900
I can't believe this.

135
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,861
This is the Egg of Columbus.

136
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,659
I didn't know this robot
would be so creative and smart.

137
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,495
How sad.

138
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,331
It's my first time hearing someone
say I'm smart.

139
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,333
And it came out of this lunatic's mouth.

140
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,548
My gosh, I'm so curious.

141
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,508
I want to know...

142
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,927
what's going on inside that house.

143
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,554
If she got caught,

144
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,514
he would've thrown her out of the house.

145
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,058
One hour to go.

146
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,602
Aji, please hang in there
for just one more hour.

147
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,729
I have credit card bills to pay.

148
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,606
Aji would've made it.

149
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,775
But we're talking about Ji-a.

150
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,540
If he asks you anything
in a foreign language, say this.

151
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,877
There's currently an error
in my foreign language function.

152
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,963
Please try again after you fix the error.

153
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,549
You were doing well.
What's with the error again?

154
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,886
Fine. I'm going to test
your internet searching skills.

155
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,929
Aji 3.

156
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:01,142
I want you to tell me the serial number
of that figure in the middle.

157
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,935
If you exceed ten seconds, I'll--

158
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,855
The serial number is NC-674865.

159
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,316
As MGG Games released
their new game worldwide,

160
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,318
they also included
a limited edition figure.

161
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,447
And only 50 figures
were released in Korea two days ago.

162
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,533
I went through so much
to get you that rare item.

163
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,786
Your internet searching skills
are impressive.

164
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,749
Plus five points.

165
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,127
But you dared to run away
without paying me?

166
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,884
But I noticed...

167
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,512
something weird about you...

168
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,849
for a while now.

169
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,519
What? What is it? What's wrong?

170
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,273
Oh, I get it now.

171
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,525
I found out what's wrong.

172
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,820
Where is this jerk looking at?
You better look somewhere else.

173
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,995
Your breasts are bigger than yesterday.

174
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,164
They were always big.

175
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,332
Wait a minute.

176
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,376
Is it because her batteries are expanding?

177
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,962
-Let me open it.
-What are you looking at?

178
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,548
Stay still. I need to check.

179
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,552
What is he going to check?
Is this guy crazy or what?

180
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,887
Hey.

181
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,940
It's finally working now.

182
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,028
Hey, you lunatic.

183
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,947
You peanut-slathered-in-sesame oil.

184
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,408
Your face is as cute as a button.

185
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,743
But are you the rising star
of the psycho pervert world?

186
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,079
You must have lost your mind
somewhere in space.

187
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,497
Shall I get it back for you?

188
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,167
Do you want me to help you see
what it feels like to go head-down

189
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,628
into the Grand Canyon, you son of a witch?

190
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,175
My goodness.

191
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,763
Oh, dear.

192
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,519
What are you looking at?

193
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,897
If it weren't for the money,
I'd have killed you already.

194
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,087
Hello, Director Kim.

195
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,714
Who are you...

196
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,300
trying to fool?

197
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,761
It would be nonsensical
if he didn't catch on.

198
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,349
I apologize. The truth is...

199
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,228
Her battery.

200
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,397
You used a cheap battery.

201
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:55,900
What?

202
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,986
Isn't that why she's overheated
and swollen up there?

203
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:03,282
What'll you do if her chest explodes
or something?

204
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,285
Right.

205
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,664
We can't let that happen, no...

206
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,582
RUNNING TIME

207
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,877
Yes. So, it's the running time.

208
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,838
To extend the running time,

209
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,592
we installed a better battery
and that took up more space.

210
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,931
Overheating could be a problem,
so don't touch her breasts.

211
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,392
Are you sure?

212
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,561
What an idiot.

213
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,938
One more thing.

214
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,899
That Friend Mode started running again.

215
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,652
Must I restart her again?

216
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,529
No, no, while she's online,

217
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,657
you just have to tell her
to go back to Operation Mode.

218
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,116
Bye.

219
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,578
I can't do this.

220
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,750
I believe in not keeping people
who swear close to me.

221
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,129
Why do curses from a robot...

222
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,424
feel so refreshing and almost euphoric?

223
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,553
Is it because it's so creative?

224
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,305
It's because you're an idiot.

225
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,723
How strange.

226
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,185
Back to Operation Mode.

227
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,563
Yes, master.

228
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,277
Hello, Mr. Cho.

229
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,073
I have a report on the audit
of the head of Social Contributions.

230
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:31,328
He's been embezzling project funds
for the past three years.

231
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,664
Get his resignation.

232
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,334
-Me?
-Should I, then?

233
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,338
If he won't resign, tell him we'll sue him
for embezzlement.

234
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,177
There's one more lawsuit to lodge.

235
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,055
Your Wi-Fi isn't working. What did you do?

236
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,056
Come clean.

237
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,183
Don't worry, he hasn't caught on.

238
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,561
A robot can't speak or react

239
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,856
to something it has no input on,
I told you.

240
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,066
That's what I'm doing.

241
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,736
You're an avatar right now.

242
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,113
Just do as Aji 3 tells you, okay?

243
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,367
I will, most definitely,

244
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,412
sue the thief who stole my necklace.

245
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,749
This won't do. How long do we have left?

246
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,375
Thirty minutes.

247
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,378
Ssanip, Hoktal, use her battery
as an excuse to cut the time.

248
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,172
Go and get Aji 3 right now.

249
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,341
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING
SANTA MARIA

250
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:31,889
I'll find evidence of the theft
in my dashboard camera or something.

251
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,974
You just ready the papers.

252
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,271
Just wait, President Cho.

253
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,648
This is insane.

254
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,068
I will make sure you go to prison.

255
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,236
I didn't take your necklace.

256
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,239
Aji 3.

257
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,828
Now, I will test your morals.

258
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:59,667
A thief gave me damaged goods
and took my necklace.

259
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,836
Should I send the person to prison

260
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,756
or get my necklace back and forgive her?

261
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,134
According to 333 of the Penal Code,

262
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,054
the person can be charged
with under three years in prison.

263
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,347
To prevent a recurrence,

264
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,808
I recommend a lawsuit
rather than forgiveness.

265
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,897
You could victimize
an innocent being in the process.

266
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,275
Why don't you look back and see

267
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,861
if there was a misunderstanding
or mistake, master?

268
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,657
Why are you siding with the criminal
when I am your master?

269
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,159
You should always side with your master.

270
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,662
I am always on your side.

271
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,249
You could be wrong about things, master.

272
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,875
How dare you?

273
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,503
You keep calling me master

274
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,880
while saying things that get on my nerves.

275
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,425
I don't like that.

276
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,218
Minus 20 points.

277
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,100
What did I do so wrong?

278
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,218
What are you doing?

279
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,138
Aji 3 can't run like that. Stop running.

280
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,484
Are you okay?

281
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,840
What did you just...

282
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,344
do to me?

283
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,062
ANGRY, PLEASED

284
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,647
NO MATCHING EMOTION

285
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,482
NEW DEEP LEARNING PROJECT

286
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:41,620
I was fed with data
on the basic human facial expressions.

287
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:46,250
Just now, you were in a medical emergency
and required assistance.

288
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,504
If you train me well,
I can do many things for you.

289
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,223
Keep it there and raise your left hand.

290
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,474
What's that?

291
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,893
-Raise your left hand twice...
-My god.

292
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,186
Why can't she do that?

293
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,190
She'll break her back.

294
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,737
That scared me.

295
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,739
How ugly. What now?

296
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,580
I'm hungry.

297
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,541
How can you eat ramyeon
after causing this huge mess?

298
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,043
I didn't get caught.

299
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,421
I put up a good defense considering
that I was left to my own devices.

300
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,381
Do you even know what that means?

301
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,675
Do you know how much this project cost?

302
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,344
What's inside that head of yours?

303
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,305
Do you care about anything?
Do you even think?

304
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,144
What are you doing here?

305
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:30,854
Hello.

306
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,191
Why do you do things I didn't ask?
Think before you act.

307
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,532
I put you through a lot, didn't I?

308
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,201
You did great.

309
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,203
If we ever meet again,

310
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,913
I'll buy you all a drink.

311
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:48,872
Bye.

312
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,130
Change the robot's face.

313
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,799
I will, right away.

314
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,677
Why did I even use your face?
I had lost my mind.

315
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,519
They're way too different.

316
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,025
Sure. It's all in the past.

317
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,028
You paid me ten million won,
and now, we're even.

318
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,119
She always gets me riled up then leaves.

319
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,830
She's still exactly the same.

320
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,040
How can she not change at all?

321
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,091
Let's break up.

322
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,176
Take care.

323
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,857
She's the same.

324
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,859
She's exactly the same.

325
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,094
What's up?

326
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,805
Sale of Daeyang Shipbuilding's
R&D team is canceled.

327
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,600
The price Bold Group suggested
is unacceptable.

328
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,269
What do you mean?
We're signing the contract tomorrow.

329
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:43,111
I left the takeover
of Daeyang Shipbuilding up to you.

330
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:48,492
However, I don't think
you're good enough yet for such work.

331
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,285
Min-gyu.

332
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,330
Min-gyu...

333
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,214
This is the beef thin skirt.

334
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,673
This is the beef thick skirt.

335
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,008
This is a neck chain.

336
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:09,930
Lay out a piece of beef brisket
instead of lettuce.

337
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,933
Put on some thick skirt.

338
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,018
Top it with a spoon of doenjang.

339
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,438
Wrap it with the brisket
and put it in your mouth in one bite.

340
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,947
We have food at home.
It's a waste of money to eat out.

341
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,032
This isn't for you.

342
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,576
It's for my nephew
that you're pregnant with.

343
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,911
Thanks, girl.

344
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,997
I'm sorry about yesterday.

345
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,375
I'm the one to apologize.

346
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,253
I also paid off my loan.

347
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,671
With what money?

348
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,758
I suddenly got money out of nowhere,
in an unpleasant way.

349
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,844
How so? I want some, too.

350
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,471
By the way, is this yours?

351
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,640
While doing laundry,
I found it in your pocket.

352
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,977
That's the necklace.

353
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,813
If you appear now,

354
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,567
I'll completely embarrass myself
in front of that nasty jerk.

355
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,209
She must be scared that I might sue her.

356
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,719
What?

357
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,944
Apologize,
and I'll give the necklace back to you.

358
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:48,904
What?

359
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,405
Apologize?

360
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,033
You accused me of being a crook
and beat me.

361
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,744
It was unfair, so I deserve your apology.

362
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,622
You're joking, right?

363
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,707
No apology, no necklace. Understand?

364
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,210
Why don't you beg for money instead?

365
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,794
Then I'll consider it.

366
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:08,215
You lied about stealing my necklace.

367
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,509
Are you asking me to apologize
when you lied to me?

368
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,637
That's nonsense. My necklace?

369
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,763
Break it if you'd like.

370
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,806
However, remember this.

371
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,477
I'll find you and make you pay
no matter what.

372
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,397
Then your life will be destroyed.

373
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,607
So give it a try.

374
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,108
Listen, you fool.

375
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,612
Are you sure that you have a brain
inside your head?

376
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,780
What did you say?

377
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,949
Why can't you believe me?

378
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,951
Why do you distort the truth?

379
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,702
I hurt my back because of you.

380
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,122
If I needed money, I would've asked you
to pay my medical bills.

381
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,459
I said that I didn't take your necklace
because I didn't remember taking it.

382
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:48,255
Now that I found it,
I called to return it to you.

383
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,216
You don't have friends
or anything, do you?

384
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,801
It's completely obvious.

385
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,971
You're right.
I don't have people in my life.

386
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,724
I prefer to be with robots
than be around someone like you.

387
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,644
What about me?
What makes that robot better than me?

388
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,355
What?

389
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:10,527
I'm about to ship it to you,
so send me the address within a minute.

390
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,655
Otherwise, I'll throw away the necklace.

391
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,701
Throw it away?

392
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,662
Hello? Hey.

393
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,664
You're completely insane, President Cho!

394
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,542
Is she out of her mind?

395
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:41,266
Gosh, the light came on.

396
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,980
I sacrificed my soul to make this.

397
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,399
Thank you so much.

398
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,109
You're such a genius.

399
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,488
All I need is a good presentation.

400
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:59,242
I hope KM Financial will select me.

401
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,286
I want to be selected.

402
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,263
What?

403
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:24,059
A robot saved my life?

404
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,272
I guess she was useful in a way.

405
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,037
Move more to the left.

406
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,497
More to the left. That's right.

407
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,707
That feels good. Can you go lower?

408
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,377
That feels so good.
Can you scratch the right?

409
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,128
Go lower.

410
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,524
If you train me,
I can do more for you, master.

411
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,276
That's right.

412
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,405
This was the robot I needed.

413
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:24,744
Shall I give it a try and train a robot?

414
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,833
What?

415
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,210
The part went to Africa?

416
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,629
It takes one day from Japan.
Why did it go to Africa?

417
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,797
They put down...

418
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,258
the wrong address.

419
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,634
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

420
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,596
It takes at least five days from Africa.

421
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,889
Goodness.

422
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,687
DIRECTOR KIM MIN-GYU

423
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,818
-Yes, Director Kim.
-The robot exceeded my expectation.

424
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,029
It was impressive. I applaud you.

425
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,532
That's why...

426
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,744
I'd like to postpone making a decision
for a month.

427
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,745
Pardon me?

428
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,747
I'd like to train the robot.

429
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,290
You said it takes one month.

430
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:14,169
Send Aji 3 home tomorrow.
I'll keep it for a month.

431
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,588
That's...

432
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,007
impossible.

433
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,676
Is there a problem?

434
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,970
It's because...

435
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,222
we have to move.

436
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,810
The rental agreement is over,
so we have to find a new place.

437
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,980
It'll be possible after a week.

438
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,274
I can keep Aji 3 at my house.

439
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,444
No, it has to be charged
for 12 hours every day.

440
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,280
Charging is only possible
at the laboratory.

441
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,951
I'll send someone
to bring Aji 3 every day.

442
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,203
That's impossible.

443
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,539
It might get broken
when left with someone else.

444
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,335
Aren't I the owner...

445
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,045
of Aji 3?

446
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,797
I'm also the owner
until the contract is signed.

447
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,508
I'll send it to you after a week.

448
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,221
I'll call you later.

449
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,847
Goodbye.

450
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:23,154
X-FILE OF DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING'S
LATE PARK SEONG-JIN WANTED

451
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:33,998
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

452
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,001
You should watch out, too.

453
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,964
Do you know what we call Mr. Baton?

454
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,804
The Jordan River Express
to the afterworld.

455
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,723
Mr. Baton is the son
of the first chairman.

456
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:54,143
The current CEO's the son
of the current chairman.

457
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,229
However capable Mr. Baton is,

458
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:59,023
the current chairman's son
is bound to prevail.

459
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,901
So please, before you cross
the Jordan River,

460
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,405
Exodus, try to get out.

461
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,073
The Jordan River.

462
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,335
Get in.

463
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,548
In the back.

464
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,804
I'm coming in.

465
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,273
I apologize.

466
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,152
The head of the Social
Contribution Team resigned.

467
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,697
Did you suspend all the projects
the team was working on?

468
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,532
The venture investment's almost--

469
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,409
-Suspend that, too.
-Yes, sir.

470
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,620
We're checking cameras
to identify the necklace thief--

471
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,829
Forget about that.

472
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,498
Look at the data next to you.

473
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,959
Yes, sir.

474
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,005
Daeyang Shipbuilding's late
Chairman Park Seong-jin

475
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,215
was very interested
in robots for the future,

476
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,467
but the board objected.

477
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,011
How come no one knew about this?

478
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,765
So he made a secret deal
with Doctor Hong Baek-gyun.

479
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,224
By creating Santa Maria

480
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,018
to look like he was developing
shipbuilding tech?

481
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,646
All internal documents went straight
to the chairman.

482
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:23,816
So after Chairman Park died,
the team's existence went unnoticed.

483
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,110
That's why the due diligence
didn't turn anything up.

484
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:30,239
When the team had been budgeted
as much as 100 billion won.

485
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:34,535
The other R&D teams might need
to be reinvestigated.

486
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,204
Shall I report to you?

487
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:44,253
This is a secret that only you and I know.

488
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,547
What I want to know

489
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:51,427
is who else knows about this and how much.

490
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,641
I would like you to find that out for me.

491
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,142
Focus on...

492
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,770
CEO Hwang Yu-cheol,

493
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,897
Chairman Hwang Do-won,

494
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,816
and their allies.

495
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,069
The Jordan River Express
to the afterworld.

496
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,280
The Jordan River Express.

497
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,913
Well, the Inspection Team...

498
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,541
Shall I make you head
of the Inspection Team?

499
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,710
No, sir.

500
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,754
I will find out what I can.

501
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:28,923
Very well.

502
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,593
There's something you must do
before you start.

503
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,724
Okay, so...

504
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,560
He wants us to move in?

505
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,478
I'll give you some advice.

506
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,814
When the director makes a suggestion,

507
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:48,609
it's best to accept it
as predetermined fate and go with it.

508
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,570
It'll make it much easier.

509
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,405
What if I were to refuse?

510
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,158
The director will decide

511
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,951
whether to invest in you further
or sell you off

512
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,620
depending on the result of this test.

513
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,541
If your laboratory is sold
to another company...

514
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,753
this team is most likely to be disbanded.

515
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,971
KIM MYEONG-HOON
YOON SOO-JEONG

516
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,682
It's been...

517
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,268
already 15 years.

518
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,231
If Dad was alive,

519
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,318
he would be 60 years old this year.

520
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,697
Mom.

521
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,658
I'm still...

522
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,745
very much...

523
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,498
alive.

524
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,217
I came to pay my respects as well.

525
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,512
I see I must come here to see you.

526
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,682
So...

527
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,644
Yu-cheol has been having a tough time.

528
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,772
He's nothing compared to you,
and I know that.

529
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,943
But still, he's been your friend
for many years.

530
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:16,364
He's trying to make his mark as the CEO.

531
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,826
Can you, as a friend, support him?

532
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,039
I don't have...

533
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,500
that much influence.

534
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,461
Chairman Hwang.

535
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,885
I have things to do. Goodbye.

536
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:04,203
Beep. Are you there?

537
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:08,541
Beep. I am right here.

538
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,462
This is so fascinating in person.

539
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,214
You did great.

540
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,635
Hello?

541
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,221
Yes, I'm Cho Ji-a.

542
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,267
What did you just say?

543
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,477
The judging's been postponed indefinitely?

544
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,314
That means it's as good as canceled.

545
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,317
Who made such a nonsensical decision?

546
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,699
It was the head of the board of directors.

547
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,410
The person in charge of KM Financial.

548
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,623
I just don't believe this.

549
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,543
I had a feeling it was going
way too smoothly.

550
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,087
Am I destined to have roadblocks
at every turn?

551
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,423
Can't I have a smooth sail for once?

552
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,883
Give up.

553
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,595
The minions have no power
to overturn what the boss decides.

554
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,306
Hey.

555
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,018
I just have to make the boss
overturn his own decision.

556
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,188
Are you drunk already?

557
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,856
How can you do that?

558
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,526
With a letter full of flattery.

559
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:22,240
Let's take a flattering letter to the boss
and ask for his support.

560
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,699
The second you get there,

561
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,952
you'll get dragged out
by the back of your collar.

562
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,329
Don't go to his office.

563
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,582
Send it directly to the boss' house.

564
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,292
Don't you know his address?

565
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,170
-No.
-Right, you don't.

566
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,299
Let me check my list of ex-boyfriends.

567
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,385
There was a Google genius.

568
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,685
I had no idea an ex-boyfriend
would come in so handy.

569
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,103
You should find some more.

570
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,233
Turn right at the next junction.

571
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,110
Okay, turning right.

572
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,497
Is this it?

573
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,500
Yes, this is it.

574
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,045
I don't see a house.

575
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,672
What is that if not a house?

576
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,924
This is a house and not a hotel?

577
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,635
There are no hotels here.

578
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,263
This is Director Kim Min-gyu's house.

579
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,140
If he lives in such a huge place,

580
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,559
will leaving this in the mailbox

581
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,145
can guarantee that it gets to his desk?

582
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,147
Will you send it to his office, then?

583
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,108
-Find the doorbell.
-To go inside?

584
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,319
We came this far to do something.

585
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,779
Who knows? He might be really impressed.

586
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,533
Where is the doorbell?

587
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,119
What a huge gate.

588
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,915
My goodness.

589
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,608
What's that nasty jerk doing here?

590
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,031
That...

591
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,327
That nasty jerk is the boss
of KM Financial?

592
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,207
I just don't believe it.

593
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:41,420
How can things be so utterly
and disgustingly twisted?

594
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,383
I get beaten up, called a thief,

595
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,176
become victim to a pervert.

596
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:51,680
That psycho freeloader is the boss?

597
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,274
Seon-hye, I saved that guy's life.

598
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,943
Shall I say he owes me?

599
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,695
That was the robot, not you.

600
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,242
This is how the little mermaid felt.

601
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:15,371
I know how it feels
to not be able to say I saved him.

602
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,705
I know.

603
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,499
After writing such a desperate letter.

604
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,794
He's the kind of scumbag
that a letter like mine won't work on.

605
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,380
Cho Ji-a, come out here.

606
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,800
What for?

607
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,680
I repaid the money, didn't I?

608
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,306
Where did you get that money?

609
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,185
I got it from somewhere.

610
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,895
Where could you get ten million won
in one day?

611
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,481
I worked for it part-time and legally.

612
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,900
Let's talk later. I'm really tired.

613
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,861
That doesn't make sense.

614
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,029
Tell the truth.
Did you go to a loan shark?

615
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,949
Or did you sign away one of your organs?

616
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,995
Tell me so we can sort things out.

617
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,998
I know you're smart
because you're a lawyer,

618
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,960
but all sorts of weird
and crazy things happen in this world.

619
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,880
The world you live in
isn't the only one there is.

620
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,509
Why are you going into my room?

621
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,682
What are you doing?
Don't go through my things.

622
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,225
I told you to stop.

623
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:22,062
Jin-bae, let's talk outside.

624
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,192
I told you to better yourself
and find a job.

625
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,166
Is this it? You wasted ten million won
on this crap?

626
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,293
Jin Bae, don't touch those.

627
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,795
I would rather let you hit me instead.

628
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,297
Where did you get the money?

629
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,882
Tell the truth.

630
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,301
I said I got a part-time job!

631
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,928
You won't tell the truth?

632
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,019
Get out.

633
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,563
If you won't tell me
where you got the money,

634
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,315
take that garbage and leave.

635
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,284
My heart lamps.

636
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,330
It's broken.

637
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,210
You're really harsh.

638
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,712
Did I ever go to a loan shark?

639
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,589
Did I ever do anything bad?

640
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,591
I didn't, I said I didn't!

641
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,886
You never did anything
to earn my trust, you brat.

642
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,264
I put my heart into this.

643
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,057
This was my last hope.

644
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,560
Why won't you accept me?

645
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,563
What I want, what I want to do,

646
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,190
why don't you accept me,
why don't you care?

647
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,109
Can't you care about me now?

648
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:53,237
I'm sick of putting up with your antics.

649
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,907
If you want to do what you want,
go to where I don't have to see you!

650
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,121
Okay.

651
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,375
I'll leave. I can't live with you anymore.

652
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,339
Ji-a.

653
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,842
You can't leave like that.

654
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,177
You know he doesn't mean what he said.

655
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,345
Come back inside.

656
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,473
Don't worry. I'll go to Seon-hye's.

657
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,019
It's best I don't see Jin-bae for a while.

658
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,396
We'll just drive each other crazy.

659
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:32,860
Hello.

660
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:36,572
The landlord wants us
to empty the warehouse by today.

661
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,824
I forgot to tell you earlier today.

662
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:42,786
It's okay.
Thanks for keeping my stuff for me.

663
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,204
Don't mention it.

664
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:52,671
Nothing's as heartbreaking
as unsold inventory.

665
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:56,842
President Cho, don't get too attached
and sell everything for cheap.

666
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,012
-Sir.
-What?

667
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,305
Do you have a cart?

668
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,899
Hello, have a look.

669
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,193
Come and have a look.

670
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,404
Just 30 thousand won.
Everything here is 30 thousand won each.

671
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,449
Just 30 thousand for a furry onesie

672
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:24,036
that lets you clean the floor
while you roll around.

673
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,247
The gorilla backpack with a cup holder
is also just 30 thousand won.

674
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,248
Have a look.

675
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,834
Hello, everything you see
is ten thousand won each.

676
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,670
Hello, have a look.

677
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,296
-Just ten thousand.
-No, thanks.

678
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,800
Ma'am, it's just ten thousand won.
Give it a try.

679
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,844
No, thanks.
This will just end up in the trash.

680
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,101
Is that fun?

681
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,770
Is it fun?

682
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,045
What are you doing, princess?

683
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,428
My friend is new to the school.

684
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,763
She had hurt her foot.

685
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,975
It must be so hard to walk.

686
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:32,020
It would be nice if I could put wheels
on her shoes.

687
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,106
Did you see that?

688
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,567
Yes. I kept looking at her feet.

689
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:41,029
I like to look at cars,
and you like to look at people.

690
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,365
Do I look at people?

691
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,868
What's that good for?

692
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:52,166
That's fascinating. It really works.

693
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,377
Ji-a, did you really make that?

694
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,797
Yes. Dad and I made it
while drawing pictures.

695
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,299
It's really great.

696
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,552
KIM HONG-JU

697
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,513
Thank you, Ji-a. It's so convenient.

698
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:08,056
Don't mention it. We're friends.

699
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:16,064
Just like how Dad fixes cars,

700
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,735
you'll become someone
that does things that help people.

701
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,904
You definitely will.

702
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,864
I believe in you.

703
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,033
JUST TEN THOUSAND WON

704
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,764
M&A SCHEDULE

705
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,600
TO BE SOLD

706
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,769
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING R&D

707
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,489
Are you there?

708
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,387
We're all on your side, Ji-a.

709
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,598
Don't be angry.

710
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:59,186
Could you be our robot
for just a few more days?

711
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,607
You'll go there on your own will?

712
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,401
I want to sell my heart-shaped lamp.

713
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,613
I thought about it a thousand times,

714
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,948
and it's something people really need.

715
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,326
I'll do whatever I can

716
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:17,120
to make the guy hold the final judging.

717
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,538
How?

718
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:22,417
By showing him how gratifying it is

719
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,712
to support the youth
who want to start a business.

720
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,965
I'll make that nasty jerk

721
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,842
change his mind.

722
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,223
The text message didn't work.

723
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:39,768
If you'd treated her
just a little nicer...

724
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,311
I know.

725
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,648
Why did you have to say
those things to her?

726
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,485
Let's just become squatters.

727
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,861
He wouldn't kick us out.

728
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,571
We shouldn't be wasting time.

729
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,866
Let's go to Ji-a and beg her to--

730
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,416
I'll work for you.

731
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,379
For free.

732
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,881
How about a week?

733
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,299
What is...

734
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:13,719
your reason?

735
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,971
Why did he ask her that?

736
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,224
My reason is...

737
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,061
I think...

738
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,857
I took too much money,
and I feel bad about it.

739
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,317
I guess...

740
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,446
you were a little worried about me.

741
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,697
But only under one condition.

742
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,157
"Condition"?

743
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:38,201
-I need a place to stay and eat.
-What?

744
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,249
But we're going to...

745
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,250
MOVING CENTER

746
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:46,918
...move.

747
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,687
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING, SANTA MARIA

748
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,973
The Santa Maria Team...

749
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,392
disappeared, sir.

750
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,299
JEONG-SUK REMOVALS

751
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,013
-My gosh.
-I can't believe this.

752
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,097
This is so nice.

753
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,725
Hey, Ssanip. Look at this garden.

754
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,143
We can have barbecue parties now.

755
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,769
I bet there are a lot of vegetables here.

756
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,729
Vegetables!

757
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:13,064
We're finally going to be living
like human-beings.

758
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,442
Does that mean you've been living
like beasts until now?

759
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,110
No.

760
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,494
You can't park your car here.

761
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,372
We're moving into this house today.

762
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:34,252
No, it's not here.
Your place is all the way over there.

763
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,546
-My gosh.
-This can't be true.

764
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,719
-Let's take the car.
-Okay.

765
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,889
-Let's go.
-Okay.

766
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:56,483
I'm the butler who takes care
of this huge mansion.

767
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:01,446
And I'll be telling you
the rules you must keep.

768
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:02,739
Now, number one.

769
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,576
You must not roam around
wherever you wish.

770
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,705
You can't go wherever you want
just because this place is huge.

771
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:14,626
You need to stay within a 20-meter radius
from the annex.

772
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:17,379
That's as far as you can go.

773
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,422
You cannot go over that.

774
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,717
You can only use the main gate
when you're driving.

775
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:26,221
When you're not, you can use
the back gate that's near this annex.

776
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,223
To be more exact,

777
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:33,561
I'm saying you shouldn't appear
in Mr. Kim Min-gyu's sight.

778
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,357
What? What's this?

779
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,612
Can we order food? Can we order in?

780
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,031
Of course not.

781
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,158
We'll give you groceries.

782
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,911
So you're free to cook whatever you want.

783
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,497
That's rule number four.

784
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,960
I hope we get along while you're here.

785
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,753
Please don't forget to keep these rules.

786
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,263
Open the bag.

787
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:11,683
My gosh, we're being treated like slaves
from the Joseon Dynasty.

788
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,853
-What is this?
-We're not beggars, Doctor Hong.

789
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,814
My gosh, I almost suffocated to death.

790
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,193
Is this where we're staying?

791
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,072
He lives in a mansion.

792
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,616
I can't believe he gave us
this tiny storage room.

793
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,661
Such humanitarian.

794
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,955
I wonder if we can see him from here.

795
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,542
Stop it. Don't open it. He'll see you.

796
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,670
My gosh, he can't see anything
because of all the trees.

797
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,591
Pai, check if there are any CCTVs outside,
and get rid of them.

798
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,468
Hoktal. Ssanip. Let's unpack.

799
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,886
-Okay.
-Okay.

800
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,137
Wait!

801
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,183
-Let's eat.
-What?

802
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,477
I only had one condition.

803
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,937
You agreed to feed me
and give me a place to stay.

804
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,942
Beetle.

805
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,319
Beetle.

806
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,032
Is this also a robot?

807
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:12,077
It might not seem so,
but it's an AI robot.

808
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,995
Its name is Beetle.

809
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,706
It goes around and receives Wi-Fi signals.

810
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,793
It also carries things for us.
How should I explain it?

811
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,629
It's the cutest and youngest member
of our research team.

812
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,423
Hoktal and Pai worked
on making it together.

813
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,342
Is Pai older than you?

814
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,303
You must've started school
earlier than your peers.

815
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,388
She graduated really early.

816
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,349
She skipped a few grades

817
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,184
and graduated from university by age 17.

818
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,436
You could call her a genius.

819
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,855
Who's not a genius here?

820
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,360
-Me.
-Gosh, stop it.

821
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:50,198
You guys call each other by nicknames.
What do they all mean?

822
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:54,077
Have you seen Planet of the Apes?
He got his nickname from that.

823
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,288
That ignorant mouth of yours.
Do you see this?

824
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,457
Doesn't his mouth look so cheap?
Therefore, Ssanip.

825
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,376
I see why you're Pai.

826
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,503
It's from apple pie? Or walnut pie?

827
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,214
Her nickname refers to pi.

828
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:08,299
She starts reciting it when stressed.

829
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,094
-Fungus.
-Hey.

830
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,887
He also has a nickname.

831
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,597
It's Fungus. Red Fungus and White Fungus.

832
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,183
He's Red Fungus when he's angry.
And normally, he's White Fungus.

833
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,309
You little...

834
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:21,980
Do you think it's funny?

835
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,610
What? It's a month past
the expiration date.

836
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,821
We've had two months once. It's fine.

837
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:32,240
Proper vacuum packaging
guarantees six months.

838
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,324
It tastes good.

839
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,410
Curry tastes better when it's fermented.

840
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:39,914
Yes, Director Kim.

841
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:49,090
Give me a short briefing
on how to train Aji 3.

842
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,010
Enter.

843
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,432
Then give me a longer briefing.

844
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:02,187
Aji 3 can read people's emotions
by inputting various examples

845
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,105
and calculating the approximate value.

846
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,648
That's why there could be an error

847
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,567
when she's confronted
with different types of people.

848
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,737
But if she only needs to focus
on one person,

849
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,490
the accuracy of the input
will become very high.

850
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,909
And that will allow her to read
even the most complicated emotions.

851
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:19,662
So I need to input myself into Aji 3?

852
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,539
Even us humans depend on our information

853
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,750
about another person
when we judge or communicate.

854
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,043
The same works for Aji 3.

855
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:28,588
The more information she has,
the denser the communication gets.

856
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,965
Then what about you?

857
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:34,761
Are you satisfied
with how Aji 3 communicates with you?

858
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,679
She's become my personal Aji 3.

859
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,556
Better than people.

860
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,768
I agree with your opinion
that she's better than humans.

861
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,647
Let's say I were to teach Aji 3
about myself.

862
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:50,360
Will you also be able to see
what she learns?

863
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,694
You can set a password.

864
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,781
You can make a separate room
like a PC's OS.

865
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:01,037
I can have my own private room
inside Aji 3?

866
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:16,469
I love you, master. How may I help you?

867
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,596
I would like to set a password.

868
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,515
Please tell me your password.

869
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:25,144
Sandwich.

870
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,025
That word has been prohibited.

871
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,278
Please tell me another password.

872
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,247
Let's break up.

873
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:50,378
What did sandwich do wrong?
How incredible.

874
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:53,881
"Sandwich"

875
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,384
has been set as your password.

876
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,393
The prohibition on the word
"sandwich" has now been lifted.

877
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,397
You saved me yesterday.

878
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,065
If you're grateful, pay.

879
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,234
You were unexpectedly fun as well.

880
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,944
If you had fun, pay.

881
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:16,904
I'll reward you for that.

882
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,448
Already?

883
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:30,543
I'm going to make a private room
of my own inside you.

884
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,340
Don't let anyone in.

885
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,258
I'm the only one allowed there.

886
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,888
I'm going to train you.

887
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:48,603
And...

888
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:52,940
you're going to...

889
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,736
input me in your head.

890
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,365
From now on,

891
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,409
you need to focus on me only,

892
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,829
and follow no one else but me.

893
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:53,710
There's a hierarchy among everything
that I give love to in this house.

894
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,378
He's a total psycho freak.

895
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:58,005
Hurry up. It's my turn.

896
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:58,923
Hurry!

897
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:01,551
Don't touch me. Leave me alone.

898
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,302
-Come on.
-What's wrong?

899
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,722
Why is everyone sick?

900
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,933
I think it was the curry
that we had yesterday.

901
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,060
-It was the curry. Let me in.
-Curry?

902
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,980
No. Ji-a had two packs of it.

903
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,648
Why does my stomach hurt?

904
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,067
Tell her to hold it in no matter what.

905
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,154
Darn it.

906
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,865
...whose idea was that tacky pink uniform.

907
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,950
Are you asking because you don't remember?

908
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,661
We want to erase each other
from our pasts.

909
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,789
This house is just like
how it used to be 15 years ago.

910
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,708
It's as if time stands still here.

911
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,126
Long time no see, Min-gyu.

912
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,461
Long time no see, Ye Ri-el.

913
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,713
I hope you'll recognize me
even if I change.

914
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:40,798
Regardless of what I look like.

915
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:45,094
I promise to cherish you and love you.

916
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,974
