1
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,371
This is when...

2
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,082
you must kiss.

3
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,380
A human's body temperature is 36.5℃.

4
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,676
I confess.

5
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,558
That there are times I longed...

6
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,103
for the 36.5℃ warmth.

7
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,739
Someone once said
that a first kiss tastes of apples.

8
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,743
Someone said it's like
the first flower bud

9
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,828
on the end of a tree branch.

10
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,082
And someone said...

11
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,504
it's like seeing the sea
for the first time.

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,257
I imagined this moment so many times.

13
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,594
The first time my 36.5℃ lips...

14
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,431
will make contact with another's.

15
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,226
But...

16
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,771
the first lips that mine touch...

17
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,190
are a robot's?

18
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,945
What are you doing?

19
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,365
I should be doing it.
Why are you kissing me?

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,995
Were you going to kiss me?

21
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,372
Why would I?

22
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,416
Sorry, I won't do it again.

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,876
Did I tell you not to?

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,003
Then shall we do it again?

25
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,006
Do what? What? Do what again?

26
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,426
What are you really?
Why are you doing this to me?

27
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,263
I'm so confused because of you.

28
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,392
Sorry, I'm late.

29
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,437
Where is your first love?

30
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,452
You have a terrible habit.

31
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,788
You called me knowing I'm on a date?

32
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,833
What is it? What is so urgent?

33
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,732
This is when...

34
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,568
you must kiss.

35
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,169
Thanks for the ride.

36
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,337
Can you come on your own?

37
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,047
Of course, the rain stopped.

38
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,757
See you early tomorrow morning.

39
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,409
Darn it.

40
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,959
I must be insane.

41
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,045
Why did I stick my lips out at him?

42
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,383
How did someone come up with this?

43
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,218
Was he a genius?

44
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,929
Or a craftsman?

45
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,101
He said what I had wanted to hear
my whole life with that look.

46
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,229
How could I not lose my mind?

47
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,239
What should I do?

48
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,333
You.

49
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,795
Why did you do that to me?

50
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,588
PRETTY

51
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,676
I can't do anything because of you.

52
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,594
This is insane.

53
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,181
Why did you do that?

54
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,392
That was my first kiss, for god's sake.

55
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,020
You just stole my first kiss.

56
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,647
I can't believe that after all this time,

57
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,482
a robot stole my first kiss.

58
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,445
What will you do about this?

59
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,286
Why did she do that to me?

60
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,333
What did I input by mistake that--

61
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,507
That feeling you just felt,
the atmosphere,

62
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,551
the gaze. Don't forget that.

63
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,720
That is sexual tension.

64
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,723
And that is when you must kiss.

65
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,981
This is when...

66
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,525
you must kiss.

67
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,405
No way.

68
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,033
She deep-learned that whole lesson?

69
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,954
No way.

70
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,665
That's ridiculous.

71
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,126
This isn't some science-fiction novel,
is it?

72
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,466
Wait.

73
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,469
I almost blew my cover.

74
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,264
He missed it because he is stupid.

75
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,683
He would have found out
if he were a little smarter.

76
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,727
Be careful.

77
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,979
I must be careful.

78
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,310
Is she charging?

79
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,941
Why does she look so unfamiliar?

80
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,319
It's like I never met her before.

81
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,199
I mean, this robot.

82
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,081
-What is it?
-Oh, I...

83
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,002
I wanted to ask Aji 3 something.

84
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,171
As you can see, we're charging her.

85
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,716
Yes, I see that.

86
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,676
From now on, please call ahead.

87
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,429
That means, "Please leave."

88
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,473
This is my house.

89
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,308
Shall I stop charging her?

90
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:00,396
Okay, then. Let me ask just one thing.

91
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,858
Can a robot, I mean...

92
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:07,278
If Aji 3 successfully
deep-learns everything,

93
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:11,240
could she develop emotions?

94
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,409
Like likes and dislikes?

95
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,746
Even we don't know the extent
of Aji 3's deep-learning capabilities.

96
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,208
Depending on how detailed
the information you give her is,

97
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,252
we just predict she will react
as if she has emotions.

98
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,588
She can express likes and dislikes.

99
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,131
Our final goal is for her

100
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,343
to become attached to, hug,
and comfort her master first.

101
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,764
She can hug me first?

102
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,349
It's not a real emotion.

103
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,725
Wait.

104
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,061
So, if we get very close,

105
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,564
that would be possible
even without my command?

106
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,690
Yes.

107
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:49,320
If that happens, we'll end the test,
retrieve her, and study her. Why?

108
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,242
End the test?

109
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,746
Never mind.

110
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,915
Get back to work.

111
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,051
My goodness.

112
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,930
How close does she think we are?

113
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,395
Anyway, that robot is so insolent.

114
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,772
My gosh.

115
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,234
I would love...

116
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,697
to meet the person who made this.

117
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,992
My gosh, you fool.

118
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,411
That person was right in front of you.

119
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,913
Also...

120
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,250
I'm a human, not a robot.

121
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,589
I'm going to tell him everything
once the test is over.

122
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,927
You think the robot likes you?

123
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,764
How is that even possible?
It sounds like a Hollywood movie.

124
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,683
I checked with the research team.

125
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,437
If the robot succeeds in deep-learning,

126
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,355
she can act like she has emotions.

127
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,025
But the thing is,

128
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,611
she...

129
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,030
likes me too much.

130
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,991
My gosh, how annoying.

131
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,911
Are you bragging that a robot likes you?

132
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,040
Gosh, what do you mean?
This is nothing to brag about.

133
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,418
Someone likes you
for the first time in 15 years. Isn't it?

134
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,380
-You...
-I'll check with my own eyes

135
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,840
as soon as I return to Korea.

136
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:48,272
The fact that you feel accepted by someone
is a very good sign.

My gosh, I wonder if this idiot
will even be able to understand.

140
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,336
"I am a human."

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,296
"We're destined for each other."

142
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,508
"I invented that umbrella."

143
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,719
"Do you know
that I saved your life twice?"

You just wait, Kim Min-gyu.

145

But...

146
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:13,566
did Aji 3 kiss me,
or was that just a peck?

147
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:18,654
Would he like it when he finds out
that I'm actually human?

Well, the money.

Give me the rest, 300,000 won.

00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,234
I don't want to.

Fine.

157
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,654
I'll give it to you...

158

if you answer my question.

What?

Do people...

161
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,959
consider it a kiss even when two people...

162
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,631
just smooch lips together?

163
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,049
That's a kiss.

164
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,175
Not a peck?

165
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,555
Well, was it a quick peck?

166
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,475
Or was it a really long smooch?

167
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,145
I think it was pretty long.

168
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,440
Then that's totally a kiss.

169
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,861
It's a kiss if it exceeds over one second.

170
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,948
I knew it. It was a kiss.

171
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,867
Was it nice?

172
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,914
Did your heart flutter?

173
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:56,043
It was completely unbelievable,
ridiculous, and flabbergasting.

00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,070
So this is how it feels...

186
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,616
to be somebody's crush.

187
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,665
It feels like I have around 100 vaults
stacked in my house.

188
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,052
We used to go on a lot of dates.

189
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,387
We never came to places like this.

190
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,806
We did. Think carefully.

191
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,808
-Where is everyone?
-You just don't remember.

192
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,519
They went out to get coffee
and still haven't returned.

193
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,605
Where's Ji-a?

194
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,316
She'll be here soon.
She had to go somewhere.

195
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,903
Gosh, it was so annoying
to have her tag along all day.

196
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,988
You look happy.

197
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,823
Do I?

198
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,202
It was so bothersome to take care of her.

199
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,912
Then don't go.

200
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,582
-What?
-You just said it's bothersome.

201
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,086
I will go next time.

202
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:08,759
I can't really ask you to...

203
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,430
It was nice.

204
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,394
-Do you want to get back together again?
-Yes.

205
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,146
It became clear
after spending time with her today.

206
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,024
Did you figure out...

207
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,402
-why she left you?
-No.

208
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,529
But that's already in the past.

209
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,532
If we start over again--

210
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,952
Even when a machine breaks, you have
to find out the cause of the error.

211
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,954
Otherwise, the error repeats.

212
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,249
You might end up hurting each other again.

213
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,043
I really can't figure out why.

214
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,713
Why don't you find the starting point?

215
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,755
The starting point?

216
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,632
For example,

217
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,511
think about the moment
you felt the sorriest for Ji-a.

218
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:56,140
Maybe that could lead to the reason
why you broke up.

219
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,770
This is so nice. I can eat this every day.

220
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,689
I have one more.

221
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,234
Hey, what's wrong?

222
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,487
Did something happen last night?
You have red eyes.

223
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,655
Hey, guys.

224
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,950
I experienced all sorts of emotions
last night.

225
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,161
I can't think straight anymore.

226
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,789
-Do you want...
-Did you go to sauna?

227
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,850
Please keep in mind
that you're still a robot.

228
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:44,021
I'm already aware of that to the bone.

229
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,273
What kind of a robot has bloodshot eyes?

230
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,150
-Open your eyes.
-I'll do it.

231
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,818
Open them. I need to check.

232
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,743
What are you, a grey alien?

233
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,411
Open them slightly.

234
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,039
Can't you talk nicely?

235
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,666
Why would you call me an alien?

236
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,836
I'm sorry.

237
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,473
Pai.

238
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,142
When will you be done fixing Aji 3?

239
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,770
I need to be prepared
for my own thing now.

240
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,855
We are almost done.

241
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,398
Almost.

242
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,901
We will be done before the weekend.

243
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,362
I will fix her no matter what.

244
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,072
Thank you.

245
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,659
By the way,
you can talk to me comfortably.

246
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,160
This is comfortable for me.

247
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,584
Did my brother
have his first kiss last night?

248
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,503
I don't know.

249
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,922
It won't be easy for him.

250
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,675
But who knows
if the girl kissed him first?

251
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,344
My gosh.

252
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,180
I'll only be able
to relay this message to him

253
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,849
once he has cleared his first kiss.

254
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,144
Seon-hye told me
that after the first kiss...

255
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,607
-the next day--
-The next day is very important.

256
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,402
If either of them starts ignoring
what happened,

257
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,239
that is when
the game of Hard to Get begins.

258
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,741
Are you fully charged overnight?

259
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,785
Yes, master.

260
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,831
Everything is my fault.

261
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,668
I made the wrong input...

262
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,337
which is why you turned out this way.

263
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,047
"This way"?

264
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,632
Listen carefully, Aji 3.

265
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,219
Open the wires, and input it accurately.

266
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,141
You shouldn't love me.

267
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,562
You can be my closest friend.

268
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,815
But you can't be the woman I love.

269
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,027
You're the one who asked me
to be with you forever.

270
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,695
In other words,

271
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:02,534
don't ever repeat
what you did yesterday, okay?

272
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,746
What did I do yesterday?

273
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,249
-What?
-Did I do something yesterday?

274
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,087
You tried to...

275
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:18,050
You did something to me, remember?

276
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,845
Did something happen between us yesterday?

277
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,263
Are you ditching me?

278
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,683
That's not the proper way
to speak, master.

279
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,770
I see, you don't remember
because you're in Operation Mode?

280
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,480
Switch to Friend Mode.

281
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,733
-What?
-"What?"

282
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,817
You're being curter.

283
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,569
What do you want?

284
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,446
Are you upset with me?

285
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,826
I don't know what you mean.
Could you please repeat?

286
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,246
Why did you switch back to Operation Mode?

287
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,540
Due to an error,
only Operation Mode is available for now.

288
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,585
Stop kidding. Aji 3, Friend Mode.

289
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,797
Due to an error,
only Operation Mode is available for now.

290
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,760
After what you did to me yesterday,

291
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,263
it's impolite to treat me this way.

292
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,099
I don't know what I did yesterday,

293
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,267
but I'll never do it again.

294
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,852
-That's not what I mean.
-Should I do it again then?

295
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,814
Do what? Do what again?

296
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,527
You remember what you did yesterday,
don't you?

297
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,238
Did something happen yesterday, master?

298
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,865
Come on, Aji 3.

299
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,550
I prepared a lot for my first kiss.

300
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:45,679
Someone intercepted it. My first kiss.

301
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:50,183
That's why I have to prepare
for my first kiss again.

302
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,313
Can our goddess of kissing
give me some ideas?

303
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,690
He might as well be weeping blood.

304
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:01,236
Who dared to take away your first kiss?

305
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,073
I wish I could bite him.

306
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,909
-You must do it properly this time.
-How?

307
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:12,414
Spend some intimate time privately
where physical contact is possible.

308
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,750
How about going on a drive?

309
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,942
Darn it.

310
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,652
Why you...

311
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,654
Gosh.

312
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,824
Stop interrupting me.

313
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:52,120
You keep following me like a puppy,
so I can't do it.

314
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,664
Then go alone.

315
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,334
I can only kiss if she's there with me.

316
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,630
What a strange way you two flirt.

317
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,006
Flirt?

318
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,717
She frustrates me.

319
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,011
Goodness.

320
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,975
I've been worried about you.
Did you deal with it?

321
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,852
I ignored it.

322
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,730
I pretended that it was erased.

323
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,899
How can you ignore it?

324
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,989
Pai.

325
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,201
Is my language that harsh?

326
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,620
Based on general standards,

327
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:34,830
yes.

328
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,999
-How bad is it?
-Since we're close to you,

329
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,711
however you speak,
we only care about the content.

330
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:46,758
Most people care about the way you speak.

331
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,761
Are my manners that crappy?

332
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,013
Based on general standards,

333
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,431
yes.

334
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,685
But I don't think that way about you.

335
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,436
I think I remember...

336
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,983
the worst thing I've done to Ji-a.

337
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,236
Hello.

338
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,447
Why do you do things I didn't ask?
Think before you act.

339
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,074
Did I ask you to clean up here?

340
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,784
Are you a janitor?

341
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,247
How could I forget
saying such a terrible thing?

342
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,999
I'm not even human.

343
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,668
Is that why you broke up?

344
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,637
Why are you holding up an umbrella
when it isn't raining?

345
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,600
Look at it carefully.
Does it ring a bell to you?

346
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:39,936
No.

347
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:46,359
A memory related to this umbrella
is probably misplaced.

348
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,069
Try to recall it.

349
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,740
I don't know what you mean.

350
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:53,909
Even now?

351
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,836
Come on. Try to remember.

352
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,465
Is it necessary that I remember?

353
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,718
No, you must erase it.

354
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,055
Why do you keep insisting
when it is basically erased?

355
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:24,189
It's not fair that I'm the only one
who remembers.

356
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,982
You should forget it too.

357
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,029
Having the ability to forget must be nice.

358
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,615
I'm not a robot like you.

359
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,785
How can I forget
something ingrained in my memory?

360
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,911
Time.

361
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,622
Human memories fade with time.

362
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,041
You don't seem to understand.

363
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:47,087
Sometimes, human memories
can't be forgotten with time.

364
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:51,716
A place or a song
can bring back your memories.

365
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,011
This umbrella will remind me of you
from that moment.

366
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,138
What will you do about it?

367
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,599
You don't want to remember
because what happened

368
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,601
-was ridiculous and unbelievable.
-Gosh.

369
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,979
I hope you never forget it.

370
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,148
Are you complaining to me, master?

371
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,693
That's right. You should better forget it.

372
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,278
Forget it forever.

373
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,281
Don't you dare remember it. Goodness.

374
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,033
Gosh.

375
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,885
That's impossible.

376
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,305
It's precious to me.
I would never lose it.

377
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,726
Could it be a mere coincidence?

378
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,185
I don't know about that.

379
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:48,565
When the pressure and friction
of the bolt are imbalanced

380
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,984
due to gravity,

381
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,111
it snaps and falls.

382
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,197
I should get going.

383
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,199
Don't you want a cup of coffee?

384
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,368
I forgot my wallet.

385
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,370
I'll buy one next time.

386
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,747
You can pay next time.

387
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,459
My family believes
that we should never owe anything.

388
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,878
What's wrong with this guy?

389
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,962
-What?
-Pardon?

390
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,213
Did you say something?

391
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,923
-Did I?
-I thought you did.

392
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,675
I didn't say anything.

393
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,677
Seon-hye. Hoktal?

394
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,888
-Hoktal.
-Hello.

395
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,059
-When did you get here?
-What?

396
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,019
-Tell me what's on your mind.
-Those are new clothes.

397
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,356
Seon-hye left something,
so I came to return it.

398
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,732
Okay, leave.

399
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,816
Seon-hye.

400
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,652
Are you getting ready
for your eye surgery?

401
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,530
May I get an Americano?

402
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,074
I would like a latte.

403
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,786
Here are your latte and Americano.

404
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:46,623
Thank you.

405
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,295
By the way,

406
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,172
when Hard-to-Get game begins,

407
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,883
which side usually gets dragged around?

408
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,678
The person who gets angry first.

409
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:09,729
But Mr. Kim, this is my job.

410
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,274
From now on, Aji 3 will do them all.

411
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,155
Don't just stand there. Get them inside.

412
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,741
Now.

413
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,335
It will take forever
if you take them one by one.

414
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,978
Master, you called me your treasure.

415
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,647
Is this how you should treat
your treasure?

416
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,482
You're unbelievable.

417
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,694
What's the use of a forgetful robot
that can't save information?

418
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,112
You should do petty work.

419
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,781
You, when you're done wiping up,

420
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,742
do you see the books in the study?

421
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,662
Organize them
according to date of publication, okay?

422
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,707
What?

423
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:26,347
This work will exhaust my battery
much faster, master.

424
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,308
You seem to last quite a while.

425
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,059
Why? Are you tired?

426
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,644
Would I ever?

427
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,648
I have titanium arms and titanium legs.

428
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,277
Gosh, so much dust. Do you see this?

429
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,612
Dust this when you're done.

430
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,744
He just found himself a new slave.

431
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,998
PETITION

432
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,291
CHO JI-A

433
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,835
He didn't even open it?

434
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,545
Why that...

435
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,674
That cold-blooded reptile.

436
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,861
Wiping the window?

437
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,822
That lunatic.

438
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,540
Have you lost your mind?

439
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,209
How can you make
a state-of-the-art android robot

440
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,544
wipe the windows?

441
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,296
What's wrong with that?
Cleaning is a sacred chore.

442
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,341
Should I wipe the windows
when I have a robot to do it?

443
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,718
I will do it instead.

444
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,136
Are you crazy?

445
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,849
What are you doing right now?

446
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,644
I can't watch my robot hold a rag.

447
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,895
Do you cherish her that much?

448
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,731
I do. I can barely even look at her.

449
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,567
What a nuisance.

450
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,444
You, go fold that umbrella.

451
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,323
No. I'll do it.

452
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:15,915
Why are you going overboard today, Doctor?

453
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,252
Because I made this umbrella.

454
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,132
Did you really?

455
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,466
No.

456
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,677
-Right?
-No.

457
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,970
I invented it.

458
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,222
How dare you, Fungus?

459
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,224
You're lying.

460
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:37,103
That umbrella couldn't have
come out of your head.

461
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:41,274
It's somewhat more genius than you are.

462
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,442
It's that good.

463
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,861
My IQ level is only 94.

464
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,113
Leave that, and come see this.

465
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:53,953
NEW SANTA MARIA LAB AIRVIEW

466
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,873
The airview of the plan
for your new research complex.

467
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,209
It'll be about 2000 pyeong
with a great view.

468
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,669
2000 pyeong?

469
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,298
All the amenities are there,
so you won't have to leave the complex.

470
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,926
The best, top-notch, state-of-the-art--

471
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,844
That's all good.

472
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:14,974
I don't see tailored or personalized
welfare for individuals.

473
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,980
You just saw what an incredible complex
I will build you

474
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,192
and you still want personalized welfare?

475
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,319
Ssanip puts food first.

476
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,197
We need a restaurant
to provide three meals a day

477
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,823
with a complimentary beer fridge.

478
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:34,285
Hoktal is surprisingly sensitive
and cares about nature.

479
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,371
I want a greenhouse next to the lab

480
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,873
with a complimentary pool. And for Pai--

481
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,333
What about me?

482
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,043
-You're a robot.
-You're a robot.

483
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,311
DAILY VEGETABLE JUICE

484
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:23,251
Fine. I'll forget it forever and ever.

485
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,596
What do you think?

486
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,975
One more adjustment,
and I think we're done.

487
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,352
I agree. Let's do it just one more time.

488
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,062
Yes, Doctor.

489
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,232
Ji-a's suffering a lot because of you.
Get yourself ready.

490
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,068
You are concerned for Cho Ji-a.

491
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,069
Of course.

492
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,203
This is when...

493
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,914
you must kiss.

494
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,124
Who taught you that?

495
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,418
I think it was Hwang Seon-hye.

496
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,046
Why did you learn that?
That was for Min-gyu.

497
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,799
-Doctor, can you...
-Right.

498
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,765
Your sandwiches are here.

499
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,104
We're back. Eat first, work later.

500
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:30,151
Is the sandwich ban lifted now?
I missed these so much.

501
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,403
Why did you order seven sandwiches?

502
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,654
We can't eat all that.

503
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,365
The hungriest person should always order.

504
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,076
Don't worry, I'll eat them all.

505
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,869
See what happens if you don't.

506
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,914
I'm hungry. Let's order two large sets.

507
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,166
That's too much. Who will eat it all?

508
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,293
We will get a medium set
and an extra sandwich.

509
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,545
Fresh sandwiches, please.

510
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,683
The robot's not to blame.

511
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,602
Blame the human that can't forget.

512
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:09,398
Robots have errors
and things get deleted by mistake.

513
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,026
Okay, that's everything sorted.

514
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,279
Let's sleep.

515
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,825
No.

516
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,785
It is not sorted.

517
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,995
It's not clear.

518
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,833
Welcome, Director Kim Min-gyu.

519
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,630
Why don't you call me "master"?

520
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:18,634
I am currently running
the Master Version Operation Software.

521
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:23,222
To run the software personalized to you,
you must log out of this version.

522
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,770
The Aji 3 here...

523
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,150
is just you, correct?

524
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:38,738
I am the only Aji 3 constructed
at the Santa Maria laboratory to date.

525
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,824
If there are clones,
our performances will be identical.

526
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,202
Are you...

527
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,496
my Aji 3?

528
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,584
I can't believe it.

529
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:55,046
Those who cannot trust anyone
can never earn the trust of others.

530
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,134
Those who cannot trust anyone...

531
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,262
can never earn the trust of others.

532
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:06,974
Aji 3.

533
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,645
What does it mean...

534
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,689
to train someone?

535
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,274
...forming a relationship.

536
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,443
Forming a relationship.

537
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,111
He said...

538
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,281
that it was about input.

539
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,660
What you input is the issue.

540
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,246
What you input is the issue.

541
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,178
It's not a real emotion.

542
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,221
It's not.

543
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,517
It feels so real.

544
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,023
Are you a fake?

545
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,108
Yes.

546
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,945
I'll forget about yesterday
and act as usual.

547
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:33,037
Because I am Min-gyu's closest friend
and treasure.

548
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,176
Master?

549
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,811
I'm hungry.

550
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,849
Do you want some?

551
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,525
Just kidding.

552
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:47,987
Today...

553
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,991
you seem to be in a bad mood.

554
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,951
But I'm smiling right now.

555
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,454
How do you know I'm not happy?

556
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,625
Because I saw you up close until now.

557
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,337
Deep-learning?

558
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,550
Yes. It's your job to observe everyone.

559
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,929
You watch me and everyone around you.

560
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:19,435
There's no penalty
if you get over nine points.

561
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,605
Out of 20 questions, you got five.

562
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,652
This is hilarious, isn't it?

563
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,955
Are you laughing because it's funny or...

564
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,251
because you must laugh?

565
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,306
Are you still upset...

566
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,393
over what happened yesterday?

567
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,235
The weather is nice.

568
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,070
I will do the laundry.

569
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,627
Shall I do it?

570
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,171
No.

571
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,800
Isn't it tiring?

572
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:36,971
It is.

573
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,184
You could stomp it a million times
and not feel tired.

574
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:46,897
Good for you.

575
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,056
You.

576
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,893
You didn't delete it.

577
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,563
You remember everything, don't you?

578
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,446
I don't know what you mean, master.

579
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,625
I really hate this.

580
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,461
Do you know that...

581
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,963
seeing you makes me feel disgusting?

582
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,635
How much lower will you bring me down
when you're just a robot?

583
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:00,929
Input this.

584
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,349
I'm no longer your friend.

585
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,934
I did something no friend should ever do.

586
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:10,022
From now on, only use Operation Mode.

587
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,775
If Friend Mode appears
without my command...

588
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,570
I will reset you.

589
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,493
Go home.

590
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:27,956
I still...

591
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,752
have some battery left.

592
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,841
I want to be alone.

593
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,305
Go.

594
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,445
Was that...

595
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,365
all fake?

596
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,121
They all meant nothing?

597
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:57,045
MADAM X
LOSING FRIENDLY SHARES

598
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,591
Soon, Yu-cheol will become...

599
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,887
the majority shareholder and director.

600
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,431
How about him as a son-in-law?

601
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,944
DISTRIBUTION OF SALES

602
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,199
You gathered quite a lot of shares.

603
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,034
At the upcoming shareholder meeting,

604
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,120
I will propose the dismissal
of Director Kim Min-gyu.

605
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:35,083
How much money did he make us so far?

606
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,670
I don't see why he should be dismissed.

607
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,090
When I'm done buying the shares
at the end of this month,

608
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,759
there will be a new majority shareholder.

609
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:47,638
We can get rid of Director Kim
without your shares.

610
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,890
If it'll happen anyway,

611
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,309
why waste our energy?

612
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,602
Don't you think?

613
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,103
I'm not sure.

614
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,775
Unless you find me something crucial
that stops him from doing his duty...

615
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,529
my shares will go toward supporting him.

616
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,034
I promised his late father
when he passed away.

617
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,245
Goodbye.

618
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,372
Seong-tae.

619
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,583
I'm giving you an opportunity.

620
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,086
When you have an opportunity,

621
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,004
you must seize it.

622
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,094
I don't care about succession.

623
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,513
I care about company value.

624
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,808
Like late Chairman Kim Myeong-hoon did.

625
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,108
As soon as Min-gyu's dismissed,

626
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,236
prepare to send Martin the contract
right away.

627
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,904
Yes, sir.

628
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,949
Min-gyu isn't up to anything much, is he?

629
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,118
I think he's looking for Jang Du-sam.

630
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,498
He used to be the driver
of late Daeyang Chairman Park.

631
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,251
Does he live here?

632
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,378
He moved out the day before yesterday.

633
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,839
If he ever returns,

634
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,216
please tell him to call this number.

635
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,343
-Okay.
-Thank you.

636
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,515
"This is what the velvet rabbit asked.

637
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:18,729
'Mr. Horse, do I need a spring
to become real?'

638
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,315
'No.

639
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,484
That's not how you become real.

640
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:30,407
You can become real
if someone loves you for a long time.'

641
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,871
'Does it hurt to become real?'

642
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,498
'Sometimes.'

643
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,878
The horse looked at
the velvet rabbit and smiled."

644
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,466
My gosh, this is epic.

645
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,468
Is this how powerful Min-gyu is?

646
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:52,054
Everything will clear up
once Aji 3 goes public

647
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,597
and Doctor Hong's article gets published.

648
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,891
What is the article about?

649
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,769
Doctor Hong got slandered
by a fellow colleague

650
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,729
saying that he stole
his research material in America.

651
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,273
But in reality, he falsely claimed that

652
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,941
just because he wanted everything
by himself.

653
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,611
I joined the team
after he came back from America,

654
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,738
so I heard the story later on.

655
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,448
Still, it pissed me off.

656
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:15,410
What a worthless US jerk.
How could you just stand him?

657
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,205
He worried me and Pai would be blamed too.

658
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,416
So Doctor Hong just handed over
all his research materials.

659
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,378
That's quite impressive of you,
Doctor Hong.

660
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:32,469
But our brother, Min-gyu,
is doing everything he can

661
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,596
to help Doctor Hong clear his name.

662
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,765
How impressive of him.

663
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,476
Gosh, I'm so proud of my little brother.

664
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,770
-Right, Doctor Hong?
-The airview of our lab is out.

665
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,564
The laboratory of your dreams
will soon be built.

666
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:48,527
-That calls for a party!
-Let's party!

667
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,736
Party, my foot.

668
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:55,617
Today, I got a call from MIT
saying that they're ready

669
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,078
to help me and my team
regain our lost reputations.

670
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,705
The one who endured all this is...

671
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,748
-Santa Maria!
-Santa Maria!

672
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,917
The one who made this possible is...

673
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,502
-Brother!
-Brother!

674
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,921
-Everyone, cheers.
-Cheers!

675
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,633
-Cheers.
-Brother, come on.

676
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,553
I'm really craving alcohol today.

677
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,389
I can't even drink this.

678
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,310
Have some appetizers.

679
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,104
I can't eat food someone else made.

680
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:25,856
I see.

681
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,651
-Hoktal's random game.
-Hoktal's random game.

682
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:30,819
The Number Game! One!

683
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,696
-Two!
-Two! My gosh.

684
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,906
-You lost.
-He lost.

685
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,242
You should link arms and drink together.

686
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,341
It's my turn now.

687
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,636
The loser has to buy ice cream
with a partner.

688
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,222
Let's play Five Chances.
We'll go this way.

689
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,808
-All right.
-Fold if you've been to America.

690
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:02,809
Fold a finger.

691
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,105
Fold if you're a woman.

692
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,734
Fold if you've never been to America.

693
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,195
-Fold if you're a man.
-My gosh.

694
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,238
Fold if you have curly hair.

695
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,951
-Pass.
-Nice.

696
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,537
Anyone wearing glasses, fold.

697
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,418
Fold if you're wearing
anything that's white.

698
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,963
We have a couple!

699
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,801
-See you.
-I hope you enjoy the walk.

700
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,397
The moon's really bright tonight.

701
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:51,733
Why don't we go see it?

702
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,819
It's a crescent moon tonight.

703
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:55,987
Let's go see the moon.

704
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,699
But my moon is really sad.

705
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,785
He's drunk. He's drunk again.

706
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,704
-Let's all go see the moon.
-The moon?

707
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,290
Put everything down. Let's go now.

708
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,840
Stop drinking now. Let's go.

709
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,480
You're drunk.

710
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,315
I know.

711
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,069
You should go back home.

712
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:39,948
I don't want to.

713
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,585
Please let go of my hand.

714
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,549
I'm scared that you'll leave.

715
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,512
I can't live without you.

716
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,475
That's also something...

717
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,521
you shouldn't say to a friend.

718
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,030
Please get up.

719
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,873
Let's play a game.

720
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,125
The one we just did earlier.

721
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:42,052
Fold your finger
if you've ever been kissed by a robot.

722
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,640
Fold your finger...

723
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,309
if that made you...

724
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:51,728
flabbergasted.

725
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:57,984
Fold your finger...

726
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,614
if that made you...

727
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,325
angry.

728
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:09,829
Fold your finger...

729
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,168
if that made you...

730
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,005
hate that robot.

731
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,104
Fold your finger...

732
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,944
if you ever wished that the robot...

733
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,616
was human.

734
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,110
I'm...

735
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,906
not a robot.

736
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,539
I would like to get engaged first.

737
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,041
You're really nasty.

738
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,834
Why are you like this to me?

739
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,669
Why are you doing this to me?

740
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,922
Let's never see each other again.
Take care.

741
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,716
I asked you
not to treat her with disrespect.

742
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,678
You talk as if someone hurt
the robot's feelings.

743
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,807
She was staring at you all the time.

744
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,476
The eyes always follow the heart.

745
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,020
Why didn't I realize this before?

746
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,940
