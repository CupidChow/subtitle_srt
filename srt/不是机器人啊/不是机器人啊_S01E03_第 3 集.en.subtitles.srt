1
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,690
I'm going to make a private room
of my own inside you.

2
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,360
Don't let anyone in.

3
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,529
I'm the only one allowed there.

4
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,824
I'm going to train you.

5
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:35,952
And...

6
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,290
you're going to...

7
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,209
input me in your head.

8
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,171
From now on,

9
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,340
you need to focus on me only

10
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,217
and follow no one else but me.

11
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,679
Input?

12
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,974
Input what in my head?

13
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,227
The first thing to input...

14
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,900
is the hierarchy in this house.

15
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,948
There's a hierarchy among everything
that I give love to in this house.

16
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,577
It's a type of caste system.

17
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,415
Objects at the top hierarchy
are named "Pretty."

18
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,751
This back scratcher is Pretty One.

19
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:28,213
This old-fashioned robot vacuum
is Pretty Two.

20
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,217
This new robot vacuum,
which just had its birthday recently,

21
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,010
is Pretty Three.

22
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,513
I will become a Pretty, too.

23
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,557
In other words,

24
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,019
I'm on the same level

25
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:47,190
as the back scratcher
and the robot vacuums?

26
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,735
No, they're above you.

27
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,531
You earn points by making me happy.

28
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,617
Earn as many points as possible,

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,663
so you can be called "Pretty"
and get on their hierarchy level.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,541
I have to earn points here?

31
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,210
Then I'll celebrate your birthday as well.

32
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,878
What a nutbag.

33
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,715
For every object in this house,
the purchase date is its birthday.

34
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,759
He's a total psycho freak.

35
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,310
Gosh.

36
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,729
Hurry up.

37
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,565
-It's my turn.
-Hurry.

38
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,109
Don't touch me. Leave me alone.

39
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,403
-Come on.
-What's wrong?

40
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,738
Why is everyone sick?

41
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,908
I think it was the curry
that we had yesterday.

42
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,618
-It was the curry.
-Curry?

43
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,745
-Let me in.
-I'm next.

44
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,330
-No.
-Hey.

45
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,749
Ji-a had two packs of it.

46
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,753
Also, there are sanctuaries in this house.

47
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,257
They are more sacred than the hierarchy.

48
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,802
The card castle.

49
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,555
My cabinet. And...

50
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,016
this action figure showcase.

51
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,518
I went through hell because of that.

52
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,856
You must never touch any
of these sanctuaries.

53
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,733
Remember that.

54
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:17,363
Next, I'll input the layout of the house.

55
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,740
Follow me.

56
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,373
Why does my stomach hurt?

57
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,751
I didn't even drink last night.

58
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,127
Hey.

59
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,879
Come out now.

60
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,297
Let me in.

61
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,174
Hurry up.

62
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,467
Come out now!

63
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,095
I'll kill you if you don't
come out quickly.

64
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,847
I'll do my best. I can't...

65
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,474
guarantee it.

66
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,687
Tell her...

67
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,315
to hold it in no matter what.

68
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,358
Okay.

69
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,950
I can't do it.

70
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,953
I failed at the mission, sir.

71
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,496
How could you?

72
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,999
This is the kitchen. And...

73
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,596
My goodness.

74
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,477
Okay, that's the bathroom.

75
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,690
Why aren't you following me?

76
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,363
What is this room, master?

77
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,117
I'm the only one allowed in it.

78
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,703
You can't go inside.

79
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,082
Come.

80
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,042
Yes, master.

81
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,388
My parents.

82
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,682
Input with care.

83
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,313
What? That necklace...

84
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,939
Yes.

85
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,443
It was my mother's favorite necklace.

86
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:25,033
Some human being stole it,
but I'll get it back soon.

87
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,453
Aji 3, input this.

88
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,915
Your master hates
those who deceive others the most.

89
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,587
The people who deceive me pay for it
one way or another.

90
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,007
Darn it.

91
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,551
Get out.

92
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,970
-Get out of the way.
-Wait.

93
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,889
-Hey.
-Wait.

94
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,141
-I'm really sorry.
-No!

95
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,310
I'm going to die...

96
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,272
I am glad...

97
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,649
you are a robot.

98
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,110
You will not deceive me.

99
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,238
Also...

100
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,121
save this to your memory.

101
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,250
What shall I name the folder?

102
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,671
Who... Who is it, master?

103
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,466
My first...

104
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,177
love.

105
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,056
Shoot.

106
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,893
The new folder is named "Shoot."

107
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,480
What was that noise?

108
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,943
Master, you farted.

109
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,653
I did?

110
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,654
Yes.

111
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,616
-It wasn't me.
-Then, was it me?

112
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,702
It couldn't be you.

113
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,704
That's why it was you.

114
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,289
Then it was me.

115
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,460
That's strange. I don't remember farting.

116
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,633
The smell tells me
it might not be an ordinary fart.

117
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,470
How about you change
your underwear, master?

118
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,430
That's strange.

119
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,851
Sorry.

120
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,602
Wait here.

121
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:17,728
Okay.

122
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,077
Aji 3?

123
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,205
Your master is not the kind
of person who farts...

124
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,833
just anywhere.

125
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,759
Cho Ji-a, hold it in no matter what.

126
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,890
That cursed curry.

127
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,559
I will throw out the whole box.

128
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,728
Where did she go?

129
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,108
Who's that?

130
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,406
A ghost?

131
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,267
What are you doing?

132
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,187
Cleaning up, master.

133
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,156
The bathroom's huge.

134
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,829
Oh, no. It stinks.

135
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,860
What are you doing?

136
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,071
Cleaning up, master.

137
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,577
Did someone strange come in here?

138
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,662
No.

139
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,874
That flushing sound. Was that you?

140
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,876
Yes, master.

141
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,926
I never told you to clean this bathroom.

142
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,269
Is Ji-a okay?

143
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,771
She's not.

144
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,150
-She's in the bathroom.
-What?

145
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,361
You.

146
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,573
Is it okay to get your hands wet?

147
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,162
You can even wash the dishes.
You're a state-of-the-art robot.

148
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,041
Of course.

149
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,252
I even wash the dishes.
I'm a state-of-the-art robot.

150
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,382
That's a lie.

151
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,972
You can't deceive me. Not in my own house.

152
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,146
Does this look like
a cleaning solution to you?

153
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,608
It says so in French
on the label right here.

154
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,154
You speak 15 languages.
Are your sensors broken?

155
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,740
Can't you tell it just by the smell?

156
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,870
Cleaning with perfume
is all the rage these days.

157
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,747
Oh, with a million-won perfume?

158
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,749
You'll pour this down the toilet?

159
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,169
Sorry, the cleansing solution alone
didn't take away the smell.

160
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,547
This is insane.

161
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,509
Just because your master is rich...

162
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,599
You.

163
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,519
You're a bit strange.

164
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,770
Pardon?

165
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,688
How so?

166
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,983
That liquid dripping down your cheek.

167
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,570
It looks

168
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,323
just like a sweat.

169
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,689
Hey!

170
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,133
Get...

171
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,885
Get off me!

172
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,474
-Serves you right.
-Serves... What?

173
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,435
It's the corset.

174
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,520
-The titanium corset.
-Get off!

175
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,688
That must hurt a lot.

176
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:56,066
That must hurt really bad
considering that it's a real metal.

177
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,278
It's done.

178
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:03,782
Mr. Baton will now believe
that Ji-a is no doubt a robot.

179
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,709
Are your muscles very tense, master?

180
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,380
I'm getting a massage
because I ache all over because of you.

181
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,136
Shall I adjust the mode?

182
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,061
Shall I lend you my robot hands?

183
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,318
Aren't I quite useful?

184
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,613
What did you do
with your useful hands earlier?

185
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,282
You pushed me away
and caught the bottle of perfume!

186
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:52,581
Because it was your special
one-million won perfume.

187
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,920
You, sit. Sit down.

188
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,381
Listen.

189
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,634
I am a human being. And you are?

190
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,845
-A robot.
-Exactly, a robot.

191
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,224
You may look like a human,
but you're made of metal.

192
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,560
Your body is a lethal weapon to us.

193
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,896
You cannot forget that
for a single second.

194
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,108
Think about the situation
we were in earlier.

195
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,152
"If I were to fall here,

196
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,154
I would crush my master.

197
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,616
I should twist sideways
and land next to him."

198
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,035
Shouldn't you have done that?

199
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,914
Physically speaking,
the vector of the speed at which I fell...

200
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,750
...was greater than the vector
of the speed at which I could avoid you.

201
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,378
It would have been more rational
for you to move aside.

202
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,089
That came out so nicely. I'm so smart.

203
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,592
Why are you talking about physics?

204
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,679
I'm talking about the attitude
with which you should serve me.

205
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,974
I do not understand what you mean.
Would you tell me again?

206
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,939
Should I just sell her?

207
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,861
What kind of situation is that?

208
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,115
A dog is saving a person.

209
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,325
That's right.

210
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,493
You're equivalent to that dog.

211
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,455
That dog is risking its life
for its owner.

212
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,166
Just like that dog,
you need to protect me with bravery.

213
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,792
Input this as "Mission."

214
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,211
That dog is saving its owner

215
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,048
because the owner showed it
love and affection.

216
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,300
You should show me loyalty first.

217
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,093
Show me half of what he has.

218
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,055
Only if you love me half as much
as that human loves his dog.

219
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,389
Human?

220
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,141
Wait a minute.

221
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,604
-How did you know that was human?
-Because he is.

222
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,399
No, that's not what I mean.
His face looks a bit different.

223
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,609
Doesn't it look a little weird?

224
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,903
Regardless of looks,
a human is still human.

225
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,156
Wait here.

226
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,202
What's wrong with him?

227
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,999
Aji 3, help!

228
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,584
Help, Aji 3!

229
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,053
Who am I?

230
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,892
Hey.

231
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,814
You recognized that guy on the TV
as a human being.

232
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,357
Why can't you recognize me?

233
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,901
Oh, it's my master.

234
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,571
Oh, it's a cat.

235
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,282
It's a cat. It's my master. Cat. Master.

236
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,912
My master's laughing.

237
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,540
I'll give you 20 points.

238
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:43,627
You're probably the first one here
to get points by making me laugh.

239
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,342
I hope you'll recognize me
even if I change.

240
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:55,222
Regardless of what I look like.

241
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,147
I promise

242
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,400
to cherish you...

243
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,113
and love you.

244
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,991
What's this?

245
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,453
Such sweet words, but I feel like a dog.

246
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:24,168
If I ever change to such an extent
that you can't recognize me just like now,

247
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,921
go inside that room that I forbid you
to enter and open the drawer.

248
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,882
You'll find a needle inside.

249
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,885
Follow the emergency procedure
and give me an injection.

250
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:37,347
Then you'll get 500 points in one go
and you'll be part of the Pretty level.

251
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,641
What does he mean?

252
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,644
I'm done.

253
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,022
There's nothing left inside of me.

254
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,276
I thought my intestines
were going to fall into the toilet bowl.

255
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,779
My goodness.

256
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,491
How can you still ask for food
right after you just emptied your stomach?

257
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,702
We are the brotherhood of shit.

258
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,663
It would be nice to respect
each other's intestines.

259
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,581
Forget it.

260
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,294
-Isn't that salmon?
-Please don't do this to me.

261
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,129
I want to lie down inside there.

262
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,221
My gosh, there's nothing to eat.

263
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,431
What an annoying bourgeois.

264
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,683
-That psycho--
-I'm speechless.

265
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,352
He must be crazy.

266
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,896
Should I order something for you?

267
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,773
I can't eat what others make.

268
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,149
They might have spat on the food.

269
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,778
He should be institutionalized.

270
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,279
And in a straightjacket.

271
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,536
This expires tomorrow.

272
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,787
You're out.

273
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,955
Is he out of his mind?

274
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,249
-You too.
-Why would he throw that away?

275
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,085
-No.
-Don't throw that away.

276
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,380
-This needs to go, too.
-I want to slap him with steaks.

277
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,509
Gosh, the Hanwoo beef I ordered
should be here soon.

278
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,395
What?

279
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,816
What's wrong with this? This isn't good.

280
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,359
Hey.

281
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,613
FROM PRESIDENT CHO
TO KIM MIN-GYU

282
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,250
He needs to sprinkle that three times.

283
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,669
-That must taste so good.
-Yes, that's how you do it.

284
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,895
Oh, my gosh.
It looks and smells so delicious.

285
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,689
Now that's how you make tteokbokki.

286
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,816
How is your master?

287
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,109
It looks delicious.

288
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,486
What?

289
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,405
You're impressive.

290
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,950
Just impressive? Aren't I very impressive?

291
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,912
Input me as "Super-duper Impressive."

292
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:09,166
I couldn't show you my skills
because I didn't have the chance,

293
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,959
but this is the kind of person I am.

294
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,046
Yes, you're right.
You're extremely impressive, master.

295
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,965
Now, let's give this a try.

296
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,973
This isn't food.

297
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,267
This is art.

298
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,519
It's so soft.

299
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,316
I can't watch. This is torture.

300
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,611
He's probably faking it.
I'm sure it doesn't taste good.

301
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,696
-It's lobster, Doctor.
-I know.

302
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,907
He put abalone inside. That says it all.

303
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,742
The octopus is practically just a garnish.

304
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,119
This is torture. My gosh.

305
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,705
We're locked up in here
and getting tortured.

306
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,707
Ji-a is gluttonous.

307
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,176
I would eat with you if you were human.

308
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,512
It's heartbreaking.

309
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,223
Shut it. My heart breaks much more.

310
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,268
I need to finish my mission,
so I can quit.

311
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,858
I'll make the perfect atmosphere
for you to enjoy your meal.

312
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,944
Please turn on classical music.

313
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,196
Please turn on a great view of the sea.

314
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,994
Good job. You memorized it well.

315
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,205
You're finally doing your job as a robot.

316
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,418
Turn on the advertisement
of KM Financial's start-up support system.

317
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,298
What's...

318
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,841
that?

319
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,225
KM FINANCIAL WILL SUPPORT YOUR DREAM
AND GIVE YOU HOPE

320
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:52,853
What's that?

321
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,231
That's the advertisement
of KM Financial's start-up support system.

322
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,859
The winner of 100 million won
will be announced soon.

323
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,320
You're even practicing
social contribution.

324
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,488
Super extremely impressive.

325
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,950
No one's wins the money, period.
Just turn it off.

326
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,954
You're the one who executed this.

327
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,081
Besides, it's a promise
of social contribution.

328
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,168
You should keep your word
for the company's image.

329
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,087
Your master never does such petty events.

330
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,090
Some people's lives depend
on that petty event.

331
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,884
Those crooks.

332
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,927
"Crooks"?

333
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,263
What do they take me for?

334
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,099
What do you think? You're a nasty...

335
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,980
If you don't take part
in such petty events,

336
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,815
what kind of person are you?

337
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,069
Why are you asking me that
in the middle of my meal?

338
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,113
I need to know you better
in order to lure...

339
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,825
No. I need to know you better
in order to serve you better.

340
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,245
But if she only needs to focus
on one person,

341
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,873
the accuracy of the input
will become very high.

342
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,459
And that will allow her to read
even the most complicated emotions.

343
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,962
So that's what she's trying to do.

344
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,632
Okay, fine.

345
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,219
You can use this chance
to input information about me,

346
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,930
and start having a deep sense of respect.

347
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,308
Let me tell you about myself.

348
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:14,976
First of all,

349
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,561
I'm rich.

350
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,146
I'm really rich.

351
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,358
I have so much money that I don't even
feel bad boasting about it.

352
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,944
Is that who you are?

353
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,907
Well...

354
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,370
No, that's not who I am.

355
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,500
I'm the boss with full control
over KM Financial.

356
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,918
Yes, that's right. I'm the boss.

357
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,504
Is that who you are?

358
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,257
Well...

359
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,217
I guess...

360
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,137
that's not who I am.

361
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:54,057
Then what kind of person are you?

362
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,231
Listen to me carefully, Aji 3.
I'll tell you who I am.

363
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,315
Well...

364
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,903
Your master is...

365
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,783
Well, to explain a little about myself...

366
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,788
Wait.

367
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:22,252
I don't think you have time
for chatting here with me.

368
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,757
Look, your senior is cleaning
the house all by itself.

369
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,926
Look over there.

370
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,097
Hurry up and clean.
Go help your senior. Hurry!

371
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,558
How dare you slack off? Get going.

372
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,518
Yes, master.

373
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,607
My gosh, this is all cold now.
Why did she have to ask me that?

374
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,420
He doesn't even know who he is,
and yet, he criticized me?

375
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,838
Should I enlighten you?

376
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,593
I refuse to give a single penny
to a con artist.

377
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,263
Not only did you steal
my precious 300,000 won...

378
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,682
Happy Birthday, Pretty.

379
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:22,395
...you're a psycho who celebrates
a robot vacuum's birthday.

380
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,690
The worst self-centered freak ever.

381
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,290
-Oh, my gosh.
-No.

382
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,855
Hey!

383
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,568
Goodness.

384
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,321
Tell him your battery is low.
Bring her here.

385
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,785
Only five percent of battery life remains.
Switching to standby mode.

386
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,787
Please call me after charging.

387
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:38,388
I think I let in a mad dog
inside my house.

388
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,183
Is Aji 3 modeled after beagles?

389
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,936
She does resemble beagles.

390
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,774
It seems to follow my orders, but...

391
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,277
She ends up doing everything
that she wants.

392
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,529
In making things worse,

393
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,406
-she's the best.
-She's the best.

394
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,745
Are we in agreement? This feels awkward.

395
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,373
I'm talking about your robot.

396
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm frustrated.

397
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,752
Not more than I am.

398
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,213
Aji 3 that I trained was so lovely
and obedient.

399
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,465
What happened?

400
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,551
Are you saying that I'm the problem?

401
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,596
This isn't your fault at all.

402
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,932
The problem
is that unpredictable beagle goat.

403
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,774
This is unbelievable.

404
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,818
Someone has more Hanwoo beef
than he can eat.

405
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,363
Life is so freaking unfair.

406
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,449
I'm sorry that we don't have much.

407
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,666
Should we eat Hanwoo beef?

408
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:53,338
Sometimes she doesn't understand
what I'm telling her.

409
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,049
In my opinion,

410
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,427
her system has a serious problem.

411
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:05,934
What do you mean
by "she doesn't understand"?

412
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,310
What did Aji 3 do?

413
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,817
That robot chose to save a perfume bottle
over her own master.

414
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,153
I said that's not good.

415
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,280
I said she should save the master instead.

416
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,241
Then she started talking about physics.

417
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,158
Goodness.

418
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,869
Also, when I instruct her
what to do in case of emergency,

419
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,413
she didn't get it at all.

420
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,539
My goodness.

421
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,374
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

422
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,960
When you invite guests,

423
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,629
you're supposed to check
if they're eating well.

424
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:38,341
But he only cares about himself
and treats us like dirt.

425
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:43,012
You said that Aji 3 is capable
of sharing emotions.

426
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,348
I don't feel that way at all.

427
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,808
When will she understand me?

428
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:50,478
Is it even possible
to share emotions with her?

429
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,314
I must...

430
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,274
Those little...

431
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,985
...reconsider signing
the contract regarding Aji 3...

432
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,238
Where do you keep looking?

433
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,491
What I mean by training her

434
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,869
is forming a relationship.

435
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,120
Right.

436
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,496
Relationship.

437
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,414
Relationship?

438
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,083
You said that it's about input.

439
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,296
What you input is the issue.

440
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,715
If you simply input data,

441
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,842
your relationship with Aji 3

442
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:25,013
will be like that of a smart secretary
and her boss.

443
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,766
If you input emotions with the data,

444
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:32,395
you'll develop a relationship
where you can share emotions with her.

445
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,233
Input my emotions?

446
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,281
-This looks amazing.
-It's innovative.

447
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,408
It was my idea.

448
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,952
I'm the one who built it.

449
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:52,624
Shall we have a meeting
to discuss business with your items?

450
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,880
Would you please stop glaring at me?

451
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,674
They would've rotted anyway.
Might as well eat them.

452
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,968
Isn't it better for the environment?

453
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,678
Is the beer for the environment, too?

454
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:09,766
Alcohol follows meat.
It's the rule of thumb in nature.

455
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,100
I'll do it.

456
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,773
Okay, get ready to eat.
Let's drink, everyone.

457
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,690
Gosh.

458
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,817
Cheers!

459
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:29,702
I've been wondering whose idea
was that tacky pink uniform.

460
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,955
You should have made it prettier.

461
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,915
I bet you can't even buy that anywhere.

462
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,710
Are you asking because you don't remember?

463
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,672
One order of pork rinds, please.

464
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,965
Yes, coming.

465
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,676
-More beer, please.
-Okay.

466
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,563
-The meat is so delicious.
-Help yourself.

467
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,815
Try some.

468
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,819
-It's a big piece.
-Thank you.

469
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,821
No, that's enough.

470
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,869
-I didn't order that.
-Someone ordered it for you.

471
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,037
-They must have liked watching you eat.
-Really?

472
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,747
-Yes.
-That's amazing.

473
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,425
Remember what?

474
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,888
Please eat some meat.

475
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,100
Gosh.

476
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,437
Eat one piece at a time.

477
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,772
You're not the only one eating.
There are others...

478
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,569
Check. What is happening here?

479
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:48,364
It looks like the exes
are getting back together.

480
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,742
It seems that way.

481
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,660
When you live together,

482
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,997
love might spark again.

483
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,583
This isn't a horror film.
That sounds awful.

484
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,210
"A horror film"? "Awful"?

485
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,130
Am I going to eat you alive or something?

486
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,007
What's so awful about that?

487
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,010
We want to erase each other
from our pasts.

488
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,890
HOW TO TRAIN BEAGLES

489
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:23,316
This will not be easy. My gosh.

490
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,695
To solve the problem,

491
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,073
I must input emotions
to form a relationship.

492
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,367
Relationship?

493
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,374
WHAT IS A RELATIONSHIP?

494
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,001
"A relationship is

495
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,588
planting roots in someone's heart."

496
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:52,345
Planting roots in someone's heart?

497
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,015
But Aji 3 doesn't have a heart.

498
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,691
AJI 3 REMOTE ACCESS

499
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,824
I love you, master. How may I help you?

500
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,492
Okay.

501
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:58,995
Come home.

502
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,246
Yes, master.

503
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,583
It's a remote control system.

504
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,793
Mr. Baton asked for it.

505
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,802
So did you sleep well?

506
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,220
Yes, master.

507
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,098
You don't sleep.
You just recharged your battery.

508
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,770
What's today's weather?

509
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,565
It will be sunny today.

510
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,233
The maximum temperature is 5℃.

511
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,778
Isn't it a great day to go out?

512
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,237
KOSPI Index.

513
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,325
Today's KOSPI Index is 2,530.67.

514
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,744
It went down 1.87 from yesterday.

515
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,829
I recommend you keep

516
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,581
your blue-chip stocks
and sell some of the rest.

517
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,459
It's really convenient.

518
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,212
The sun is shining so brightly.

519
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,006
Why don't you go out to the park?

520
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,009
Forget about going outside.
You deserve a scolding.

521
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,511
Aji 3.

522
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,180
What used to be there?

523
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,769
Well...

524
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,272
The card castle used to be there.

525
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,234
Why is it not there anymore?

526
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:17,323
-You cleaned it up.
-Yes, I cleaned it up.

527
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,910
Because a beagle made a mess of it.

528
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,204
Shall I...

529
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,498
build another one?

530
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,083
You?

531
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:31,379
It took me 15 years to build that one.

532
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,005
Fifteen years?

533
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,832
My dad and I started building it together
when I was young.

534
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:11,419
I kept adding more layers until now.

535
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,963
That's why...

536
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:19,427
when you toppled it over,
I was very angry.

537
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,225
But look.

538
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,438
The sun...

539
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,150
shines so brightly through that window.

540
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,572
I like to sit by this window.

541
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,243
I always thought it was dark.

542
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,623
I never thought
it was because of the card castle.

543
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,128
I want you to input...

544
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,090
my current face and emotions.

545
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,468
Aji 3.

546
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,097
You brought back the sunlight
for the rest of my life.

547
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,352
Your master is very pleased right now.

548
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:15,483
Stick to being a nasty jerk.
You're giving me whiplash.

549
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,360
Also...

550
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,871
Hey.

551
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,415
Watch around when you clean.
For god's sake.

552
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,084
The most expensive thing here...

553
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:35,920
is you.

554
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,381
You cost the most.

555
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,733
Go hide. You must not come outside.

556
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,569
Mr. Seong.

557
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,571
Tell Dr. Hong and his team

558
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,991
to stay inside their building
and not come out.

559
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,993
Why aren't you hiding?

560
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,370
Oh, yes, master.

561
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,710
I used to come over so often
when we were young.

562
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,003
Get to the point.

563
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,756
Why did you cancel the deal?

564
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,342
I would like to know,
seeing as I am the CEO.

565
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,803
You're the CEO?

566
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,264
You should be glad you weren't dismissed.

567
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,224
For what reason?

568
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,227
Mergers and Acquisitions

569
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,439
is when you buy something worth 10,000 won
for 500 and sell it for 5,000.

570
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:40,151
It's stupid to buy a 1,000-won item
for 500 and sell it for 600.

571
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,277
But you...

572
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,904
got that stupid with Daeyang Shipbuilding.

573
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,364
It wasn't a loss.

574
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,366
We barely covered the labor costs.

575
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,243
By trying extremely hard.

576
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,079
Martin offered to pay double the price.

577
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,164
Oh, dear.

578
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,248
Is it still off?

579
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:58,919
The more you open your mouth to speak,

580
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,547
the less qualified you seem
to be as a CEO.

581
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,506
Hey.

582
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,343
I have my limits.

583
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,510
Don't hold back.

584
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,598
I never told you to hold back.

585
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,975
Not even once.

586
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,867
Aji 3.

587
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,203
Do you know who they are?

588
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,455
EARNINGS OF TWO TRILLION WON

589
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,666
At the left is KM Financial's
Chairman Hwang Do-won.

590
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,711
The right is KM Financial's
CEO Hwang Yu-cheol.

591
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,588
They are both finances gentlemen--

592
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,048
Who says they're gentlemen?

593
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,300
That's fake news. Delete it.

594
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,344
Aji 3.

595
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,137
Input this.

596
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,014
Those two people

597
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,558
are your master's archenemies.

598
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,560
The worst of the worst.

599
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,520
Why?

600
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,066
It's a long story. Just input that.

601
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,694
If you ever cross paths with them,

602
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:06,946
you must hide.

603
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,031
You can't let them see you. Hide well.

604
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,324
Why?

605
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,828
Those two people

606
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:18,040
might know you're a robot.
And if they do...

607
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,711
they might destroy you.

608
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,181
Aji 3, can you make coffee?

609
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,100
Of course, I worked at cafes for...

610
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,893
Two cups to the garden. I have a guest.

611
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,486
Social Contribution Team
will hire a new head.

612
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,197
The CEO, Hwang Yu-cheol,
will handpick someone unknown.

613
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,576
He's being stupid again.
I'm going to dissolve that team.

614
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:54,743
Next.

615
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,872
Next is about what you told me
to do secretly.

616
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:02,209
Chairman Hwang used his corporate card
at a hotel two days ago.

617
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,377
And?

618
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,464
Bold Group's president, Martin,
is staying there right now.

619
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,724
What is my brother doing here?

620
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,934
Shall I find out more about Martin?

621
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,644
He should be in court.

622
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,063
What is he doing with that freak?

623
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,524
Bring them over.

624
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,257
Thank...

625
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,053
Hey.

626
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,184
What's wrong with your hair?

627
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,394
The wind is too strong.

628
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,022
Who...

629
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:08,317
It's Aji 3. Don't you know?

630
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,821
I didn't see her last time.

631
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,616
You should say "hi" now that you've met.

632
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:19,495
Aji 3, meet Cho Jin-bae,
our Head of Investigations.

633
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,291
-Hello.
-Hello.

634
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,922
She feels so familiar
and she is very lifelike.

635
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,674
Stay there.

636
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,843
Please let me go inside.

637
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:35,844
Right.

638
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:40,182
Did you find a way
to accuse President Cho?

639
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,936
No, you told me I didn't have to anymore.

640
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,938
I said that one issue had been solved.

641
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,857
I didn't mean to drop it entirely.

642
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,609
I apologize, sir.

643
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:51,777
Oh, dear.

644
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,156
Do you think you'll last
if you keep working like that?

645
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,200
I'm really sorry.

646
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,452
Why are you bowing to him?

647
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,788
I shall look into it right away.

648
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,290
Don't do that.

649
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,959
Don't bow down to a jerk like him.

650
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,004
That's fine.

651
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,464
She has something that's mine.

652
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,259
If I don't get it, I'll sue her.

653
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,011
Leave it for now.

654
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,345
Yes, sir.

655
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,224
-You may go.
-Yes, sir.

656
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,247
Is someone in there?

657
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,082
Can you fix something for me?

658
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,048
Why you little...

659
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:57,259
Shall I input Cho Jin-bae
as "Friend" or "Foe"?

660
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,178
I don't know yet. I'm still testing.

661
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,346
Put him in under "Unsorted."

662
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,057
Why not? I can tell right away.

663
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,059
Can you?

664
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,979
What kind of a person do you think he is?

665
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:13,275
He's honest, hard-working, determined,
really warm-hearted...

666
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,193
You're right.

667
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,488
-What?
-That's what someone said.

668
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,573
Who said that?

669
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,576
CHO JIN-BAE'S X-FILE

670
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,955
Someone anonymous
who is either a spy or a guardian angel.

671
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,041
HONEST, HARD-WORKING, DETERMINED

672
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,961
But that's other people's evaluation
of him.

673
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,589
No one knows what he'll be like around me.

674
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:38,717
Strip.

675
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,845
We're going out. Change into that.

676
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,474
Go on.

677
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:49,061
I have to change.

678
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,437
I know. Go ahead.

679
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,107
I can't until you leave.

680
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,359
I'll stay in case you dislocate an arm.

681
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,486
Please leave.

682
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,240
You showed me everything already.

683
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,584
Seon-hye, is everyone there?

684
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,461
We're coming over. Be ready.

685
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,548
Turn right here.

686
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,886
Is this it?

687
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,847
I don't think it is.

688
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,474
An accident occurred ten minutes ago.

689
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,560
We're taking an alternative route.

690
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,937
That means we'll take longer to get there.

691
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,106
Why didn't you just ask me?

692
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,942
This section is often congested.

693
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,989
Did you just get irritated?

694
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,161
In 300 meters, turn right.

695
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,372
Turn right.

696
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,961
It's my company.

697
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,129
Oh, dear.

698
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,465
There must be an error in the GPS.

699
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,343
Continue the start-up support system!

700
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,471
-Who are they?
-Continue!

701
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,849
KM Financial should honor their promise
to support entrepreneurs.

702
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,517
-Honor it.
-Honor it.

703
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,520
I think they're protesting.
What do you think it's about?

704
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,149
"Host the last stage
of the entrepreneur competition"?

705
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,151
What a joke.

706
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,278
Why isn't the security doing anything?

707
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,614
This is a democratic country.

708
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:26,533
People have the right
to voice out their opinions.

709
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,577
Why are you siding them?

710
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,662
You should side with your master.

711
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,540
A proper robot sides with justice.

712
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,919
The head of the Social Contribution Team
embezzled funds

713
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:40,088
by taking rebates from people
who wanted funding.

714
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,842
Is that justice?

715
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,641
ALL SEATS RESERVED

716
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:00,484
It has been in a while, Director Ye.

717
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,861
Who is she?

718
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,113
Is she your new secretary?

719
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,703
YE RI-EL'S FATHER

720
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:12,621
SHOOT
SAVED

721
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,331
"Shoot"?

722
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,793
The photo of the girl classmate.

723
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,254
He's that girl's dad?

724
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,800
Did you consider investing
in Geumho Steel?

725
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,927
I buy and sell companies.

726
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,845
I do not invest.

727
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,641
There are always exceptions and variables.

728
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,394
I am very grateful that you sided with me
within the KM

729
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,730
when it comes
to making business decisions.

730
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:43,610
Geumho Steel must choose
between bankruptcy and a sale.

731
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,824
Your late father chose
to build up companies.

732
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:53,495
You have turned into a man
who eats up companies.

733
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:54,871
No.

734
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,707
I'm sure that...

735
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,378
my father would be relieved
if he saw me now.

736
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,759
Ri-el is flying in tomorrow. For good.

737
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,307
I see.

738
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,488
Excuse me.

739
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:32,868
Did your father pass away?

740
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,246
My mother too.

741
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:39,833
When?

742
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,628
Fifteen years ago.

743
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:45,922
In a car accident.

744
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,985
Hey, Kim Min-gyu.

745
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,614
-What?
-Why is your face all scrunched up?

746
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,074
Should I iron it out?

747
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,454
Are you back to Friend Mode?

748
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,665
It's a nice day. Try to smile.

749
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,792
There's no point in saving your smiles.

750
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,878
That's it, my friend.

751
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,213
Okay.

752
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,298
I'll smile for you.

753
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,301
Not for anyone else.

754
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,011
Why not?

755
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,930
I want to seem intimidating.

756
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:36,932
Why?

757
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,644
So they don't mistreat me.

758
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,730
Who is it?

759
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,275
Who dares to mistreat you?

760
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,861
Bring them all. I'll beat them all up.

761
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,663
Aji 3, which is coffee?

762
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,753
This is soy sauce.

763
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,340
This is hot chocolate.

764
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,136
-This is coffee.
-Good.

765
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,232
This is the Santa Maria team's
robot development program.

766
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:31,445
Right before Daeyang's Chairman Park died,
he met Chairman Hwang,

767
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,739
and handed this. Asking for funding.

768
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:36,783
What exactly is it that you do?

769
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,328
You should've told me this existed.

770
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,788
I apologize.

771
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,125
Your father didn't want
to put too much burden on you.

772
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,835
Who else knows about this?

773
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,254
Me, your father, and you.

774
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,548
What's the probability
of Min-gyu's knowing?

775
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,842
Legally, Santa Maria belongs
to KM Financial.

776
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,178
There's no reason for him
to keep quiet about it.

777
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:59,014
It would be a great weapon
to use against us.

778
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,897
-We did it.
-Santa Maria!

779
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,023
I said we would fix it.

780
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:11,318
-We did it.
-We did it.

781
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,903
Santa Maria did it.

782
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:16,323
-Well done, all of you.
-Not a problem.

783
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,284
The service people said
they couldn't come for a few days.

784
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,495
By the way,

785
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,040
why do you need
this X-ray scanner at home?

786
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,920
It's for Mr. Kim's safety.

787
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,880
Don't get me started.

788
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:35,467
Sending food waste is nothing.

789
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,803
He was cut hurt by shards of broken glass.

790
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,555
Once, an employee of a company
that he sold

791
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,724
sent a small ax.

792
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,100
Why that...

793
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,895
One time, people he had let go
from the company

794
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,356
even sent him a voodoo doll.

795
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,903
That's when we got this machine.

796
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:59,407
Only boxes that are cleared
are allowed inside the house.

797
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,334
Why is it so itchy?

798
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,839
Is my heart about to sprout or something?

799
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:40,532
Ri-el is flying in tomorrow. For good.

800
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,628
I'm in a taxi.

801
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,171
Yes.

802
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:47,682
Don't tell him I'm here.
I want it to be a surprise.

803
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:26,930
Aji 3, stay right here.

804
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,516
You can't come outside this time either.

805
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,892
Yes, master.

806
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,354
Is someone here?

807
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:36,314
Ri-el.

808
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,526
My first love.

809
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:09,264
This house is just like
how it used to be 15 years ago.

810
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,599
It's as if time stands still here.

811
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,522
Long time no see, Min-gyu.

812
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,984
Long time no see, Ye Ri-el.

813
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:25,572
How do I look? Do I seem more mature?

814
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,951
YE RI-EL, 28

815
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:30,869
Yes.

816
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:31,786
SHOOT
SAVED

817
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:33,329
You seem very mature.

818
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,623
That's some great career she has got.

819
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,502
Also, I was appointed as the head
of the Social Contribution Team

820
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,421
at your company.

821
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:46,259
So you're the one that Yu-cheol recruited.

822
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,845
But to be honest,
I have my reason for that decision.

823
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,514
What do you think that is? Guess.

824
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,225
I don't know. What is it?

825
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,854
My dad wants me to marry you.

826
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,983
It's obviously for your money.
You know that, right?

827
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,615
My answer to that proposal is...

828
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,455
Why not?

829
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,919
It's never bad to have a lot of money.

830
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,837
Plus, I know you very well.

831
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,215
It's better than marrying
some other rich guy I don't know

832
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,841
and being stabbed in the back.

833
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:27,801
Don't you agree?

834
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,763
Let's make a deal.

835
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:34,015
You can give me money and honor.

836
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,852
Then I'll delegate the voting power
for my dad's shares to you for life.

837
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,523
But even if it's just a marriage
of convenience,

838
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,985
we should still go on dates.

839
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,532
Let's have at least three tryout dates.

840
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:54,452
If I confirm that I can kiss you,
I'm up for this marriage.

841
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,914
What about you?

842
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,834
Are you okay?

843
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,210
I'm sorry.

844
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,547
You should go now. I have an appointment.

845
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:06,965
I'll call you.

846
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,764
Master.

847
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,494
Master, are you okay?

848
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:38,556
If I ever change to such an extent
that you can't recognize me just like now,

849
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:43,478
go inside that room that I forbid you
to enter and open the drawer.

850
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,572
You'll find a needle inside.

851
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,289
Follow the emergency procedure
and give me an injection.

852
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,965
I hope you'll recognize me
even if I change.

853
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:15,843
Regardless

854
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,638
of what I look like.

855
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:13,651
I'm curious.

856
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,987
Why did God leave me so many memories

857
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:18,448
that make me long
for those days so dearly?

858
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,492
Whether Mr. Baton is a pervert or not,

859
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,244
you still don't want to send Ji-a to him.

860
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,954
I would like
to officially reintroduce myself.

861
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,956
I'm Cho Jin-bae, Ji-a's older brother.

862
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,166
"That man"?

863
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:32,253
I thought he was
a psycho and a nasty jerk?

864
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,840
My gosh, how adorable. You're so adorable.

865
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,972
