1
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,477
If only she were...

2
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,604
a robot like you.

3
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,908
Then I could touch her hair.

4
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,203
And hold her hand.

5
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,958
And go to places with lots of people.

6
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,002
And...

7
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,889
even kiss her.

8
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,976
I wish.

9
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,073
Touching you gave me the answer.

10
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:17,952
I'll give this necklace...

11
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,997
as a present.

12
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,166
To the last woman...

13
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,336
of my life.

14
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,162
TO. MIN-GYU.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY! FROM RI-EL

15
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,331
She remembered my birthday, which is...

16
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,458
the same day I lost my parents.

17
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,590
On a day
that I can never be congratulated,

18
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,346
she gives me a little solace.

19
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,351
Will I meet...

20
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,020
someone like that again?

21
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,943
Thank you.

22
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,573
That is...

23
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,788
more than enough.

24
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,009
The weather is beautiful.

25
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:01,055
Who says anything about rain?

26
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,901
PETITION

27
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,823
This is the last time.

28
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,077
If this doesn't work, I'll give up.

29
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,213
What does he think I am?

30
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,425
He thinks that I'm a robot.

31
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,885
But still,

32
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,095
I look like a woman.

33
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,140
But I'm still a robot, indeed.

34
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,892
Yes, I made the reservation.

35
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,854
I reserved the whole place.

36
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:55,151
No, make it completely empty
without a single person.

37
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,111
I don't need that.

38
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,739
Servers?

39
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,248
Aji 3.

40
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,208
Look at the sky.

41
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,002
The clouds are beautiful.

42
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,551
Isn't the weather perfect
for a marriage proposal?

43
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,764
Will you propose today?

44
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,893
Heavy rain is expected soon.

45
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,479
That's even better.

46
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,696
Let's see.

47
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,699
-Three high tides.
-Three high tides.

48
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,120
-Excuse me, doctor.
-Yes?

49
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,748
You should take a look.

50
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,381
...even kiss her.

51
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,842
That psychotic pervert--

52
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,220
I thought you should make the decision.

53
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,097
I knew this would happen.

54
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,974
Bring Ji-a out of there.

55
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,060
She isn't home right now.

56
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,354
Then where is she?

57
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,815
RESTAURANT AND CAFE

58
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,734
WE'RE FULLY BOOKED
THANK YOU

59
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,784
Hot chocolate is for children.

60
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,454
She loves hot chocolate.

61
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,582
It's 1.5 cups of water
with four spoons of cocoa powder.

62
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,841
Proposing with a mug
might not be a good idea.

63
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,427
There's a story behind this mug.

64
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,056
She gave it to me as a birthday present.

65
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,391
When was that?

66
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,353
About 15 years ago.

67
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,939
You've kept it all this time?

68
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,776
She's...

69
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,654
very special to me.

70
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,410
Serve this to Ri-el when she arrives.

71
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,413
Yes, master.

72
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,836
She's here.

73
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,299
Don't make any mistakes.

74
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,391
Gosh, she's so pretty today.

75
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,481
Mr. Baton took her outside again.
This is driving me crazy.

76
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,859
-Locate Aji 3.
-Aji 3 is inside.

77
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,570
-He's talking about Ji-a.
-Oh, right.

78
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,743
I won't put up with that pervert anymore.

79
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,495
He better not lay his hands on Aji 3.

80
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,883
Why did you make me hot chocolate?

81
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,678
You like hot chocolate.

82
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,471
Yeah, when I was young.

83
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,100
It's too sweet for me now.

84
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,353
Gosh, I told you no hot chocolate.

85
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,314
Oh, I see.

86
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,900
I guess you don't like it anymore.

87
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,902
What's this mug?

88
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,906
It's really corny, don't you think?

89
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,324
You...

90
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,953
gave me that as a gift.

91
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,913
A gift?

92
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,331
Yes. It was a birthday gift.

93
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,543
-A long time ago.
-Did I?

94
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,089
Why do you keep talking about the past?
It makes you look old.

95
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,841
It makes you look old-fashioned.

96
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,636
Really?

97
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,015
But since you prepared this just for me,

98
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,933
I'll be nice and drink it.

99
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,441
It's really sweet.

100
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,779
She just insulted him twice.

101
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,326
So what's your answer?

102
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,161
What do you think?

103
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,246
He's going to give you the necklace.

104
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,875
Please bring us two cups of coffee.

105
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,882
Tell me your answer first.

106
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,304
Ri-el.

107
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,932
I'm not going...

108
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,477
to go on three dates with you.

109
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,106
And I'm not going to kiss you.

110
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,236
So, we're going to get married right away?

111
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,531
No.

112
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,409
Are you seeing someone?

113
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,209
What am I going to tell my dad?

114
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:07,547
I'm pretty, smart,
and have impressive credentials.

115
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,257
How am I going to tell him
that I got rejected?

116
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,261
Tell him that he'll be rewarded
in some other way.

117
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,055
And here.

118
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,103
What's this?

119
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,816
This is your mother's necklace.

120
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,609
Why are you giving me this?

121
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,445
You used to want it.

122
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,073
Wait.

123
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,410
Let me make this clear.

124
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,538
Are you proposing to me,
or are you rejecting me?

125
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,206
It's...

126
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,000
neither.

127
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,045
I'm just giving it to you as your friend.

128
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,507
I guess we're going to stay friends
from now on.

129
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,472
But I don't think it's something
I should be getting from a friend.

130
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,018
You should just take it.

131
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,312
I drank your tea and heard your answer.

132
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,898
It's customary for dumpers
to wait until dumpees leave.

133
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,861
Here.

134
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,867
Let's shake hands
and forget about getting married.

135
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,814
You're going to regret it
once I get married to someone else.

136
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,569
Yes, of course.

137
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,197
I'll definitely regret it.

138
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,451
You're the first and last woman...

139
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,455
I'll ever have in my life.

140
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,669
I'll go now.

141
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,568
I'm just going to get married.

142
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,321
This might be my one and only chance.

143
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,448
Go ahead.

144
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,492
Really?

145
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,702
Is there a way?

146
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,788
Do whatever you want if you want to die.

147
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,266
Master.

148
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,102
Why would you throw that away?
It's your mother's.

149
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,980
I want to be alone. Please leave.

150
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,940
-But--
-Get lost!

151
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,805
Let's go...

152
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,517
home.

153
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,330
You're right.

154
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,373
About what?

155
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,836
That story about my friend
was actually about me.

156
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,088
And as you already know, I rejected her.

157
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,758
No.

158
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:27,968
I got rejected.

159
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,138
Why are you being so honest
all of a sudden?

160
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,810
Because it's you.

161
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,148
I already showed you everything,

162
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,901
so I don't think I'll be embarrassed
to tell you the truth.

163
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,113
Then does that mean
we've become close enough

164
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,700
to tell each other embarrassing things
about ourselves?

165
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,662
It's so unfair.

166
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,082
I have so many things
to be embarrassed about since I'm human.

167
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,626
But that's not the case for you
since you're a robot.

168
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,255
Can I ask you something?

169
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,094
Why did you give her
that precious necklace

170
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,345
when you got rejected?

171
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,180
I told you already.

172
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,559
She's the first and last woman
I'll ever love.

173
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,812
Someone else might come along.

174
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,647
No one will ever come along.

175
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,357
What if someone does?

176
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,905
My gosh, forget it.

177
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:34,451
A robot like you wouldn't understand
a human's infinite feelings.

178
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,872
I do know that you need me right now.

179
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,708
I need you?

180
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,668
Why else are you holding my hand?

181
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,547
I don't know.

182
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,632
Why was I holding it?

183
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,804
I'm cured.

184
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,476
I didn't inject myself.

185
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,771
How strange.

186
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,370
Are you okay?

187
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,502
Get away from me!

188
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,922
I told them to empty the cafe.
Why are you here?

189
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,966
I wasn't informed of anything like that.

190
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,469
No wonder there aren't any customers.

191
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,554
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

192
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,892
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

193
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:40,809
No.

194
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,687
I'm just fine.

195
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,356
I'm too fine.

196
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,193
Then there is no problem.

197
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,652
That's impossible.

198
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,404
No.

199
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,115
I cannot not have an allergic reaction.
Wait.

200
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,790
Mister.

201
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,004
Will you please touch me?

202
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,882
Mister.

203
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,051
Mister.

204
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,553
Mister!

205
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,806
Mister.

206
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,727
Don't you dare come back!

207
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,439
You want me to touch you? Where?

208
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,899
DOCTOR OH

209
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,944
Are you crazy?

210
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,280
Or was that guy your type?

211
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,450
Yes. I'm crazy. I'm not in my right mind.

212
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,495
Is he reacting to the break-up now?

213
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,872
Why isn't he picking up?

214
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,144
Do you need a distraction?

215
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,147
Then let's go.

216
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,110
We can walk among those people.

217
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,154
I'll cheer you up, friend.

218
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,172
Hello.

219
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,760
Just talk.

220
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,305
-Sorry.
-I said no.

221
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,121
This is so cute.

222
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,042
-It's cute.
-Do you want it?

223
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,425
It's only 9,900 won.
Don't you have any small change?

224
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,599
Hello.

225
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,893
What's this?

226
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,356
I am Pretty Four.

227
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,358
ENLISTING TOMORROW

228
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,235
-This is silly.
-Goodbye.

229
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,904
Let's take a photo with your phone.

230
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:21,905
Here.

231
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,453
PRETTY, ENLISTING TOMORROW

232
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,999
Hello. One ice cream cake, please.

233
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,083
Sure.

234
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,794
Would you like to press the button?

235
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,965
-This?
-This looks like fun.

236
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,758
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

237
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,554
Normal?

238
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,659
-Your girlfriend's very pretty.
-What?

239
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,954
She isn't my girlfriend.

240
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,622
Still, not just friends, right?

241
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,801
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING
SANTA MARIA

242
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,028
Hello? Min-gyu?

243
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,113
I...

244
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,158
I was cured.

245
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,621
But I'm having a sudden reaction.

246
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,582
Where are you? Your pills.
Do you have a syringe?

247
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,044
No.

248
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,587
I don't.

249
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,215
I don't have...

250
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,259
I don't have anything.

251
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,753
Hello? Min-gyu.

252
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,138
Stay with me. Is there anyone nearby?

253
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,516
Someone...

254
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,644
is here.

255
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,985
Doctor Oh.

256
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,530
When I see someone...

257
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,866
the rashes go away.

258
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,996
And when I don't see someone,
the rashes come back.

259
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,583
Do you believe me?

260
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,169
What? What are you saying?

261
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,796
When you see someone?

262
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,601
It's not...

263
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,771
a person.

264
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,430
-They're so lovely.
-Congratulations.

265
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,309
It was because of you.

266
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,939
It was because you were by my side.

267
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:35,700
I will buy you
the world's longest-lasting batteries.

268
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,622
Be with me...

269
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,416
until I die.

270
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,294
Be with me forever.

271
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,090
You are...

272
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,593
the most precious treasure...

273
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,679
of mine.

274
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,857
-Bravo.
-Congratulations.

275
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,320
-Congratulations.
-Way to go.

276
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,406
He finally lost his mind.

277
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,201
You pervert.

278
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,453
How dare you kiss her
with those filthy lips?

279
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,497
I didn't send her for this.

280
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,624
Are you okay? Let's go.

281
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,128
Where are you going? I'm your master.

282
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,883
What did I tell you?

283
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,052
Stay by my side.

284
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,721
I'm the expert.

285
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,597
I'm her master.

286
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,266
I'm the one who built her.

287
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,730
Battery only has five percent remaining.

288
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,149
Entering standby mode for recharge.

289
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,862
Hey, you!

290
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,413
You're good now.
He can't see you. Breathe.

291
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,583
My gosh, I almost died.

292
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,418
But...

293
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,629
why were you there? Did you follow me?

294
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,590
We almost got caught.

295
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,967
I told you not to follow him outside.

296
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,969
Why did you get yourself in trouble?

297
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,971
-What trouble?
-"What trouble?"

298
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,350
Hey, he almost... He could've kissed...

299
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,352
On your forehead...

300
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,395
Gosh, forget it. Let's just drop it.

301
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,522
Are you rebelling against me?

302
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,191
What? Why would I?

303
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,860
Why are you overreacting?
Why won't you listen to me?

304
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,653
Okay, I'm sorry.

305
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,157
I'm going to take a nap,
so tell me when we arrive.

306
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,576
How can you sleep in this situation?

307
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,790
Fine.

308
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,958
Just sleep.

309
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,776
What did I do?

310
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:30,083
HYOSEONG VILLA

311
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,675
Are we here?

312
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,764
What? This is my house.

313
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,683
I thought you would still be living here.

314
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,519
Why are we here
instead of going to that house?

315
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,772
I'll bring you your stuff.
You can give me my stuff then.

316
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,649
What are you talking about? Why?

317
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,859
The test is over.

318
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,361
Your part-time job is over.

319
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,116
I'm telling the truth.

320
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,661
I bumped into all those people,
but I was completely fine.

321
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,874
I'm serious. Nothing happened to me.

322
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,336
Doctor Oh, how can I make you believe me?

323
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,470
See?

324
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,513
There's nothing.

325
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,182
Unbelievable.

326
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,311
You can't heal this rapidly
without the injection.

327
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,479
Exactly.

328
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,189
It's been 15 years.

329
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,442
You tried all kinds of medicine
for 15 years, but none of it worked.

330
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,612
This is the first time you've experienced
a breakthrough like this.

331
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,365
Is this all because of that robot
you showed me?

332
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,784
Yes,

333
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,204
although I can't exactly tell you why.

334
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,748
So you brought a robot
that looks exactly like a human,

335
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,167
and you don't get any rashes
when she's with you?

336
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,377
That's right.

337
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,340
How long has she stayed with you?

338
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,967
Well...

339
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,385
About ten days?

340
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,471
What did you do with that robot?

341
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,558
What do you mean? I just stayed with her.

342
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,393
What exactly did you do with her?

343
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,688
I didn't really do much.

344
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,733
Listen to me carefully.

345
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,570
This is a miracle.
You've experienced a miracle.

346
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,864
First, keep a record
of every single change you've experienced

347
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,951
ever since that robot came
into your house.

348
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,369
Even the smallest things.

349
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,414
If you put those things together,
you might get something.

350
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,959
You might find out
how she was able to cure you.

351
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,351
Gosh, we bought so much.

352
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,272
My goodness, are you happy?

353
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,358
-Please open the door.
-Please open the door for Mom.

354
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:01,734
Let's go.

355
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,388
Ji-a, you did your best.

356
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,099
Your part-time job is over.

357
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,685
Let's leave the final results to fate.

358
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,438
Yes.

359
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,318
They won't be able to reject
that heartfelt petition I sent them.

360
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,949
It feels nice to lie down on a warm mat.

361
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,412
My puppy, you're so adorable.

362
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,893
Come back to your senses, Ji-a. Wake up.

363
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,186
Rock-paper-scissors.

364
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,063
My gosh, stop it.

365
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,609
Gosh, it's hot.

366
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,951
What was the meaning behind that kiss?

367
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,620
Was he thinking of me as a kid or a woman?

368
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,544
To him, you were just a robot.

369
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,296
You are a robot.

370
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,131
-Kiss me.
-Kiss me.

371
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,094
-Kiss me.
-My goodness.

372
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,639
-It's so cold.
-Is it?

373
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,307
It's so cold.

374
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:10,405
You must have lost your mind
somewhere in space.

375
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,906
Shall I get it back for you?

376
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,326
Do you want me to help you see
what it feels like to go head-down

377
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,121
into the Grand Canyon, you son of a witch?

378
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,336
Was that when the miracle happened?

379
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,908
Or was it then?

380
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,000
Why can't you recognize me?

381
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,669
Oh, it's my master.

382
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,130
Oh, It's a cat.

383
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,008
It's a cat. It's my master. Cat. Master.

384
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,596
My master's laughing.

385
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,853
She was really cute then.

386
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,860
You're so cute.

387
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,905
But cuteness doesn't bring miracles.

388
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,161
Hi, Doctor.

389
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,331
Min-gyu, does that robot
look very much like a human?

390
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,334
Well, yes.

391
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,378
Did you tell that robot of your troubles?

392
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,256
Well, yes.

393
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,467
Did you mention your illness?

394
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,221
Well...

395
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,848
kind of?

396
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,434
You spent ten days together?

397
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,437
How would you feel if you couldn't see
that robot for ten days?

398
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:07,939
I would...

399
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,529
I think I would miss it a bit,

400
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,073
but ten days is too long.

401
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:21,077
I believe you have formed a friendship
with that robot.

402
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,455
I think that's the cause of the miracle.

403
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,887
Who is it?

404
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,015
Who dares to mistreat you?

405
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,852
Bring them all. I'll beat them all up.

406
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,441
Despite all that,

407
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,946
you grew up well, master.

408
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:03,953
"A relationship is

409
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,958
planting roots in someone's heart."

410
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,930
HOKTAL

411
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,223
PAI

412
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,392
The parts arrived but there's a problem.

413
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,605
Uncle, it's that van, right?

414
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,607
It is.

415
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,943
But I don't think that's the guy.

416
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,823
Why does he look familiar?

417
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,370
DOCTOR HONG BAEK-GYUN

418
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,371
That's him.

419
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,373
Doctor Hong Baek-gyun, right?

420
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,667
Right. He looks just like this photo.

421
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,296
He's driving off. Get ready.

422
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,340
Wait.

423
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,812
I've got you all.

424
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:16,525
Why won't he answer if his phone is on?

425
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,694
Doctor.

426
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,040
-...even kiss her.
-That son of a Baby.

427
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,293
Mr. Baton is actually a filthy beast.

428
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,295
He was strange from the start.

429
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,423
Her cover was almost blown many times,
and what did he do each time?

430
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,092
He let it go. He passed.

431
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:45,096
That prick was blinded by the boner.

432
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,139
That's why he never noticed.

433
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,058
I can't send Aji 3 to him.

434
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,017
Definitely.

435
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,436
That's Cho Ji-a.

436
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,188
That's why it's even worse.

437
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,233
What? Wait.

438
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,237
Isn't it perverse
to act like that to a woman?

439
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,991
If he were to find out she's human
and not a robot,

440
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,327
Mr. Baton and Ji-a
could have a happy ending.

441
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,414
Mr. Baton did that thinking she's a robot.

442
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,750
If we fix Aji 3, he'll treat her the same.
Are you okay with that?

443
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,002
Of course not.

444
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,212
I can't let him do that to my Aji.

445
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,672
That's true.

446
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,341
But we have to give him Aji 3 by tomorrow,
or he'll kick us out.

447
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,469
We know what his temper is like.

448
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,639
Why should we get kicked out? We'll leave.

449
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,769
Unwillingly as it was,
the robot helped you practice

450
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,938
how to mingle with people.

451
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,400
Spend more time
and do more things with the robot.

452
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,486
Maybe then, you'll experience
the miracle of being healed.

453
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:51,495
PRETTY ROOM

454
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,003
Aji 3.

455
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,466
My treasure.

456
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,011
So that means...

457
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:11,265
you can't do anything without me, right?

458
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,562
Cherish your treasure with all your heart.

459
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,572
I shouldn't have said she's my treasure.

460
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,075
How am I to put up with that from now on?

461
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,589
CEO Hwang,
let's have a drink this evening.

462
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,011
Is it good or bad? What occasion is it?

463
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,764
I met Min-gyu yesterday.

464
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,725
And?

465
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,145
How could he refuse a woman like me?

466
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,191
What's that smirk? Are you pleased?

467
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,610
-No.
-Is he seeing someone?

468
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:09,156
I don't know.
We don't discuss personal issues.

469
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,658
Does he not like you?

470
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,911
No, I don't think he dislikes me,

471
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,663
but he doesn't want to marry me.

472
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,873
I'm getting more and more annoyed.

473
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,669
It's not that I lack anything, right?

474
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,878
Then...

475
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,047
marry me.

476
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,967
Only I can put up with you.

477
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,177
I'm not sure.

478
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,138
I wonder if I can kiss you.

479
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,057
Let's give it a go.

480
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,392
Now?

481
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,103
KIM MIN-GYU

482
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,862
Don't you think it's rude to call
in the morning after you rejected me?

483
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,906
-Let's do it.
-What?

484
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,868
Three dates, a kiss,

485
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,161
and then marriage.

486
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,496
Let's do it.

487
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,542
Kim Min-gyu, what are you doing?

488
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,378
Asking you on a date.

489
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,504
A date?

490
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,425
You played hard to get yesterday?

491
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,262
Okay. See you this weekend.

492
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,139
You should better be ready.

493
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,016
I hate anything that's tacky.

494
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,642
Bye.

495
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,980
Sorry, let's drink another time. See you.

496
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:40,581
HWANG YU-CHEOL

497
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,630
I found out where
the Santa Maria team is based.

498
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:48,797
Where are they?

499
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,425
At Director Kim Min-gyu's house.

500
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,230
YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS REPORT

501
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,320
APPLICATION FORM

502
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,239
It looks like a decent project.

503
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,157
Why did they cancel it?

504
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,372
So you slept at a sauna last night?

505
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,377
Hello? Excuse me. Anyone home?

506
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:27,711
What?

507
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,505
Yes.

508
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,300
How much work
did that jerk make you do for you

509
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,885
to look like you dropped a dress size?

510
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,346
Fungus is right.

511
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,140
He is a psycho and a pervert.

512
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,601
No, you couldn't be more wrong.

513
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,397
He's the type
that gets misunderstood easily,

514
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,482
but he's way more naive than he looks.

515
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:52,236
He makes mistakes around people
because he's clueless.

516
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,738
Why are you defending him so passionately?

517
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,740
You called him names two days ago.

518
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,534
I saw another side of him yesterday.

519
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,453
He's not a pervert nor a psycho.

520
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,165
He just has lived alone
for such a long time that...

521
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,710
That man's just awkward at everything.

522
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,753
You're calling him that man again.

523
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,130
Seon-hye.

524
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:16,844
What do you think will happen
if he finds out I'm not a robot?

525
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,095
The test is over.

526
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:21,348
You won't have to see him again,
so why worry?

527
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:25,936
Why?

528
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,981
Are you upset that you can't go back?

529
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,025
Why is that? Who is it about?

530
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,943
Fungus? Or--

531
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,737
My suitcase.

532
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,115
My Heart Ball is in that suitcase.

533
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:41,285
-I have to get it.
-Fungus said he would bring it.

534
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,622
That's right.

535
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,542
The petition.
I have to make sure he read it.

536
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,044
I need to go back.

537
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,254
You left it where he's bound to see it.

538
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,089
He'll read it.

539
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,634
I still need to check.

540
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,470
The final round of that competition
depends on it.

541
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,347
I won't be long.

542
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,644
Hello?

543
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,396
What?

544
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,982
You're hosting the final round?

545
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,068
The new head
of the Social Contribution Team

546
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,861
sorted out the projects.

547
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:19,114
You'll get a call
about the details of a briefing.

548
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,828
Thanks. I'll wait for the call.

549
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,164
Well?

550
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,541
What? The final round's back on?

551
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,294
Yes, the new head
of the Social Contribution Team said yes.

552
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,298
Good for you.

553
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,467
I need to fix my lamp.

554
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,885
Should I get a new outfit?

555
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,471
You really don't have to go back anymore.

556
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,516
-What?
-The part-time job is over.

557
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,935
Don't forget to pay for my insurance.

558
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,987
Look at the time. Why isn't she here yet?

559
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:02,950
Did they...

560
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,577
forget to charge her?

561
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,163
No way.

562
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,002
Why isn't Aji 3 at work yet?

563
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:16,046
Because the testing phase is over.

564
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,676
Don't you want the extra funding?

565
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,636
I'll leave to find another investor.

566
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,721
You'll leave?

567
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,183
-Says who?
-Says me.

568
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,437
Don't you know
that Aji 3 belongs to KM Financial?

569
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,149
I'll find a new investor
and give back what you paid me so far.

570
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,483
Call it quits.

571
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,651
I can't do that.

572
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,153
Never ever.

573
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,364
Then I must tell the truth.

574
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,533
What truth?

575
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:48,454
That KM Financial's director
is a pervert who treats a robot sexually.

576
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,248
What?

577
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,750
A pervert? Did I treat it sexually?

578
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,503
-Me?
-Yes, you.

579
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,256
You kissed Aji 3.

580
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,091
On her forehead.

581
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,634
That was because...

582
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,428
There was a situation in which that--

583
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,139
I don't want to know
what that situation was.

584
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:10,517
The Santa Maria team will leave
as soon as we find an investor.

585
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,602
That's final.

586
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,363
It is covered by a viscoelastic material,

587
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,823
that, at the same time...

588
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,161
-The robot?
-We're fixing a minor problem.

589
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,747
Then it'll be difficult.

590
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:36,627
Words have spread that you were banned
in the US as a fraud.

591
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,838
I predicted as much,
but the director didn't want to invest.

592
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,256
Leave it.

593
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,342
I won't work for a company that

594
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,093
doesn't recognize a gem.

595
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,804
It won't be easy to find an investor.

596
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,223
I have to go.

597
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,356
-Next on the list is--
-Let's take a break.

598
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,953
I came for my suitcase.

599
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,955
I'll tell Ssanip to bring it to you.

600
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,207
You can't ever go into the house.

601
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,210
Okay. I'll wait outside.

602
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,675
Why can't I ever go into the house?

603
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,845
I dressed up as the robot just in case.

604
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,060
Oh, my.

605
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,062
What are you doing here?

606
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,773
You should be inside working by now.

607
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,075
That's Ji-a on the cart.

608
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,618
Oh, no.

609
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,041
Hey, something bad happened.

610
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,591
You want to take what's mine?

611
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,968
What do you take me for?

612
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,689
You.

613
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,942
You escaped because you missed me.

614
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:26,862
Well done.

615
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,739
Very well done.

616
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,784
Yes. You should come
whenever your master calls.

617
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,622
All the hard work I put into training you

618
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,540
is finally paying off.

619
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,626
But first...

620
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,128
you need a scolding.

621
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,380
Did I...

622
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,258
do something wrong?

623
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,346
You're a robot. That's your problem.

624
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,933
You will scold me
just because I am a robot?

625
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,311
Yes. You don't have a heart.

626
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,355
That's the reason I'm scolding you.

627
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,524
Starting today,
you must learn about me every day.

628
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,069
You will have an incredible amount
to input.

629
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:10,739
I will take root in that hardware
that is your heart.

630
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,491
If not...

631
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,244
I will feel...

632
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,705
very wronged.

633
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,460
That might take up a lot of power.

634
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,003
How much do you have left?

635
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:28,924
How much time can you spend with me?

636
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,387
Up to eight hours in Power Saving Mode.

637
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,346
Really?

638
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,306
Aji 3, Power Saving Mode.

639
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,933
Activating Power Saving Mode.

640
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:43,230
When in Power Saving Mode,
please don't make me do any work.

641
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,232
If you don't work,

642
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:46,900
should I do it?

643
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,653
Shall I cancel Power Saving Mode?

644
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,074
Okay, don't stay standing. Sit down.

645
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,623
Aji 3, Friend Mode.

646
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,088
What do you want?

647
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:11,049
Why are you so elegant? Be yourself.

648
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,384
"What do you want?" Like that.

649
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,678
Don't pick on me.

650
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,806
Someone asked me

651
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,350
what kind of relationship we have.

652
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:25,188
Guess what I said.

653
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,023
What did you say?

654
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:33,447
I called you an ungrateful brat
who left her master for another guy.

655
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,407
It wasn't easy...

656
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,578
for me to accept that...

657
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:44,833
you were the first friend I made
in 15 years.

658
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,044
Remember that.

659
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,802
You really need to thank me.

660
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,929
Just to protect you,

661
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,807
I'm about to spend a huge amount of money.

662
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,897
Doctor Hong Baek-gyun
is trying to keep us apart.

663
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,859
But I won't, under any circumstances...

664
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,570
lose you.

665
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,492
First, we will go after the team.

666
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,286
Will you beg for their help?

667
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,749
Me? Beg?

668
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,959
Over my dead body.

669
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,837
Don't worry. I'll protect you...

670
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,839
in my own way.

671
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,142
What is this?

672
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,894
A bonus.

673
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,188
For the others.

674
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,982
You don't need to thank me.

675
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,735
We don't take such things.

676
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,320
Shut your mouth.

677
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,489
What do you mean?

678
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:58,824
They're checks.

679
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,328
Checks?

680
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:07,207
This says you'll get the remaining
50 billion by the end of the month.

681
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,876
-We'll have a look.
-Sure.

682
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,378
We don't need it.

683
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:15,924
Take it back.

684
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,425
Not bad.

685
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,511
You can negotiate.

686
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,936
-Double?
-My gosh.

687
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,647
We don't need it.

688
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:32,983
Okay.

689
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,861
Give them everything you brought.

690
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,122
However much it may be, we don't need it.

691
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,792
You don't need 50 billion won?

692
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:55,505
Are you refusing the funds
to support your research?

693
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,341
You should be relieved
that Doctor Hong's not here.

694
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,594
Before he returns this evening,

695
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,388
you should better return
the robot you stole.

696
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,600
-Who said I stole--
-Why did you come here?

697
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,685
-To talk
-A discussion.

698
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:09,811
-A chat.
-Yes.

699
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:13,023
-Please talk. We'd like to...
-Follow me.

700
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,108
Wait. Gosh, it hurts. Wait.

701
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:17,360
-Gosh, wait.
-Shouldn't we accept?

702
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,196
-Listen to me. Aji 3 is mine.
-Come on.

703
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,574
-She's mine!
-Let's just think about it.

704
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:28,955
Also, Mr. Kim came up

705
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,417
with great benefits for all of you.

706
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,377
BENEFITS FOR SANTA MARIA TEAM

707
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,796
First of all,

708
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,009
you'll no longer have to stay
within 20 meters of this annex

709
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,802
from now on.

710
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:48,099
Secondly, you'll be able to order food
whenever you want.

711
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,226
And last but not least,

712
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,187
you'll be able to use...

713
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,897
USE FACILITIES,
INCLUDING THE POOL.

714
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,357
...the facilities of this house.

715
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,441
-Nice!
-Yes!

716
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,276
-We decline.
-My gosh.

717
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,906
I can't believe them.

718
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,202
Wait a minute.

719
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:10,288
What? It's 4:00 p.m. already.

720
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,624
What should I do?

721
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,211
They'll be coming for you soon.
How should I convince them?

722
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,380
-Wait.
-Do you need my help?

723
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,465
Do you have a way?

724
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:23,843
They say, "A full stomach
is the most important thing."

725
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,805
Okay, I get what you mean.

726
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,515
Should I reserve a hotel buffet?

727
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,101
Or should I order
the best catering service?

728
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,562
No. Let's choose the menu first.

729
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,523
Korean, Japanese, Western, or Chinese?

730
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,734
-That's not where you should begin.
-Oh, is it not?

731
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,988
Okay then.
Since I'm going to spend money anyway,

732
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,615
I might as well call a world-famous chef.

733
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,995
That won't work?

734
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,125
A cruise.

735
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:58,545
They already refused your money.
Splurging it won't work.

736
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,840
"Splurging"?

737
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,800
-You should do it.
-Splurge?

738
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,010
You should cook.

739
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,637
You're saying...

740
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:13,184
I should cook for those jerks?

741
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,895
-Do you not want to?
-Yes, I'm never going to cook.

742
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,480
What a load of nonsense.

743
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,111
Do you want to lose
your precious treasure?

744
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,368
No, I don't.

745
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:40,211
My gosh, you have really pretty dishes.

746
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:45,550
My mom used to like inviting people over
and serving them food.

747
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,388
She used these.

748
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:54,434
I can't believe I'll be using them
15 years later.

749
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:03,485
My gosh, you should be honored.

750
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,499
I measured the portions wrong.

751
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,751
I've never made
more than one portion before.

752
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,711
Aji 3, search the web for me.

753
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,005
How much sauce do I need to put
into braised spicy seafood

754
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,632
when it's for four people?

755
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:32,347
The basic sauce is for three people,
and you can add more if you would like.

756
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,182
Okay.

757
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,893
-Go sit down.
-I'll help you.

758
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,269
You'll waste your battery.

759
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,147
It will be more helpful
if you sit down and wait.

760
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,824
Did you cut yourself?

761
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:54,327
Why are you cooking so aggressively?

762
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,870
This dish...

763
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,665
is the only thing...

764
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,668
I can do to protect you.

765
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,304
Is it because of Cho Ji-a?

766
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,014
Do you want to keep her close?

767
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:58,975
If he finds out,
you'll be named a fraud yet again.

768
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:01,227
Those two make a nice couple.

769
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,439
They do. They look nice.

770
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,565
How should I help you?

771
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,984
Will you just let Min-gyu
take her from you?

772
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:11,029
She's not a robot. She's human.

773
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,697
Do I look weird?

774
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,990
You look really pretty.

775
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:17,118
Mr. Kim. Have you ever dreamed
of kissing her?

776
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,912
No. Never.

777
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,795
