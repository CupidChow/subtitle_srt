1
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,940
-See here.
-Okay.

2
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,611
-Here.
-Right.

3
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,077
Ji-a, there is no end in peeling these.

4
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,705
I already peeled them. What are you doing?

5
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,999
-Cut them in half and chop.
-What?

6
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,333
-Are you out of eggs?
-In half?

7
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,043
Look in the other fridge.

8
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,797
-I'll do it. Move.
-I'll do it.

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,466
-You should clean this up.
-Hand that to me.

10
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,384
Just leave me alone! It's confusing.

11
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,219
Just leave it.

12
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,347
-I can do it.
-It's burning.

13
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,099
-Please.
-Move over.

14
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,226
-Just let me do this myself.
-Just move over.

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,686
I can do this.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,771
Hi.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,614
They all have something to tell you.

18
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,575
You don't mind, do you?

19
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,495
We will move out tomorrow.

20
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,914
We won't be seeing each other again

21
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,459
so I suggested we eat together
one last time.

22
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,049
All of us cook together today.

23
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,010
Make sure to clean properly
before you leave.

24
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,598
Since we will never see each other again.

25
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,975
Right. Okay.

26
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,896
We will make the place squeaky clean.

27
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,951
We will move out tomorrow.

28
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,828
We won't be seeing each other again

29
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,498
so I suggested we eat together
one last time.

30
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,667
It's so easy for him, isn't it?

31
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,046
How can he say that so easily?

32
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,766
Wow. Now, I can eat too.

33
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,768
Yes.

34
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,439
-Try this. I made it at home.
-Okay.

35
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,739
How is it?

36
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:38,992
It's good.

37
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,370
-Gosh, it must be really good.
-Really?

38
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,673
Ji-a, when did you start cooking?

39
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,092
A few days ago.

40
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,719
I ate too much.

41
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,137
Is it bad?

42
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,222
Well...

43
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,184
-Are you sure it's good?
-Yes.

44
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,812
But...

45
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,357
I'll do the cooking from now on.

46
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,193
-Why? What's wrong?
-Yes, you should.

47
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,700
-It's good. You should try some.
-I don't eat meat.

48
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,826
Since when?

49
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,912
-Clever girl.
-Since when?

50
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:24,871
Since when?

51
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,080
Just don't cook.

52
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,332
It's better if you cook.

53
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,585
Brother, are you feeling better?

54
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,253
I'm getting better.

55
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,714
Sitting here together like this

56
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,925
reminds me of the first day
he invited us over.

57
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,594
-I miss that. I miss it.
-I miss that.

58
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,804
When? I don't remember.

59
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,599
Min-gyu invited you over to eat with him?

60
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,977
The thing is...

61
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,605
When we told him we would take Aji 3 away,

62
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,357
he was so scared.

63
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,110
He prepared a feast
and invited us to persuade us.

64
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,906
Guess what Min-gyu called us then.

65
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,074
Researcher one.

66
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,325
-Two.
-Three.

67
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,411
Three strikes, and maybe we were out?

68
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,789
It's a tremendous improvement, Min-gyu.

69
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,792
It's all thanks to me, isn't it?

70
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,712
-His food was really good.
-It was delicious, indeed.

71
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,507
What was the point? You ignored me.

72
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,845
Beetle is a gift for you.

73
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,141
Why?

74
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,852
Well...

75
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,522
we don't know
when we'll see each other again.

76
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,191
Maybe we can never.

77
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,860
We thought about it.

78
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,031
You gave us so much
but we never gave you anything.

79
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,700
But,

80
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,661
you're rich and have everything you need.

81
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:51,582
We thought Beetle would be
the best present we could give you.

82
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,127
He can make friends with the Pretties.

83
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,257
We upgraded it last night.

84
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,511
The batteries will last longer,
and it has more expressions now.

85
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,596
It won't be as good as Aji 3,

86
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,266
but it will keep you company
when you're bored.

87
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,810
Brother.

88
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,188
I'm really sorry.

89
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,570
When we're gone...

90
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,826
I hope you forget all the bad memories,
and remember only the good ones.

91
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,164
Or just forget everything if you want.

92
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,429
No.

93
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,766
What do you mean?

94
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,352
Don't you like Beetle?

95
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,354
What am I supposed to do if that breaks?

96
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,732
Do you expect me to fix it myself?
I don't know how to.

97
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,068
Or should I dump it at a junk shop?

98
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,988
"A junk shop"?

99
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,283
Dr. Hong.

100
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,244
I think we're done eating.

101
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,413
We should go now.

102
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,000
Just stay.

103
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,420
What?

104
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,299
Just stay here.

105
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,349
Why are you trying to go outside?
It's freezing out there.

106
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,893
Just stay here at my house.

107
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,400
You're right.
They say it's the coldest in decades.

108
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,155
Ji-a, can you give me some more rice then?

109
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,575
Min-gyu, should we have some beer then?

110
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,788
I still have that huge chicken leg
we had together.

111
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,165
-You still have that?
-You do?

112
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,959
Do you own a chicken farm?

113
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,087
-Then we should eat that.
-Do you sell chicken?

114
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,713
Colonel Sanders here.

115
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,985
STRANGER

116
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:51,262

00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,932
Currently operating Master Mode.

118
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,685
Friend Mode.

119
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,897
-Did you call me?
-Hey, it works.

120
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,192
Aji 3, we are friends now.

121
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,569
No, we are family.

122
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,529
Aji 3, remember this.

123
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,658
You will be living with humans
as their friend and family.

124
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,785
Is that what I am?

125
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,914
Yes. I hope we get along well.

126
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,501
FAMILY

127
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,922
SET AS PRIORITY

128
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,628
I'm sorry, Aji 3.

129
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,674
I'm sorry, Aji 3.

130
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,061
Go back to sleep.

131
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,231
What is it?

132
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,656
I like it...

133
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,368
when you look at me.

134
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,164
But...

135
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,126
you look sad right now.

136
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,088
You're wrong.

137
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,757
I'm happy right now.

138
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,260
Min-gyu.

139
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:25,434
Input how I look and feel right now.

140
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,897
It hurts when you do this.

141
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,323
You're right.

142
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:41,992
I'm sad.

143
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,038
I found you.

144
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,668
But the Santa Maria Team...

145
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,421
lost Aji 3.

146
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,425
That's why I'm sad.

147
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,405
I don't know about anyone else,

148
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,407
but I know very well...

149
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:29,748
that today,
you tried everything you could...

150
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,251
to protect Aji 3.

151
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,553
Will you please remember one thing?

152
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,600
Wherever you may be...

153
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,021
I'll always be by your side.

154
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,787
You did your best.

155
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,279
I'm sorry.

156
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,323
You can cry.

157
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,493
I'm sure you are more upset than I am.

158
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,745
That's not true.

159
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,123
I know you're hurting more than I am.

160
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,034
We still have time until the closing,

161
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,871
so I should look for a way
until the end, right?

162
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,583
Now that's the Min-gyu I know.

163
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,172
Let's see.

I...

169
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,442
I think I found a way to get Aji 3 back.

170
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,204
What is it?
Is it fascinating to see me drive?

171
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,999
Yes, it's fascinating.

172
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,879
Why didn't he use his blinkers?

173
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,805
Did your heart flutter?

174
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,021
Hey, don't distract me while I'm driving.

175
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,751
-Go on.
-I'll be right back.

00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:20,980
Hello.

177
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,920
Hello, Mr. Kim.

178
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,512
Madame X told me to meet you here.

179
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,559
Martin is a criminal
on Interpol's blacklist.

180
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,479
Murder, fraud, and instigating arson.

181
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,940
He committed many crimes,

182
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,318
but he wasn't held accountable
due to lack of evidence.

183
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,322
If Jang Du-sam's recording
has something on Martin,

184
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,991
we can contact Interpol

185
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,286
and have them put him
in the witness protection program.

186
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,837
We'll take just one look, okay?

187
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,756
Thanks, Uncle.

188
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,259
I won't leave until I see her. I'll wait.

189
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,761
Right here.

190
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,471
I will see her.

191
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,765
Okay, how many times
do I have to tell you?

192
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,559
I said you can see her.

193
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,144
Why do you keep repeating yourself?

194
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,355
I'll wait.

195
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:53,822
I think Jang Du-sam disappeared
the day I met Dr. Hong.

196
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,282
I texted him...

197
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,243
but I'm not sure if he'll come.

198
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,411
It's 2:00 p.m., right?

199
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,705
We don't have much time.

200
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:18,013
Anyway, when did my sister...

201
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,391
become your driver?

202
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,231
Well...

203
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,858
I'm sorry.

204
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,372
Jang Du-sam.

205
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,750
Have a seat.

206
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,631
How will you protect me?

207
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,052
You'll be protected
by Interpol's witness protection program.

208
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:02,099
Here's the information
on where you can stay

209
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,851
and what to do.

210
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:11,191
Mr. Jang, I know how you managed
to survive.

211
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,277
You can't trust anyone.

212
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,364
You need to suspect everyone you see,
and wonder if they'll try to kill you.

213
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,491
You don't want to live like that...

214
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,035
but you have no choice.

215
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,665
I know very well what that is like.

216
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,003
Jang Du-sam, take my hand.

217
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,004
I will...

218
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,048
be that path.

219
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,058
ADVANCED FIRST-CLASS POLICE

220
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,146
This is Jang Du-sam's recording
I told you about.

221
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,856
Can you do it before 2:00 p.m.?

222
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,941
Please, you must.

223
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,867
How did it go?

224
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,162
You got it?

225
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,673
Now, the problem is getting there
before the closing. Well...

226
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,347
Yes, I'll call you as soon as I find Aji 3
after I get there.

227
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,306
Okay.

228
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,018
Don't worry, I'll get you there.

229
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,980
Gosh, this is...

230
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,238
SALE OF DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING'S R&D TEAM

231
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,532
We shall now close the deal
regarding the sale

232
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,284
of Daeyang Shipbuilding's R&D Team.

233
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,914
Sure.

234
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,646
Kim Min-gyu.

235
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,275
It's already over.
What do you think you're doing?

236
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,572
We're here, sir.

237
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,617
You're right.

238
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,953
It's already over...

239
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,038
for you, Chairman Hwang.

240
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,460
Hwang Do-won.

241
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,173
You are under arrest for the murder
of Daeyang's chairman, Park Seong-jin.

242
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,093
-What's going on?
-Murder?

243
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,887
You must come with us to give a statement.

244
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,533
Let's go.

245
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,544
Things will get worse.

246
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,838
No.

247
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,674
This is the end.

248
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,523
-What?
-Martin's man came for her,

249
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,316
but Aji 3 is gone.

250
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,777
Where did Aji 3 go?

251
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,205
Hello.

252
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,502
Aji 3 disappeared?

253
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,691
Let's go home.

254
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,362
GPS TRACKER REMOVED

255
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,198
NO NETWORK CONNECTION

256
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,744
Look at her.

257
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,374
She must be so cold.

258
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,753
What is she wearing? It's so thin.

259
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,343
I was crossing the street yesterday,

260
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,805
and everyone around me
suddenly seemed like trees.

261
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:21,144
I felt like I was walking in the woods.

262
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,649
Some trees looked interesting.

263
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,736
And I even had the urge
to touch some of them.

264
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:53,134
Hey, Aji 3 went outside on her own.

265
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,886
What's going on?

266
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,976
What? Aji 3 walked out on her own?

267
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,353
She couldn't have gone far.

268
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,064
Ji-a and Min-gyu are searching the area.

269
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,072
It's too cramped. Go away.

270
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,452
This bench is made for three people.
It is not cramped.

271
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,163
It's too cramped for me.

272
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,961
Aren't you scared of me?

273
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:13,798
Regardless of how you look,
you all are people to me.

274
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,052
"You all are people"?

275
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,095
Here.

276
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,681
Hold my hand.

277
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,478
You have a beautiful hand.

278
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,438
Hey.

279
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,529
Aren't you cold?

280
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,949
Where are you going dressed like that?

281
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,451
I am going home.

282
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,286
Where is your home?

283
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,747
Where my friends and family are.

284
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,332
Where is that?

285
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,501
It's a place I can recharge myself.

286
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,216
Then don't wander around, and go home.

287
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,426
Or you will end up like me.

288
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,641
What does it mean to end up like you?

289
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,811
I have no one to see.

290
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,982
I have no one waiting for me.

291
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,112
No one is interested in me.

292
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,115
I am interested in you.

293
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:23,076
What kind of person are you?

294
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,929
Here. Take this to pay for the bus.

295
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,056
You know how to take the bus, right?

296
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,893
Get going. Your family must be worried.

297
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,237
Hurry up and go.

298
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,573
You're getting me down.

299
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,831
Chairman Hwang,
are you going to keep this up?

300
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,673
DVR, REC010.M

301
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,801
Chairman Park's accident.
Was it you, Chairman Hwang?

302
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:25,472
Remember this. You know nothing.

303
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:29,184
That's the only way
you and your family will live.

304
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,228
Will you still remain silent?

305
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,192
Let's talk when my lawyer gets here.

306
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,146
Is it true what the detectives said?

307
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,150
Did my father really murder...

308
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,861
Chairman Park?

309
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,113
That's not true.

310
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,449
Then who was it?

311
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,786
Mr. Yoon.

312
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,705
It was Martin.

313
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,791
However, there is no evidence.

314
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,002
Your father remained silent
regarding the crime Martin committed...

315
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,296
in return for the kickback.

316
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,424
That's what Martin meant when he said...

317
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,134
that we're in it together.

318
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,594
My father...

319
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,722
looked the other way?

320
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,517
The best result would be

321
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,979
to have Martin leave the country
and get the chairman acquitted.

322
00:30:56,062 --> 00:31:00,066
In order for that to happen,
we must win Director Ye to our side.

323
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,653
That is the only way
to get rid of Director Kim Min-gyu.

324
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,285
Both Martin and Chairman Hwang
must be after her.

325
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,453
We must find her before them
no matter what.

326
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,708
This just suddenly came to me...

327
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,169
but I feel like Aji 3 would go home.

328
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,423
If I were her,
I would think of home first.

329
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,161
HOME OF KM FINANCIAL'S
DIRECTOR KIM MIN-GYU

330
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,122
DIRECTIONS: BUS 310

331
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,845
Excuse me. Have you seen
a woman in a pink dress?

332
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,687
KM FINANCIAL

333
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,692
BUS 310

334
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,927
I found out where Aji 3 is headed.

335
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,137
It's Director Kim Min-gyu's mansion.

336
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,766
Don't lose her. Get her no matter what.

337
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,895
Break her if you need to.

338
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,013
You did your best.

339
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,811
Let's sit over there.

340
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,814
Sit right here. I'll be just behind you.

341
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,336
Thank you.

342
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,427
You're pretty.

343
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:24,270
Bus number 7700 will be arriving soon.

344
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,232
She just got on a bus.

345
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,696
Dr. Hong.

346
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,032
Aji 3 just got on a bus.

347
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,910
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING
SANTA MARIA

348
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,143
Are we leaving without seeing her then?

349
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,188
-We waited long enough.
-Okay.

350
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,983
Hey, you need to focus. Watch the road!

351
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,947
There...

352
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,366
It's Aji 3!

353
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,244
Hey, it's your lucky day.

354
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,919
Aji 3.

355
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,717
Aji 3, where are you going?

356
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,804
I am going home.

357
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,890
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

358
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,892
Get in. Get in.

359
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,229
Get in.

360
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:00,867
Okay.

361
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,583
What is this?

362
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,135
Get them.

363
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,221
-Open up.
-Open it.

364
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,723
-Uncle.
-Open the door.

365
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,850
-They're not going to hurt us, right?
-Hey!

366
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,226
-Yes.
-Get out!

367
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,020
-They are!
-Hold tight!

368
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,356
Aji 3, we'll protect you.

369
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,615
Don't open the door! Stay inside!

370
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,458
-Hands up!
-Hands in the air!

371
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,709
POLICE

372
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,628
Take them!

373
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,591
Now hands down.

374
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,153
Aji 3, are you okay?

375
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,572
Let's go home.

376
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,663
Search the place thoroughly.

377
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,873
-Yes, sir.
-Search the stairs, too.

378
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,210
Search the stairs
and seal the exits in the lobby.

379
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,879
-Keep searching.
-Yes, sir.

380
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,217
Uncle.

381
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,928
Will Aji 3...

382
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,223
remember me?

383
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,560
She is a robot,
so she'll probably remember you forever.

384
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,232
I'm happy.

385
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,287
We should get new shoes for you, Aji 3.

386
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,290
I met a lot of people.

387
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,876
I want to read the emotions
of many more people.

388
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,713
The world she saw for the first time
must have been fun.

389
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,924
Aji 3, back up today's file.

390
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,926
Backup is complete.

391
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,471
Aji 3, are you happy to be back home?

392
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,015
I need to be charged.

393
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,642
Yes. Let's get some rest.

394
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,978
We should recharge too.

395
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,148
I've completely burned myself out.

396
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,691
Dr. Hong.

397
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,610
We should still run a test
to make sure she's okay.

398
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,404
Aji 3.

399
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,074
What do you call an alligator detective?

400
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,492
-An investi-gator.
-An investi-gator.

401
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,122
Everything's perfect. Absolutely perfect.
I'm so proud.

402
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,063
What are you thinking about?

403
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,899
It's a secret.

404
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,903
Hey, are you serious?

405
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,115
I'm just happy.

406
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:29,742
About what?

407
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,952
I'm just happy

408
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,623
with everything that's going on right now.

409
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,629
I achieved my goal for today.

410
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:46,926
Also, you're beside me right now.

411
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,514
Also...

412
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,936
I can lie down and look at you like this.

413
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,854
Hey, you're heavy.

414
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,856
Hey, deal with it.

415
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,193
By the way,

416
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,320
you're a really good driver.

417
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,280
See? I told you.

418
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,616
I told you that you should be honored.

419
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,828
Tell me if you need anything else.

420
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,247
Do whatever you want to do.

421
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,332
Make what you want to make.

422
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,210
But make sure you show it to me first.

423
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,968
It's still too dangerous
to go outside by yourself, so I'll--

424
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,595
Stop right there.

425
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,021
-I need to go now.
-What?

426
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,023
You can play with him.

427
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,777
-Where are you going?
-I need to go home.

428
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,362
What about here?

429
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,531
This is your place.

430
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,408
Can't it be your place as well?

431
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,951
What are you talking about?

432
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,832
I'm hungry. Cook for me.

433
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,417
Cook your own food.

434
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,752
Come on. I have no energy.

435
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,006
Come on. Cook for me.

436
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,300
Make me something.

437
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,385
Go and make something yourself.

438
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,512
Come on. I want food.

439
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,890
-Okay. Get up.
-Okay.

440
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,151
Back when I was young,
I went on a field trip.

441
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,779
But there was no one to make gimbap
for me, so I had to make my own.

442
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,284
My aunt went on a picnic
when she was my age.

443
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,412
She didn't know how to make gimbap,

444
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,832
so she made herself rice balls like this.

445
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,709
That was the first time she made them.

446
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,338
Why would a child make gimbap?

447
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,342
She didn't have anyone to make it for her.

448
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,302
I bet...

449
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,431
a lot of kids made fun of her
at the picnic.

450
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,683
No one ate with her,

451
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,977
but my mom did.

452
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,397
That's why
she became my mom's guardian angel.

453
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,486
Here. Try it.

454
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,366
Why are you laughing?

455
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,243
It's a secret.

456
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:20,204
What the heck? I won't give you this then.

457
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,497
I just found out...

458
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,292
who my guardian angel was.

459
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,586
Who was it?

460
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,389
You told Yu-cheol everything?

461
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:25,477
I guess he was bound
to find out sooner or later.

462
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,773
You didn't tell him about that thing,
did you?

463
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,484
No, I didn't tell him.

464
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,570
Martin already got away.

465
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,740
I just need to get acquitted.

466
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,701
Make sure to get Director Ye.

467
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,578
Go back.

468
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,372
I won't become in-laws with a criminal.

469
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,379
This is a gift from Chairman Hwang.

470
00:43:59,094 --> 00:43:59,928
TRANSFER OF SHARES

471
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:04,475
The shares in his borrowed name accounts
were transferred to Ri-el.

472
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:09,647
Chairman Hwang wants you
to become the new director.

473
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:14,068
If you accept,
he will support you wholeheartedly.

474
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:19,114
He wants me to become director
and cover up all his wrongdoings?

475
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,618
That would make it easier for you
to do your duties

476
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,536
once you become the director.

477
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,498
You just have to oust Director Kim.

478
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,708
Ousting him isn't enough.

479
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,127
He will climb back up.

480
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,174
We must make him lose the will to do so.

481
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:41,178
Will you use his illness?

482
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,981
Hold on.

483
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,035
I know what you're thinking.

484
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:11,041
But sometimes, a man's misfortune
can be another's opportunity.

485
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:15,504
What you need at a time like that
is the courage to look the other way.

486
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,593
How...

487
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,974
How is that courage?

488
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,477
It's courage. Not everyone can do it.

489
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,772
How does that make any sense, Dad?

490
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,483
What kind of an excuse is that?

491
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,653
Do you think I, your daughter...

492
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,699
would be happy living like that?

493
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,534
Everything passes.

494
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,912
When it does, you'll see it wasn't much.

495
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,798
Your father remained silent
regarding the crime Martin committed

496
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,425
in return for the kickback.

497
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:02,926
Okay.

498
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:09,308
At least he didn't kill anyone.

499
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,232
Hi.

500
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,235
Does Min-gyu have an illness?

501
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,404
I think your dad and mine...

502
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:26,033
will use that to do something terrible.

503
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:27,826
What?

504
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,329
I called assuming you didn't know.

505
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,707
You don't know about it, do you?

506
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,752
No. Look.

507
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,713
I'll call you right back.

508
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:06,114
CHAIRMAN HWANG DO-WON

509
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,978
FORFEITURE AGREEMENT

510
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,049
How would you like your hair?

511
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,596
Can you straighten these, too?

512
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,680
Of course.

513
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,473
When asking questions
during a tarot card reading,

514
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,351
it's best to be specific, not general.

515
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,937
For example, rather than asking
"Can I fall in love?",

516
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:04,191
ask,
"Can I fall in love with this person?"

517
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:07,277
The answer to that question would be...

518
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,200
A gift for you.

519
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,590
Would you mind if I join in?

520
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:31,426
I'm right here. Respect my existence.

521
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:35,055
Do you want me
to buy you a pair of Heart Balls?

522
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,182
I shouldn't have fallen asleep then.

523
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,017
I didn't know this would happen.

524
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,397
I feel lonely.

525
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:47,567
I feel lonely now. So lonely.

526
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:53,448
I told you she would be pretty.

527
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,368
Who is she? Do you know her?

528
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:01,581
Your hair, your style. Wow.

529
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,958
You know her too?

530
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:04,751
Hello.

531
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,505
People die if they make a drastic change.

532
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,298
VEGETABLE JUICE

533
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,008
Drink these and wake up.

534
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:15,137
The style changed
but not the character. Good.

535
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,098
I'm in a bad mood.
Shall I dye my hair ash blue?

536
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,559
Do it. It's not bad.

537
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,853
Hoktal, what do you say?
Would you like to join?

538
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,775
I'm not the hair-dying type.

539
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,653
Up until yesterday,
you would do anything I asked.

540
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,363
Why the sudden change?

541
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,949
Did Seon-hye tell you not to do it?

542
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,994
She shrugged. I hate you.

543
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,580
-Hoktal.
-Yes?

544
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,833
Go back to the time
when you were nice to me.

545
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,794
I'm so lonely on days like this.

546
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,296
Why? Is today a special day?

547
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,591
No, it's just...

548
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,093
Fine, don't do anything.

549
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,220
I'll just get angry if you do something.

550
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,516
Don't do anything.

551
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,310
-Hello.
-Hi.

552
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,771
-You bought juice.
-Yes.

553
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,278
-Gosh, it's good.
-Yes.

554
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,572
The inside lab needs some fixing.

555
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,407
Oh, okay.

556
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,662
What? Does your scalp itch?

557
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,914
No.

558
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:27,542
You are made for each other.

559
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,755
Ssanip, I need you to go to Yongsan.

560
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,006
What? Where?

561
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:36,259
Buy these, and come straight to the annex.

562
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:40,263
Oh, parts, Yongsan? Okay, Dr. Hong.

563
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:42,098
See you.

564
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,186
-Take your time.
-I love you.

565
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,938
-Me too.
-Bye.

566
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,946
Pai, by the way...

567
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,865
you look a bit...

568
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:00,659
strange today.

569
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:01,910
How so?

570
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:04,496
You seem very different than usual.

571
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:05,997
The difference is...

572
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,960
Oh, your eyes are bigger.

573
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,128
I'm not wearing glasses.

574
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,547
I see.

575
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,552
Your forehead is wider too.

576
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,054
I parted my bangs.

577
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,223
I see.

578
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,229
You parted your bangs.

579
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:33,275
Wait, your hair. Wasn't your hair curly?

580
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,527
I got sick of it, so I straightened it.

581
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,782
Does my hair look weird?

582
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,117
No.

583
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,119
It doesn't.

584
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,623
Let's go.

585
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,504
It doesn't look weird.

586
00:52:56,882 --> 00:53:00,719
Even without Ji-a next to me,
I keep practicing going out on my own.

587
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:04,431
Right. I guess she can't be around you
all the time.

588
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,807
She is no longer a robot.

589
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,475
Exactly.

590
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,687
It was nice when she was a robot.

591
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:12,856
Aren't you afraid?

592
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:16,735
I keep telling myself
that she's next to me,

593
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,946
and that seems to help a bit.

594
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,657
Your index seems to be okay right now.

595
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:26,828
As long as you avoid a situation
where you suddenly face a crowd,

596
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,831
don't you think
you can handle everyday life?

597
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,500
I don't think that will ever happen.

598
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,337
Take care. Goodbye.

599
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,257
EMERGENCY BOARD MEETING TOMORROW

600
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,675
DISMISSAL OF DIRECTOR KIM MIN-GYU

601
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:50,185
I'm back.

602
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,272
Dr. Hong.

603
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,149
Hoktal.

604
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,403
Brother?

605
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,991
I'm not scared. I'm not scared at all.

606
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,534
Dr. Hong.

607
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,831
Where did everyone go without me?

608
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:16,252
They are so mean. How could they?

609
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,673
It's my birthday. If I were in the US,
I'd be partying like crazy.

610
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,967
No one cares.

611
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,887
-Hello.
-What the heck? What's going on?

612
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:33,269
Happy birthday to you

613
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,314
Happy birthday to you

614
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,651
Happy birthday, dear Ssanip

615
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,570
Happy birthday to you

616
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,790
You guys are so childish.

617
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,834
A surprise party?

618
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,795
We don't do this anymore
on the east coast.

619
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,298
You need a lot more to choke me up...

620
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:04,509
but I'm crying.

621
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,262
Thank you.

622
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,597
Did you think we didn't know?

623
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,850
-Blow the candles.
-Blow the candles.

624
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,476
-Blow the candles.
-Blow the candles.

625
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,978
I'll love again.

626
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:31,870
Brother, this is incredible.
Did you make it?

627
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,790
I knew it. It's just a humble meal.

628
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,542
This cake is amazing.

629
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,420
I chose it.

630
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,297
With my help.

631
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,511
I feel like flipping the table.

632
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,554
Here's yours.

633
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,437
Your present.

634
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,149
What could be inside?

635
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,860
What is it?

636
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:07,655
Yuzu bread?

637
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,493
Brother, what does this mean?

638
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:14,329
We heard you cry whenever you see this.

639
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,789
I wanted to see you eat it and cry.

640
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,332
Why you...

641
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,045
-You're crying already.
-What are you saying?

642
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,421
I see tears.

643
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,340
He's crying.

644
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:33,431
Shall I make Ssanip cry once more
with this gift?

645
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,935
Is that a new one? How many terabytes?

646
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:39,354
The present is the video in this.

647
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:43,650
It's a gift from Aji 3
who just finished her first outing.

648
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,295
She must be so cold.

649
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,882
What is she wearing? It's so thin.

650
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,094
Then don't wander around, and go home.

651
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,805
Or you will end up like me.

652
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,392
What does it mean to end up like you?

653
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,980
I have no one to see.

654
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,067
I have no one waiting for me.

655
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:30,280
No one is interested in me.

656
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,411
You know how to take the bus, right?

657
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,996
Get going.

658
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:44,085
TIRED

659
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,382
You did your best.

660
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,563
Thank you.

661
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:08,485
HAPPY + GRATEFUL

662
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,903
You're pretty.

663
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:12,864
Aji 3.

664
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,202
Aji 3, where are you going?

665
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,578
DELIGHTED TO SEE ME

666
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,707
Aji 3, are you okay?

667
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:24,709
Let's go home.

668
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:28,796
FAMILY

669
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:47,106
We wanted Aji 3 to connect with people.

670
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,400
As you saw,

671
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,655
she grew up much better than we had hoped.

672
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,782
Not just us.

673
00:58:56,533 --> 00:59:00,620
Min-gyu and Ji-a, you both did well too.

674
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,249
Why do we make robots?

675
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,793
I think Aji 3's memories...

676
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,420
will answer that.

677
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,422
It's heartbreaking,

678
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,592
but as promised, I think it's time...

679
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,761
to change Aji 3's face.

680
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:21,349
We will leave the patterns
of the emotions she procured,

681
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:25,436
and delete every video
including the private ones

682
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,606
she took of Min-gyu and Ji-a.

683
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:36,447
Then we will begin our new android robot.

684
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,033
I'm sure that Aji 3...

685
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,161
would want that too.

686
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:46,541
She would want us
to make her memories more beautiful.

687
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:51,045
So, let's all...

688
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,008
say our goodbyes tonight.

689
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,806
You helped us get through.

690
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,686
The patterns you left
will continue in the next robot.

691
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:10,565
That's how we will remember you forever.

692
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,777
Bye, Aji 3.

693
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:20,450
I'm really sorry for sending you
to Martin.

694
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,703
I really wanted to say that.

695
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,708
I will tell the next robot about you.

696
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,252
You...

697
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,172
will not disappear.

698
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:38,301
I know you liked me more than anyone else.

699
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,306
Aji 3.

700
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,977
-Goodbye, Aji 3.
-Goodbye, Aji 3.

701
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,279
Aji 3's last video

702
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,908
captured Martin confessing
to killing Chairman Park Seong-jin.

703
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:06,537
I think he let his guard down
because she was a robot.

704
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,458
Interpol will love this.

705
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,503
They will protect Jang Du-sam
for sure now.

706
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,547
That's good.

707
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,093
We have reporters on standby.

708
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,803
We can attack right ahead.

709
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,554
When the board meeting ends,

710
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:28,142
someone is bound to tell them
what just happened.

711
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,521
We can't get blood on our hands.

712
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:43,658
EMERGENCY BOARD MEETING

713
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:46,619
We shall begin
the emergency board meeting.

714
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,580
On the agenda is the dismissal
of Director Kim Min-gyu.

715
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:53,626
The cause is, as you were all informed.
An illness.

716
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:16,482
He is here.

717
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:29,162
KM FINANCIAL DIRECTOR KIM MIN-GYU
PRESS CONFERENCE

718
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,592
I am KM Financial's director,

719
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,011
Kim Min-gyu.

720
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,306
Also...

721
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,607
I suffer from...

722
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:02,195
human allergy.

723
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,567
His allergy isn't completely cured yet?

724
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,736
Can he go outside without you?

725
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,239
It's not over yet. You can...

726
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:49,325
Why is he always so harsh on me?

727
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:52,954
We used to be friends.
How could he treat me this way?

728
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,332
Are you sure you don't need me there?

729
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,834
No, it's okay.

730
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:01,629
Wherever I may be,
I know that you'll always be by my side.

731
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:05,174
I feel like it'll be okay this time.

732
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,431
