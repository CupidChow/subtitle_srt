00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,064
TILDA'S BETRAYAL
CAUSED DEADLY ALLERGIC REACTION

2
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,295
I'll tell you what you need to do today.

3
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,717
Let's...

4
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,762
reset Aji 3.

5
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,112
SAD

6
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,492
SAD

7
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,369
Everyone seems sad.

8
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,542
We have to lie to a friend.

9
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,419
Lies are bad.

10
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,923
I'm lying for that friend.

11
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,467
That friend will misunderstand you.

12
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,053
And that will make you sad.

13
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,555
No.

14
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,766
I'll be happy...

15
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,270
as long as he is fine.

16
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,401
So it is a happy lie.

17
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,780
There are times when

18
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,700
it is better to lie
for the sake of a friend.

19
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,042
Let me work the last shift myself.

20
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,964
Please.

21
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,525
Ji-a.

22
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,485
I'm really sorry.

23
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,200
Now you're suddenly calling me Ji-a?
On our last day? Cheap move.

24
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,729
Aji 3.

25
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,981
Friend Mode.

26
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,485
It's good to see you, my friend.

27
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,199
I've been...

28
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,079
very rude to you, haven't I?

29
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,875
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,086
It's okay.

31
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,505
I can be quite magnanimous.

32
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,262
Should we...

33
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,351
go out for a walk?

34
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,020
It's going to...

35
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,522
snow today.

36
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,776
That will be better.

37
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,280
We have three hours from now.

38
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,117
We might walk and run today.

39
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,746
We need to come back in three hours,
so your battery will not die.

40
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,679
Let's go.

41
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,144
Pass! Pass me the ball!

42
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,064
-Pass!
-Pass me the ball!

43
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,983
-Come on!
-Pass!

44
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,859
A HAPPY SCHOOL THAT BUILDS DREAMS

45
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,279
This was my primary school.

46
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,906
I came here again for the first time

47
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,908
in 15 years.

48
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,831
Gosh, that stings.

49
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,582
My gosh, no.

50
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,209
What's wrong?

51
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,878
-Look at him.
-That's gross.

52
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,381
-What's going on?
-He has rashes.

53
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,591
My gosh! His face is getting red too.

54
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,885
Gosh! What's happening to him?

55
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,806
You didn't believe me,

56
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,641
but...

57
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,437
I really used to be allergic
to human contact.

58
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,815
But...

59
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,901
after I met you,

60
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,029
I got cured.

61
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,490
It's incredible, isn't it?

62
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,596
I was crossing the street yesterday,

63
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,349
and everyone around me
suddenly seemed like trees.

64
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,354
I felt like I was walking in the woods.

65
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,989
I was no longer scared of the trees.

66
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,993
Some trees looked interesting.

67
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,414
And I even had the urge
to touch some of them.

68
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:27,303
That's when I knew
that I'm never going back

69
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,305
to how I used to be.

70
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,814
How pretty.

71
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,192
I'm proud of you.

72
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,532
You're prettier.

73
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:52,995
What?

74
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,373
It's snowing.

75
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,126
It's our first snow together.

76
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,086
You're right.

77
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,758
Gosh, it's cold. Wait a minute.

78
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,010
I can't let your battery die.

79
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,188
Are you worried
that I would be too heavy to carry?

80
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,358
That's right. You're crazy heavy.

81
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,402
-Whatever.
-Let's go.

82
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,707
It's nice.

83
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,960
THE VELVETEEN RABBIT

84
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,672
The Velveteen Rabbit?

85
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,094
A little boy had a rabbit doll,
which he cherished.

86
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,724
This story is about that doll
who wanted to become a real rabbit.

87
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,102
So?

88
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,688
Did it become a real rabbit?

89
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,731
Yes.

90
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,193
But the little boy ends up saying goodbye
to the rabbit.

91
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,070
And when he met the rabbit again,

92
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,156
he didn't recognize him.

93
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,287
What...

94
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,915
a sad story.

95
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,335
If...

96
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,296
you ever become human,

97
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,883
if that kind of miracle ever happens,

98
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,931
I will recognize you right away.

99
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,561
You were upset

100
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,064
because I've scolded you so much, right?

101
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,527
I'm going to compliment you big today.

102
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,445
So listen to me carefully.

103
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,033
What I showed you today...

104
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,579
is...

105
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,333
my daily life that you gave back to me...

106
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,294
after 15 years.

107
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,424
For the past month,

108
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,969
you were my friend,

109
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,472
my treasure,

110
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,851
and my cure.

111
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,353
You were also...

112
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,734
my door out to the real world.

113
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,489
Every minute with you...

114
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,078
was a miracle for me.

115
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,121
Thank you.

116
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,333
And...

117
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,129
I'm sorry.

118
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,721
I'm not the one who cured you.

119
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,600
Deep down in your heart,

120
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,020
you had a longing for someone special.

121
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,147
That's what cured you.

122
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,609
You...

123
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,321
would've become better
even if it weren't for me.

124
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,451
So from now on, I hope...

125
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,787
that you'll be happy...

126
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,415
and have fun, whatever you do.

127
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,590
I'm going to compliment you big as well,
so listen.

128
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,637
You...

129
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,351
made me realize that I'm someone valuable.

130
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,523
You were my friend.

131
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,443
You treated me like a treasure.

132
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,031
And you made me feel special.

133
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,746
Everything you did for me,

134
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,708
and what it meant...

135
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,462
I will never forget it.

136
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,427
Thank you.

137
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,640
And I'm sorry.

138
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,472
Aji 3.

139
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,850
Operation Mode.

140
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,731
How may I help you, master?

141
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,109
As of this moment,

142
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,321
I'm going to...

143
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,365
reset you.

144
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,036
Once you reset me,

145
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,290
all the memories we made together
will be deleted,

146
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,251
and they cannot be restored.

147
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,796
Will you still proceed?

148
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,220
Proceed.

149
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,100
Please press the button
on the back of my neck for five seconds.

150
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,979
Then the reset process will begin.

151
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,235
There's one last thing...

152
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,115
I would like to input into your system.

153
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,619
That will also...

154
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,497
be deleted soon.

155
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,916
I love you.

156
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,302
Every single moment...

157
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,764
I spent with you made me happy.

158
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,231
In five seconds,

159
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,028
all of our memories will be deleted.

160
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,454
Five.

161
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,501
Four.

162
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,089
Three.

163
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,176
Two.

164
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,389
One.

165
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,369
RESET COMPLETE
FOLDER KIM MIN-GYU DELETED

166
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,706
The Kim Min-gyu folder has been deleted.

167
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,482
Hi, Aji 3...

168
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,170
It's a cat. It's my master. Cat. Master.

169
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,008
My master's laughing.

170
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,219
PRETTY'S ROOM

171
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,902
That's right.

172
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,572
Whatever you do,

173
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,492
be happy...

174
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,412
and have fun.

175
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,346
She's very dehydrated,
so we gave her an IV.

176
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,182
Thank you.

177
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,521
Gosh.

178
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,316
Ji-a.

179
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,052
I hate it when Mr. Baton comes
to the office.

180
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,136
Me too.

181
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,556
He's the trifecta, a prick, rude,
and a douche bag.

182
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,516
All he has is good looks.

183
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,186
He looks like me,
so it's even more offensive.

184
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,521
What?

185
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,238
Director Kim.

186
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,825
How do I look like you? I don't see it.

187
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,996
I'm still drunk from last night, so...

188
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,624
Eighth floor.

189
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:51,708
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

190
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,174
I'll be coming into the office
every day now.

191
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:01,927
Bye.

192
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,979
You don't...

193
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,274
You can go with your business.

194
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,150
I'll do my own thing.

195
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:21,989
Gosh.

196
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,495
Hi.

197
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,165
Good morning.

198
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,751
How does it feel to go to work
like normal people?

199
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,379
Mr. Baton irritates me so bad.
It's impossible to work here.

200
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,256
Why is he around so often?

201
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,216
What's wrong with him?

202
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,721
I caught the employees talking about me
behind my back.

203
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,931
That's how office workers release
their stress.

204
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,934
That's why I let them off the hook.

205
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,227
That is good.

206
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,478
Just in case,

207
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,982
make sure to keep the smartwatch
and a needle on you.

208
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,943
Where are you now, anyway?

209
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,285
DAILY VEGETABLE JUICE

210
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,668
You should stay healthy
before you stay busy.

211
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,838
Director Kim. What brings you here?
You didn't call...

212
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,256
No particular reason.

213
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,926
By the way, why are you eating alone?

214
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,680
No one wants to eat with me
because I'm on your side.

215
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,640
They don't want to die.

216
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,852
Is that why you're in a bad mood?

217
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,146
No, sir.

218
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:43,445
After you finish lunch,
bring me the list of M&As in progress.

219
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,698
Those in consideration
and those that are complete.

220
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,951
Also, bring all the financial statements
from the prior years.

221
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,746
The person you have reached
is not available.

222
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,584
We worked very hard for him.

223
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,503
The least he can do is pay us the rest.

224
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,214
The person you have reached
is not available.

225
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,341
He won't answer? That's okay.

226
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,885
We have plenty of time to kill.
I'll keep calling.

227
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,262
Who will pay us then?

228
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,388
Who do you think?

229
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,309
The highest up at KM Financial.

230
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,526
Santa Maria can't be the only one
they got kickbacks for.

231
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,946
Flag anything that seems suspicious
and investigate them.

232
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,364
Yes, sir.

233
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:31,118
I heard that the testing of Aji 3 ended.

234
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,129
Has Jang Du-sam contacted you yet?

235
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,047
Not yet.

236
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,425
FROM MADAME X

237
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,888
CHAIRMAN HWANG'S SHARES SOON TO BE SOLD

238
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,557
Soon,

239
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,644
Chairman Hwang will probably call
an emergency board meeting.

240
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,980
To dismiss me.

241
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:05,402
We need Jang Du-sam's recording
to dismiss Chairman Hwang first.

242
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,864
Is there another solution
if he doesn't contact us?

243
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,825
There is.

244
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,411
But it won't be without damage.

245
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,506
-Mr. Cho.
-Yes?

246
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,217
Do you have any information on AM Retail?

247
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,760
One moment, please.

248
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,847
Among three places,

249
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,266
this seems to be overvalued.

250
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,767
Take a look.

251
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,325
Aren't you going home?

252
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,912
It's 1:30 a.m.

253
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,648
My mom told me that...

254
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,609
the water should come up
to the back of the hand.

255
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,154
I know,
but we're making porridge right now.

256
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,281
We need twice as much water.

257
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,491
-Is that so?
-Yes.

258
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,410
Ssanip, calculate the moisture
in vegetables

259
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,620
to measure the amount of water.

260
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,414
Squash is 95% water.

261
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,209
For onions and carrots, it's 90%.
Thus, we need--

262
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,710
Wait a minute.

263
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,630
What are you doing here?

264
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,509
Late-night meal.

265
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,594
We're making you some meal.

266
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,388
Do you like abalone?

267
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,276
It tastes bad.

268
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,612
Give it to me.

269
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,240
You can't take it back.

270
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,533
You said it tastes bad.

271
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,452
I'll eat it...

272
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,747
considering your efforts.

273
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,507
We're leaving this house soon too.

274
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,303
-What?
-For Min-gyu.

275
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,179
It's better that all of us disappear.

276
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,267
He'll be left alone again.

277
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,439
You made him depend
on the Santa Maria Team.

278
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,525
You made him believe you,
so take responsibility.

279
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,153
Stay by his side.

280
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,071
Support him.

281
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,657
Help him hang in there.

282
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,077
So he won't be lonely anymore.

283
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,414
I beg of you.

284
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,048
If you're done, let's play.

285
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,799
Yes, let's play.

286
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,968
We waited to play with you.

287
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,220
What shall we play? Basketball? Soccer?

288
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,472
What?

289
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,350
But it's 2 a.m.

290
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,145
Red light, green light, one, two, three.

291
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,818
-Red light, green light, one, two, three.
-It's two in the morning.

292
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,450
Red light, green light, one, two, three.

293
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,702
Red light, green light, one, two, three.

294
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,418
-Good job. That's right.
-But...

295
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,632
Fine.

296
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,550
Red light, green light, one, two, three.

297
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,223
Red light, green light, one, two, three.

298
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,246
Don't move. I'm watching.

299
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,374
-Hurry up and play.
-She's grabbing me.

300
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,670
Red light, green light, one, two, three.

301
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,629
Shoot.

302
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,215
You're next.

303
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,800
-Pai, you...
-That's it.

304
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,352
Tell the house that I'm going to bed.

305
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,022
Turning to Sleep Mode.

306
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,624
MGG FIGURES TO BE RELEASED

307
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,693
Hello?

308
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,154
What took you so long to pick up?

309
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,449
I was going to hang up in one second.

310
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,746
I need you to buy something for me.
The terms are the same as last time.

311
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,751
Hello?

312
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:56,795
President Cho.

313
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,129
Are you still there?

314
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,009
Why won't you answer?

315
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,053
Say something.

316
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,601
Do you think

317
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,896
I'm someone you can call to pass time?

318
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,192
Can you do that for me
if I become a regular?

319
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,236
I'm really bored these days.

320
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,282
If you're bored, call a friend.

321
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,745
My best friend...

322
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,248
went far away.

323
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,168
That's why I'm very bored.

324
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,672
Wait.

325
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,384
Why do you sound like that? Are you sick?

326
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,596
Too bad.

327
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,640
I'm going far away too.

328
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,724
What?

329
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,810
Where to?

330
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,521
Far, far away.

331
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,608
You can't. Who is going to buy things
for me, then?

332
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,901
Who am I going to call?

333
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,367
I don't buy things for people anymore.

334
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,202
So...

335
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,833
don't call me again.

336
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,713
Hello? President Cho.

337
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,548
President Cho!

338
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,667
Why can't she keep buying things for me?

339
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,877
This is no fun.

340
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,361
Mr. Kim.

341
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:30,323
I'm going to sleep here tonight.
You can sleep in my room.

342
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,576
Why don't you sleep on your fancy bed?

343
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,827
I just...

344
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,708
can't fall asleep on that bed.

345
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,252
Oh, dear.

346
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,720
Your late father did this

347
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:56,182
when he couldn't sleep.

348
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,606
Pull your chin back
and look straight into the camera.

349
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,901
I'll take it now. One, two, three.

350
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,239
PASSPORT APPLICATION

351
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,407
PASSPORTS

352
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,909
I want to apply for a passport.

353
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,829
-Australia?
-Australia?

354
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,415
Yes. It's called "a working holiday."

355
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,458
You can work and learn English
at the same time.

356
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,920
How could you make a decision like that
without talking to us?

357
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,797
A year goes by really fast.

358
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,050
I'll save some start-up money,
get some ideas,

359
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,844
and come back speaking English fluently.

360
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,972
I'll teach you English now, Dong-hyeon.

361
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,224
I don't need to speak English well.

362
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,434
Don't go.

363
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,687
You sweet thing.

364
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,606
-I'm off to work.
-Take a break.

365
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,483
You just left the hospital.

366
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,278
I need to save up
for the plane ticket. Bye.

367
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,842
You startled me.

368
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,385
Why are you here?

369
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,555
Why do you think?
I'm here to fix your jalopy scooter.

370
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,768
You do know that this is really random,
don't you?

371
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,521
Last night, your scooter randomly appeared
in my dream.

372
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:29,025
It said it's at its life's end,
so it asked for my golden hand.

373
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,526
So here I am.

374
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,072
I can drop it off at a garage. Go home.

375
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,032
You must be rich.

376
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,617
Pay me for the repairs, then.

377
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,369
It will take 30 minutes. Wait just a bit.

378
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,374
Are you getting any sleep?

379
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,044
What do you care?

380
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,837
You're my creditor.

381
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,714
I owe you,

382
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,466
and if the creditor dies
an untimely death,

383
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,801
the debtor will be at a loss.

384
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,805
-You didn't get that, did you?
-Why you little...

385
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,266
It will run fine for about a month.

386
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,267
That's it?

387
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,646
Just get a new one.
What if it dies on a highway?

388
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:11,275
What? Did I accentuate
the wrong word again?

389
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,361
Don't come here anymore.

390
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,447
You said take responsibility.

391
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,201
I'm taking responsibility for what I did.

392
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,537
See you.

393
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,646
As you feared,
there will be an emergency board meeting.

394
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:49,981
The main item on the agenda

395
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,859
is your dismissal, sir.

396
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,124
It's a nice day. Try to smile.

397
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,001
There's no point in saving your smiles.

398
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,213
Disappear.

399
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,933
Pretty hats and gloves. Come take a look.

400
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,562
They're nice and warm.
Check out some gloves.

401
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,272
Hello.

402
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,527
-They're cute.
-They are.

403
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,487
-Can I try one on?
-Sure. This one?

404
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,364
Yes, it's so pretty.

405
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:46,996
-It suits you.
-Does it?

406
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,331
You look so pretty.

407
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,542
-How much is it?
-It's 15,000 won.

408
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,169
-Would you like one?
-Yes.

409
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,254
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

410
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,761
You're prettier.

411
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,651
-Can I have a look?
-Yes, of course.

412
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,654
These are pretty. How much...

413
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,031
Why do you look so sad?

414
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,407
Is it because they aren't selling?

415
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,368
I'll take all of them.

416
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,037
Give me this and this and this.

417
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,248
Give me all of them. All of them, okay?

418
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,707
-Go on.
-All of them?

419
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,875
Of course.

420
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,752
Here you go.

421
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,635
This as well. All of them.

422
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,808
Aji 3.

423
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,644
I'll turn you into a handsome guy.

424
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,354
Thank you, Doctor.

425
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,857
Turn me into a super-duper impressive guy.

426
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:03,322
That's something Kim Min-gyu used
to say a lot.

427
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,827
Pai, did you delete the backup files
of Min-gyu's account as well?

428
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,036
Yes, I did.

429
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,956
Did she hear one of us say that?

430
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,715
Package delivery?

431
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,384
Do you know how tough that job is?

432
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,927
I like it.

433
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,138
It's the best way
to keep my mind occupied.

434
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,115
Hello.

435
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,784
Here you go. Bye.

436
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,287
Tomorrow,

437
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,748
Min-gyu will be dismissed.

438
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,126
The shares belonging to my allies

439
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,421
and those in our borrowed-name accounts
make up the majority. Period.

440
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,090
Santa Maria and Aji 3

441
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,760
are practically ours already.

442
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,847
By tomorrow,
you will be KM Financial's director.

443
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,057
Dad.

444
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,101
You said you would leave this to me.

445
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,520
I did. And what happened?

446
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,814
Did you give Martin the robot?

447
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,400
No, I'm looking for the right person
to do the job--

448
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,651
Stop it.

449
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,987
We just have to get rid of Min-gyu

450
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,990
and give Aji 3 to Martin.

451
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,450
Why waste time?

452
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,911
I'm setting the table for you.

453
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,205
You just have to eat.

454
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,581
Why are you complaining?

455
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,043
I will make Ri-el yours, too.

456
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,212
No! Will you just stop it?

457
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,469
Have you found Jang Du-sam?

458
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,597
Sorry, sir. Not yet.

459
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,350
That sneaky bastard.

460
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,186
Why is he back in Korea?

461
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,230
If he blabs

462
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:03,150
about Chairman Park Seong-jin's death,
then we're all dead.

463
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,693
Find him.

464
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,570
You must find him

465
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,406
and shut him up.

466
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,534
You can't let him meet Min-gyu!

467
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,129
Hello?

468
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,005
Jang Du-sam?

469
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,340
Are you alone?

470
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,968
As you can see, I'm here alone.

471
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,727
-I need to rethink this.
-Hello?

472
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,273
Don't look for me until I contact you.

473
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,275
-Jang Du-sam.
-Don't look for me.

474
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,401
Jang Du-sam.

475
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,324
Damn it.

476
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,202
Mr. Cho?

477
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,623
I think

478
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:03,210
there's more
to Chairman Park Seong-jin's death.

479
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,046
We should go with Plan B now, right?

480
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,260
COMPOSE EMAIL

481
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,597
TO: MADAME X
REINVESTIGATE CHAIRMAN PARK'S HIT-AND-RUN

482
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,556
SEND

483
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,231
Where are you?
You didn't forget our date today, did you?

484
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,444
You have some packages.

485
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,571
-Hello.
-Hello.

486
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,284
-Just a minute. Let me check them.
-Sure.

487
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,516
This one or the other one?

488
00:41:58,974 --> 00:41:59,892
Both.

489
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,393
They're both pretty.

490
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,729
What? That sounds so insincere.

491
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,065
What do you mean?

492
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,112
Could you sign it quickly?

493
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,405
Okay.

494
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,158
-Here.
-Thanks.

495
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,669
Yu-cheol would've said...

496
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,505
I would say the third one.

497
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,465
You have a pretty neck.

498
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,393
You're really...

499
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,105
super-duper looking better now, Min-gyu.

500
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,403
It's all good.

501
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,950
It's for the best.

502
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,247
Director Kim is here.

503
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,678
KM FINANCIAL BOARD MEETING

504
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,973
We'll begin the board meeting.

505
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,851
As you were all notified,

506
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,645
the main item on the agenda
is Director Kim's dismissal.

507
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,814
The reason is to stabilize the company.

508
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,734
Do you think that is an adequate reason?

509
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:35,487
Because of Director Kim's bad temper
and bizarre actions,

510
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,864
our company

511
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,825
has lost trust both inside and outside.

512
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,201
You all know that.

513
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,747
To create a corporate culture
that suits the 21st century,

514
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:49,418
we can't let the largest shareholder
treat the company

515
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,880
as his personal property,
and most of those on the board concur.

516
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,430
How much did Director Kim earn
for our company?

517
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:05,059
Director Ye, you value money too much.

518
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:09,647
Perhaps it's time to consider
our company's image as well.

519
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,400
Director Kim shall speak.

520
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,444
Who is the candidate...

521
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,571
to replace me?

522
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,907
It's CEO Hwang Yu-cheol.

523
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,166
I think

524
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,543
by the end of this meeting,

525
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,338
CEO Hwang Yu-cheol

526
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,840
will be the one
who is going to be dismissed.

527
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:46,558
Daeyang Shipbuilding had an R&D team
called Santa Maria.

528
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,145
What they made...

529
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,107
was not a ship.

530
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:57,820
They made...

531
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,032
a robot.

532
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,079
Now...

533
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:17,965
I introduce to you Dr. Hong Baek-gyun
and the Santa Maria team...

534
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,176
who created
the world's greatest android robot.

535
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:39,153
Hello, I'm Hong Baek-gyun,
leader of the Santa Maria team.

536
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,907
Let me introduce our android robot, Aji 3.

537
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:05,262
Three directors who had sided
with Chairman Hwang changed their minds.

538
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,432
Your dismissal was scraped,

539
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,518
and they will discuss
CEO Hwang's dismissal instead.

540
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,032
I was responsible for...

541
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,328
the sale of Daeyang Shipbuilding.

542
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,874
As of this moment,

543
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,253
I resign as CEO.

544
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,524
Are you happy now?

545
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,526
You took me down.

546
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,821
It was so easy.
You should've done it long ago.

547
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,616
How did you put up with me...

548
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,369
being CEO?

549
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,625
I tried...

550
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,755
my best not to abandon you.

551
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,340
No.

552
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,593
You already abandoned me, Yu-cheol.

553
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,513
That day.

554
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,099
Fifteen years ago.

555
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,935
Sign this.

556
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:39,940
My dad says if you sign this,
we can live together.

557
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,819
We were young then.

558
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,613
You knew what that document meant.

559
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,199
You pretended not to know until now.

560
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,368
Am I wrong?

561
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,622
Even now,

562
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,000
you'll turn a blind eye

563
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,960
to whatever your dad is doing.

564
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:04,006
So keep doing what you always did,

565
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,925
and stand aside
as if you don't know anything.

566
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,886
You're not the one I need to fight.

567
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,763
It's your dad.

568
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,849
Is that why you took me down?

569
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,727
Because I'm not even worth a fight?

570
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,813
Fine. But...

571
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,400
I'm my dad's son.

572
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,611
You should be careful.

573
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,405
Don't act so arrogant, you bastard.

574
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,205
Dad, what did you just say?

575
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:38,624
Who got dismissed?

576
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,543
Yu-cheol ended up causing a huge problem.

577
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,443
Let's go.
I reserved a table at a restaurant.

578
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,905
-Where's Director Kim?
-He's getting some air.

579
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,207
Where are you, Min-gyu?
Let's grab a drink.

580
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:21,958
Later.

581
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,550
-How have you been?
-Good.

582
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:50,255
The Velveteen Rabbit?

583
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:54,718
A little boy had a rabbit doll,
which he cherished.

584
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:59,055
This story is about that doll
who wanted to become a real rabbit.

585
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,056
So?

586
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,601
Did it become a real rabbit?

587
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:03,685
Yes.

588
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,105
But the little boy ends up saying goodbye
to the rabbit.

589
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,691
And when he met the rabbit again,

590
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,277
he didn't recognize him.

591
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,031
"The following spring,

592
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,494
the boy was healthy again.

593
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,037
He went to the woods to play.

594
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,123
And that's when...

595
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:29,419
he saw a rabbit looking at him.

596
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,883
The little boy mumbled,

597
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,427
'That's interesting.

598
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,680
He looks just like...

599
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,559
the rabbit I lost.'"

600
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,263
MUST BE OPENED BY DIRECTOR KIM HIMSELF,
PLEASE.

601
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,611
I'm sending you the Heart Ball
like I promised.

602
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,693
We're going to change Aji 3's face now.

603
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,769
It's only 80% complete.
There are still major errors.

604
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,938
You need to wait until it's perfected.

605
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,774
We need to change it as soon as possible.

606
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,609
For Min-gyu.

607
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:42,237
Aji 3.

608
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,489
Your face will change soon.

609
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,825
My character model is being changed?

610
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,828
The starting point of my mistake...

611
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,830
was your face.

612
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,082
Mistakes need to be corrected.

613
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,084
Yes, that's right.

614
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:57,627
Don't worry.

615
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,254
Regardless of what you look like,

616
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,714
you'll always be my Aji 3.

617
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,260
Regardless of how I may look,
I'll always be Aji 3.

618
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,013
Then please switch to Standby Mode.

619
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:28,700
No!

620
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:32,829
Stop it. Don't change anything.

621
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,581
Just leave her as she is.

622
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:35,790
Min-gyu.

623
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,709
I need to find her again.

624
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,169
Who?

625
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,336
The Aji 3

626
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,088
that I had trained.

627
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,509
I shouldn't have reset her.

628
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,929
I shouldn't have let her go like that.

629
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,308
I want her back. I want to have her back.

630
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,310
I need to see her again.

631
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,020
You need to let her go.

632
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,980
You won't be able to find her again.

633
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,317
No, I can.

634
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,443
I'll start all over.

635
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:07,655
I'll train her exactly how I did
from the start.

636
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,575
What's wrong with you, Min-gyu?
Come to your senses.

637
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,662
I miss her so much.

638
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,211
I want to see her again.

639
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,424
I miss her so much.

640
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:42,273
I love you, master. How may I help you?

641
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,276
Aji 3.

642
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,320
Friend Mode.

643
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,697
It's good to see you, my friend.

644
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:54,202
That's not what you used to say.

645
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:57,080
"What? What do you want?"

646
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,873
That's what you used to say.

647
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,418
Did you call for me?

648
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:05,713
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

649
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:10,385
Let's do our best so that we can go back
to how we used to be.

650
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,345
Okay, Aji 3?

651
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,348
It's a cat.

652
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,100
It's my master.

653
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,393
It's a cat.

654
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,811
It's my master.

655
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,229
It's a cat.

656
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:24,065
Yes, that's exactly it. Good job.

657
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,777
Let's see. The next thing we did was...

658
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,947
I normally use this as a perfume.

659
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,783
but you use it as a cleaner.

660
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:40,331
It's very foolish to use a French perfume
as a cleaner.

661
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,089
What do you think?

662
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,383
Is this my room?

663
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,432
Where is the charger?

664
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,692
From now on, you'll be my treasure.

665
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,445
But what if I decide to sell you?

666
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,489
What will you do, then?

667
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,325
It is essential to reset me
before you sell me.

668
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:32,300
I only have 10% battery remaining.

669
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,636
Would you like me to switch
to Standby Mode?

670
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,681
I want you to remember...

671
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,478
every moment we spent together.

672
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,190
What do I need to do
to make you come back?

673
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,278
What more do I need to do...

674
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,032
in order to...

675
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,911
meet the old you?

676
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:05,917
Are you the same master
that I used to serve back then?

677
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,338
No.

678
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,843
I'm a lot different...

679
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:20,056
from how I used to be.

680
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:24,143
Then you'll never be able
to meet the old me,

681
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,104
since the input will be different.

682
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,819
SEOUL STATION, ENTRANCE, EXIT
LET'S GO ON A TRIP WITH KTX

683
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,862
Did you arrive?

684
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,364
Yes, I'm in Daegu right now.

685
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,866
The agreement ceremony
is going well as planned.

686
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,286
Why aren't you driving here?

687
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:44,455
I thought it would be nice
to get some fresh air

688
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,916
and watch people on the way.

689
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,836
You don't need to pick me up
at the station.

690
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,254
I'll see you at the center.

691
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:55,383
A meteor shower occurs when particles
from comets or asteroids collide

692
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:58,011
with the Earth's atmosphere and burn.

693
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,471
It's a phenomenon
where shooting stars fall like rain,

694
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,348
which makes them seem like rain.

695
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,850
NIGHT SKY ROMANCE
"WATCH WITH YOUR LOVED ONES"

696
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,602
The meteor shower
that will soon be visible,

697
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,271
occurred due to debris left
by asteroid 3200 Phaethon

698
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:10,523
got sucked into the Earth's atmosphere...

699
