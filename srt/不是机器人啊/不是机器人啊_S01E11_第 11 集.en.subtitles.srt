1
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,063
What do you think of this design?

2
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,555
I think there's something
we should discuss.

3
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,434
Should I talk first?

4
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,273
I like the apple tea at this cafÃ©.

5
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,194
I prefer hydrangea to roses.

6
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,654
I prefer winter to summer.

7
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,119
I thought I knew myself well.

8
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,830
But I was wrong.

9
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,875
A person...

10
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,129
has to go through people and experiences

11
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,132
to learn about one's real self. I think.

12
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,386
I agree.

13
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,181
I'm not as materialistic as I thought.

14
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,476
I surprised myself.

15
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:46,439
Since it's a part of me,
I should accept it.

16
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,775
That's why...

17
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,571
I can't be with you, Min-gyu.

18
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,369
You're impressive.

19
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,621
Ri-el.

20
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,209
I'll talk to my dad
when the time is right.

21
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,837
He'll be supportive of you, as usual.

22
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,964
He acknowledges that you are good
at your job.

23
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,674
The problem is me.

24
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,429
It is my first time to go against my dad,
so it will not be easy,

25
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,348
but he won't throw me out.

26
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,935
Use me as an excuse.

27
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,395
No need.

28
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,982
It's going to happen
at some point in my life anyway.

29
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,194
But there's just one thing
I feel guilty about.

30
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:37,407
The birthday cards you were receiving
over the past 15 years,

31
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,452
they weren't from me.

32
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,456
Sorry. My dad went too far.

33
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,669
You knew?

34
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,797
Whether they were from you or not,

35
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,177
the moment I opened them...

36
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,681
I was really happy.

37
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,602
And for that happiness...

38
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,689
I thank you.

39
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,983
We're saying goodbye.

40
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,694
Don't be that cool.
I might get a second thought.

41
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,448
You've changed a bit.

42
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,366
How so?

43
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,703
Before, whenever I sat across from you,

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,915
I would wonder what we should talk about.

45
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,627
But now, I see you as a friend
that I can have a drink with.

46
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,925
If you want to have a drink,
call me anytime.

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,514
It's a pity I won't get
that necklace of yours.

48
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,476
It will find a good owner.

49
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,484
SEOUL STATION, ENTRANCE, EXIT
LET'S GO ON A TRIP WITH KTX

50
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,361
Did you arrive?

51
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,779
Yes, I'm in Daegu right now.

52
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,365
The agreement ceremony
is going well as planned.

53
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,742
Why aren't you driving here?

54
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,787
I thought it would be nice
to get some fresh air

55
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,456
and watch people on the way.

56
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,334
You don't need to pick me up
at the station.

57
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,669
I'll see you at the center.

58
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,923
A meteor shower occurs when particles
from comets or asteroids collide

59
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,509
with the Earth's atmosphere and burn.

60
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,011
It's a phenomenon
where shooting stars fall like rain,

61
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,680
which makes them seem like rain.

62
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,348
NIGHT SKY ROMANCE
"WATCH WITH YOUR LOVED ONES"

63
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,058
The meteor shower
that will soon be visible,

64
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,727
occurred due to debris left
by asteroid 3200 Phaethon

65
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,773
got sucked into the
Earth's atmosphere and burned.

66
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:37,360
Since it was identified in 1983,
this asteroid will move...

67
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,115
Hi, Hong-ju.

68
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,575
I'm about to board the train.

69
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,996
I'll call you when I reach Geoje Island.

70
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,706
Bye.

71
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,711
Hi, Seon-hye.

72
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,088
I'm about to board the train.

73
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,965
I'm not leaving the country.

74
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,800
Why is everyone calling me?

75
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,971
Hang up. I'll call when I get there.

76
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,556
Bye.

77
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,814
We're here for coffee.

78
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,651
Seon-hye.

79
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,155
How is Ji-a doing?

80
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,158
Is she eating?

81
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,245
How many coffees?

82
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,498
Seven. We're expecting a guest at the lab.

83
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,209
Seven. It's a lucky number,
so it's a deal.

84
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,711
It's a deal.

85
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,634
Is Min-gyu okay?

86
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,136
-Would he be?
-Would he be?

87
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,638
He withers away each day.

88
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,515
Noticeably.

89
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:54,437
They won't cross paths or something,
would they?

90
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,108
Ji-a will spend a while on Geoje Island
and then she'll go to Australia.

91
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,862
They'll come across each other
when pigs fly.

92
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,198
But still, what if they do meet?

93
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,451
Then...

94
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,412
it means they're destined
to make pigs fly.

95
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,751
DESTINATION DONGDAEGU

96
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,897
We will soon arrive in Dongdaegu.

97
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,358
The door will open on your right.
Thank you.

98
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,113
EXIT

99
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,164
Excuse me. You're in our seat.

100
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,093
AUSTRALIA

101
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,380
What a relief.

102
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,063
What?

103
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,320
Aji 3's face.

104
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,699
How did you come up with it?

105
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,333
I had a character model.

106
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,461
With the face, personality, habits,
and so on.

107
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,549
I hired someone appropriate
as a part-time worker.

108
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,468
I can't reach that person now.

109
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,262
Why?

110
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,849
Why would you suddenly ask me that?

111
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,646
I just got curious suddenly.

112
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,818
Then one day...

113
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,321
could I...

114
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,700
cross paths with that person?

115
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,829
That's not impossible.

116
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:27,710
But even if you do,
it would be best if you just ignore her.

117
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,839
You could end up looking like a creep.

118
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,386
Okay. I'll do that.

119
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,825
The number you called does not exist.

120
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,160
I really can't reach her.

121
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,265
How are you doing...

122
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,393
Doctor Hong?

123
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,229
Hello.

124
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:37,405
CELL PHONE QUICK CHARGER

125
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,913
Yes, hi, Mr. Cho.

126
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:51,293
Actually, something came up
and I can't make it.

127
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,046
What happened? Is it serious?

128
00:11:56,173 --> 00:12:00,344
Yes, it is.
I'm not exactly in my right mind.

129
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,596
Director Kim.

130
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,265
Director Kim.

131
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,975
Are you okay?

132
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,602
Yes. Please take care of the ceremony
for me.

133
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,675
Who is this woman?

134
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,470
She's Aji 3.

135
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,722
Are you saying...

136
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,433
-she is a robot?
-Yes.

137
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,686
Her hairstyle is different
because she changed wigs.

138
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,773
I saw her going to work from Mr. Cho's
with my two eyes--

139
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,695
With our four eyes.

140
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,450
And you mentioned that...

141
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,995
you saw Aji 3 eating ice cream.

142
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,291
Yes, it's an incredibly high-tech robot.

143
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,877
Isn't that enough information...

144
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,088
for us to get paid?

145
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,468
Is she Aji 3?

146
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,554
No, wait.

147
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,517
Or could she actually be human?

148
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,147
Her?

149
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,692
We used her as a model for Aji 3.

150
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,654
To make Aji 3 more human-like,

151
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,739
we hired an actual human model.

152
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,286
So are you saying
she was used as a model for Aji 3?

153
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,287
Is there...

154
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,331
a problem with that?

155
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,332
No.

156
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,334
But...

157
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,796
which one did Director Kim meet?

158
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,716
Was it Aji 3 or this woman?

159
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,888
I don't understand what you mean.

160
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,598
I'm pretty sure you do.

161
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,393
If you don't have anything else to say,

162
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,978
I'll excuse myself.

163
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,730
Soon...

164
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,358
I'll have something to say.

165
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,946
Give me a call anytime.

166
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,406
Sure.

167
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,849
What is this folder?

168
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,231
INCORRECT PASSWORD

169
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,650
Ssanip, did you create this folder?

170
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,569
-No, it wasn't me.
-You little...

171
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,157
Look at this.

172
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:12,703
I think that was made to back up files
that were to be deleted soon.

173
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,996
So it's Hoktal's work.

174
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,624
It's eating up a lot of space,
so tell him to get rid of it.

175
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,625
Okay.

176
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,253
By the way, when's the Design Team coming?

177
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,505
Mr. Cho said they would be here today.

178
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,883
They need to measure
all our devices in advance,

179
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,719
so that they can set them up
in our new laboratory.

180
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,138
Who is it?

181
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,182
We're the Design Team from KM Financial.

182
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,934
They're here. Just a moment.

183
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,561
They're here. They're finally here.

184
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,482
Hello.

185
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,859
Come in.

186
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,944
Hello.

187
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,626
You came here a lot earlier than expected.

188
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,503
We get things done pretty quickly.

189
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,421
Do you need any help?

190
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,340
It's okay. We're professionals.

191
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,341
Okay.

192
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,678
I don't think you're leveling it properly.
Let me help you.

193
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,680
-No, really, I'm fine.
-It's okay.

194
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,848
Don't mind me.
I like doing stuff like this.

195
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,893
Do you need help with anything else?

196
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,979
-No, it's okay.
-Okay.

197
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,983
-It's bent.
-Where?

198
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,651
-Oh, I see.
-This should be measured properly.

199
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,069
-I'll hold it.
-Okay.

200
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,446
-You're good.
-Thank you.

201
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,452
Who are you?

202
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,039
Aji 3.

203
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,250
Do you know me?

204
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,211
I would like to get to know you as well.

205
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,194
I won't allow you
to look at her like that.

206
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,155
And you must refrain from touching her.

207
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,700
She's really sensitive.

208
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,416
How should I block your eyes?

209
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,670
Hoktal, come here and check this.

210
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,547
Okay. Excuse me.

211
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,100
Let's see.

212
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,731
-It's done. The virus is installed.
-Okay. Let's hack the files.

213
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,107
Figure out the password.

214
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,239
We've succeeded.

215
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,064
HONG-JU'S BED AND BREAKFAST

216
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,234
SEAFOOD NOODLES, SASHIMI
SEA SQUIRT BIBIMBAP, SASHIMI WITH RICE

217
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,408
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

218
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,216
She should be here by now.

219
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,801
Just...

220
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,846
let her do whatever she wants, Grandma.

221
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,098
Don't ask her any questions.

222
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,434
Feed her when she says she's hungry.

223
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,146
And let her work
if she insists on helping you out.

224
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,273
I understand what you mean.

225
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,277
Speaking of the devil. She is here.
I'm going to hang up now.

226
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,988
Nana.

227
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,740
Let me take a look at you.

228
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,660
My gosh, you got so weak and skinny.

229
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,204
I went on a diet.
I've become really pretty, haven't I?

230
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,707
I'm worried
that I might become even prettier.

231
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,002
I personally think my granddaughter,
Hong-ju, is prettier.

232
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,298
You should be grateful
that you have such a kind sister-in-law.

233
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,592
My gosh, you don't know
what you're talking about.

234
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,970
Once she gets mad, she's really scary.

235
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,764
That's why everybody looks at the floor
when she's angry.

236
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,142
She's like that
because she takes after me.

237
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,977
My gosh, enough of that.

238
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,062
Here, I got you a gift.

239
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,815
My goodness, you didn't have
to waste your money like this.

240
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,984
I bought it myself,
so don't think of it as a waste.

241
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,403
Just paint your lips shiny and sparkly.

242
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,617
-Why are you wearing that?
-I need to work.

243
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,785
Gosh, you just got here.

244
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,872
Are you trying not to pay me?
I'm getting paid here today.

245
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:10,125
Since when did you get that greedy?

246
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,543
My goodness.

247
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,923
My goodness.

248
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,180
I had a character model.

249
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,225
With the face, personality, habits,
and so on.

250
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,519
I hired someone appropriate
as a part-time worker.

251
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,238
Hey, Captain Park.

252
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,200
You should be bringing me
the fish you caught. Why are you calling?

253
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,036
Come on. Give me some.

254
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,288
There is no one working here.

255
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,040
Yes.

256
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,584
Is the ship coming in?

257
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,669
Yes.

258
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,712
We have a reservation tomorrow.

259
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,881
So I asked Captain Park
to send me some fish.

260
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,259
-But that old man--
-I'll go get them.

261
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,891
I'll be right back.

262
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,395
My gosh.

263
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,481
She must've come here to clear her head.

264
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,109
GEOJE FISHERY PRODUCTS MARKET

265
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,197
My gosh, look who's here. Come.

266
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,741
Did Captain Park's ship come in?

267
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,369
Long time no see. It'll be here soon.

268
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,330
Are you going to stay here this winter?

269
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,873
No, I'm going to Australia.

270
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,500
-Australia?
-Australia?

271
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,085
Do you know how to speak English?

272
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,921
Of course.
I'm really good at speaking English.

273
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:38,964
Should I show you?

274
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,178
-I don't understand.
-I didn't get anything.

275
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,347
You're really good.
Is there anything you're bad at?

276
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,266
You're so smart and talented.

277
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,768
-She's good at everything.
-I envy her.

278
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,146
-My goodness.
-She's incredible.

279
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,815
It's a cat.

280
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,735
-My gosh.
-How is she that good at English?

281
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,195
-What's wrong?
-My goodness.

282
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,574
Hello, kitty.

283
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,244
Isn't there a lot to eat here?

284
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,082
Why are you alone?

285
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,002
Don't you have a friend?

286
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,005
It's a cat. Master. Cat.

287
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,553
You remind me of someone.

288
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,191
Hey, the boat is arriving.

289
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,651
-There it is.
-It's coming.

290
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,321
I wonder if they caught a lot.

291
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,369
-Over here.
-Come on.

292
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,704
-Hurry up.
-Hello.

293
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,123
Oh, you're here.

294
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,377
-Gosh.
-I brought your favorite bread.

295
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,171
A little sailor's snack for you.

296
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:04,424
You always bring it when you visit.
How lovely.

297
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,510
Then please give me the top-quality fish.

298
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,719
Okay.

299
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,597
I already picked out the ones for you.

300
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,848
Bring them here.

301
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,434
-You're the best, Captain.
-I know.

302
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,311
Bring them here.

303
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,022
Goodness, they're a bit heavy.

304
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,858
-Here you go. Take them.
-Thank you.

305
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:22,901
It's heavy.

306
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,653
-Okay.
-Thank you for the bread.

307
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,696
Thank you.

308
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,209
Goodbye.

309
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,294
-Take care.
-Bye.

310
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,256
Please follow her.

311
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,423
Nana.

312
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,437
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

313
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,453
You know me, don't you?

314
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,628
No.

315
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,838
I don't know you.

316
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,471
We...

317
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,475
were on the same train.

318
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,396
Oh, that's right.

319
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,109
Our seats were facing each other.

320
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,781
I remember that, but what about it?

321
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,410
Could you spare me some time?

322
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,829
Why?

323
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,707
I have something to tell you.

324
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,253
About what?

325
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,754
I...

326
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,886
I'm sorry, but I don't have much time.

327
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,846
I work here as a part-timer.

328
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,183
As you can see, we're very busy.

329
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,436
If my boss catches me
chitchatting with you,

330
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,730
I lose my pay for the day.

331
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,984
I'll wait until you finish.

332
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,607
Seon-hye, he's here. What should I do?

333
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:53,695
Gosh, he really did make pigs fly.

334
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,613
-What?
-Never mind.

335
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,824
What is he doing now?

336
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:04,080
I'm in the kitchen,
and he won't get up from his seat.

337
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,333
I'm about to suffocate. What should I do?

338
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,126
Breathe in.

339
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,588
Breathe in and out. Listen carefully.

340
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,840
You've never met Min-gyu before.

341
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,926
What do we do
when a stranger approaches us?

342
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,763
-We ignore him.
-That's right.

343
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,182
What if he's persistent?

344
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,186
Treat him like a crazy man.

345
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,147
-Let's go.
-Thank you for the food.

346
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,024
Come again soon.

347
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:17,028
I know that I sat across from you,

348
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,156
but it's strange
that you followed me here.

349
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,367
Do you know that it's not normal?

350
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,621
Based on your expression,
it wasn't by chance.

351
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,582
Did you follow me from the train station?

352
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,086
Did you fall in love with me
at first sight?

353
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:37,298
Even if you did, unless you're a stalker,

354
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,467
you can't follow me to my work.

355
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,386
That's just wrong.

356
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,931
I have no interest in you.

357
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,766
You aren't even my type.

358
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,643
Please leave.

359
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,230
Otherwise, I'll call the police.

360
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,653
Assorted sashimi set.

361
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,448
Won't you leave?

362
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,783
I'm quite hungry.

363
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,286
This isn't the only sashimi joint around.

364
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,372
This is only sashimi joint
where I want to eat at.

365
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,833
By the way,

366
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:16,504
is your name Hong-ju?

367
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,256
HONG-JU'S

368
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,884
Goodness.

369
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,469
Hong-ju?

370
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,679
I'll wait for you, Hong-ju.

371
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:27,640
Who is he?

372
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,644
I don't know him.

373
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,812
Should I call the police?

374
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:33,855
No.

375
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,566
Isn't he tormenting you?

376
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,614
It's me...

377
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,158
who's doing the tormenting.

378
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,204
I see. That must be him.

379
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,248
The guy who makes you work and barely eat.

380
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,427
HONG BAEK-GYUN

381
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,767
The number you have dialed
is not available.

382
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,060
Please leave a message...

383
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,438
It's Ji-a. I'm on Geoje Island.

384
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,315
Min-gyu is here.

385
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,818
He hasn't found out yet. What should I do?

386
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,202
Pai, analyze the virus pattern
to remove it.

387
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,287
Hoktal, trace back where it came from.

388
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,164
Ssanip, see if any files were taken.

389
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,457
-Yes, Doctor.
-Yes, Doctor.

390
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:38,795
Who dared to infect our main hard drive
with a virus?

391
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,004
When was it created?

392
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,256
It's today.

393
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,007
It's either exterior or interior.

394
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,843
Was there anyone else here today?

395
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,970
-The Design Team?
-The Design Team?

396
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,013
Darn it. Look through every detail.

397
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,640
Every file is Aji 3's technology.

398
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,808
Protect it no matter what.

399
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,017
-Yes, Doctor.
-Yes, Doctor.

400
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,575
I got you, punk.

401
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,744
I traced it back.
It was sent from Yongsan.

402
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,788
Destroy everything that you find
as you trace back.

403
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,789
Okay.

404
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,583
How dare you?

405
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,627
Screw you, assholes.

406
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,464
Gosh, I give up.

407
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,092
Where are you going?

408
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,015
Who are these guys?

409
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,434
See if anything was stolen
from the backup files.

410
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,852
I checked everything.

411
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,063
Okay.

412
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:44,652
Someone claimed to be Mr. Cho
and postponed the Design Team's visit.

413
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,072
Then hired hackers to attack us.

414
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,240
-Who was it?
-Who?

415
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,742
I know who it was.

416
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,702
What? Who was it?

417
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,877
Even now,

418
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,212
you'll turn a blind eye

419
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,214
to whatever your dad is doing.

420
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,301
So keep doing what you always did,

421
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,970
and stand aside
as if you don't know anything.

422
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,728
Why are you here?

423
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,023
Why do you think?
I came to drink with you.

424
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,569
Are you pitying me?

425
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,614
You must not know me yet.

426
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,616
I'm not good at pitying people.

427
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,536
Please just leave.

428
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,704
CEO Hwang.

429
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,582
You're here not to pity me,

430
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,334
but to make fun of me.

431
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,298
You're so twisted.

432
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,426
Let's see how childish I can be.

433
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,639
And let's see how materialistic
you can be.

434
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,975
Let's keep this up.

435
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,310
I'm curious to know
how we'll end up at this rate.

436
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,604
That's enough.

437
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,607
Push it further, you'll hurt my pride.

438
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,859
If I succeed in ruining Min-gyu's career,

439
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:10,613
your dad will eventually give you to me.

440
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,115
Yu-cheol.

441
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,868
Now you're treating me
like an object as well?

442
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,996
Why is it okay for Min-gyu...

443
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,207
but not for me?

444
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,252
What is so different about him?

445
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,671
Do you want to know?

446
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,506
Min-gyu

447
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,217
is always classy,
no matter what he's doing.

448
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,470
He doesn't stoop low
and doesn't show his worst side like you.

449
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,560
Ri-el.

450
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,443
If Director Kim becomes your son-in-law,

451
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,237
it'll only be right for you
to be in a higher place.

452
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,867
-After you.
-Thanks.

453
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,670
Did you meet Min-gyu?

454
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,302
I met Yu-cheol.

455
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,889
Mr. Hwang is the chairman.

456
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,599
Why did he get kicked out?

457
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,476
Because Chairman Hwang
tried to get rid of Min-gyu

458
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,187
and make Yu-cheol the director.

459
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,815
He probably received many bribes
in that process.

460
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,235
And I'm sure he used that money
to buy borrowed accounts.

461
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,321
But that's solely on his dad.

462
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,989
Yu-cheol did nothing wrong.

463
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,659
He was the CEO who knew nothing.
That's what he did wrong.

464
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,621
It's neither fair nor transparent.

465
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,498
I really don't like it.

466
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,833
Min-gyu was always fair and transparent.

467
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,086
I can't kiss him, Dad.

468
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,509
I changed your engagement venue
to a bigger place.

469
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,177
We're going to have a lot of guests.

470
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,556
Are you going to use my engagement day
to become the chairman of KM Financial?

471
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,475
You get to be the director's wife.

472
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,859
We failed.

473
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,444
I'm sorry, sir.

474
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,459
Who are you? Let's get ready.

475
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,671
Fusion!

476
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,766
Fight.

477
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,355
-I'm going to destroy you.
-Hey, kid. Look at me for a second.

478
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,006
I don't know what's going on,

479
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:18,050
but you shouldn't make
someone that desperate.

480
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,330
The number you have dialed
is not available.

481
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,420
2 MISSED CALLS, 1 TEXT

482
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,590
It's Ji-a. I'm on Geoje Island.

483
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,383
Min-gyu is here.

484
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,802
-He hasn't found yet. What should I do?
-Holy crap.

485
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,819
What is it that you want to say?

486
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,786
DOCTOR HONG BAEK-GYUN

487
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,456
Gosh, why isn't she picking up?

488
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,540
What is it this time?

489
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,334
Min-gyu and Ji-a are together.

490
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,585
What?

491
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,177
Doctor Oh.

492
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,721
Min-gyu's with Ji-a right now.

493
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,515
What? Where? How?

494
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,851
No, wait. Can you reach Ms. Cho right now?

495
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,104
You can't get a hold of her?

496
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,233
If you do, tell her this.

497
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:00,695
Tell her to keep it a secret to death,
to pretend she wasn't Aji 3,

498
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,281
and not to say or do anything
that could remind him of Aji 3.

499
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,492
I...

500
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,288
recently lost...

501
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,707
a friend.

502
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:18,713
That friend helped me
come out from the dark...

503
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,923
after 15 years.

504
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,386
Sorry to hear that.

505
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,181
But what exactly
does that have to do with me?

506
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,809
You feel...

507
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:36,272
very similar to that friend.

508
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,200
Sometimes,

509
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,663
absurd things tend to happen
in this world.

510
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:58,753
Things people can't believe
unless they actually experience them.

511
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,588
That friend and I...

512
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,424
experienced one
of those miraculous moments...

513
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,719
together.

514
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,063
I don't understand.

515
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:19,523
Hey.

516
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,818
You should seriously go to the hospital.

517
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,988
I'll tell you the address
of a nearby hospital.

518
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,615
You should go now.

519
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,950
This is what I used to say to her. "Hi...

520
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,081
Aji 3."

521
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,178
MENU

522
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,849
I finally understand
why you're being like this.

523
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,728
Are you acquainted
with Doctor Hong Baek-gyun?

524
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,773
You know him.

525
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,777
Then you must know Aji 3 is a robot.

526
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,154
Do you know this?

527
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:11,867
If you happen to meet Min-gyu again,
tell him this...

528
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:15,037
I was that robot's character model.

529
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,291
He paid me 10 million won for the job
four years ago.

530
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,670
The person standing before you is whom?

531
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,172
Not a robot but a person, okay?

532
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,716
I know that you were a character model.

533
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,635
You know that much

534
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,638
and you make me feel uncomfortable
by being so rude?

535
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,643
I apologize.

536
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,146
Then get out.

537
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,689
Sorry.

538
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,607
If you feel sorry, get out.

539
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,445
Can't I stay and just look at you,
Hong-ju?

540
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,658
When I get tired of that,
I'll see myself out.

541
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,497
You want to... You'll look at me?

542
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,499
Why would you do that?

543
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,171
It's just...

544
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,215
so fascinating.

545
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,052
-Get up.
-What?

546
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,388
Get up before I drag you outside.

547
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,307
Wait, Hong-ju. Wait.

548
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,641
Hong-ju, wait.

549
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,269
You psychopath,
what do you want to look at?

550
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,189
Are you a rising star
in the stalker world?

551
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,279
You're laughing?

552
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:34,200
You still haven't learned your lesson.

553
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,659
Listen up.

554
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,620
My face is mine,

555
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,623
and the robot you're thinking of isn't me.

556
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,000
I shouldn't have taken that part-time job.

557
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,462
I had no idea
such a weirdo would end up following me.

558
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,883
Do you know how scary it is

559
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,594
when a stranger shows up
acting like you met before?

560
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,638
Give me a room.

561
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:56,931
What?

562
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,016
It says bed and breakfast.

563
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,101
Give me a bed to spend the night in.

564
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,479
Will you please get lost?

565
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,481
No. We're full.

566
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,776
It looks like you're empty.

567
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,444
I...

568
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,863
Hong...

569
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,699
I'll go too.

570
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,992
-Me too.
-Me too.

571
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,703
-You stay.
-You guard the lab.

572
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:21,997
We...

573
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,625
Get hacked again, okay?

574
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,918
Come on...

575
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,130
How come she's with our brother?

576
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,465
I have no idea.

577
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,134
Do you think something will happen?

578
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,220
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING
SANTA MARIA

579
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,221
Pai.

580
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,726
You haven't slept properly in days.

581
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,728
What if you doze off at the wheel?

582
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,523
If you want to go, take me with you.

583
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,650
If not, you aren't going either.

584
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,776
Never ever.

585
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,779
She's so stubborn.

586
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,210
Seon-hye, where on Geoje Island is Ji-a?

587
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,215
The call cannot be connected.

588
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,598
DOCTOR OH

589
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,434
Do you think Ji-a gave in?

590
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,980
The probability of her being successful
is below ten percent,

591
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,941
but Min-gyu's cluelessness
could be a strong variable.

592
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,028
I calculate that will raise
the success rate to 30 percent.

593
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,488
Another variable,
Ji-a's unpredictable behavior,

594
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,115
will bring it down to 15 percent.

595
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,326
No, that variable is so strong

596
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,286
that it will stay controlled
up to 25 percent.

597
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,413
Fifteen percent.

598
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,041
-Twenty-five percent.
-Fifteen percent.

599
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,250
Twenty-five.

600
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:04,725
He's like a leech. He just won't let go.

601
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,194
-Seon-hye.
-Why didn't you pick up?

602
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,487
What happened?

603
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,155
I kicked him out for now.

604
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,994
I gave Fungus your address.
He'll be on his way.

605
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,579
Can he come here?

606
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,790
We must be there.

607
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,625
Did you say you were a character model?

608
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,502
Yes, I think he believed that.

609
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,544
Listen carefully.

610
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:36,215
You called me out of anger about Min-gyu,
and we're coming over.

611
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,510
If he bothers you again, be angry.

612
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,595
I am being angry.

613
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,138
It's not working.

614
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,015
It's like he doesn't understand Korean.

615
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,351
Be as angry as you can be.

616
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,769
Doctor Oh said this.

617
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,772
Don't say or do anything
you said or did as Aji 3.

618
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,066
Okay, I'll be careful.

619
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,527
Should I just run away?

620
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,529
Min-gyu's IQ is 159.

621
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,115
I guarantee that he'll suspect you
as soon as you disappear.

622
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,827
It's suffocating.
I can't breathe like this.

623
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,245
It's a bed and breakfast, right?

624
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,789
Lock yourself in a room
until we get there.

625
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:10,958
Okay.

626
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,669
How could something like this happen?

627
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,713
-Hong-ju.
-My gosh! My goodness!

628
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,017
What was that? Deja vu?

629
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,312
I misheard that, didn't I?
Please say, I did.

630
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,606
It actually happened, Doctor.

631
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,567
Oh, no.

632
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,411
Aji 3...

633
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,746
did that exact thing one time.

634
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,874
When we first met.

635
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:56,128
No. Was it the second time?

636
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,966
Why are you here?

637
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,719
Oh, I left my bag and coat.

638
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,846
Take them and get out.

639
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,639
I haven't finished my sashimi.

640
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,226
-I'll pack the rest for you.
-No, I'll eat it all here.

641
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,353
We have to close.

642
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,565
I'll eat it all up before you do.

643
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,150
But...

644
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,500
Oh, dear.

645
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,091
He didn't leave. He came back in.

646
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,679
Listen to me carefully.
You might as well just be yourself.

647
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:51,183
I told him Aji 3 has your face,
personality, and habits.

648
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:53,143
But remember this instead.

649
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,438
You do not know anything he said
or did to you, okay?

650
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,690
The second he notices, you become Aji 3.

651
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,025
Okay.

652
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,404
Thanks for the bread.

653
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,783
How are Ji-a's defenses?

654
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,326
The first line is down.

655
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,579
The second and last line are still secure.

656
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,664
Thank you.

657
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,086
-Seon-hye.
-I'm on diet.

658
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:25,300
Will Kim Min-gyu fall for the ruse
from start to finish again?

659
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,553
He did when Ji-a was the robot.

660
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,346
I think he will, he will.

661
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,973
He has to, right?

662
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:34,476
Back then, he was weird
since he had been alone for so long.

663
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,187
He has come leaps and bounds since then.

664
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,065
My heart is pounding so hard,
it's killing me.

665
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:44,611
Does he still have that clueless idiocy?
That is the question.

666
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:54,538
Dear Dong-won, am I all you see?

667
00:47:55,163 --> 00:48:00,127
Dear Dong-won...

668
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,087
You froze. What are you doing?

669
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,506
Why are you zoning out? Get a grip.

670
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,427
Seon-hye, I was always looking at you.

671
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,223
You knew that and...

672
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,155
Drink some water, too.

673
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,032
Isn't it too dry?

674
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,619
Thank you.

675
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,747
Can you take the cart
to the communal warehouse?

676
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,624
Woo-sik's family needs it tomorrow.

677
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,752
And bring the baskets we dry the fish in.

678
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,837
-I'll clean up here first.
-Okay.

679
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,796
Ma'am.

680
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:46,715
Do you have a room?

681
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,883
-No.
-Yes, many.

682
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,178
Which one do you want?

683
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,265
The one with an ocean view?

684
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,559
Yes.

685
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:04,441
Come on, show him to his room.

686
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,002
There's no bed?

687
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,046
No. You'll leave, right?

688
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,381
I'll stay.

689
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,094
There are better hotels around.

690
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,263
This place or a hotel,
they're still worse than my room.

691
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:40,102
He's just as mean and spiteful as always.

692
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,604
-Goodnight.
-Wait.

693
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:44,856
So...

694
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,609
How about a coffee?

695
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,905
There's a vending machine
outside the restaurant.

696
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,573
It costs just 200 won.

697
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,616
Wait.

698
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,539
I don't have any change.

699
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,520
It's on me.

700
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:41,955
Hi.

701
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:43,540
Are you on Geoje Island?

702
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,960
How did you know I'm here?

703
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:49,713
I got a call from the character model.

704
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,382
She said a weirdo's calling her Aji 3.

705
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,967
She is scared and wants you gone.

706
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,969
Is that why you called me today?

707
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,848
I met her by chance on the train.

708
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,185
She looks incredibly like your robot.

709
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,148
When I came to my senses,

710
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,484
I was here.

711
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,195
You can't do that.

712
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,489
How shocked must she be?

713
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,701
Was she very shocked?

714
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,204
Of course, she was. Wouldn't you be?

715
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,707
Yes, I guess you're right.

716
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,462
I told her the truth about why I'm here.

717
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,172
This really won't do.

718
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,549
I'm on my way. I'll see you there.

719
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,384
What? You'll come here?

720
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,970
Do you think I can stay in Seoul
when this is happening?

721
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:42,057
You wait right there.
And leave the girl alone.

722
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,642
But I--

723
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:45,811
CALL LIST

724
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,356
DOCTOR OH

725
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,905
Doctor Oh, you called?

726
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,282
Is everything okay?

727
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,076
Of course.

728
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,036
Do you have your syringe and medication?

729
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,539
You should carry it for a while,
just in case.

730
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,833
No, I didn't bring anything.

731
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,668
Mr. Kim.

732
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,506
Don't worry, I have everything I need.

733
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,362
Mr. Cho?

734
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,030
Yes, Director.

735
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,992
You didn't answer your phone,
so I couldn't report back.

736
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,535
You can do that later.

737
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,247
When you looked into Santa Maria,

738
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:51,209
did you find anything
on Aji 3's character model?

739
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:57,215
Is there a human being that looks
just like Aji 3?

740
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,426
What?

741
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,512
Her name is Hong-ju.
I don't know her surname.

742
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,264
Hong-ju?

743
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,348
Me?

744
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:06,933
Do you remember?

745
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,312
Yes.

746
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,817
Aji 3 was created based on a real person.

747
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,029
That's all I know for sure.

748
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,072
I see.

749
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:27,329
If you say so, then it must be true.

750
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,122
Yes, sir.

751
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,624
Okay.

752
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:39,841
Honey.

753
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,968
What is it?

754
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:47,182
Why did you say my name all of a sudden?

755
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,323
Can you stop outside
that convenience store?

756
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,992
Sure. Do you need something?

757
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:18,880
SENIOR CHEON MYEONG-WON

758
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,890
Angela, why aren't you picking up?

759
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,851
My professor wants to offer
the professor position again.

760
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,603
Asking why you're refusing
offer this good.

761
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,146
Give me a call.

762
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,333
Drink this before you drive.

763
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:58,211
-Leave it there.
-Drink it.

764
00:54:58,837 --> 00:54:59,963
Now.

765
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,048
You don't have to get angry.

766
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,466
Drink it.

767
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,135
Okay, I will.

768
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,225
Tastes like crap.

769
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:14,144
Finish it up. All of it.

770
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,312
Then you can drive.

771
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,897
My life is at stake too.

772
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,325
You can go now.

773
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,244
Okay.

774
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,377
I think I got something.

775
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,379
Can you restore it?

776
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,548
I just need the password.

777
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:47,719
Seon-hye, that time,
for the moonlit date, where did you go?

778
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,096
-She didn't go anywhere.
-Be quiet.

779
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,224
-Tell the truth.
-No, really.

780
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,976
You went to the toilet, right?

781
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,186
-Yes, I did.
-See?

782
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,312
MONAMI FOLDER WAS LEAKED.

783
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,481
Did you really go to poop?

784
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,941
-We are drinking coffee.
-Come on.

785
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,321
What's going on?

786
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,582
Did the car just break down?

787
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:21,503
I'm surprised it held out
for as long as it did.

788
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,879
Don't do this to me.

789
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,762
DELUXE, PLAIN, KOREAN TEA

790
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:32,555
DELUXE

791
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,689
The sweeter the coffee, the better.

792
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,736
Thank you.

793
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,283
-It's really good.
-Right?

794
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,452
Nana, I'm off to the warehouse.

795
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,370
Wait.

796
00:56:55,453 --> 00:57:00,708
I noticed last time that the light bulb
in there was flickering.

797
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,210
It's dark. I'll come along.

798
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,546
It's fine. I'll go on my own.

799
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,339
-You, young man.
-Yes?

800
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:10,218
I don't want my granddaughter
to go off on her own at night.

801
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,011
Could you go with her?

802
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,555
Nana.

803
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,392
That's not a problem.
I have loads of time.

804
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,977
Let's go, Hong-ju.

805
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,105
-Nana.
-Go on.

806
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:23,523
Go.

807
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,879
From now on,
I will pick you up every morning

808
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,381
to maximize the use of your battery.

809
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,632
Is it because...

810
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,927
-I'm your treasure?
-Whatever.

811
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,305
Get ready for a scolding.

812
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,765
It's wrong to scold for no reason, master.

813
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,104
Why did you laugh?

814
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,731
You laughed too.

815
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,233
I had a good enough reason to laugh.

816
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,027
Can you not talk to me?

817
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,695
I'm trying to drive.

818
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:15,617
I'm here to look after you, Hong-ju.

819
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,202
Did I ask you to?

820
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,913
Technically speaking,
shouldn't you be grateful?

821
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,623
Do you force people to thank you?

822
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:24,751
-Are you usually this plucky?
-What's wrong with me?

823
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:29,005
Aji 3 was rude, but she was cute.

824
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:33,176
Being with you is helping me realize
there are differences.

825
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,053
If I stay longer...

826
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,097
will I see more?

827
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:41,392
Darn it. Should I be happy or sad?

828
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,478
Aji 3 was--

829
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,735
Are you getting your revenge
by driving roughly?

830
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:53,488
I'm just a terrible driver, that's all.

831
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,144
I left my phone in my apron.

832
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:31,109
Can you turn on your phone
on flashlight mode?

833
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,821
My battery's almost dead.

834
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,490
I'll buy you a new one
that's fully charged.

835
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,325
Turn it on.

836
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:46,249
Where is the basket?

837
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:52,714
It stinks.

838
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,471
My gosh. Unbelievable.

839
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:03,391
Shut the door after using the warehouse.
For god's sake.

840
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,529
-What?
-What?

841
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,243
No. Hold on.

842
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,828
I'm still inside!

843
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,956
Excuse me! There's someone inside!

844
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,043
Excuse me!

845
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,420
There's someone inside!

846
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,215
Excuse me!

847
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:46,267
My gosh, did I seriously get locked up
in this storage room with him?

848
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:47,810
This can't be.

849
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:52,607
I'll either suffocate or freeze to death
before morning comes.

850
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,485
Why don't we be friends?

851
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:38,736
I don't have a girlfriend.

852
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,322
I slowly started to become greedy.

853
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:44,242
Who do you miss the most right now?

854
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,618
Mr. Kim Min-gyu.

855
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,955
If I honestly told him
what really happened,

856
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,541
maybe he would forgive and believe me.

857
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,543
Do you miss me that much?

858
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:56,045
But I shouldn't do that, right?

859
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:59,257
Gosh. There she is.

860
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,175
Let me explain everything.

861
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,262
Have you been lying to me this whole time?

862
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,769
