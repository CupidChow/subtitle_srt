1
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,815
Chairman Park Seong-jin
wasn't murdered by Chairman Hwang Do-won.

2
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,983
It was Martin.

3
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,695
A video of him confessing his crime

4
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,031
was recorded on Aji 3.

5
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,871
I heard that the emergency board meeting
is tomorrow.

6
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,165
I think we should all go--

7
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,082
No.

8
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,334
That won't solve anything.

9
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,796
Then, do you have any other ideas?

10
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,841
I'm going to make sure

11
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,428
they don't use my illness against me
from now on.

12
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,698
Are you going in?

13
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,209
Try some.

14
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,378
When you were young,
I used to get this bread

15
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,963
for you and Min-gyu.

16
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,632
You both loved it so much.

17
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,678
You know about it too, don't you?

18
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,556
I'm talking about Min-gyu.

19
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,476
Do you know about his illness?

20
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,812
Of course, I do.

21
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,523
He suffered from the illness for 15 years.

22
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,568
Fifteen years?

23
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,070
Yes.

24
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:57,700
It started when his parents passed away.

25
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:05,250
It's probably because he was deeply hurt
by a lot of people back then.

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,798
Sign this.

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,970
My dad says if you sign this,
we can live together.

28
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,107
Cheer up, my friend.

29
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,068
No, we're a family now.

30
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,239
Get off! Get away from me!

31
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,359
CLAIM
APPLICANT: HWANG DO-WON

32
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,950
After that day,

33
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,830
Min-gyu locked himself up in this house
for 15 years.

34
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,794
He couldn't have any physical contact
with other people,

35
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,464
he cooked his own food,

36
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,883
and he just endured the pain.

37
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,553
More importantly,
no one came to visit him.

38
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,892
Why didn't you visit him?

39
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,271
I am sorry.

40
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:58,488
If you're sorry, you need to say it
in order for him to know.

41
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,642
It's apparently because of me.

42
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,729
Min-gyu got sick because of me.

43
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,315
I used to feel really upset.

44
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,235
I couldn't understand
why he was so harsh on me.

45
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,321
I couldn't understand
how he could treat me that way

46
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,450
when we used to be friends.

47
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,454
I always thought I was the victim.

48
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,000
And I slowly started to

49
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,044
rationalize my actions...

50
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,340
and my dad's actions.

51
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,178
You were young back then.

52
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,224
You didn't know
he had that kind of illness.

53
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,270
I'm sure Min-gyu will understand.

54
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,982
It's not too late.
You can go back to being friends.

55
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,611
Do you really think so?

56
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,771
He probably can't sleep
because of tomorrow's press conference.

57
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,403
Hey, what's up?

58
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,449
What? You're where?

59
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,752
When did you arrive?

60
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,170
Just a while ago.

61
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,173
Are you okay?

62
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,936
Friend Mode.

63
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,315
What's with the frowning?

64
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,275
Do you want me to straighten it out
with an iron?

65
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,152
Who made you feel this way?

66
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,530
Bring them over.
I'll beat the hell out of them.

67
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,411
My gosh, you're cute.

68
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,124
You better not act this cute
around others.

69
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,835
You're the only person
who thinks I'm cute.

70
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,795
What? Why wouldn't anyone
think you're cute?

71
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,839
I know, right?

72
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:09,011
You're the cutest and prettiest woman
out of all the women I know.

73
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,097
You don't know a lot of women.

74
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,228
Should I get to know some more women then?

75
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,729
I'm going to kill you.

76
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,777
If I'm so cute,

77
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,904
then you can promote me
and start calling me Pretty again.

78
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,531
No, I can't do that.

79
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,449
Why not?

80
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,201
There's another rank
right above the rank of Pretty,

81
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,411
and that's you.

82
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,079
What kind of rank is that?

83
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,416
It's a special rank that I made
just for you with all of your secrets.

84
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,751
Gosh, I told you everything.
There's nothing more to tell.

85
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,545
When? I'm sure there's more.

86
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,713
I already told you everything.

87
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,215
-Do you want me to bring it up again?
-You're so mean.

88
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,301
-I know there's more.
-There's nothing more to tell.

89
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,595
-Gosh, just admit it.
-Hey.

90
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,264
You're driving me crazy.

91
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,734
Do you feel better?

92
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,860
Yes.

93
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:11,032
Thanks to you,
I'll be able to win the fight tomorrow.

94
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,995
Are you sure you don't need me there?

95
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,123
Do you want me to stand
at the back of the conference room?

96
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,542
No, it's okay.

97
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,960
I'll go by myself.

98
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,508
Wherever I am,
I know that you'll always be by my side.

99
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,184
I wish you all the best.

100
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,813
I'll do my best to win.

101
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,951
We shall begin
the emergency board meeting.

102
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:59,539
Today's agenda is critical to the future
of KM Financial,

103
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,166
and the board must come
to a quick decision.

104
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,751
Just a second.

105
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,631
Let me say something
before you announce the agenda.

106
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:13,719
Director Kim is currently holding
a press conference.

107
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,223
It may have a big effect
on today's meeting.

108
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:21,060
Therefore, I think we should first check
what he'll be announcing.

109
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,145
What are you talking about?
Let's just get on with it.

110
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,440
But he might be announcing
something really important.

111
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,027
Are you sure Director Kim
isn't just trying to trick us?

112
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,030
KM FINANCIAL DIRECTOR KIM MIN-GYU
PRESS CONFERENCE

113
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,268
I'm KM Financial's director,

114
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,645
Kim Min-gyu.

115
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,858
I also...

116
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,073
suffer from...

117
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,285
a human allergy.

118
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,833
As soon as I come into physical contact
with a human being,

119
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,376
I start to have difficulty breathing.

120
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,504
And I start getting rashes on my body.

121
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,882
And because of this,

122
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,720
I always carried around my gloves
and my baton.

123
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,847
I'm sure a lot of you may wonder

124
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,060
how someone like me was able

125
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:48,230
to work as a director of a big firm.

126
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,775
Every time I came to the office

127
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,112
all the employees thankfully kept
their distance from me.

128
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,490
Therefore, I had no trouble
attending meetings.

129
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,533
And as for my other duties,

130
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,330
I was able to take care of them
without a problem.

131
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,500
Thanks to our capable Mr. Cho.

132
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:17,802
There's one thing I'm proudly able
to tell everyone.

133
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:21,972
I'm slowly starting to heal from this

134
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,185
so-called human allergy.

135
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,356
One day, out of the blue,

136
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,985
a robot suddenly came to my life.

137
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,533
I became friends with that robot.

138
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,454
And I tried to connect with it.

139
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,667
Yes.

140
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,630
That's what happened.

141
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,928
That robot...

142
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,682
was sometimes human.

143
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,727
And sometimes a robot.

144
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,064
My emotions

145
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,192
were input

146
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,486
into that robot

147
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,364
and that person.

148
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,242
That's how...

149
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,706
this miracle happened.

150
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,715
That fact

151
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,428
completely changed the way I view things.

152
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,596
This will be yet

153
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:48,309
another scoop for the reporters present.

154
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,811
KM Financial

155
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:55,774
will go from financing
Mergers and Acquisitions

156
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,487
to investing in futuristic industries
that involve human sensibilities.

157
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,034
This is your first change
in business strategy in 15 years.

158
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,120
Do you have anything mapped out?

159
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,290
First of all, KM Financial

160
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,375
will invest heavily
in developing robots with AI

161
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,212
that can communicate with us
on an emotional level.

162
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,465
With Doctor Hong Baek-gyun,
a world-class roboticist,

163
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,885
we will bring in
the fourth industrial revolution,

164
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,430
and we will offer any support necessary.

165
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,266
Is Doctor Hong in Seoul?

166
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,894
-Can we interview him?
-Is your allergy curable?

167
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,813
-Look over here.
-Where is that robot?

168
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,898
Can you tell us?

169
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,942
Can you tell us anything else?

170
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,659
Doctor, it looks like
you'll have quite a hassle.

171
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,831
We'll bring in
the fourth industrial revolution.

172
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,296
I suddenly feel a weight on my shoulders.

173
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,007
You're really heavy. Stop it.

174
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,972
Doctor, can I talk to you in private?

175
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,267
Our stock price is soaring.

176
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,394
-Is it really?
-What's going on?

177
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,479
-My goodness.
-It's skyrocketing.

178
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,273
It went up so much.

179
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,482
Look.

180
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,693
May I have your attention, please?

181
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,194
We're running out of time.

182
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,030
We shall now vote
on dismissing Director Kim...

183
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,786
The press conference we just saw
convinced me

184
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,957
beyond a shadow of doubt that Director Kim

185
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,543
is someone we can't do without.

186
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,296
I, therefore,

187
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:45,092
agree wholeheartedly
with Director Kim's new road map.

188
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,094
As a shareholder

189
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:54,184
and as Chairman Hwang's representative
on the agenda of Director Kim's dismissal,

190
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,563
I vote no.

191
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,273
What do you mean?

192
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,775
-We came to vote yes.
-What's happening?

193
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,611
-What's going on?
-It's nonsense.

194
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,071
I also support Director Kim Min-gyu.

195
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,116
I'm against his dismissal.

196
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,328
-My goodness.
-What is happening here?

197
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,917
-We came here to get rid of him.
-What are they talking about?

198
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,293
This is a mess.

199
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,049
-Hi, did you watch?
-Yes.

200
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,803
Kim Min-gyu, you were awesome,
incredibly cool.

201
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,765
This is the kind of guy your boyfriend is.

202
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,393
I have to go to the company.

203
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,938
Go and wait somewhere.
I'll come over later.

204
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,439
Thank you.

205
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,816
Okay, good luck wrapping it up.

206
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,529
You have to really do your best.

207
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,698
You know I invested in you, right?

208
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,078
Thank you, but...

209
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,330
will you be okay?

210
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,500
I trust your competence.

211
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,504
That's why I'm excited
about the new future you proposed.

212
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,632
Will there be a lot I can do too?

213
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:12,388
Actually, Yu-cheol worked harder than I
to convince the directors.

214
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,812
I think I should leave
and let you two talk

215
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,481
about the misunderstandings you've had
for 15 years.

216
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,079
I found out...

217
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,125
what the papers I had given to you meant.

218
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,961
What my dad had tried to do to you.

219
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,590
I found the papers in my dad's study.

220
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,094
But...

221
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,723
I couldn't tell you that I knew.

222
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,184
I pretended not to know what had happened.

223
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,857
I pretended I had not wronged you at all.

224
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,319
I believed my dad hadn't done that
out of malice.

225
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,365
That's how I rationalized it away.

226
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,993
Just to protect myself.

227
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,669
It was coward

228
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,422
and foolish.

229
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,678
Sorry it took so long.

230
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,436
I'm sorry, Min-gyu.

231
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,196
We found evidence

232
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,866
that Martin killed
Chairman Park Seong-jin.

233
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,619
Interpol got involved.

234
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,957
Go and convince your dad.

235
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,252
He has to turn himself in

236
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,005
to get a lower sentence.

237
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,513
Okay.

238
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,724
Thanks for telling me.

239
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,503
I think

240
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,298
I'll be okay this time.

241
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,413
Hi. Where are you?

242
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,042
Shall we meet on the street
we walked on when it was snowing?

243
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,088
Shall we? Okay, I'll be right there.

244
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,385
When...

245
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,888
How long...

246
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,516
have you been standing there?

247
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,143
Quite a while now.

248
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,061
I knocked before coming in.

249
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,941
Have a seat.

250
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,333
You did very well today.

251
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,334
Thank you.

252
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,086
I think we sorted everything out.

253
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,339
What do you think?

254
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,758
Yes, I think so, too.

255
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,344
We should all go home early today.

256
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,305
In that case, I would like you to accept

257
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,974
my letter of resignation.

258
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,684
What?

259
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,770
That...

260
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,898
I already said--

261
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,775
That was your opinion.

262
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,985
I haven't changed my mind...

263
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,738
about resigning.

264
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,324
But--

265
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,327
I stayed because there was a lot to do.

266
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,538
Now that everything's done, so as planned,

267
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,874
I should leave as well.

268
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,503
Mr. Cho.

269
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,464
Please, sir.

270
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,971
Well...

271
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,306
goodbye.

272
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,995
Why do you want to buy clothes?

273
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,747
You'll be swamped
with interview requests now.

274
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,833
I'll wear what I have.

275
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,671
Don't you think Min-gyu
has an unusual charm?

276
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,882
He looks like a little brother at home.

277
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,511
But at work, he has this killer charisma.

278
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,514
He's a director for a reason.

279
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,308
He put up a good fight.

280
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,560
What about me?

281
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:55,564
I'm used to you, so it's impossible
to find a new side of you.

282
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,279
What is it?

283
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,740
Do you want to go out with me?

284
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,367
What?

285
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,210
How long are you going to stare?

286
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,004
Until you look back at me.

287
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,215
There. Happy?

288
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,508
Do you want to go out with me?

289
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,929
Why are you laughing?

290
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,141
Let's go.

291
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,896
Dr. Hong, aren't you going to answer me?

292
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,612
It's cold. Let's go.

293
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,840
Dad, I'm sorry.

294
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,969
I'm not living the life
you wanted me to live.

295
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,639
But I'll live happily.

296
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,433
I know that deep in your heart,

297
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,853
you would want me to be happy.

298
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,274
That's what I believe.

299
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,039
I thought you were nervous,
but you did so well.

300
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,001
I was really nervous at first,

301
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,255
but I thought of you
after taking a deep breath.

302
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,716
From that point on,
I was able to talk smoothly.

303
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,761
My spirit helped you.

304
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,391
Also,

305
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,895
it was my first time in 15 years

306
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,440
that I had a real conversation
with Yu-cheol.

307
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:07,445
I even suggested
that we shake hands first.

308
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,740
For some reason,
I thought it would be okay.

309
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,951
-You shook hands?
-Yes.

310
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,286
Were you okay?

311
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,454
Yes.

312
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,541
Once I thought of you, I was fine.

313
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,836
You should take good care
of this treasure of yours.

314
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,132
Gosh, it's so cold.

315
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,634
Come here.

316
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,848
If you're cold,
why are you giving this to me?

317
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,725
To take good care of my treasure.

318
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,606
What do you want to do today?

319
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,065
I'll do anything for you.

320
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,612
Wait. Is this really what you want?

321
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,696
Yes.

322
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,664
Seriously.

323
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,128
Hey.

324
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:11,551
What is Mr. Cho like?

325
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,513
Once he says no, it's a no.

326
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,938
I see. What kind of person is he to you?

327
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,233
Someone like a dad?

328
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,529
Mr. Cho quit today.

329
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,031
What? Really?

330
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,115
Yes.

331
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,326
I don't know

332
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,372
how to persuade him.

333
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,585
Mr. Cho...

334
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,337
Quit?

335
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,047
Ji-a's brother?

336
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,340
He handed in a resignation letter?

337
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,761
Did you offend him or something?

338
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,308
Maybe a little? It was long ago.

339
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,104
To be honest, a lot. But...

340
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,147
it wasn't anything recent.

341
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,277
I don't think he's the type of person
who hold grudges.

342
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,197
Hey, didn't you see him
sue his own sister?

343
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,657
Grudges?

344
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,909
He's such a stubborn guy.

345
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,369
He must be uncomfortable.

346
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,079
With what?

347
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,498
To have his sister's boyfriend
as his boss.

348
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,499
You're right.

349
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,751
I just imagined it,
and it's so uncomfortable.

350
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,461
Would it be that uncomfortable?

351
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:32,132
I thought we got along well.

352
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,341
Work is work.

353
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,552
It's different when it's personal.

354
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,264
Is this season two
of turning Kim Min-gyu into a human?

355
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,598
Yes.

356
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,269
I got it. This is it.

357
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,270
What is it?

358
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,732
He doesn't like you as Ji-a's boyfriend.

359
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,733
Hey.

360
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,861
-Watch your mouth.
-Keep that closed.

361
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,449
They were not helpful at all.

362
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,038
Why are you following me in?

363
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,748
I'm going to rest.

364
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,181
-What is it?
-Hey.

365
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,434
Where do kids go for dates these days?

366
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,729
Why are you asking me such a thing?

367
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,024
Why? Can't I ask a question?

368
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,859
You don't have anyone
to go on a date with.

369
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,319
Wait a minute.

370
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,487
Do you?

371
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,783
No way. There are no women around.

372
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,037
Be quiet.

373
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,040
I said be quiet.

374
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,876
Since when?

375
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,129
Hey.

376
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,174
You guys actually look good together.

377
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,928
-Of course.
-I went to a fun place today.

378
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,054
Do you want to know where?

379
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,055
Where is it?

380
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,474
This is for you.

381
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,684
-Thank you.
-No problem.

382
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,647
Hey, did you really quit your job?

383
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,899
Don't worry,
it has nothing to do with you.

384
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:13,942
What?

385
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,236
You quit your job?

386
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,156
Hong-ju.

387
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,451
Are you kidding me right now?

388
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:28,164
When you confessed everything to me,
I told you to never lie to me again.

389
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,709
What is this? You quit without telling me?

390
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,794
Well...

391
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,797
I handed in the resignation letter
quite a while ago.

392
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,591
What? You handed in a resignation letter
a while ago?

393
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:42,721
This is making me really mad. Gosh!

394
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,055
-Hong-ju, calm down.
-Hong-ju.

395
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,223
Stop!

396
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,517
How can I calm down?

397
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,854
Mom, you will scare the baby.

398
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,689
Right. I'm sorry.

399
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:57,026
How are you so inflexible?

400
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,696
Go get your resignation letter back
right away.

401
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,990
Answer me.

402
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,450
Okay.

403
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,666
You fool.

404
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,086
It's not over yet.

405
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,963
-You can--
-No.

406
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,049
It's over.

407
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,429
They found evidence
where Martin admitted his murder.

408
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:28,475
You need to confess everything you know
before he gets arrested.

409
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,268
That's the only way
to reduce your sentence.

410
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,895
Impossible!

411
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,606
It's not over for Hwang Do-won!

412
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,609
Come to your senses, Father.

413
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,736
Please.

414
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:51,956
So, you will pay for a portion of the rent
in exchange for a corner in the café?

415
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,335
Yes. What was it called again? Shop--

416
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,045
-Shop in shop?
-Yes.

417
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,673
I want to do that in a corner
of your café.

418
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,134
I will use it as my office
as well as a showroom.

419
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,720
I like that. Let's do it.

420
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,431
What about development expenses?

421
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,808
Last time, Hong-ju--

422
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,185
She's furious right now. I can't ask her.

423
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,062
Why? Did something happen?

424
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,606
My brother quit his job.

425
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,943
I can see why she's mad.

426
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,153
Ask Kim Min-gyu to invest.

427
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,738
Isn't it an investment company now?

428
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,323
I will make it work on my own.

429
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,910
Something called crowdfunding
or something.

430
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,371
-"Crowdfunding"?
-Yes.

431
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,581
It's a medium
where I publish my idea on the internet

432
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,251
to receive investment.

433
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,087
Then, give me a percentage
of your earnings

434
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,130
instead of paying rent.

435
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,632
Let's go, Cho Ji-a!

436
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,716
Yes!

437
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,718
Now, I...

438
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,351
have to go on a date.

439
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,769
I'll close the café.

440
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,895
Okay.

441
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,256
Are you feeling all right?

442
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,843
Yes. I'm all better now.

443
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,428
I'm just like everyone else.

444
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,762
I can even touch you.

445
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,650
I'm sorry.

446
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,238
-Hey.
-Hey.

447
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,784
Please go ahead.

448
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,455
Well...

449
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,835
It's about your resignation letter.

450
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,670
Yes. The letter...

451
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,178
I think I should...

452
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,805
Well...

453
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,393
The resignation letter...

454
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:21,272
Okay. I will just process it, then.

455
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,317
It looks like your mind is set.

456
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:30,531
I would really prefer for you
to stay on the team,

457
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,702
but maybe you're uncomfortable
because of Ji-a.

458
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,038
But...

459
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,875
if you ever change your mind,
please don't hesitate to tell me.

460
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,878
I would welcome you back with open arms.

461
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,393
Yes. What is it?

462
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,895
Where are you?

463
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,522
At Summer Snow.

464
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,649
Should I come over?

465
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,235
I'm working.

466
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,613
What's more important? Me or work?

467
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,617
Work is important, and so are you.

468
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,037
Gosh. I miss you a lot.

469
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,164
I miss you too.

470
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,793
I'll call you when I finish this.

471
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,754
Okay. Bye.

472
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,507
CROWDFUNDING REGISTRATION

473
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,854
I can sit here for a while, right?

474
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,444
You can work. I'll just watch you.

475
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,612
You're not allowed to talk to me.

476
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,505
Fine. What is it? Tell me.

477
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,341
Well...

478
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,594
Mr. Cho--

479
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,179
Right, my brother!

480
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,514
He must have come to see you
to get his registration letter back.

481
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,516
I forgot to tell you.

482
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,437
-What?
-His wife has him under her thumb.

483
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,899
She ordered him to get it back.
It's good news, right?

484
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,901
Did you see him today?

485
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,654
Yes. We met up.

486
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,156
And?

487
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,951
I told him I would process it.

488
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,661
I see.

489
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:44,207
I'm suddenly getting a headache.

490
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,335
This isn't working. Come over to my house.

491
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:50,630
What?

492
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,508
My brother won't be able
to take his word back anymore.

493
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,552
So you should come to my house,

494
00:34:56,636 --> 00:35:00,848
and give his letter of resignation back
right in front of my sister-in-law.

495
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,851
Then my brother won't be able to refuse.

496
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,396
I get what you mean.
I think I can do that. Okay.

497
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,731
And...

498
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,943
if I go over to your house,

499
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,863
are you going to show me your room?

500
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,658
No, I can't show you my room.
It's too dirty.

501
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,663
You already saw my room.
Why can't I see yours?

502
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,213
To be honest, I--

503
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,614
You're a fast learner.

504
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,120
I'm going to kill you if you kiss.

505
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:12,253
You video called me because you knew
I took my makeup off, didn't you?

506
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,673
No. I just wanted to see your face
while we talk.

507
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,135
It hasn't even been that long
since we said goodbye.

508
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,141
You're so cute.

509
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,689
I can't watch this.

510
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,943
Everyone else but me is dating.

511
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,362
This is sad.

512
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,159
Even the sauce container is in a pair.
How annoying.

513
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,243
Eddie?

514
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,252
Jane?

515
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,965
When did you come to Korea?
No, that's not right.

516
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,190
Dear all holy beings, thank you!

517
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,355
There are still a lot of people.

518
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,483
Watching people is fun, too.

519
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,737
This feels nice.

520
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,323
I like it, too.

521
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,413
I think

522
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,833
we spent too much time locked
inside the laboratory.

523
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,545
We develop robots
that communicate with humans,

524
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,130
but we

525
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,049
didn't have much contact
with the outside world.

526
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,136
We were all too busy with research.

527
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,684
Let's do this more often.

528
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,769
Sure.

529
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,732
What do you think is around that corner?

530
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,859
Let's go and find out.

531
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,361
Sure, let's go.

532
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:52,163
You put on a terrific scheme.

533
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,291
Did you enjoy scamming the naive kids?

534
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,544
Yu-cheol

535
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,297
will soon be reinstated as CEO.

536
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,717
Both Yu-cheol and Ri-el

537
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,720
will live their own lives.

538
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:12,850
We will run KM Financial in a way
that is very different from before.

539
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,268
You arrogant fool.

540
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:18,272
You and my dad parted ways as enemies.

541
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,233
Yu-cheol and I are different.

542
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,653
We will not repeat

543
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,822
what went wrong in the past.

544
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,706
Everything is over at last.

545
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,958
How do you feel? Relieved?

546
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:44,215
I don't feel as relieved or excited
as I thought I would.

547
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,175
I just think

548
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,179
I'm realizing that what happened

549
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:54,767
in the past no longer hurts me.

550
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,936
That's a huge deal. You're healing.

551
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,940
Though we'll never know
when you'll get hurt again.

552
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,984
I'm well acquainted
with pain at this point.

553
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,362
Yes.

554
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,740
If you comfort yourself along the way,

555
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,243
so that you're less hurt and less sad,
time will pass.

556
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,247
Doctor, I think I need to hang up.

557
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,666
I'm getting an urgent call.

558
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,626
Is it Ji-a?

559
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,087
You're hurting me now, you know.

560
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,463
Doctor Oh.

561
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,007
I'll call you right back. Bye.

562
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,177
Hi. It's me.

563
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,390
My brother's at home right now.
So is Hong-ju.

564
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,769
Oh, really? Okay, then.

565
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,564
I'm wearing a suit right now.

566
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,982
I'm not even wearing a tie.

567
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,358
That's perfect.

568
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,318
Is it? Okay, then.

569
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,906
Hey, what does your niece like?

570
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:07,673
Why did you go and did what you did?

571
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,967
Sorry, Dong-hyeon.

572
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,889
I'm on your side,
whatever anyone else says.

573
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,618
-Sir.
-Nice to... No.

574
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,913
How are you?

575
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,624
Why are you here?

576
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,335
Oh, Ji-a?

577
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,086
-Ji-a.
-No, I...

578
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,464
I'm here to see you.

579
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,509
It's Kim Min-gyu.

580
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,929
Hi, Cho Dong-hyeon.

581
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,431
How do you know my daughter?

582
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,850
That's...

583
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,269
-A secret.
-A secret?

584
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,522
A secret.

585
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,670
Do you like dak-bokkeum-tang?

586
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,338
Yes.

587
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,298
Have some with us.

588
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,383
Okay.

589
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,125
She was cute.

590
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,379
She was just like how she is now.

591
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,688
I would want to meet you.

592
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,067
What?

593
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,487
Did your allergy go away?

594
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,282
Yes, it did.

595
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:43,120
The person you said you liked a lot
is my aunt, right?

596
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,998
Yes, it was.

597
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,375
But that's our secret.

598
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:59,762
I wasn't sure what to buy...

599
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,597
You didn't have to get me anything.

600
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,313
Wow, this is so pretty.

601
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,398
-Thank you.
-Sure.

602
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,776
This is so cute.

603
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,529
It's lovely.

604
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,878
It looks like they're on a blind date.

605
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,547
It does.

606
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,510
Mr. Kim.

607
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,178
Yes?

608
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,180
What brings you here?

609
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,600
Well...

610
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,020
I...

611
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:56,026
I don't think I can live without Mr. Cho.

612
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,611
What?

613
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:58,821
Mr. Cho.

614
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,490
I like you.

615
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,867
A lot.

616
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,499
To me, you are

617
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,962
a colleague and mentor
that I want to keep close forever.

618
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,049
Dad, you're so cool.

619
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,593
Yes, he's amazing.

620
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,388
Therefore,

621
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,350
I cannot accept your resignation.

622
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:33,313
I would like you to tear it up yourself.

623
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,153
I have one condition.

624
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,489
Sure, what is it?

625
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,450
For as long as you date my sister,

626
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,827
let's keep work apart
from our private lives.

627
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,287
I agree.

628
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,706
At work, you're my superior,

629
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,709
but once we leave work,

630
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,628
can I treat you
like my sister's boyfriend?

631
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,549
Yes, please do that.

632
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,468
Okay, Min-gyu.

633
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,145
Okay, then, Jin-bae.

634
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,540
There's really nothing to see in here.

635
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,176
SCISSORS THAT HELP YOU
CUT IN A STRAIGHT LINE.

636
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,393
HEART BALL

637
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,156
What should I do?

638
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,950
Why?

639
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,785
I like you even more.

640
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,124
-I have all this.
-What?

641
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,419
Everything you made
is in my yellow cabinet at home.

642
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,004
That's a lie.

643
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,381
Come and see for yourself.

644
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,426
The cleaning thing too?

645
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,344
Yes.

646
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,430
No way.

647
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:15,100
You were one of the five people?

648
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:19,688
Where did you get them? I barely sold any.

649
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,441
Kiss me and I'll tell.

650
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,614
Auntie!

651
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,491
Mom's acting strangely.

652
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,329
Wait, do you need anything?

653
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,413
-No.
-My wallet.

654
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,873
Mom, are you okay?

655
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,082
-Yes.
-She's okay.

656
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,626
Ask Auntie to dress you.

657
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,044
Hurry, we need a car.

658
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:42,961
Call a taxi.

659
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,254
I'll drive you.

660
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,131
Okay, your car, then.

661
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,216
Dong-hyeon, come on outside.

662
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,551
Take your time.

663
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,226
It's okay, Hong-ju.

664
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,145
It will be okay.

665
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,690
This is our second child.

666
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,567
Don't be so nervous.

667
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,614
It's okay.

668
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:14,910
Dad, look at me. I grew up pretty well.

669
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,036
You did.

670
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,413
Hold your mom's hand.

671
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,334
Take a deep breath.

672
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,212
MATERNITY WARD

673
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,396
Hong-ju's fine.

674
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,231
The baby's healthy.

675
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,194
My daughter

676
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,196
is beautiful.

677
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,865
Like a princess.

678
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:57,536
-You're a big sister now.
-Yes.

679
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,667
She looks so pretty.

680
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,336
Like an angel, right?

681
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,839
That's your sister, Dong-hyeon.

682
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,842
Welcome. It's your first day in the world.

683
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,148
2 YEARS LATER

684
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,705
We want to...

685
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,416
make connections to something

686
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,210
and want contact with people.

687
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:53,258
That's because it's human instinct,
hardwired into our DNA.

688
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:57,512
The Santa Maria Team
focused on that instinct

689
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,890
while developing our new AI robot.

690
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,559
If there were a robot

691
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,561
that could communicate
on an emotional level,

692
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,189
how would our lives change?

693
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,191
To a person

694
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,818
who is physically and emotionally drained,

695
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:16,031
what would it mean to have a robot
that comforts them

696
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,658
with emotions
that were programmed into it?

697
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:24,706
I can tell you with confidence
that it would make us more human.

698
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,835
The something that flows
from human to human.

699
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,672
If we could unravel
the secret behind emotional connections,

700
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:36,885
I was confident
we could create a revolutionary AI robot.

701
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,471
And finally,

702
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:44,601
the Santa Maria Team succeeded
in solving part of that secret.

703
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,603
We named the robot

704
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,690
after Daeyang Shipbuilding's
late Chairman Park Seong-jin.

705
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,365
Ladies and gentlemen,

706
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,911
let me introduce the robot
that will rewrite the history of androids.

707
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,217
Hello.

708
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,228
DESTINATION SOKCHO

709
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,964
MANAGING DIRECTOR CHO JIN-BAE

710
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,683
I'll leave right now.

711
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,940
Shall we proceed with this?

712
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:17,360
Yes. Do more research over the weekend,

713
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,487
and we'll meet again on Monday morning.

714
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,989
-Okay.
-Great.

715
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,577
I have to go.

716
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,755
-Let's go.
-Okay.

717
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,133
We won't be late, will we?

718
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:41,968
I think we'll be on time.

719
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,228
-The diapers
-Honey.

720
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,438
Oh, dear.

721
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,773
I woke her up.

722
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,524
You just woke up?

723
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,235
-Oh, dear.
-Pack the rest.

724
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,488
We're running late, let's hurry.

725
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,710
Honey, I'm nearly there,
I see the building right now.

726
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,379
See you soon.

727
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,678
Oh, that would be wonderful.

728
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:11,141
Oh, how about using social media
to release it to the public?

729
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,435
Since its function is based on networking,

730
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:17,605
I think it could appeal
to a lot of the social media users.

731
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,399
Sure, that's a good idea.

732
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,322
KIM MIN-GYU

733
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,080
I really...

734
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,707
missed you.

735
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,628
Congratulations on your discharge.
Well done.

736
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,798
The day actually came.

737
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,183
Aren't you hungry?

738
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,061
I'm starving.

739
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,730
Let's go. Everyone's waiting for you.

740
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:48,113
-I have so much to tell you.
-Like what?

741
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:50,698
I signed a contract
with an overseas buyer.

742
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,408
I'm so happy!

743
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:57,664
I also have this new idea
that I recently thought of.

744
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,623
It's about...

745
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,345
This is...

746
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,475
when we kiss.
