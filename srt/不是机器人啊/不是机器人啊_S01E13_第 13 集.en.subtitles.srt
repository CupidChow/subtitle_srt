1
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,231
Gosh. There she is.

2
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,882
That's...

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,801
That's...

4
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,766
That's the necklace I gave Aji 3.

5
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,646
Let me explain everything.

6
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,822
Have you been...

7
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,203
lying to me this whole time?

8
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,301
I'm going to throw up.

9
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,656
No.

10
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,166
I'm sorry. I'll explain everything.

11
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,251
Step aside.

12
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,544
Oh, no.

13
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,838
No.

14
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,481
-Put on the oxygen mask.
-Yes, sir.

15
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,733
-Monitor his pulse.
-Yes, sir.

16
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,943
Has his blood vessels expanded?

17
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,570
-Give him 0.3 ml of epinephrine.
-Okay.

18
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,447
Give him fluid at full speed.

19
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,448
Yes, sir.

20
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,028
Insomnia.

21
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,114
Generalized seizures.

22
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,534
Hallucination of thinking a human
is a robot.

23
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,746
What do you think the psychiatrists
will say about this condition?

24
00:06:55,748 --> 00:07:00,169
It is named delirium tremens
and mentally deranged.

25
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,839
I already got a doctor's diagnosis.

26
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,133
His position as a director
is not only the issue.

27
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,886
Min-gyu will also
become socially ostracized.

28
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,145
A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS,
MISTAKING A HUMAN BEING FOR A ROBOT

29
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,647
KIM MIN-GYU HID HIS RARE DISEASE
AND EMBEZZLED A LARGE SUM OF MONEY

30
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,359
I don't want to go that far...

31
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,529
if you agree to show me some appreciation.

32
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,077
WAIVER

33
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,708
Aji 3 never existed from the start.

34
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,669
You used Cho Ji-a, a human being,

35
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,964
to fool Kim Min-gyu
into thinking that it's Aji 3.

36
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:49,886
Send Aji 3 to the designated time and date
that I will notify you.

37
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,889
Then Aji 3 will be gone forever.

38
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,185
We're going to change Aji 3's face.

39
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,103
We check first and change it afterward.

40
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,272
Do not change a single thing.

41
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,578
SIGNATURE: HONG BAEK-GYUN

42
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,893
Are you okay?

43
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,210
Min-gyu!

44
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,498
Min-gyu just woke up.

45
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,672
While he was unconscious,
his condition kept going back and forth

46
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,382
for some reason, and I was worried.

47
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,843
But his condition has improved,

48
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,471
and he is able to talk to people
as long as there isn't physical contact.

49
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,891
But he still has trouble moving around,

50
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,185
and he needs to rest.

51
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,078
WRITTEN STATEMENT

52
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,462
It is a written statement and a report
from everyone involved in Aji 3's test.

53
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:15,257
It is a handwritten statement
elaborating how Santa Maria's test,

54
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,010
which was a case of fraud, started.

55
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,762
Sue everyone.

56
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,181
Yes, sir.

57
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,560
But if you sue them,
you might lose your title as the director.

58
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,357
Please read the summarized report first.

59
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,651
INCIDENT REPORT

60
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,994
A deep learning video clip?

61
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,081
What is this?

62
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,626
Why is there a video of me?

63
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,505
It appears

64
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,299
that Aji 3's deep-learning process system
that is in development

65
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,094
is extracting patterns from such videos.

66
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,055
The process will stay the same
even if Aji 3 becomes commercialized.

67
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,267
However, you can sue them
for having watched the video

68
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,060
without your consent.

69
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,314
Doctor Hong signed a document,
stating that everything was a lie,

70
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,818
in return for getting the video clip
back from Chairman Hwang.

71
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,697
He also agreed to hand over the real Aji 3
with nothing in return.

72
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,158
Has he gone mad? Why would he sign that?

73
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,617
They threatened him...

74
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,745
that they will reveal your illness
to the press, if he didn't.

75
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,082
I see.

76
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,296
So are you saying he did that for me?

77
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,342
Do you expect me to believe that?

78
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,677
It's the truth.

79
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,890
And if you decide to sue them,
this test will become public.

80
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,725
And you'll end up getting dismissed...

81
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,770
for the same reason
CEO Hwang got dismissed.

82
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,564
I don't care.

83
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,609
I want you to sue
the entire Santa Maria Team.

84
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,361
I also want you to sue that woman
who played the robot.

85
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,490
Yes, sir.

86
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,534
I'll carry on with the procedure.

87
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,129
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

88
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,592
And this is my letter of resignation.

89
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,803
I'm currently waiting to be assigned
for another position in the company.

90
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,765
I also wrote the reason
for my resignation.

91
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,727
I will finish my job
until you find my replacement.

92
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,214
On top of everything that has happened,
are you saying...

93
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,842
that woman is your little sister?

94
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,761
I am...

95
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,889
very sorry.

96
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,893
Get lost.

97
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,606
Oh, and tell everyone,

98
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,068
right now,
without delaying for one second...

99
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,320
get out of my house.

100
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,865
Yes, sir.

101
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,305
Mr. Cho.

102
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,142
Have some tea before you go.

103
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:10,784
The late Chairman Kim Myeong-hoon
liked this tea very much.

104
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,080
I offered it to Director Kim many times,

105
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,542
but he just doesn't seem to like it.

106
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,377
Thank you.

107
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,837
Please.

108
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,055
You aren't running away, are you?

109
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,556
Pardon?

110
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,935
Long ago, whenever things get
a little rough,

111
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:40,272
the late Chairman Kim Myeong-hoon
would hold me and say,

112
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,984
"It's not right to run away
when someone is suffering."

113
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,491
I told them not to.

114
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:56,413
They wanted to tell you the truth,
but I stopped them...

115
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,167
out of fear that you might suffer or die.

116
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,587
That's why they couldn't tell you.

117
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,173
So what?

118
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,843
What does that have to do with me now?

119
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,110
When...

120
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,531
was that?

121
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,286
The first day of the reset.

122
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:41,667
If they had told you the truth then,

123
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,920
what do you think would have happened?

124
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,550
Would the joy of knowing
that Aji 3 was human

125
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,012
could have outweighed
the feeling of betrayal?

126
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,766
I'm sleepy. You can go.

127
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,686
I can be alone now.

128
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,357
You must eat before you sleep.

129
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,735
I'm not hungry.

130
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,571
Sleep well.

131
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,138
Does Min-gyu want to see me?

132
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,519
What will happen to us now?

133
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:47,149
Director Kim said,

134
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,735
"Right now,

135
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,655
without any delay,

136
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,783
get out of my house."

137
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,494
That's it.

138
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,374
That's only natural.

139
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,460
Let's pack up.

140
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,172
We will take the machines and computers
after we find storage.

141
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,216
What about Aji 3?

142
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,426
We will take her.

143
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,553
We have to give her
to Chairman Hwang later.

144
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,060
Where do we stay tonight?

145
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,850
-What is it?
-Doctor.

146
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,561
What do I do now?

147
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,147
What can I do?

148
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,692
His illness got better because of me,

149
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,069
but then he got sick again because of me.

150
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,240
I'll do everything you say,
anything you want.

151
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,242
What should I do now?

152
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,661
What can I do...

153
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,081
to make him better again?

154
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,297
I have a feeling
that you have the answer, not me.

155
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,050
You created the miracle, Ji-a.

156
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,970
If you find an answer,

157
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,223
that could just be the correct one.

158
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,144
I wish I felt that way sooner.

159
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,883
HYOSEONG VILLA

160
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,385
Auntie, come eat!

161
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,473
I don't want to eat.

162
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,684
Sit down. Sit.

163
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,854
I am really not hungry.

164
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,067
I cooked for you. Eat at least a spoonful.

165
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,236
Auntie, it's really tasty.

166
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,154
I bet you'll finish it all.

167
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,156
Eat up. You too.

168
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,200
Okay, I'll eat.

169
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,306
Teach me how to cook.

170
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,727
Make them the same size.
Gently and slowly.

171
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,733
From the top to the bottom, gently.

172
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,194
Identically.

173
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,325
Slowly.

174
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,996
Oh, dear.

175
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,373
Dong-hyeon, the first aid kit.

176
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,499
Take this off.

177
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,209
Oh, no.

178
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,961
It stings.

179
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,385
Let me. Thank you.

180
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,762
Ssanip.

181
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,639
Thank you.

182
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,684
Do you have a place to stay?

183
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,355
Come here during the day.
No one comes here then anyway.

184
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,065
Neither at night.

185
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,400
Don't.

186
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,945
We're looking for a studio
or a warehouse with an office.

187
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,741
We can't go abroad once we're sued.

188
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,410
You'll be sued? By whom? Kim Min-gyu?

189
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,247
We deserve it.

190
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,500
The deeper the love, the deeper the wound.

191
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,881
I guess Min-gyu liked you people
more than I thought.

192
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,894
Do you want someone
with this illness for a son-in-law?

193
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:40,150
Leave the future of KM Financial
to Yu-cheol and Ri-el.

194
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:44,237
You and I can offer those two our support.

195
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,656
Isn't that a beautiful picture?

196
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,328
To do that,

197
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,706
you need someone to own the shares
you bought under borrowed names.

198
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,877
I'll transfer them to Ri-el
once they are married.

199
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,880
What will you do with Min-gyu?

200
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:06,718
Now that you and I are working together,
we can get rid of him whenever we need.

201
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:12,307
Of course, until then,
his illness must be kept between us.

202
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:17,604
Yu-cheol and Ri-el
should only see and hear good things.

203
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,412
Mr. Seong?

204
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,084
I brought some food.

205
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,213
You can't eat what other people cooked.

206
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,718
I cooked this with gloves and a mask on.

207
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,637
I made sure not a single hair got into it.

208
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,392
It's really clean.

209
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,259
Okay.

210
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,221
He's trying to get through.

211
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,850
I should endure it too.

212
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,196
Aren't we going to see a storage
to move in?

213
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,658
This is college.

214
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,410
I spoke with the professor.

215
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:23,498
As long as you agree,
the professor position is still available.

216
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,792
Go see the professor.

217
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,045
I made myself clear
that I won't take the job.

218
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,046
Pai.

219
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,049
I know it's hard but accept it.

220
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,469
My career is over now.

221
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,432
Santa Maria Team is finished too.

222
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,354
You are better off as a professor.

223
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:52,319
I'll recommend Hoktal and Ssanip
to positions in other labs.

224
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,573
Once I send Aji 3 to Chairman Hwang...

225
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,201
I'll wrap things up.

226
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,038
We believe you, Dr. Hong.

227
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,416
We have many ideas
that we want to develop.

228
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,045
We started from nothing and came this far.

229
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,630
We can try again.

230
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:18,094
My life was based on the belief
that I could never be wrong.

231
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,139
However, that belief is destroyed.

232
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,143
I started thinking that I could be wrong.

233
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,273
I'm afraid...

234
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,485
of everything.

235
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,571
You must get over that
to upgrade yourself.

236
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,699
Don't run away.

237
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,410
Can't you just go?

238
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,704
So that I'll feel better?

239
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,223
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING SANTA MARIA

240
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,612
Shall we go?

241
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,614
Let's go.

242
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,263
Are you out of your mind?

243
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,058
Why do you keep coming back
when I completely snub you?

244
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,394
Right.

245
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,271
The lawsuit?

246
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,608
Do you think this will make me
drop charges against you?

247
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,693
It's not that.

248
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,612
Then why do you come here?

249
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,448
Why do you come to my house
when you're not even a robot?

250
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,996
You don't understand
what you've done to me, right?

251
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,165
Do you want me to show you?

252
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,722
What's wrong?

253
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,560
Are you afraid it might be contagious?

254
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,812
Are you scared?

255
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,438
It's not that at all.

256
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,566
You weren't afraid when you were a robot.

257
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,109
Are you afraid now that you're human?

258
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,152
You know it's not that.

259
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,571
Yes, it is!

260
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,955
This is my response.

261
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,541
Piss off.

262
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,560
I'm sorry.

263
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,146
However,

264
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,441
I'm not scared of you at all.

265
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,323
Regardless of what you say to me

266
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,201
or do to me, I'll be back.

267
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,039
Tomorrow and the day after.

268
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,460
I'll come back to see you every day.

269
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,826
It's here. Come inside.

270
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:40,708
There is no central pillar here,
so you'll be able to use the space freely.

271
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,338
We can use this space for the bedroom,

272
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,006
and that space for the research lab.

273
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,217
Will you get rid of everything here?

274
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,636
If you sign the contract,
we'll get rid of them in a week.

275
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,852
Something is lacking in the x-axis.

276
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,397
More so when it comes to the y-axis.

277
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,107
But the price is

278
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,317
-very agreeable.
-Very agreeable.

279
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,460
What's wrong?

280
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,714
No, it's nothing.

281
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,554
Doctor Hong.

282
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,764
Be honest with me.

283
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,516
About what?

284
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,769
You freaked out that I might
really leave yesterday, weren't you?

285
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,397
Freaked out? What are you talking about?

286
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,028
Yes.

287
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,072
I freaked.

288
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,491
I didn't expect it,

289
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,577
but my heart dropped
at the thought of you leaving.

290
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,541
Why are you smiling like that?

291
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,085
-When did I smile?
-You just...

292
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:08,921
smiled like that.

293
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,800
-Was it weird?
-Very.

294
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,182
I wonder if Min-gyu is doing well.

295
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,060
Leave him to Ji-a.

296
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:26,939
The person who knows Min-gyu best is Ji-a.

297
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:40,328
Regardless of what you say to me...

298
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,956
or do to me, I'll be back.

299
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,378
Tomorrow and the day after.

300
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,134
I'll come back to see you every day.

301
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,020
It's cold.

302
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,341
It's warm.

303
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,219
You'll feel warmer if you come closer.

304
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,306
This is just warm enough.

305
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,601
Will she come again tomorrow?

306
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,729
Gosh.

307
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,899
Stop letting her in.

308
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,320
Is there...

309
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,866
anything you lied to me about?

310
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,995
If so, tell me right now.

311
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:49,624
How can a person get by without lying?

312
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,083
Only angels can.

313
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:54,170
Do you tell me everything?

314
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:58,174
You promised to buy me an x-ray machine
last year but you didn't.

315
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,888
Do you know the hedgehog story?

316
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,059
They felt so cold,
so they huddled together,

317
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,686
and they pricked each other.

318
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,104
So they scattered.

319
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,733
But then, they felt so cold,

320
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,486
so they decided to huddle back together.

321
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:25,117
Rather than braving the cold on their own,

322
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:30,248
they decided that being pricked
by each other was more bearable.

323
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,958
Don't you think?

324
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,612
Oh, dear. My goodness.

325
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,948
Are you okay?

326
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,199
It hurts.

327
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,911
-Are you okay, kid?
-Are you all right?

328
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,303
Tomorrow and the day after.

329
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,640
I'll come back to see you every day.

330
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,521
She...

331
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,860
lied again.

332
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,300
WRITTEN STATEMENT

333
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,772
Cho Ji-a.

334
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,690
Ji-a?

335
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:03,943
Aji?

336
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,113
You shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

337
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,330
Try one of these.

338
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,500
They are perfect snacks
when you are drinking.

339
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,210
Do I look like your friend?

340
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,588
Who told you not to use honorifics?

341
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,610
Was the owner of these Heart Balls...

342
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,572
you?

343
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,580
Did you...

344
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,917
read my statement?

345
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:30,798
You came in here to get me
to reopen the competition?

346
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,470
That's what it was about.

347
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:43,185
I wondered why the commercials popped up,

348
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:47,439
why I witnessed protests,
and got petitions about the competition.

349
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:52,027
I have a lot to tell you.

350
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,364
Will you...

351
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,700
hear me out?

352
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,076
No.

353
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:05,541
What more should I listen to
in this situation?

354
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,543
You're really...

355
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,880
You have a lot of guts.

356
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,635
How can you keep coming here after that?

357
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,555
What are you?

358
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,099
Are you really human?

359
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,145
Oh, you lack basic human decency.

360
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,523
Maybe that's why you made a great robot?

361
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,193
I'm sorry.

362
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:48,542
Shall I tell you what I did
before I read your statement?

363
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,005
I waited for you.

364
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,508
Like a fool.

365
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,970
Like a lunatic.

366
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,098
With no self-respect.

367
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,687
I hate myself for waiting for you.

368
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,817
You deceived me again.

369
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,115
I hate myself for anticipating
and worrying that you might not come.

370
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,368
How silly...

371
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,914
must you think I am?

372
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,044
You knew I would act like this
when you said it.

373
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,129
No.

374
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,758
Why didn't you just disappear as a robot?

375
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:41,512
Or if you were going to lie,
at least don't get caught.

376
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,932
You shouldn't have gotten caught ever!

377
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,186
I'm sorry.

378
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:50,938
You're sorry?

379
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:54,942
For what? What did you do?

380
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,404
For pretending to be a robot
and duping me?

381
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,323
Is that what you're sorry about?

382
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,744
You knew how I feel.

383
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,040
You felt it.

384
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,962
What did you think
while you saw and felt all that?

385
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,591
What were you thinking
as you watched me tell you

386
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,468
that I wished you were human?

387
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,180
Also, the day I reset you.

388
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,810
What a fool you must have thought I was.

389
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,021
Was it fun?

390
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,649
How much fun did the rest of you have?

391
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,611
How much did you laugh at me
for falling for it like a fool?

392
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,406
I'm sorry.

393
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,534
You ignored me on the train.

394
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:48,579
You pretended not to know me
at the restaurant too.

395
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,503
That day in the warehouse
when I showered you all those stories,

396
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,714
how did you manage to listen to that?

397
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,299
Is that possible?

398
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,051
Is that really possible?

399
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,014
How could you do that
if you knew how I felt?

400
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,349
How could you do this to me?

401
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,229
If I hadn't gone to look for you...

402
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,192
you would have stayed in hiding.

403
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,529
Why are you back here?

404
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,699
Why? Don't you have any shame?

405
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,576
Did you ever...

406
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,288
feel anything for me...

407
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,210
for even a second?

408
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,511
Why are you crying?

409
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,972
To prove that you're human?

410
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,976
That's despicable and disgusting.

411
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,437
Get lost.

412
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,566
Did you not input that?

413
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,153
Oh, you're no longer a robot.

414
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,365
Okay, I'll speak to you
like a human being,

415
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,741
so listen up.

416
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,537
Every second I spent with you...

417
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,374
terrifies me now.

418
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,835
I want to delete them all.

419
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,631
I want them all to disappear.

420
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,717
So get out!

421
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,598
Get out of my life forever!

422
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:17,496
DISCHARGE OUTLET

423
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,337
FROM MADAME X
JANG DU-SAM LOCATED

424
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,470
Do you know Jang Du-sam?

425
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,098
Yes, I do.

426
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,811
He was the driver
of late Daeyang Chairman Park Seong-jin.

427
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,731
He used to visit my lab
with Chairman Park.

428
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,694
Why do you ask?

429
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:52,739
He has something we can use
to oust Chairman Hwang.

430
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:57,577
We must get that to help Director Kim

431
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,539
as well as your team and Aji 3.

432
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:07,087
I just managed to locate Jang Du-sam.

433
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,329
These are my favorite comic books.

434
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,165
Read them when you're bored.

435
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,459
You'll lose track of time.

436
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,781
What is Ji-a's friend doing here?

437
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,950
Why do you think I came here?

438
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,036
To see your face?

439
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:23,997
That can't be.

440
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:29,711
I'm here to give and then take away
the gift of your life.

441
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:34,132
Once I leave, you will feel very upset.

442
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,719
-I guarantee that.
-I lack the patience to listen.

443
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:46,895
The Santa Maria Team comes
to my cafe often.

444
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,898
They'll find a warehouse
and then come back for their stuff.

445
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,026
Ji-a will leave for Australia soon.

446
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:54,444
I don't care.

447
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,363
I doubt it.

448
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,073
Why else would you let me in?

449
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:02,035
Now, here's the gift.

450
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,997
Ssanip cried yesterday
while talking about yuzu bread.

451
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:11,461
Hoktal said that one day,
he'll give you an upgraded Beetle.

452
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,757
Ji-a spends hours each day
cooking for you...

453
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,885
that her hands are full of cuts.

454
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,723
Soon, you'll be left out
of their memories.

455
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:26,768
The memories of the time
you spent with them

456
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,729
will only become memories of your own.

457
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:35,777
And one day,
Ji-a will meet a man other than you.

458
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,992
Why did Ji-a kiss you?

459
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:48,331
Since when did she want to tell you
she wasn't a robot?

460
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,962
How did she feel toward a man

461
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,756
who said he loved her,
knowing she's a robot?

462
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,762
Aren't the answers to all these questions
a gift of life?

463
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,600
A gift that is more precious...

464
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:12,898
because they aren't visible
and must be trusted as they are felt.

465
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:21,031
You're about to lose
those gifts forever, Min-gyu.

466
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,836
Did Ji-a go out?

467
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,923
Yes, to see her dad.

468
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,637
-Can I have some water?
-Stay for dinner.

469
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,846
-Dinner?
-Yes.

470
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:58,985
If they had told you the truth then...

471
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,947
what do you think would've happened?

472
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,159
Would the joy that Aji 3 was human...

473
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,621
have outweighed the feeling of betrayal?

474
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,425
FOR RENT

475
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,389
I must be crazy.

476
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,643
What am I doing here?

477
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,275
Here, have some fish cakes.

478
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,695
Have some delicious fish cakes.

479
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,114
Be careful. It's hot.

480
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,451
Gosh, this is nice.

481
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,788
Do you think our brother is eating well?

482
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:56,251
Soon, you'll be left out
of their memories.

483
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,004
I'm sure Min-gyu's eating well.

484
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:02,007
The memories of the time
you spent with them

485
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,260
will only become memories of your own.

486
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,307
Did they call us and tell us
to send Aji 3 over?

487
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,392
Not yet.

488
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:17,564
Hey, that's Min-gyu's car.

489
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,567
-Hold this.
-Hey.

490
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,735
Min-gyu!

491
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,613
-It's Min-gyu's car.
-My brother!

492
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,282
Brother!

493
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,371
Brother!

494
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,752
-Wait here.
-Brother!

495
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,755
-Brother.
-Brother!

496
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,548
Brother!

497
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:45,842
Brother!

498
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,601
-Tell me when you're done.
-Thank you.

00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:02,942
CHO SEONG-CHEOL

500
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,235
Dad.

501
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,197
Have you been doing well?

502
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,284
I brought you a gift.

503
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:34,557
I managed to do everything well
thanks to you.

504
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,772
The person I like...

505
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:47,028
really liked the umbrella
and the Heart Balls that I had invented.

506
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,534
But I messed up.

507
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,746
I hurt him too badly.

508
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,628
But I still miss him.

509
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,758
What am I supposed to do?

510
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,902
I SENT THE OTHER ONE TO JI-A

511
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:19,621
Tonight, a maximum of 70 stars
are expected to fall in an hour.

512
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:23,041
According to the Korea Astronomy
and Space Science Institute,

513
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,960
the Quadrans Muralis
will become visible starting tonight,

514
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:30,340
and it'll cover the entire night sky
once it hits the peak.

515
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:59,577
Is this that umbrella?

516
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,755
I didn't know I had two
of the same umbrellas.

BUSINESS IDEA: TRANSPARENT UMBRELLA

521
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,044
At some point,

522
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:56,134
I wondered if I was a useless person
in the world.

523
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,351
How did someone come up with this?

524
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,061
Was he a genius?

525
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,939
Or a craftsman?

526
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,653
I would love...

527
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:19,240
to meet the person who made this.

528
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,703
One person...

529
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:27,498
reassured me that I'm useful

530
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:31,210
and that I should never give up.

531
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,297
This is when...

532
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,133
you must kiss.

533
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,509
Stop.

534
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,553
Thank you for being honest with me,

535
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:31,098
for telling me everything
I wanted to know.

536
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:33,267
How can you leave like this?

537
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,603
How can you just abandon me like this?

538
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,188
Don't go.

539

All that is left is for you to accept it.

01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:43,027
I have one condition.
Please do this for me.

01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,530
What's going to happen after that?

542
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:46,697
I love you.

543
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:48,825
Bye, Ji-a.

544
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,369
Bye, Aji 3.
