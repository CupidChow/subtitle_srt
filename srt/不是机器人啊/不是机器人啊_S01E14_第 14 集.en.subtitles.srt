1
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:21,062
Tonight, a maximum of 70 stars
are expected to fall in an hour.

2
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,482
According to the Korea Astronomy
and Space Science Institute,

3
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,359
the Quadrans Muralis
will become visible...

4
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,694
Oh, my gosh!

5
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,446
Why did you stand up?

6
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,905
I must go to Mt. Hwangmae.

7
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,283
Are you crazy? It's late.

8
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,536
He promised to take me there
during the meteor shower.

9
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,873
-Who?
-Mon ami. My friend.

10
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,666
I think...

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,336
your friend will be with someone else.

12
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,047
With whom?

13
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,561
What do you want to say?

14
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,148
What do you want to say so badly?

15
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,025
I'll tell you.

16
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,235
I'll tell you everything.

17
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,615
I have a lot to say.

18
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,783
I don't know where to start.

19
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,951
From the beginning.

20
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,954
Start from the day you came to my house.

21
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,249
Are you...

22
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,335
hiding something else?

23
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,503
I didn't mean to hide it.

24
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,549
But I didn't get a chance to tell you.

25
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:42,263
You first met me as a human being,
not as a robot.

26
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,561
I was Cho Ji-a when we first met.

27
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,148
Cho Ji-a made Heart Balls
at the start-up support system.

28
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,025
I met her...

29
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,736
before the final evaluation?

30
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,864
I was President Cho
who bought and delivered figures.

31
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,202
You met that Ji-a before.

32
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:09,540
That's when we first met.

33
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,389
We couldn't find him.

34
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,183
He wasn't home.

35
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,188
We should have followed him
and apologized.

36
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,649
It may have been the last time.

37
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,986
Will we ever get a chance

38
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,948
to apologize to him properly
and explain everything?

39
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,410
It would be nice if we get a chance...

40
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,372
but it's up to him to decide.

41
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,999
I hope...

42
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,002
he'll meet us at least once.

43
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,463
Otherwise, I'll cry
whenever I think about him.

44
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,056
What's a tragedy when seen close
but comedy when seen from afar?

45
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,142
-Life?
-Life.

46
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,435
C'est la vie.

47
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,232
President Cho?

48
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,360
You're that President Cho?

49
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,196
No way.

50
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,576
That's impossible.
I talked to her on the phone many times.

51
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,204
I prefer to be with robots
than be around someone like you.

52
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,041
What about me?
What makes that robot better than me?

53
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,043
What is this?

54
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,461
That necklace.

55
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,171
You haven't taken it out yet.

56
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:43,217
How did you know
there's a necklace inside?

57
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:47,972
Do you...

58
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,808
remember now?

59
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,936
If you're telling me the truth,

60
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,189
didn't I share...

61
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,231
Do people...

62
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:02,361
consider it a kiss even when two people...

63
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,908
just smooch lips together?

64
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,953
I think it was pretty long.

65
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,373
Did I say all that to you?

66
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,381
Wait a minute.

67
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,051
This makes no sense.

68
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,261
When Aji 3 was delivered,

69
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,721
I was on the phone with President Cho.

70
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,307
Right, I was on the phone with you.

71
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,684
I told you to go see a doctor.

72
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,228
Aji 3 was in a box.

73
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,647
I was on the phone in the box.

74
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,691
When the box opened,
you were standing in front of me.

75
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,610
Imagined how shocked I was.

76
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:43,861
So...

77
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,571
My goodness!

78
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,120
I was sure I was caught that very moment.

79
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,080
Dr. Hong said...

80
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,416
Friend Mode will turn on.

81
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,710
And you actually believed him.

82
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,711
Then...

83
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,798
that never existed?

84
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,925
He made it up to cover for me.

85
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,969
Does that mean...

86
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,513
I'm the fool?

87
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,224
I was surprised that you believed him.

88
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,523
Goodness.

89
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,942
How did I fall for it?

90
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,863
Master, you farted.

91
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,614
I did?

92
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,657
Yes.

93
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,494
-It wasn't me.
-Then, was it me?

94
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,164
It couldn't be you.

95
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,666
What about that fart?

96
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,549
What robot in this entire world
would frame someone else for farting?

97
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,677
Hey.

98
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,055
You must have...

99
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,266
thought that...

100
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,351
I was a real dimwit.

101
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,938
Tell the truth.

102
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,733
I couldn't believe what an idiot--

103
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,569
That's enough.

104
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,906
Do you believe me now?

105
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,450
No, I don't.

106
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,120
You may be President Cho...

107
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,333
but I can't believe myself
for thinking you were a robot.

108
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,461
Sure. It's hard for me to believe too.

109
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,255
I didn't know this robot
would be so creative and smart.

110
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,134
You're the first person to call me smart--

111
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,385
That's enough.

112
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:41,437
Also, my brother didn't know
that I was doing this.

113
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,439
He isn't like that.

114
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,068
He didn't tell you
that Aji 3 looked like me

115
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,362
for my sake. I promise.

116
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,655
How can I believe that?

117
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,073
If not...

118
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,700
Thank...

119
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,707
Why would I have had my hair
down like that?

120
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,046
I continued to believe you
even after that?

121
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,259
Did you call me
to confirm that I'm an idiot?

122
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,344
You called me.

123
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,391
NICE REAL ESTATE
NICE DORMITORIES

124
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,486
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING
SANTA MARIA

125
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,948
Are you sure Jang Du-sam lives here?

126
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,367
Madame X told me that he does.

127
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,328
What? Madame X?

128
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,788
I don't know what that is either.

129
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,791
I only know he or she
is a trustworthy informant.

130
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,670
But do you think
you'll be able to convince him?

131
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,046
I need to.

132
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,716
He's our only hope.

133
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,598
Hey, Pai.

134
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,517
This place is the best
out of all the places we've seen.

135
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,644
It also has enough space for Aji 3.

136
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,898
Oh, right. We're to send her away.

137
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,984
-I'm sorry.
-Then sign the lease.

138
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,069
I trust your judgment.

139
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,995
Seon-hye, Americano, please.

140
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,080
Okay.

141
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,374
Did you find a place?

142
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,209
I already signed the lease.

143
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,464
We can move in
after we send Aji 3 to Chairman Hwang.

144
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,133
But...

145
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,719
did Aji 3 run out of battery?

146
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,804
She kept saying she had to go somewhere.

147
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,057
I got annoyed and put her on Standby Mode.

148
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,768
She'll probably get disassembled
into pieces...

149
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,437
once President Martin takes her away.

150
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,524
I hope all her parts
will end up getting used

151
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,152
for the benefit of many people.

152
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,112
I'm sorry, Aji 3.

153
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,865
Here's your Americano.

154
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,159
Thank you.

155
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,329
Let's all make a wish
during the meteor shower.

156
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,124
Who knows?
One of our wishes might come true.

157
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,804
Fine. Given what it is,
let's tell each other everything.

158
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,182
Tell me. What else did you lie about?

159
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,227
I didn't lie about anything else...

160
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,522
but I did steal something.

161
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,941
You stole something? What did you steal?

162
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,818
Don't get me wrong.
It's not what you think.

163
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,236
Are you an onion?

164
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,780
You have layer after layer.

165
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,990
I stole what you threw away.

166
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,200
What did I throw away?

167
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:46,414
You once threw away a bunch of food
from your refrigerator

168
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,166
including the hanwoo beef
that was expiring the next day.

169
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,169
And you took them?

170
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,796
They looked delicious.

171
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,384
I also took a little bit
of lettuce and alcohol.

172
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,179
My gosh.

173
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,848
Did you just laugh?

174
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,476
How did you hold in...

175
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,231
your hunger? You must've really wanted
to eat the food I cooked.

176
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,776
I got to at Geoje, remember?

177
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,823
Everything was really delicious.

178
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,204
What else is there? Hurry up and tell me.

179
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,373
There's nothing else.

180
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,376
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.

181
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,844
Are you really...

182
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,138
sure?

183
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:45,931
Yes.

184
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,729
Who's Hong-ju?

185
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,483
I have a question.

186
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,526
Yes?

187
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,695
Why...

188
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,740
aren't you angry at me?

189
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,409
I expect punches.

190
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,954
Lawyers look at things
from the perspectives

191
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,623
of both the assailant and the victim.

192
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,082
That's why I was able to understand.

193
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,460
Whereas the start was wrong,

194
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:18,547
I could see that you grew
to sincerely care for one another.

195
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,259
That makes me feel sorrier for everyone.

196
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:27,139
I felt sorry for Director Kim, my sister,
and the Santa Maria Team.

197
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,935
But do you know something?

198
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,189
You can feel the other person's sincerity

199
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,525
once that person was caught in a crisis.

200
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,069
What I'm saying is...

201
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,072
Director Kim isn't the only person

202
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,950
who has the key to resolve this issue.

203
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,577
If he were, it would be too cruel.

204
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,706
Each and every one of you
needs to take responsibility.

205
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,044
The lawsuit will get filed
with the court tomorrow.

206
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:58,921
Okay.

207
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,552
Okay. Then what did you think of me

208
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,220
when you...

209
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,556
first met me as a human being?

210
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,016
-You were a nasty jerk.
-What?

211
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,436
You took off without paying my other half,
so I misunderstood you.

212
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,481
Back then, I didn't know
about your allergy.

213
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:21,443
But of course,
I did realize that I was mistaken

214
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,028
once I saw the figure box in your house.

215
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,323
-What about after that?
-After that...

216
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,034
I thought of you as a crazy psycho.

217
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,580
I mean, I really couldn't help
but think that way.

218
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,040
You celebrated
your robot vacuum's birthday.

219
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,043
And you babbled about a rank
for every stuff.

220
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,088
It was impossible for me
to think of you as a normal person.

221
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,175
You told me to only tell you the truth.

222
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,261
Okay, fine.

223
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,679
And then?

224
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,266
But after a certain point...

225
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,729
I suddenly started to feel sorry for you.

226
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,069
I was dumbfounded
by everything you said at first.

227
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:11,118
But they all suddenly started
to sound sad.

228
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,500
So the more time I spent with you,

229
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,794
and the more I got to know you...

230
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,841
I kept feeling sad.

231
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,345
So?

232
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,180
So...

233
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,142
I started to wish for your happiness.

234
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,771
So?

235
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,483
I wanted to do everything I could...

236
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,862
in order to make you happy.

237
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,829
Your voice is small, I can't hear you.

238
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,750
Come sit next to me.

239
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,941
Tell me everything again...

240
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,527
from the start.

241
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,250
As you wished,
I canceled your engagement to Min-gyu.

242
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,961
You were so against it. I can't force you.

243
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,463
Do you mean it?

244
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,843
Min-gyu will probably have to resign
from KM Financial.

245
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,304
Then, Yu-cheol will be able to return.

246
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,226
You're better off with Yu-cheol
than Min-gyu anyway.

247
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,228
Yu-cheol?

248
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,731
Why are you suddenly mentioning him?

249
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,359
We're expecting some guests.
I want you to welcome them.

250
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,410
My goodness. Ri-el, it's been so long.

251
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,704
-Hello, Chairman Hwang.
-Don't call me that.

252
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,832
Just call me Mr. Hwang in private,
like you used to.

253
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,461
No, wait. You'll be calling me
"Father" soon.

254
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,795
Pardon?

255
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,673
Let's talk slowly over dinner.

256
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,425
-Oh, sure.
-Okay.

257
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,012
I'm sorry. Please excuse me for a moment.

258
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,273
Ri-el.

259
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,444
-Wait.
-Shut it. Don't say anything.

260
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,740
You're just as bad.

261
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,826
I didn't know.
I didn't know anything about this.

262
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,745
I can't trust you anymore.

263
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,373
I'm not even sure if you're still...

264
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,627
the Yu-cheol that I used to know.

265
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,513
Apart from feeling sorry for me...

266
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,560
has your heart ever fluttered
because of me?

267
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,731
It's really nothing.

268
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,067
There's nothing special about it.

269
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,612
Just tell me everything.

270
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,992
Everything I didn't know
while I was with you.

271
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:51,296
My heart fluttered every morning
on my way to your house.

272
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,137
When you told me that I was your treasure

273
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,973
and asked me to stay with you forever...

274
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,103
it kind of felt
like I was being proposed to.

275
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,772
And when you cut yourself

276
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,816
-cooking to protect me...
-Did you cut yourself?

277
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,235
Why are you cooking so aggressively?

278
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,613
It was like you were
my knight in shining armor.

279
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,743
You know how I saved you
when you had an allergic reaction?

280
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,495
Then...

281
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:32,337
I thought, "Gosh, I can't believe
there's a guy who smiles like this."

282
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,633
Back then...

283
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,094
weren't you scared?

284
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,307
To be honest, I was scared.

285
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,478
But I remembered something you said.

286
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,149
I hope you'll recognize me
even if I change.

287
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:54,985
Regardless

288
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,571
of what I look like.

289
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:04,203
That's when I realized how desperately...

290
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,747
you meant those words.

291
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,923
What else?

292
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,428
Each time you stroked my head...

293
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,847
I was happy and excited.

294
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,475
You know what?

295
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,603
I really didn't like it at first.

296
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,731
But then I got used to it...

297
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,193
and I missed it if you didn't.

298
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,278
What else?

299
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:44,534
That day when you got drunk

300
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,163
and said you wished I were human.

301
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,456
Fold your finger...

302
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,379
if you ever wished that the robot
was human.

303
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,923
I thought...

304
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,802
my heart would explode.

305
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,473
I felt so sorry...

306
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,059
and happy.

307
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:17,192
That's why I leaned in close to you
and said this...

308
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,035
I'm...

309
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,081
not a robot.

310
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,475
How pretty.

311
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,686
You're prettier.

312
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,960
We're...

313
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,755
a nuisance, aren't we?

314
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,507
Sorry.

315
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,885
We'll get out of your way
when we move in a few days.

316
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,098
It's fine. Feels like the cafe's bustling
with customers.

317
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,391
Did you...

318
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,853
always have curly hair?

319
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,272
Yes, it's genetic.

320
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,565
You're pretty now,

321
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,694
but you would look much nicer
with straighter hair.

322
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,822
Such a waste.

323
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,996
I heard you had many boyfriends.

324
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,623
Why don't you have one now?

325
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,667
I have a chronic disease.

326
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:43,255
At first, I grab the guy
because he shines like a star,

327
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,467
but then I look at my hand
and he's just a rock.

328
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,513
All my relationships were like that.

329
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,058
They say humans were created
from stardust.

330
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:59,020
Why look for a star outside
when there's one inside of you?

331
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,944
-Want to go out?
-Yes. Wait, what?

332
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,661
Your answer is?

333
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,079
Stars.

334
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,040
If that's what you want.

335
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,628
Ears.

336
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,797
Sleep.

337
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,599
So when you reset me...

338
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,061
I couldn't say anything to you.

339
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,649
I couldn't tell you the truth.

340
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,945
I felt terrible.

341
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:54,534
Was it...

342
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,996
very hard?

343
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,335
It was bearable.

344
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,381
I liked being able to see you.

345
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,221
I liked it that you looked at me.

346
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:21,144
I paid the price
for forgetting that I was deceiving you.

347
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,064
Back then...

348
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,567
when you followed me to Geoje...

349
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,113
I'm really sorry
I pretended not to know you.

350
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,203
When you called out to me...

351
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,213
I really thought my heart
had crumbled into pieces.

352
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,386
That night in the warehouse...

353
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:02,269
I was so worried that you would find out
and have an allergic reaction.

354
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,857
But I was so happy...

355
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,696
that I got to see your face...

356
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,908
and hear your voice.

357
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,916
I really wished time would stop.

358
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,051
I should have told you the truth then.

359
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,015
I'm really sorry.

360
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,321
I'm right here.

361
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:42,702
What I really wanted to say to you,

362
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,080
I'll say now.

363
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,248
That day,

364
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,793
the day it rained.

365
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,215
The day you held an umbrella over me.

366
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,929
-The day I kissed--
-Stop.

367
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,767
The best gift...

368
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,144
should be put aside.

369
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:10,688
I want...

370
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,651
to keep that one unopened.

371
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,545
Thank you...

372
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,713
for being honest with me,

373
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,718
for telling me everything
I wanted to know,

374
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,929
and for not making our time together...

375
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,807
a haunting remorse,

376
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:51,146
but a beautiful memory
that I can cherish forever.

377
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,066
With those memories,

378
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,360
I think I can...

379
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,906
get through...

380
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,368
the rest of my life.

381
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,501
What do you mean by that?

382
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,630
I should go back to where I belong.

383
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,467
What do you mean?

384
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,513
Perhaps I may never...

385
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,475
be able to touch you.

386
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,605
I endured it during the last 15 years.

387
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,398
I can't put you through it too.

388
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,942
So...

389
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,237
this is...

390
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,948
the end for us.

391
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:55,043
I can't watch the meteor shower with you.

392
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,753
Otherwise...

393
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,840
the memory will be emotionally unbearable.

394
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,967
So...

395
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,889
our time together...

396
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,309
is over now.

397
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,148
Goodbye...

398
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,359
Aji 3.

399
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:22,946
Goodbye...

400
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,241
Cho Ji-a.

401
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,710
How can you leave like this?

402
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,045
Stop right there.

403
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,384
The one who gave me
all the love I ever wanted...

404
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,678
was you.

405
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,514
The one I miss every day...

406
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,933
is you.

407
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,652
It's not because you need me.

408
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,990
I really need you so badly.

409
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,243
It's because...

410
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,914
you're the one...

411
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,128
I've been looking and waiting for
all my life.

412
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,506
You don't know, do you?

413
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,844
This is what I really wanted to tell you
before the reset.

414
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,224
I love you.

415
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,693
We missed the meteor shower.

416
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,112
I wanted to make a wish.

417
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,907
My wish...

418
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,494
just came true.

419
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,039
What was it?

420
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,913
I fell asleep. Gosh, I totally dozed off.

421
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,667
Nothing happened
while I was asleep, right?

422
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,878
I had a dream.

423
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,630
It was a really upsetting dream.

424
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,715
Keep sleeping.

425
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,842
Should I?

426
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,558
Is today...

427
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,727
our...

428
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,355
First day together?

429
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,861
Gosh, you're cute.

430
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,157
You're cuter.

431
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,497
REST AREA

432
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,687
Here's your Americano.

433
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,064
Thank you.

434
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,069
Are you up?

435
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,737
-Yes.
-Here.

436
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,447
Thank you.

437
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,954
Let's go.

438
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,047
Should we take another lap?

439
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,967
That was our fifth already.

440
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,677
You should go home now.

441
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,304
When are you going to come?

442
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,723
I'll call you after I take a nap.

443
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,976
I'm sad.

444
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,896
Do you want to work for me again?

445
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,441
Hurry up and go home.

446
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,067
-Bye.
-See you.

447
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,152
Okay.

448
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,159
Bye.

449
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,702
-Bye.
-Okay.

450
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:45,786
See you.

451
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,169
Bye.

452
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,379
-Go on.
-You go first.

453
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,549
-No, you go first.
-You go first.

454
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,885
Hurry up.
I'll go after I see you go inside.

455
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:01,969
Okay.

456
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,183
-Go on.
-Bye. I'm really going this time.

457
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,251
Auntie!

458
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,670
Where were you last night?

459
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,213
Mt. Hwangmae.

460
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,757
Mt. Hwangmae? Why did you go there?

461
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,051
Wasn't it cold there?

462
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,554
Not at all. It was really warm.

463
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,182
Hey, go hit your aunt.

464
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,602
Come over here.

465
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,772
You cutie pie.

466
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,378
Mr. Jang.

467
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,593
It's been a while.

468
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,346
Dr. Hong.

469
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,725
Just like you...

470
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,853
I also revered Chairman Park.

471
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:02,817
He was passionate about robots enough
to create a secret team in his company.

472
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,445
Tomorrow, when the deal
between KM Financial

473
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,115
and Martin is finalized,

474
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,658
the chairman's dream...

475
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,993
will vanish forever.

476
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,454
Please help us.

477
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:25,339
Chairman Park's death was no accident.

478
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,267
Take this money...

479
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,686
and leave the country.

480
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:44,358
You were Chairman Park's driver
for about five years.

481
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,485
Yes.

482
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,528
You...

483
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,114
did not see anything.

484
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:54,743
Me, Martin, or Santa Maria.

485
00:40:55,911 --> 00:41:00,624
Chairman Park died
in a hit-and-run accident,

486
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,918
and you almost died yourself.

487
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,671
That's all you need to remember.

488
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,840
Chairman Park's accident.

489
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,676
Was it you, Chairman Hwang?

490
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,516
Remember this.

491
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,394
You know nothing.

492
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:24,857
That's the only way
you and your family will live.

493
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,698
Did Chairman Hwang Do-won really say that?

494
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,366
Did you record it?

495
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,244
The second I give you the recording,
I might die.

496
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,331
I'm being chased right now.
Give me time to think.

497
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,545
Did you find Jang Du-sam?

498
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,840
Why? Did you think I didn't know?

499
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,967
I'll ask you point blank.

500
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,136
Chairman Park Seong-jin...

501
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,431
Did my dad kill him?

502
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,726
No.

503
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,728
Then who did?

504
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,481
When the deal closes tomorrow,
Director Kim will be dismissed.

505
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,192
No, that's not what I asked you.

506
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,028
If Min-gyu finds Jang Du-sam...

507
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,324
what will happen next?

508
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,743
CHO JIN-BAE

509
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,830
I apologize, sir.

510
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:22,831
Oh, dear.

511
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:27,294
Do you think you'll last
if you keep working like that?

512
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,046
I'm really sorry.

513
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,134
Why did you live like that, Min-gyu?

514
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,148
Is this Mr. Cho Jin-bae?

515
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,984
Yes, sir.

516
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,655
Hi there. Have you eaten?

517
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,365
Sorry?

518
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,367
Never mind.

519
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,870
Where are you right now?

520
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,999
On the way to court to file the lawsuit.

521
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,377
The lawsuit?

522
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,214
Yes, against the Santa Maria Team
and my sister Ji-a.

523
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:16,719
Oh, yes, that. Cancel that.

524
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,470
I won't sue them.

525
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,932
It's best that you do it
so you don't regret later on.

526
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,935
I won't sue them. I will not.

527
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,353
I understand.

528
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,398
Then, whom will you not sue?

529
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,610
Is it the Santa Maria Team or my sister?

530
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,404
Well, for now...

531
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,991
I can't be bothered, so cancel both.

532
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,284
Yes, sir.

533
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,744
I'll keep the paperwork.

534
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,413
Tell me if you change your mind.

535
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,625
I won't change my mind.
Just tear everything up.

536
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,377
Come to my house right now.

537
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,671
No.

538
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,884
Would you mind coming over, please?

539
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,094
Of course, sir.

540
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,222
I had something to report to you anyway.

541
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,724
Okay.

542
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,231
Gosh, what was that?

543
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,444
I've never felt
that strange feeling before.

544
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,160
I don't think the term "full recovery"
applies to you.

545
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,912
Depending on how you feel,

546
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:28,290
the symptoms can always disappear
or come back.

547
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:32,419
It might be easier if you consider it
a friend you're stuck with forever.

548
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,880
Consider my illness my friend?

549
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,966
One should learn
to soothe their chronic illnesses.

550
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,636
The problem is, now,
the medicine isn't as effective.

551
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,098
You should be careful
until a new one is developed.

552
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,391
I will.

553
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,267
If you reconciled with Ji-a,

554
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,228
will you reconcile
with the Santa Maria Team as well?

555
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,229
That's...

556
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,899
a different issue, I think.

557
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,610
You're the one who spent time with them.

558
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,737
I'm sure what you feel is the truth.

559
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,406
However,

560
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:05,160
the people I saw
were truly worried about you.

561
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,210
Please sit...

562
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,587
Mr. Cho.

563
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,133
No, thank you. I'm fine, sir.

564
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:23,053
You don't have to stand
so far away from me.

565
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,389
As long as we just don't touch.

566
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:29,184
It's fine, sir.
I feel more comfortable here.

567
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,979
Okay, you're more comfortable there.

568
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,274
I'm not.

569
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:48,036
That's not what I meant.

570
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,415
Just sit in the chair, please.

571
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,709
-Pretty please?
-Okay.

572
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,210
Then I'll sit.

573
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,135
DAILY VEGETABLE JUICE

574
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,823
You did...

575
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,784
nothing wrong at all.

576
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,287
I will not accept your resignation.

577
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,708
You did make mistakes,
but I understand why you made them.

578
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:38,837
So, please don't act
like a sinner around me.

579
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,297
That's exactly what...

580
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,425
makes me uncomfortable.

581
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,470
I...

582
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:49,848
trust and...

583
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,309
believe you.

584
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,186
Don't trust me.

585
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,397
As a civil rights lawyer,

586
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,442
I thought I could never tell
even the smallest of lies.

587
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:03,737
This job proved me wrong.

588
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,491
Everyone's capable of changing.

589
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,369
But still...

590
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,873
I will trust you
and deal with the consequences.

591
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,333
But my sister--

592
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,669
I like your sister.

593
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:22,047
I like her very much. Does that fact...

594
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,802
pose a problem with our relationship?

595
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,972
-Not right now.
-Then...

596
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,848
please proceed.

597
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,935
Martin entered this country today.

598
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,271
And the Santa Maria Team?

599
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:42,109
Once the deal is closed, they will lose
all their research on Aji 3.

600
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,821
We located Jang Du-sam, but...

601
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,365
we couldn't persuade him.

602
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:02,713
We'll be there soon.

603
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,592
We're still charging her.
We'll start packing her when you arrive.

604
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:10,012
Let's try to keep this quiet.

605
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,104
Aji 3.

606
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,733
Do you know who killed Captain Crunch?

607
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,443
A cereal killer.

608
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,531
Aji 3, you're going to a nice place.

609
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,368
You'll meet a new master and be happy.

610
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,203
Don't worry.

611
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,754
SADNESS

612
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:49,384
Today, you are telling a happy lie
for my sake.

613
00:48:56,975 --> 00:49:01,938
Once the deal is closed, they will lose
all their research on Aji 3.

614
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:05,275
WRITTEN STATEMENT

615
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:11,990
Brother,

616
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,743
Ji-a really didn't know anything.

617
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:18,705
It was all our... No, it was my fault.

618
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:23,335
Ji-a wanted to back out,
but I begged her not to.

619
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,879
It was my fault.

620
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,673
I'm sorry.

621
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,592
Mr. Kim.

622
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:33,136
I think you should come out here.

623
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,556
Something's going on in the annex!

624
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,781
Sorry. We didn't mean to come here,

625
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,033
but we had to charge Aji 3.

626
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,120
We'll move out our equipment soon, too.

627
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,080
Where's Aji 3?

628
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,251
Where is she?

629
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,129
They took her.

630
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:52,257
We meant to send her anyway.

631
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,552
How could you let her go that easily?

632
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,930
Was that all Aji 3 was to this team?

633
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,975
It wasn't easy.
It was beyond our control, it was...

634
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,937
the only way.

635
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,982
You asked your ex to pretend to be a robot
to get 50 billion won,

636
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,943
and conned me into thinking it was a test.

637
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,779
Where did those guts go?

638
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,032
You should've done everything you could.

639
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,950
I'm sorry.

640
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:22,120
Don't apologize to me, apologize to them.

641
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,789
Sorry, brother.

642
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,291
We all agreed to it.

643
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,835
I'm sorry, brother.

644
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,171
I'm really sorry.

645
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:34,090
Sorry. I really am.

646
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,427
Aren't any of you angry?

647
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:40,597
If you want to be angry at me, go ahead.

648
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,182
You know why...

649
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,643
we sent her away.

650
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,562
Do you want to gloat
that you let her go for me?

651
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,190
Let them know of my illness! I don't care.

652
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,441
Hey, Min-gyu.

653
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,861
Do you know...

654
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,532
what it's like
to have the media hound you?

655
00:51:58,824 --> 00:51:59,658
I do.

656
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,284
We do.

657
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,204
Because we've been through it.

658
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,165
It means being branded forever.

659
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,460
However loudly you speak the truth,
no one will listen.

660
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,254
The rest of your life...

661
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,007
will end up
the way the media portrays you.

662
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,092
We...

663
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,345
don't want to see your life...

664
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,014
end up like that.

665
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,569
I never asked you to do that.

666
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,641
CHO JI-A

667
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,811
KIM MIN-GYU

668
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,616
Did you sleep?

669
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,327
Yes, I just woke up.

670
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,245
You?

671
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,873
I had a lot to do.

672
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,460
Why are you laughing?

673
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,463
You really are President Cho.

674
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,133
Are you happy?

675
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,719
Yes, I'm very happy.

676
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,640
No wonder it felt so familiar
whenever I spoke with you.

677
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,892
Did it?

678
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,853
When you changed your number,
I was really upset.

679
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,022
You did it to avoid me, didn't you?

680
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:40,944
I thought I would run right over to you
if I got another call from you.

681
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:46,241
Is something wrong?

682
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,704
Shall I come over?

683
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,581
No, later, in the evening.

684
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,208
Right now...

685
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,502
I have to do something.

686
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:03,550
The team follows the leader
and the leader bears the responsibility.

687
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,470
The full burden of responsibility
rests on your shoulders.

688
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,014
I know that.

689
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,767
I know what you want me to say.

690
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,310
Then say it.

691
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,022
Only the truth.

692
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,277
Ji-a...

693
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,739
was my first love.

694
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,492
One day...

695
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,039
she left without telling me why.

696
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,667
I probably made Aji 3 look like her...

697
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,962
to find the answer.

698
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,465
Now, I found the answer.

699
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,217
I got to understand Ji-a,

700
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:50,805
and more than anything,
I know myself better.

701
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,602
With this, one chapter of my life...

702
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:57,812
has ended.

703
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,357
You two looked...

704
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:04,903
great together on Geoje.

705
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,199
I mean it.

706
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,160
You looked so sweet together

707
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:15,413
that I almost wanted
to tell you everything.

708
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,499
But I lost the chance to once again.

709
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,544
I'm sorry.

710
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:27,675
It seems crucial moments always pass by...

711
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,428
when you hesitate.

712
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,433
I won't sue you.

713
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,269
I won't let Aji 3 go,

714
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,314
and I'll stop tomorrow's deal
from happening.

715
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,400
Not because I forgave you.

716
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:48,321
It's because...

717
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,075
it's the right thing to do
for KM Financial.

718
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,722
Come in.

719
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,268
Sir, Director Kim is here.

720
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,444
You came to see me?

721
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,280
Who knew I would ever see this day?

722
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,698
Let's sit.

723
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,670
So, why are you here?

724
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:47,964
I plan...

725
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,050
to resign as director.

726
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,803
I'll make no management decisions.

727
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,181
In return,

728
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,017
-I have one condition.
-A condition?

729
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,145
Sell the Santa Maria Team to me.

730
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,314
In return for giving up KM Financial,

731
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,941
you want to own
the team that deceived you?

732
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,526
It's not a bad deal.

733
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,821
That would be when I didn't know
about your illness.

734
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,575
You're in no condition
to carry out your duties.

735
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,744
Until now...

736
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,749
despite my condition,
I earned a lot of money...

737
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,627
for this company.

738
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,462
About your illness...

739
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,173
What would happen
if the world found it out?

740
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,468
Would you still be able
to keep your position like this?

741
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,096
Please...

742
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,432
do this for me.

743
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,604
The Santa Maria Research Team...

744
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,524
will be sold to Bold Group tomorrow.

745
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:51,444
Dr. Hong already agreed to this.

746
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,989
All that is left is for you to accept it.

747
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,533
Min-gyu.

748
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:00,537
Wouldn't it be better for you
to resign voluntarily?

749
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,960
Have you gone mad?

750
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:12,757
You want the Santa Maria Team
in return for KM Financial?

751
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,385
You want them
even though they betrayed you?

752
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,972
That's because they're worth fighting for.

753
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,181
Really?

754
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,308
How are they worth it?

755
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,895
Are they worth it
because they're good at scamming people?

756
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:31,526
You always gave me such a hard time
and never forgave me...

757
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,571
for what I did to you
back when we were young.

758
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,074
But you'll risk everything
to protect those con artists?

759
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,329
Have you gone insane?

760
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,539
I'm perfectly sane.

761
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,041
As you already know,
I know how to do my math.

762
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,169
Listen to me carefully, Yu-cheol.

763
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,630
Those people...

764
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,886
gave up everything they had for me.

765
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,180
I'm sure you and your father...

766
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,268
will never understand that.

767
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,218
I won't beat around the bush.

768
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:42,305
Let's cancel your engagement to Ri-el.

769
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:45,141
I was...

770
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:47,894
careless.

771
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,104
You were very careless.

772
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:53,733
President Martin
will be signing a contract tomorrow.

773
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:58,738
I'm sure you already know
what that contract signifies.

774
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,783
We need to do everything we can
to stop this for KM Financial.

775
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,869
I'll gather the emergency board meeting.

776
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:06,954
Please help me.

777
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,625
Ri-el will be marrying to Yu-cheol soon.

778
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:12,960
That's my answer.

779
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,637
We'll start planning the wedding
for you and Yu-cheol

780
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,431
as soon as the contract
with Bold Group is signed tomorrow.

781
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,433
Dad.

782
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,852
I told you to let me go.

783
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,063
I don't want to live like this anymore.

784
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,691
You always acknowledged
Min-gyu's competence.

785
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,610
You thought of him
as a family for 15 years.

786
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,696
How can you turn your back on him
in one day?

787
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:42,657
Family? Who?

788
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:43,866
Min-gyu?

789
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:47,662
Was this always your attitude...

790
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,832
while you supported him?

791
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,753
Don't you feel sorry for him?

792
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,297
Yes, this is Reporter Park.

793
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,093
I just got the article via email.

794
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,054
This is interesting.

795
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,682
Once this goes public, it'll go viral.

796
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,809
And people will talk about it for a while.

797
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:13,438
I'll be on standby.
Tell me whenever you're ready.

798
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,981
MISTOOK A HUMAN FOR A ROBOT
MENTALLY ILL

799
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:15,898
Okay.

800
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:29,287
FROM MADAME X
[RE] RE-INVESTIGATE CHAIRMAN PARK'S HIT

801
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,994
Let's go home.

802
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,912
