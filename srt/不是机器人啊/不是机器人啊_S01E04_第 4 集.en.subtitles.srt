1
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,393
Be careful. You can do it.

2
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,310
Right.

3
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,979
Be careful.

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,817
-Yes!
-You got it.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,110
-The last one.
-One more.

6
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,237
-The last one.
-Okay, I can do it.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,321
Be careful.

8
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,075
Nice.

9
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,994
-The last card.
-The last card.

10
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,704
-If you get this...
-It's the last card.

11
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,164
-Please.
-Come on.

12
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,041
You can do it.

13
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,586
One more time.

14
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,963
You can do it, Min-gyu.

15
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,883
Oh, no!

16
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,426
It's okay, Min-gyu.

17
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,969
Look.

18
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,221
Daddy will show you something cool. Look.

19
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,515
Let's watch.

20
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,103
Watch.

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,735
-That's cool.
-Why are you hiding them?

22
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,487
-What are you doing?
-It's my secret.

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,781
-Come on. That's not fair.
-Seriously.

24
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,074
Show me.

25
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,200
Some moments

26
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,245
become memories
of the times you end up missing dearly.

27
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,414
-Give it to me.
-No.

28
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,916
No, let me do it.

29
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,045
-Give it to me.
-Let me do it.

30
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,756
I made it.

31
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,049
Here I go.

32
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,635
-Yes!
-Gosh!

33
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,386
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

34
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,723
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

35
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,435
-Happy birthday, dear Min-gyu
-Happy birthday, dear Min-gyu

36
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,855
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

37
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,526
Make a wish.

38
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,615
Happy birthday.

39
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,826
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

40
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,411
Happy birthday, Min-gyu.

41
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,372
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

42
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,502
It's so pretty.

43
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,797
-Who made it? What is it?
-It's so pretty.

44
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,758
-Yu-cheol.
-Hey!

45
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,468
Wait right there.

46
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,220
Wait until I catch you.

47
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,638
-Hey.
-Be careful.

48
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,432
-Stop it.
-Give it back to him.

49
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,934
-Goodness.
-Come here.

50
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,978
Stop it. Be careful.

51
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,604
Give it back.

52
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,816
-You'll get hurt. Be careful.
-Seriously?

53
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,025
You should give it back.

54
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,583
Some moments...

55
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,544
become beautiful memories...

56
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,130
that will never happen again.

57
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,011
-Did you have fun today?
-Yes.

58
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,472
-Shall we play a word game?
-I'll go first.

59
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,515
What?

60
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,516
Chopsticks.

61
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,559
-S?
-S?

62
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,769
-Savings account.
-Savings account?

63
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,606
-Travels.
-Travels?

64
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:15,153
S... S... Sky.

65
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,404
Sky?

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,038
And...

67
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,082
some moments...

68
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,243
Mom!

69
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,370
Mom...

70
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,748
Mr. Hwang.

71
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:13,378
My mom and dad... My mom...

72
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,174
Min-gyu, you need to be strong

73
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,176
and listen to me.

74
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,888
You are now my son.

75
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,893
Yu-cheol and I will become your family.

76
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,937
So today,

77
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,357
let's send your mom and dad off.

78
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,238
Everyone is waiting for you right now.

79
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,420
It was an accident?

80
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,213
The vice chairman is here.

81
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,137
What a pity.

82
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,937
Hello, Mr. Yoon.

83
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,523
It's okay, don't get up.

84
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,775
Stay seated.

85
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,820
It's hard, right?

86
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,117
If only I was there that day...

87
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,204
Anyway, hang in there.

88
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,122
Min-gyu.

89
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,460
These are for the logistics
for the funeral.

90
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,921
Would you sign these papers?

91
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,591
It will help your dad go more peacefully.

92
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,176
Here.

93
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,469
Okay.

94
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,678
Good boy.

95
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,184
May I go to the bathroom first?

96
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,978
Sure, go ahead.

97
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,920
DON'T SIGN ANYTHING.
DON'T ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. MADAME X

98
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,886
You won't have to worry.

99
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,513
I talked to him.

100
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,391
He'll sign the papers
without any suspicion.

101
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,727
Will he? We have to get it done
within the day.

102
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,521
Yes, sir. It will be done.

103
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,956
-I'll need your support going forward.
-We'll do our best.

104
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,000
-Mr. Kim.
-Mr. Chairman.

105
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,252
You know? Serve me well from now on.

106
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,629
-I'll stay loyal, sir.
-Thanks.

107
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,049
Directors and friends,
let's create a stronger company.

108
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,718
-Help me out.
-Yes, sir.

109
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,390
Min-gyu.

110
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,645
Won't you live with me?

111
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,022
Come and live with me.

112
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,900
You can be my younger brother.

113
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,777
No?

114
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,573
How about you be the older brother, then?

115
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,784
Sign this.

116
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:18,998
My dad says if you sign this,
we can live together.

117
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,544
My dad said we're family now.

118
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,553
FUNERAL PARLOR CONTRACT

119
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,063
CLAIM
APPLICANT: HWANG DO-WON

120
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,861
SIGNATURE

121
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,417
Cheer up, my friend.

122
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,504
No, we're family now.

123
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,470
Get off! Get away from me!

124
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,233
Did he sign it?

125
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,359
Yes.

126
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:32,029
I think something's wrong with Min-gyu.

127
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:40,288
NAME: KIM MIN-GYU
SIGNATURE: SON OF A BITCH

128
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,043
Are we going to we live with him
starting tomorrow?

129
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:53,009
I have a feeling he prefers to be alone.

130
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,461
I was curious.

131
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,553
Why did God leave me so many memories

132
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,765
that make me long
for those days so dearly?

133
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,523
The beautiful memory of the day
that was so perfect...

134
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:54,945
What is...

135
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,907
the use of any of it?

136
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,518
Memories.

137
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,398
Recollections.

138
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,821
To me, they became...

139
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,281
a prison sentence.

140
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,467
Did you have a bad dream, master?

141
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,136
Yes.

142
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,388
I had a dream

143
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,183
about evil people sticking knives
behind my back.

144
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,688
Do you feel better?

145
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,565
Me?

146
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,995
Why, you...

147
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,039
You did it.

148
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,084
You recognized me.

149
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,836
And gave me the shot, too.

150
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,839
It would be humiliating
if I couldn't recognize my own master.

151
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,550
Weren't you scared?

152
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,260
Why would a robot be scared?

153
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,762
Didn't I seem like a monster?

154
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,475
Regardless of how you look,
you'll always be my master.

155
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,186
Right. That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

156
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,939
Hey, you're way better than that dog.

157
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,485
The fact that you recognized me
is a great ability.

158
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,487
You can be proud of that.

159
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,281
It's a compliment,
but why do I feel offended?

160
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,787
My gosh, how adorable. You're so adorable.

161
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,419
So, am I getting a level up?

162
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,795
Of course.

163
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,215
You can join the Pretty squad
starting today.

164
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,716
You can't take that back, master.

165
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,426
Okay, sure.

166
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,305
Does your leg feel okay?

167
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,142
Hey.

168
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,019
I was able to put it in,

169
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,898
but it was beyond my ability
to take it out.

170
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,699
Your shoulder, too.

171
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,497
Your level up

172
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,082
is canceled.

173
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,794
It's rude to take back
what you already gave.

174
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,964
Then what about this?
Don't you think this is rude?

175
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,926
You must be highly allergic to something.

176
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,886
Wow, you can change subjects now?

177
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,263
What are you allergic to?

178
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,599
Peanuts? Shellfish? Eggs?

179
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:11,934
It's a secret.

180
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,894
Friends don't have secrets.

181
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,938
Snap out of it.

182
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,148
You're on Operation Mode right now.

183
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,527
Shall I switch to Friend Mode?

184
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,237
I think you need a friend.

185
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,573
I should ask them to open up your head

186
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,741
and check your circuitry.

187
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,910
You should go now.

188
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,579
I'm going to sleep a bit more.

189
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,372
Yes, master.

190
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,291
My gosh.

191
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,508
Master, is the top...

192
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,261
of your foot okay?

193
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,474
That one was because my hand slipped...

194
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,767
You little...

195
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,023
My goodness. I'm sorry, sir.

196
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,693
No, wait. I'm on the same level now.

197
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,781
I'm a Pretty, too.
I hope that we get along.

198
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,035
How unfriendly.

199
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,467
There's already a stain on the box.

200
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,428
I can never get this figure again.

201
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,723
But still, you ask me for money?

202
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,727
I guess I was the nasty jerk.

203
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,610
I'll smile for you. Not for anyone else.

204
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,488
I want to seem intimidating.

205
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,699
So they don't mistreat me.

206
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,409
I had a dream

207
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,871
about evil people sticking knives
behind my back.

208
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,626
He must've been backstabbed hard before.

209
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,848
He also has really bad allergies.

210
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,560
I wonder what he's allergic to.

211
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,232
It seemed like he had it all,

212
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:27,319
but I guess life isn't that easy
for him either.

213
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,324
Strip.

214
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,537
Is he a psycho pervert?

215
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,294
You went outside with Mr. Baton yesterday.
Why didn't you tell me?

216
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,380
I thought you were watching.

217
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,966
No wonder it was so quiet.

218
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,176
Did he do anything weird to you?

219
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,512
-What do you mean?
-He doesn't seem normal.

220
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,306
He's normal.
He's not like that on the inside.

221
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,226
He doesn't lie.
And he has a soft side to him.

222
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,730
Why are you suddenly taking his side?

223
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,566
He's my master.
It's natural for me to take his side.

224
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,985
-I'm your master.
-How ridiculous.

225
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,946
Please wake up. Aji 3 is right there.

226
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,366
Either way, don't follow him outside

227
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,076
from now on.

228
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,620
Don't go inside his bedroom either.

229
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,706
And why would you let him touch you?

230
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,459
Gosh, you're scolding me
for weird a reason again.

231
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,586
I thought you would scold me
for giving him an injection.

232
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,795
Yes, about that.

233
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,132
Do you think you're a paramedic?
Why would you give him an injection?

234
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,634
A severe allergic reaction
can result to death.

235
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,054
That means I should be complimented
for what I did.

236
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,348
And this is not the problem right now.

237
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,309
Yes, sir.

238
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,686
Mr. Cho is your brother?

239
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,106
-Oh, my god.
-Same here. Oh, my god.

240
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,275
If my brother caught me doing this...

241
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,278
My brother has bad lungs,
so he might really collapse.

242
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,280
Please help me not get caught.

243
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,158
I'll hack the CCTV so that we'll know
as soon as he comes.

244
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,785
My gosh, what a relief.

245
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,540
But where's Pai?

246
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,292
I need to take off my corset.

247
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,383
What's this?

248
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,012
You want us to paint?

249
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,264
-This entire wall?
-No.

250
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,934
You need to paint this side first.

251
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,646
Then you need to paint the other walls
about three coats.

252
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,773
Then it will finally become waterproof.

253
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,486
You're living here,
so think of this as your own house.

254
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,696
And please paint it well.

255
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,699
Go say something.

256
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,285
I'll leave you two to paint.

257
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,578
Sir.

258
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,914
Sir.

259
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,916
I'll be off since I'm busy.

260
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,918
Oh, I almost forgot.

261
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,130
You can leave those two
to paint the walls.

262
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,923
Meanwhile, I would like
a pretty doctor here

263
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,800
to help me with something.

264
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,801
Sorry?

265
00:18:55,884 --> 00:19:00,055
There's no power
in the storage shed over there.

266
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,141
I can't figure out why.

267
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:06,770
There are so many things to fix
because this house is so old.

268
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,607
But now that I have so many young
people living here,

269
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,319
I feel really reassured.

270
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,904
Oh, I see.

271
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,741
What did he say?

272
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,620
I feel like the gates of hell have opened.

273
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,332
We shouldn't have fixed
that X-ray scanner for him.

274
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,667
Don't you agree, Hoktal?

275
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,002
Shit.

276
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,093
Just take it off.

277
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,637
Are you kidding me?
I can't take this off by myself.

278
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,890
Want help?

279
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,728
-You better not look. Turn away.
-I'm not looking.

280
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,569
What are you doing? Look away.

281
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,987
Okay, I won't look.

282
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,864
My gosh. All I did is help you.

283
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,199
Aren't you done yet?

284
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,076
Don't get me wrong.

285
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,079
-You don't mean anything to me--
-I'll be back by dinner.

286
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,627
This place feels so empty.

287
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,548
My gosh! Holy moly.

288
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,677
How can that nasty jerk
be your brother's boss?

289
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,598
And you even saved that nasty jerk's life?

290
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,517
My gosh, do you think the universe

291
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,146
is trying to make you guys fall
for each other?

292
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,731
No.

293
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,360
That man met up
with his beautiful first love yesterday.

294
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,819
"That man"?

295
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:42,241
I thought he was
a psycho and a nasty jerk?

296
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,492
Starting today.

297
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,369
I realized that I was wrong.

298
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,080
Go hit on him.

299
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,873
You said he's a man.

300
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,668
First loves aren't meant to be anyway.

301
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,586
-But I'm a robot.
-So what?

302
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,674
If you're a robot, but still goes for him.
That's the real love.

303
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,010
A love surpassing human-object boundaries.

304
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,972
A true love that exists
beyond our physical existence.

305
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,807
Are you making fun of me?

306
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,268
By the way,

307
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,437
is your ex-boyfriend fine
with seeing you every day?

308
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,355
He's fine.

309
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,399
He says he doesn't see me
as a woman anymore.

310
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,526
Was it necessary to say that?

311
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,153
That's more suspicious.

312
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,739
That mean brat.

313
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,075
Me?

314
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,578
I'm talking about Ji-a, not you.

315
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,542
Please say the subject.
Otherwise, there will be an input error.

316
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,380
That mean brat.

317
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,133
Cho Ji-a?

318
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,093
No, I'm talking about you.

319
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,388
Whatever.

320
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,435
-Did you collect the petitions?
-Right.

321
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,106
Excluding the ones involved
in the embezzlement,

322
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,108
I got petitions
from three people in total.

323
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,276
Thank you.

324
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,778
If I win in the final round,

325
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,780
I'll pay for your insurance and more.

326
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,782
But you said the petitions won't work.

327
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,785
Well, that's what I thought.

328
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,581
But I realize he's just a bit unique.

329
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,542
He doesn't appear to be
that abnormal and weird.

330
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,421
And the action figure incident
looks like my misunderstanding.

331
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,188
Come here, Aji 3.

332
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,906
That's right.

333
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,700
She left.

334
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,871
You recover faster than before?
By how much?

335
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,165
I would say one to two hours.

336
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,918
I'm positive I recovered
much faster than usual.

337
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,213
It must be insignificant
or the symptom was subtle.

338
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,049
I could have died.

339
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,051
You didn't die.

340
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,219
Doctor!

341
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,179
I'm going to England tomorrow.

342
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,474
-I won't be readily available.
-I don't care.

343
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,685
It's different from usual.

344
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,979
Even the refreshment is.

345
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,361
NASTY JERK

346
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,904
Yes, master?

347
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,073
Are you out of your mind?

348
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:33,078
-Hello?
-I received the necklace.

349
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,412
So?

350
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,374
Remember the hammer in the photo?

351
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,000
You didn't...

352
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,754
smash the necklace with it, did you?

353
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:48,051
If you did, tell me beforehand,
so I can prepare myself.

354
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,345
I told you that I sent it.

355
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,847
-In what shape?
-In good shape.

356
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,265
How can I believe that?

357
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,600
Just trust me.

358
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,103
When someone is open about her feelings--

359
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:01,273
Why would you be open about your feelings?
I don't care about that.

360
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,233
I'm not asking for your attention.

361
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,194
Why are you getting upset?
I'm only asking for the truth.

362
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,989
I told you the truth.
I sent it in good shape.

363
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,991
How can I believe that?

364
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,492
I need some kind of guarantee.

365
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,536
Wait a minute.

366
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,789
I'm not going to believe anything
that you tell me.

367
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,084
Why am I still talking to you?

368
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,378
I'm just wasting my precious time.

369
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,005
Bye.

370
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,591
Hello? Hey!

371
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,635
You're the one who called,
you crazy psycho.

372
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,263
The crazy psycho returns.

373
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,392
I swear he's gifted
at making people lose their minds.

374
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:41,313
I was crazy to think
that you were normal for a second.

375
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,277
I'll destroy you with this tomorrow.

376
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,738
-Will it work?
-He's sick.

377
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,700
When people are sick,
they become open-minded and sensitive.

378
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,286
That's when you approach them

379
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,456
with handwritten letters
that will move the heart.

380
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,459
They'll arrive tomorrow
if I send them today.

381
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,919
Leave it to me.

382
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,755
Are you sure that Jin-bae has no idea?

383
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,757
Of course. You know him.

384
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,258
All he did is study, so he's dull.

385
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,679
It's a high technology substance

386
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,307
that is repurposed to build helmets...

387
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,476
She definitely looks like my sister.

388
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,231
It is covered by a viscoelastic...

389
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,234
Have you seen anything like it, Mr. Cho?

390
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,985
No, what is it?

391
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,320
It's a robot.

392
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,072
A robot?

393
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:35,242
She looks human, but she's a robot.

394
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,245
However capable Mr. Baton is,

395
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,538
the current chairman's son
is bound to prevail.

396
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,418
I received this video internally.

397
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,796
I don't know which deal it relates to.

398
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,799
I'm asking in case you know.

399
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,385
No, I have no idea.

400
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,936
If you find out anything about this robot,

401
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,063
please let me know.

402
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,523
Yes, sir.

403
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,192
For your information,

404
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,989
this is only between you and me.

405
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:20,495
CEO'S OFFICE

406
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,510
Are you sure you aren't rushing this?

407
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:40,473
I can't get what Min-gyu said
out of my mind.

408
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,892
Don't worry.

409
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,395
I made sure that Mr. Cho won't talk.

410
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,857
I don't think Mr. Cho knows about Aji 3.

411
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,902
I feel like he recognizes
her face, though.

412
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,488
How's the tracking going?

413
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,828
What?

414
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,874
We caught him.

415
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,838
Can you track down
the owner of the vehicle?

416
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,508
I mean, the owner of the vehicle.

417
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,639
My shoulder hurts.

418
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,392
Restricted number? Goodness.

419
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,895
I'm too busy for this.

420
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,690
The person you have reached...

421
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,734
He's not picking up, uncle.

422
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,779
They're cautious
like the geniuses they are.

423
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,449
However, we are sneaky and cunning.

424
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,876
My shoulder hurts.

425
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,674
Will they come?

426
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,760
They will definitely come.

427
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,763
Everyone comes when there's a package.

428
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,807
I know because I've waited for packages.

429
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,974
No.

430
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,143
I meant her.

431
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,397
Here they come.

432
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,283
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING
SANTA MARIA

433
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,665
Is it the part from Africa?

434
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,250
That's strange.

435
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,502
I asked them to send it
to the new address.

436
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,338
It's not the part. It's a freebie.

437
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,091
Gosh, I knew it.

438
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,885
One, two, three.

439
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,314
Follow them discreetly.

440
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:08,663
Where are they?

441
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,206
Where did they go?

442
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,626
Gosh, how did you lose them?

443
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,503
-Is that... No.
-No, it isn't.

444
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,931
My dad wants me to marry you.

445
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,895
My answer to that proposal is...

446
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,731
Why not?

447
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,072
But even if it's just a marriage
of convenience,

448
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,532
we should still go on dates.

449
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,410
Let's have at least three tryout dates.

450
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:05,094
If I confirm that I can kiss you,
I'm up for this marriage.

451
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,935
Goodness.

452
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,313
This is driving me crazy.

453
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,816
Do you need a friend now?

454
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,905
A friend? Like hell.

455
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,951
Am I not right, Pretty?

456
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,294
That's right.

457
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,881
What I need is someone to talk to,
not a friend.

458
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,802
Okay, this is exactly the reason
why I'm going.

459
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,226
My senses tell me that he is not normal.

460
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,478
Ji-a says he's normal,

461
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,522
but he has severe allergies.

462
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,234
Is that why he's a psycho pervert?

463
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,406
Should I send her tomorrow or not?

464
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,702
I can't lift my arm.

465
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,288
I can't move my neck.

466
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,583
-He wouldn't make us work again, right?
-Hey.

467
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,919
We'll become decrepit
before we get paid for this project.

468
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,171
We had good a kimchi jjigae
in return, though.

469
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,383
The three of us are too good
for being paid in kimchi jjigae.

470
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,634
We're too smart for this.

471
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,803
Take off your shirt.
I'll put on some pain relief patches.

472
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,179
-Okay.
-Okay.

473
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,641
Gosh, why are you taking that?

474
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,980
I'll do it.

475
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,817
Goodness, do as you please.

476
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,445
-We'll do it ourselves.
-Yes, that's better.

477
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,223
What are they doing inside?

478
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,896
My goodness.

479
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,066
Hoktal, can you stop moaning?

480
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,069
People may think
we're having an orgy here.

481
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,113
I'm so embarrassed to face Ji-a.

482
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,915
-You sound even weirder.
-What?

483
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,667
Gosh, it hurts.

484
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,585
Doesn't sound like
they're charging her battery.

485
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,920
They're having a blast.

486
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,547
What kind of sound is that?

487
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,094
-Stop laughing.
-Will you be okay?

488
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,887
-You might lose a screw.
-Do you need one more?

489
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,389
I can't believe

490
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,016
you're laughing like that
when your master is not around.

491
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,602
My gosh, what an unfaithful robot.

492
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,480
Don't moan together. It sounds weirder.

493
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,275
My gosh, I think we need to go to a sauna.

494
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,779
I heard swimming
helps relieve muscle pain.

495
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:10,697
-Swimming?
-Swimming?

496
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,365
Apparently, it eases the pain.

497
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,453
By the way, what's that red dot
that keeps on flashing?

498
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,978
-What's with the strange timing?
-What do you mean?

499
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:45,440
You came out
just when I was about to enter.

500
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,026
It feels as if you've been watching me.

501
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,488
I came out to buy
some pain relief patches.

502
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,449
Pain relief patches?

503
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,744
Your butler has been making
my researchers do physical labor,

504
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,829
so they're about to collapse.

505
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,290
Why don't you just hire more workers?

506
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:07,003
I don't like people hanging
around in front of me.

507
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,005
But you don't mind us hanging around
in front of you?

508
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,256
Of course not.

509
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,341
I'm only putting up with you
because of Aji 3.

510
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,512
But what brings you here
at such a late hour?

511
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,890
I need to see Aji 3.

512
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,225
I'm going to go inside. Get them all out.

513
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,269
No, you can't. She's charging right now.

514
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,063
I'm going to see her while she's charging.

515
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,440
No, you can't.
Her batteries might explode.

516
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,071
I wasn't going to say this,

517
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,616
but I already heard Aji 3 talking
a while ago.

518
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,118
How are you going to explain that?

519
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,746
Her skin sensors are broken,
so we're fixing that right now.

520
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,915
Someone touches her way too much.

521
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,250
You should refrain from doing that.

522
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,919
It's going to cost a lot to fix it.

523
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,213
That's up to me.

524
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,841
And it's up to me to decide
whether Aji 3 gets sent to you or not.

525
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,677
You can pack up if you're unhappy with me.

526
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,762
Okay, we will.

527
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,555
We'll pack right now.

528
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,723
Wait.

529
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,573
It's Mr. Baton.

530
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,867
-How do you know that?
-Be quiet.

531
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,497
We installed a tracking app
in his cell phone.

532
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,749
So whenever he moves with his cell phone,

533
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,960
that red dot will show us his location.

534
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,255
You guys are so kind.

535
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,339
I'm so touched.

536
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,970
My gosh, don't mention it.

537
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,245
-Are you sure the lights are off?
-I think he's sleeping.

538
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,621
Is that a swan?

539
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,706
No, it's a flamingo.

540
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,167
That's so embarrassing. My gosh.

541
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,044
I'm only going to swim. American style.

542
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,217
You go first?

543
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,344
-Let's jump together.
-Okay.

544
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,721
Wait. We need to warm up first.

545
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,014
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

546
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:23,931
That's enough.

547
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,783
-My gosh!
-What was that?

548
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,411
-I can't believe this.
-I just saw Mr. Baton.

549
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,914
-You lunatic!
-Mr. Baton!

550
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,333
My goodness! What was that?

551
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,543
-He's a lunatic!
-He's crazy!

552
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,338
-He's gone mad.
-He must be out of his mind.

553
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,381
-He's mentally ill.
-What a psycho.

554
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,050
-He's a psychotic jerk!
-Lose the flamingo.

555
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,232
What's bothering you?

556
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,114
Look.

557
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,908
What would you do?

558
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,701
Ji-a said he's normal.

559
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,953
How can we trust her?

560
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:30,039
I'm sure she knows more
about him than we do.

561
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,333
Are you saying
I should just send her over to him?

562
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,627
Why can't you trust Ji-a?

563
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,089
Was she not trustworthy
when you used to go out with her?

564
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,009
No, she was trustworthy.

565
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,304
Then that explains it.

566
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,015
Whether Mr. Baton is a pervert or not,

567
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,101
you still don't want to send Ji-a to him.

568
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,043
How about some chicken and beer?

569
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,465
This is chicken and beer?

570
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,426
Anchovies are like chicken,

571
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,219
and this is beer.

572
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,679
What's the big difference?

573
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,186
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

574
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,775
Eat some anchovies.

575
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,282
Eat up.

576
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,284
It's tasty.

577
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,455
It's hard to earn money, isn't it?

578
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,498
No.

579
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,917
I'm fine with...

580
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,670
whatever you do.

581
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,798
Do what you want to do for a living.

582
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,010
Hong-ju.

583
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,056
That's why you should work as a lawyer.

584
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,274
What about Ji-a?

585
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,401
Did you meet up with her?

586
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,989
She's giving me a headache.

587
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,657
She won't answer my calls.

588
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,993
It's all because she dated the wrong guy.

589
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,872
She shouldn't have dated
that strange robot-making professor guy.

590
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,917
What? Robot?

591
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,377
Professor?

592
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,878
Didn't I tell you?

593
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,798
What... What was his name?

594
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,467
Let me think.

595
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,304
-It was Hong... Hong...
-Hong Baek-gyun?

596
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,931
Yes, Hong Baek-gyun.

597
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,933
How do you know his name?

598
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,309
That son of a...

599
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,979
That wasn't meant for you.

600
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,309
Professor Hong, you have a guest.

601
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,148
Nice to meet you.

602
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,903
BECOMES COLORFUL
IF YOU WANT TO KISS SOMEONE

603
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,321
SIZE, COLOR, DESIGN

604
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,495
-You want me to make this?
-Yes.

605
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,832
You're a genius,
so I'm sure you can make it.

606
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,208
That's true.

607
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,544
But why do you want me to make this?

608
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,755
It would be really nice
to have one of these.

609
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,050
When a couple is walking together
underneath an umbrella,

610
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,846
they can see the rain by pressing a button
and making it transparent.

611
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,056
And if they suddenly want
to kiss each other,

612
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,018
they can make it opaque,
so people won't see and kiss.

613
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,188
Wouldn't people love this umbrella?

614
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,356
That may be so,

615
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,943
but wouldn't only a small number
of people want it?

616
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:33,115
Can't we make things
for just a few people?

617
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:40,206
I want to make things
that people don't know about,

618
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,790
but would love if they existed.

619
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,254
I lack the technical skill to make things,

620
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,175
so I want to borrow the brains
and the hands of smart people like you.

621
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:54,345
It would be even better
if we could make money.

622
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,473
Is it a no?

623
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,029
Look at his hair.

624
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,323
Hello.

625
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,741
Hello.

626
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,826
-Did you see that?
-Hello.

627
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,871
-What's wrong with him?
-It's hilarious.

628
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,208
That's so funny.

629
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:45,771
MASSIVE HAIR

630
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,489
HATS

631
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,991
Oh, no!

632
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,034
I hate the rain.

633
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,538
It's raining like crazy.

634
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,540
Let's run.

635
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,960
We're getting wet. Let's run.

636
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,822
I would like
to officially reintroduce myself.

637
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,908
I'm Cho Jin-bae, Ji-a's older brother.

638
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,410
I'll also officially reintroduce myself.

639
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,330
I'm Hong Baek-gyun,
Cho Ji-a's ex-boyfriend.

640
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,921
Aji 3, Friend Mode.

641
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,340
What?

642
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,093
I couldn't wait for you to come over,

643
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,427
and that's all you're going to say?

644
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,388
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

645
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,390
Are you pissed at me?

646
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,726
Why would I be pissed off?
I have no heart or soul.

647
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,228
Don't be like that.

648
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,855
I have a lot to tell and ask you.

649
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,982
You have many friends other than me.

650
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,401
No.

651
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:59,196
You're the only friend
whom I have a lot to tell and ask for.

652
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,157
Then that girl from yesterday...

653
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,577
Your first love.
What is she, if not a friend?

654
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,205
She's not a friend.

655
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,332
Really?

656
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,042
She's a woman.

657
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,212
Wait.

658
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,132
I've never dated before.

659
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,844
Why does this feel like I'm being grilled
by an old girlfriend?

660
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,053
No, more like...

661
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,597
The pattern of this conversation
feels familiar.

662
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,141
What is this?

663
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,517
That necklace.

664
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,477
You haven't taken it out yet.

665
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:35,482
How did you know
there's a necklace inside?

666
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:41,947
I... I just took a guess.

667
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:45,993
Open it.

668
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,119
Me?

669
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,496
Come on, I want to see
if it's in good condition.

670
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,469
Here, it's perfectly fine.

671
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,721
What a relief.

672
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,267
Put it on me.

673
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,229
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

674
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:28,160
At last. It's back.

675
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,789
Are you pleased that you got
your mom's keepsake back?

676
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,958
It's also my dad's.

677
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,253
On a hill,

678
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,964
one night, under a meteor shower,

679
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,469
my dad proposed to my mom
with this necklace.

680
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,431
Inside this is a meteorite.

681
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,642
A piece of a star.

682
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:58,106
It meant he wanted to become a part
of the star that she was.

683
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,653
Aji 3.

684
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,405
Show me the night sky from Mt. Hwangmae.

685
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:14,206
That's where my dad proposed.

686
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,547
You look really impressed.

687
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:25,300
At times like these,
you seem like a real person.

688
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,722
Okay, then.

689
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,392
This winter, when there's a meteor shower,

690
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,519
I'll take you there.

691
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:40,274
It will be Aji 3 with him that day,
not me.

692
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,739
Aji 3.

693
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,035
If I were to...

694
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,871
end up marrying someone,

695
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,458
I will...

696
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,003
propose with this.

697
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,607
Kim Min-gyu, you didn't come to work.

698
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,113
Hello, Yu-cheol.

699
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:31,783
No, should I call you CEO Hwang
since you're the CEO?

700
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,410
Aren't you going to start tomorrow?

701
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,623
I started a day early to see Min-gyu,
but he isn't here.

702
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,125
I always miss him at work, too.

703
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,588
Wow, the CEO's office is really nice.

704
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,298
If you like it,

705
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:50,177
I can put a desk over there,
and you can share my office.

706
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,095
Do you want to keep me that close?

707
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,514
No, it's in case you get into trouble.

708
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,808
I want to be able to keep an eye on you.

709
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,144
Your pickup lines have improved a lot.

710
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,063
Is that how you negotiate M&A deals?

711
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,148
Will you fall for my lines?

712
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,900
Okay, you just wait.

713
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,361
You're too late.

714
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,154
My dad wants me to get married.

715
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,198
Do you have a blind date?

716
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:14,201
Bring me the list.
I'll weed out the losers.

717
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,037
There's no need for that.
I've made up my mind.

718
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,082
Who do you think it is?

719
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,087
It's not...

720
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,048
Min-gyu, is it?

721
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,219
Listen carefully, Aji 3.

722
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,888
There's this friend I know,

723
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:38,975
and his first love
recently proposed to him.

724
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,477
You?

725
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,105
Not me. My friend.

726
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:46,274
But that friend of mine
has a very minor illness.

727
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,359
You?

728
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,485
Not me.

729
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,820
My friend!

730
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,406
Let's say so, then. What's the illness?

731
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,034
It's a really annoying illness.

732
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,537
One small mistake, and he could die.

733
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,664
An allergy?

734
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,962
Could he live with his first love

735
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,715
without telling her about the illness?

736
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,758
Why can't he tell her about an allergy?

737
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,261
Is it a bothersome allergy?

738
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,763
Like, no one knows the cause?

739
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,474
I'll tell you again. Listen carefully.

740
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:24,896
They can't kiss or hold hands.
Is that kind of marriage possible?

741
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,106
Okay, so...

742
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,693
You... No. Your friend

743
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,488
has an illness that is not terminal,
but it can kill him.

744
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,699
It's a really annoying illness.

745
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,993
His first love asked him to marry her,

746
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:41,913
and he's worried if he can marry her
with love alone.

747
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:42,831
Yes.

748
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,583
Why is love love?

749
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:48,044
It's love because you should be able
to jump off a cliff with her.

750
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,629
You don't understand.

751
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,715
It's not that easy.

752
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:55,677
Does your first love
still make your heart race?

753
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,554
Yes.

754
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,098
As soon as I heard she'd be coming back,

755
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,768
I was all excited and my heart tickled.

756
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,896
-Shoot.
-Why? Is that bad?

757
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:08,815
Why would it be? It's your heart.

758
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,027
-You mean--
-You were excited and ticklish.

759
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,821
What else can you do
other than to give it a go?

760
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,533
Go to that Shoot...
I mean, your first love.

761
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,244
Tell her what's bothering you
and hold her hand.

762
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,039
Didn't you hear a thing I said?

763
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,541
-We can't hold hands.
-Why not?

764
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,335
-Because of the allergy.
-So what?

765
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,712
It's an allergy to physical contact
with humans!

766
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,548
SEARCHING

767
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,677
NO MATCHING DISEASE FOUND

768
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,517
What do you take me for?

769
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,311
It says there's no such allergy.

770
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,604
Of course.

771
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:52,192
Until Galilei showed up,
everyone thought the earth was flat.

772
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,403
I'm starving.

773
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,364
Operation Mode.

774
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:04,496
The weather is like someone
is going to send you a letter, master.

775
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:14,506
Those tiny crab are delicious
deep-fried or stir-fried.

776
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:17,467
I'll deep-fry half and stir-fry the other.

777
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,972
Both cooking methods have a golden recipe.

778
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,058
Do not ruin such nice ingredients
with your arrogance,

779
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:28,186
and look up a recipe
from a famous restaurant.

780
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,271
Sure.

781
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,190
Isn't this quite a lot?

782
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,151
Wouldn't it taste better
to share with your neighbors?

783
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,486
I already did.

784
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,074
I bet they'll go crazy pretty soon.

785
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,078
What's up with Mr. Baton?

786
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,788
I don't know. I was getting hungry.

787
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,502
What are those?

788
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,795
Close it!

789
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,256
-Die! They got me!
-Close it!

790
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,970
How could you make a robot
out of your ex-girlfriend?

791
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,681
Have you no shame as a scientist?

792
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,479
How would my sister feel
if she knew about this?

793
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,190
About that...

794
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,067
I have... Crap!

795
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,945
I have nothing to say.

796
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:21,781
Crab?

797
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,534
I'll let you off
until the testing is done.

798
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,329
If you don't change Aji 3's face
afterward,

799
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,580
I'm going to sue you.

800
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,123
Okay.

801
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,927
They will have a terrible time trying
to catch them all.

802
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,639
He's such an evil scumbag.

803
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,256
They're everywhere!

804
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,050
-No!
-I stepped on one!

805
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,760
Put them in here.

806
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,428
-Don't miss the bag!
-I'm scared.

807
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,931
-I'm really sorry.
-Shoot!

808
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,768
I don't want my sister to get hurt.

809
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:35,188
Never, under any circumstance or any case,

810
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,857
let Ji-a know about this.

811
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,943
I'll do my best.

812
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,196
I have one last question.

813
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:44,990
Go ahead.

814
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,616
My wife said

815
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,452
my sister liked you a lot.

816
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,664
She talked about you all day every day.

817
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,250
She struggled after the breakup.

818
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,255
What did you do to her back then?

819
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:04,342
What did you do
that she had such a hard time?

820
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,679
As her brother, I would love to know.

821
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,682
I would love to know, too.

822
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,100
I think...

823
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,769
that's an answer
I must find going forward.

824
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,532
Are these robots, too?

825
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:42,422
The recipe you found is pretty good.

826
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:46,509
I think you would make
a good househusband.

827
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:50,847
I can't eat anyone else's food,
so I have to cook myself.

828
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:54,434
Can you really not eat at a restaurant?

829
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,727
I can't.

830
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,228
Since when?

831
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,105
I think it began...

832
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,025
about 15 years ago.

833
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:06,446
What did you eat since then?

834
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,281
Well...

835
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,911
At first, I drank milk
and ate cup noodles.

836
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,954
And instant noodles.

837
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,958
Then I tried to cook rice and porridges.

838
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,003
Then I tried soups and stews.

839
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,714
I succeeded once out of dozens of tries.

840
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:28,551
With all that practice,
I became good pretty fast.

841
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,039
You know something?

842
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,083
Taste...

843
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:01,960
is a memory.

844
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:05,547
My mom always cooked for me at home.

845
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,132
After lots of practice,

846
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,801
I'm now able to replicate most
of my mom's dishes.

847
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,428
Through my tongue's memory.

848
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,518
But...

849
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:24,274
I wasn't able to learn
what I should have from my dad.

850
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,277
Things like...

851
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,280
shaving.

852
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,630
That hurts.

853
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,678
Despite all that,

854
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,181
you grew up well.

855
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,964
Right now...

856
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,595
my heart

857
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,514
tickles again.

858
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,813
Are you thinking of your first love again?

859
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,444
Yes.

860
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,742
If only she were a robot like you.

861
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,257
Then I could touch her hair like this.

862
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,228
And hold her hand.

863
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,193
And go to places with lots of people.

864
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:39,409
And...

865
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,344
even kiss her.

866
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:03,975
I wish.

867
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,226
He finally lost his mind.

868
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:50,188
Hey, something bad happened.

869
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:53,441
I don't care about that.
It's a great opportunity.

870
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,193
You know what to do.

871
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,737
We can walk among those people.

872
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:59,989
I'll cheer you up, friend.

873
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,366
I'm cured.

874
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,159
I think I'm cured.

875
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:06,871
What do you think will happen
if he finds out I'm not a robot?

876
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:10,333
It was because you were by my side.

877
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,962
