1
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,392
Gosh, I'm so full.

2
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,227
I ate way too much.

3
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,814
-I need to go on a diet.
-You always say that.

4
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,277
Do it just like how you practiced.

5
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,696
No more, no less.

6
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,656
Do it just like how you practiced.

7
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,785
I heard that today's
young entrepreneur competition

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,121
was suggested by Mr. Baton.

9
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,540
Mr. Baton?

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,542
Kim Min-gyu?

11
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,461
The person in charge is the new head

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,421
of the Social Contribution Team
named Ye Ri-el.

13
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:50,383
He authorized it
in order to make her look good.

14
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,302
They're supposed to get married.

15
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,972
She's Director Ye Seong-tae's
only daughter.

16
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,349
But why is she marrying Mr. Baton?

17
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,561
There's also the chairman's son,
Hwang Yu-cheol.

18
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,564
I heard that the three were friends
since childhood.

19
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,068
Isn't CEO Hwang the better option
from all aspects?

20
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,445
Mr. Baton is handsome.

21
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:14,449
He's rich, and he's the most powerful
in our company.

22
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,910
What's the point?

23
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,537
He's a psycho with a crappy manner.

24
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,663
Goodness.

25
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,250
-CEO Hwang is so cool.
-Goodness.

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,795
Oh, my gosh.

27
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,885
What's wrong with her?

28
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,094
Let's go.

29
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,974
I know him.

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,144
Min-gyu is the best in every way.

31
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,981
I can't connect to the Wi-Fi.

32
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,319
I need to connect
the Heart Balls via Wi-Fi.

33
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,116
Excuse me. Do you know the Wi-Fi password?

34
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,576
Wi-Fi password?

35
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,287
It's KM123456.

36
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,414
Thank you.

37
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,958
Hold on.

38
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,926
Are you here
for the young entrepreneur competition?

39
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,178
Yes.

40
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,555
You need to go that way.

41
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,516
Thank you.

42
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,062
Thank goodness he's slow.

43
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,065
That luggage seems familiar.

44
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,777
I'll explain the rules once again.

45
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:37,115
Once you set up your items at your booth,
flea market-like,

46
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,034
the members of my team and the judges

47
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,204
will go around and take a look
at your items.

48
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,458
Please explain your items freely
and confidently

49
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,588
for each of them could give you a vote.

50
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,673
There won't be separate interviews.

51
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:57,468
We'll apply the employees' votes
and the judges' scores 50:50

52
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,512
to determine the final winner.

53
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,806
The result will be announced on Wednesday.

54
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:06,769
You may already be someone's one
and only special person.

55
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:12,150
These Heart Balls were inspired
by my father's words.

56
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,404
When you touch my Heart Ball,

57
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,657
you'll think of someone you want
to share your feelings with.

58
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,913
If you would reinstate
the final screening,

59
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,832
I would like to give you this Heart Ball.

60
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,128
Hoping that

61
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,757
your one and only
will appear in your life.

62
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,472
I'm coming to the final screening.

63
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,932
Empty out the second-floor lobby.

64
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,685
We have to postpone
the research demonstration.

65
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,270
Director Kim is on his way.

66
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,275
Could you speed up, sir?

67
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,402
I must stop Min-gyu.

68
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,987
He can't see Ji-a.

69
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,615
If she gets caught, her competition is...

70
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,162
Many of you proposed items

71
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,166
that were unique
and applicable to the current trends.

72
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:15,922
We'll be responsible
and do our best to make fair judgments.

73
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,886
And today, the CEO of KM Financial
will join us as a judge.

74
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,474
He's the one who will be giving one
of you 100 million won.

75
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,018
Please welcome him
with a round of applause.

76
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,778
FINAL SCREENING
OF NEW START-UP ITEM CONTEST

77
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:16,482
Today, one out of ten young people dreams
of entrepreneurship.

78
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,112
However, their survival rate
over five years is only 19.9%.

79
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,822
That's the reality.

80
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,824
Therefore, KM Financial

81
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,827
won't just end our support
with a mere compensation.

82
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,662
Instead, we offer constant management

83
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,956
and systematic support for your business.

84
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,002
That's how we aim to support your dream.

85
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,504
Thank you.

86
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,103
Director Kim.

87
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,487
HEART BALL
CHO JI-A

88
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,616
What is that doing there?
I'm sure that is Ji-a's.

89
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,453
Excuse me. Do you know the Wi-Fi password?

90
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,788
Then...

91
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,540
was that crazy-haired lady my sister?

92
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,251
I hope she's doing well.

93
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,630
What if she got all tensed and stutter?

94
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,425
What if every booth are being surrounded
by people except for hers...

95
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,635
No. Right?

96
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,892
Today's fortune doesn't seem
to be that great.

97
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,853
-Hello. We are Kind Wedding.
-Please take a look at this.

98
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,606
-Have a look.
-These are handmade.

99
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,816
Welcome.

100
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,319
The Skeleton Grill we invented can be used
to grill both meat and seafood.

101
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:47,990
Have you ever felt like you're all alone?

102
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,119
HEART BALL

103
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:56,290
When phone calls, texts, and emails
aren't enough to console you,

104
00:06:56,374 --> 00:07:00,586
you can... try putting your hand
on this Heart Ball. Then...

105
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,713
What's that for.

106
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,551
It seems useless.
We can use our cell phones.

107
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,719
What's that? How lame.

108
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,680
I wonder how she made it
to the final screening.

109
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,099
-She must have connections.
-I guess so.

110
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,684
What a useless piece of junk.

111
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,602
What is that, a toy?

112
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,282
You need to be louder.

113
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,993
I've seen you yell at me.
I know you can be louder.

114
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,872
Why are you sitting down?
Use your fat calves, idiot.

115
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,343
NEW START-UP ITEM CONTEST

116
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,472
You can't be here.

117
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,098
No. Why are you here?

118
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,516
Did Kim Min-gyu recognize Ji-a?

119
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,559
No.

120
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,061
She disguised with a crazy wig.

121
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,064
She did every absurd things
trying not to be recognized by me.

122
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,233
I see. I'm relieved to hear that.

123
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,652
How did you know that today
is her final screening?

124
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,655
Are you seeing her again?

125
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,325
I want to... see her again.

126
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,037
Does Ji-a know that?

127
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,873
I'm about to tell her now.
Is she doing well?

128
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,000
She's doing terribly.

129
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,925
But Ji-a has something stronger than luck.

130
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,886
Does she have the support
of someone powerful?

131
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:32,887
What does she have?

132
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,473
She has something she got from her father.

133
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,142
An inheritance that no one
can ever take away from her.

134
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,230
HEART BALL
CHO JI-A

135
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,818
How disappointing.

136
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,905
In the letter, she sounded invincible.

137
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,211
My dear daughter, my loving Ji-a.

138
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,518
I like to look at cars,

139
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,563
and you like to look at people.

140
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,191
Do I...

141
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,860
look at people?

142
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,447
Just like how Dad fixes cars,

143
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:37,994
you'll become someone
that does things that help people.

144
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,496
You definitely will.

145
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,959
I believe in you.

146
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,591
Dad.

147
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,456
Is there a person you love?

148
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,000
Is there someone
you would like to comfort?

149
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,377
Wherever on earth you may be,

150
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,632
this Heart Ball will allow you
to send your love to that somebody.

151
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,886
You can send your love
without anyone knowing.

152
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,014
This will light up
wherever on earth I may be?

153
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,140
Yes, that's right.

154
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,559
I'm going on a business trip
to the States next week.

155
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,811
If I touch this whenever I miss
my daughter--

156
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:50,191
Then your daughter's Heart Ball
will light up right away.

157
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,568
-Will it work even from Europe?
-It will work even from Africa.

158
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,279
My gosh, I would love
to send this to my son

159
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,407
who's studying in New Zealand right now.

160
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,242
He's having a hard time adjusting,

161
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,828
so he calls me every night crying,
saying that he misses me.

162
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,206
Then this will be the perfect gift.

163
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,917
Every time this Heart Ball lights up,

164
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,671
your son will know
how much you miss him right away.

165
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,131
How great is that?

166
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,633
This is incredible.

167
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,469
I really hope this becomes
an actual product.

168
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,638
I agree with you.

169
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,348
My gosh, take a look at this.

170
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,934
My gosh, this is great. Look at this.

171
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,477
-How incredible.
-This is so cool.

172
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,147
This Heart Ball allows people
to send their love to someone else.

173
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,150
-Do you just touch it?
-Yes, that's right.

174
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,112
I guess it will light up just by touch it.

175
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,781
It lets the other person know
that you miss them.

176
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,158
-This is great.
-My goodness.

177
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,829
Hey, come over here.
Take a look at this Heart Ball.

178
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,914
I'm not sure if people know,

179
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,668
but that Heart Ball was invented based
on quantum physics.

180
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,461
My sister knew that?

181
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,963
Ji-a didn't know that

182
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,090
in her head.

183
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,217
-She knew it in her heart.
-I need to buy one.

184
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,677
In a way,

185
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,887
she's more of a genius than me.

186
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,889
My sister?

187
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,016
So please don't underestimate her
from now on.

188
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,727
-When did I ever...
-I underestimated on her.

189
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,482
I never looked at that side of her.

190
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,360
That's how I wronged her four years ago.

191
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,738
You probably did the same thing.

192
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,366
Ji-a always used to say that...

193
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,911
you and I are very much alike.

194
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,248
-Incredible.
-How innovative.

195
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,459
-Good work.
-Thank you.

196
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,502
-Thank you.
-Bye.

197
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,213
-Hello, CEO Hwang.
-Yes, hello.

198
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,382
-What's your name?
-It's Mink.

199
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,050
What a coincidence.

200
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,511
You used to have a puppy named Mink.

201
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,223
-You remember that?
-Of course.

202
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,267
You cried so much when she died.

203
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,186
You couldn't come to school for days.

204
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,022
MINK

205
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,042
Ms. Ye.

206
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,251
Yes?

207
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,045
You need to come with me.

208
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,797
Okay. I'll be right back.

209
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,882
Okay.

210
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,344
Good luck.

211
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,803
-Good work.
-We'll vote for you.

212
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:25,971
Thank you.

213
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,685
You were very popular with the employees.

214
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,397
I'm sure you received many votes.

215
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,692
Oh, okay... Thank you.

216
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,903
Good luck and hang in there.

217
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,029
Okay.

218
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,698
So, this one person.

219
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,000
What if that person

220
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,462
turns into what torments you the most?

221
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,139
This will only remind you
of the pain you felt that day.

222
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,310
What are you supposed to do, then?
Do you have to...

223
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,813
just throw it away?

224
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,234
Or... do you smash it into pieces?

225
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,486
Input this.

226
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:26,949
Those two people
are your master's archenemies.

227
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,993
The worst of the worst.

228
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,995
I had a dream

229
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,498
about evil people sticking knives
behind my back.

230
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,252
"Hey.

231
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,213
Why would you stay friends
with a bastard who hurts you?

232
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,840
You can always make new friends."

233
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,303
That's what

234
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,557
my dad said to me when I was crying
after a mean bastard hurt me

235
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,392
when I was a child.

236
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,021
He said we need to flow through people,

237
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,440
meeting new ones and moving on.

238
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,233
Just like the river.

239
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,158
I like how your father thinks.

240
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,120
I would love to meet him one day
and listen to his lecture.

241
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,664
He passed away.

242
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,002
My dad passed away
when I was in high school.

243
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,463
And my mom passed away when I was two.

244
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,132
I didn't ask about that much.

245
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,426
I wanted to tell you that much.

246
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,263
You're just like...

247
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,641
someone I know.

248
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,187
When I touch this,

249
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,731
I am going to think of someone?

250
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,652
What if I don't?

251
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,362
You will.

252
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,572
You definitely will.

253
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,620
I like your confidence.

254
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,459
Take one and stand over there.

255
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,635
Farther.

256
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,013
Keep going. Farther.

257
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,145
I realized after we broke up.

258
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,147
I thought

259
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,816
I knew everything about Ji-a,

260
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,860
but in fact, I knew nothing.

261
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,112
Maybe that's why...

262
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,408
I gave Aji 3 Ji-a's face.

263
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,744
I wanted to know her.

264
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,580
I was curious.

265
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,458
I don't want

266
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,210
to repeat making this stupid mistake.

267
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,048
Now, I want to get to know her properly...

268
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,009
and see her properly.

269
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,219
Don't worry about Aji 3's face.

270
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,889
Once the testing phase is over,

271
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,682
I'll change it immediately.

272
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,686
Help me.

273
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,563
This is between you two.

274
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,067
I will only get involved
if you made her cry again.

275
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,569
I'll remember that.

276
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,280
Don't let Director Kim know about today.

277
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,200
I don't want anything that could cause

278
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,827
a misunderstanding between Kim Min-gyu
and the Santa Maria Team.

279
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,412
What do you mean?

280
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,039
Director Kim

281
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,166
is fighting all by himself

282
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,877
against Chairman Hwang and CEO Hwang

283
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,755
who are trying to sell Santa Maria Team
to the Bold Group cheaply.

284
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,724
Welcome. How much would you like?

285
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,017
Fill it up.

286
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,145
I need a credit card.

287
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,947
I'll start right away.

288
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,292
Your credit card and receipt.

289
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,503
Thank you.

290
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,508
Bye, Ji-a.

291
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,426
-Bye.
-Well done.

292
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,761
-Good job.
-Bye.

293
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,179
Bye.

294
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,766
-Good job.
-Well done.

295
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,104
Well done, Cho Ji-a.

296
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,897
I'm proud of you.

297
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,154
It's really over now.

298
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,491
With him, too.

299
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,665
Stay there.

300
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,002
-Get the dog.
-I'm allergic to a dog's fur!

301
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,879
Hey.

302
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,547
Go away!

303
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,340
Let go of me. I said, let go of me!

304
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,926
It's an allergy to physical contact
with humans!

305
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,429
...we should still go on dates.

306
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,354
If he's really allergic to humans...

307
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,746
How do you explain that?

308
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,459
Someone was cured
by finding someone he could truly trust.

309
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,046
It was because of you.

310
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,925
It was because you were by my side.

311
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,177
When I'm meeting anyone,

312
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,720
stay within my sight.

313
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,140
I can't live without you.

314
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,226
You are...

315
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,562
the most precious treasure...

316
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,439
of mine.

317
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,819
No way.

318
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,242
That's what I meant to him?

319
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,372
Is that why...

320
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,208
he called me his treasure?

321
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,368
PATIENTS MUST STAY INSIDE

322
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:37,963
Oh, dear.

323
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,424
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I am. Sorry.

324
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,301
-Thanks a lot.
-Sure.

325
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,288
Thank you...

326
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,169
for your 15 years of hard work.

327
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,883
I wondered why the numbers were so low.

328
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,677
I had hopes. But how? Why so sudden?

329
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,056
Did something happen that made you happy?

330
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,071
I called out...

331
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,033
to someone with my heart.

332
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,993
The first love that you wanted to marry?

333
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,453
You love her that much?

334
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,039
Now, you can marry her. How great is that?

335
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,957
Aji 3 did something great.

336
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,794
That's right. You can send Aji 3 away now.

337
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,337
You can meet people freely.

338
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,380
What if we were to...

339
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,383
stay together like right now?

340
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,344
That's nonsense.

341
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,388
Is it nonsense?

342
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,437
You'll get married.

343
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,564
What woman would like
a female-looking robot

344
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,233
hanging out with her husband?

345
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,734
She would freak out and run away.

346
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,488
It's because you got attached.

347
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,532
I see why.

348
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,867
It was the first time...

349
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,746
in 15 years that you had a friend.

350
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,333
You were so pleased
that a robot liked you.

351
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,462
How much happier would you be
if a human liked you?

352
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,297
Aji 3...

353
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,343
made me very happy as well.

354
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,096
That is an illusion.

355
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,642
Do you know how happy meeting
your life partner would make you?

356
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,770
Receiving unconditional love
from a complete stranger.

357
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:02,274
Not minding giving what's yours
to that stranger.

358
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,402
Watching each other grow old.

359
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,864
I really want you
to experience that happiness.

360
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,409
Only true love can give you that.

361
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,328
Do you know when you feel
that you're alive?

362
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,248
It's when you love.

363
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,877
When you touch and hug someone you love.

364
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,129
I hope with all of my heart

365
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,382
that you get to feel
how your bodies respond to that.

366
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,804
Until yesterday, you were practicing
meeting people through a robot.

367
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,558
You were boxed in,
and Aji 3 opened a door for you.

368
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,560
Now, you must come out into the world.

369
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,812
Into the world of people.

370
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,258
You don't have an appointment,
so you'll have to wait.

371
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,927
Okay, I'll wait.

372
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,179
I'll put you on the list, then.

373
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,388
Yes. Thank you.

374
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,860
What's up?

375
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,071
Is the final screening over yet?

376
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,614
It's over.

377
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,823
Where are you?

378
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,700
I stopped by somewhere.

379
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,786
Call me back when you're done.

380
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,663
I have something to tell you.

381
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:41,957
Here you go.

382
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,501
Thank you.

383
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,718
That is an illusion.

384
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,722
Until yesterday, you were practicing
meeting people through a robot.

385
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:01,351
You were boxed in,
and Aji 3 opened a door for you.

386
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,645
Now, you must come out into the world.

387
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,772
Into the world of people.

388
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,708
Help me.

389
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,335
Baek-gyun.

390
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,341
What brings you here today?

391
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,512
You came here two days ago.

392
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,556
Has her condition gotten worse?

393
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,932
No.

394
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:44,102
I didn't come here for my niece today.

395
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,771
I have more questions

396
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,025
about the allergy to human contact
that I asked about last time.

397
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,067
What's your question?

398
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,486
This is what you told me.

399
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,239
The condition might improve

400
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,742
once you find someone
you can trust and depend on.

401
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,287
What did you mean exactly?

402
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,791
Let me show you a video.

403
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,877
It will be easier to understand.

404
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,768
Johnny uploaded this video
to make others understand his condition.

405
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,313
Tilda was his nurse
who later became his girlfriend.

406
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,649
Soon after, his condition got better.

407
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,819
Tilda is the cure for Johnny.

408
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,090
For a long time,

409
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,845
he must have been so scared.

410
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,974
It took me 15 years to build that one.

411
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,396
My dad and I started building it together
when I was young.

412
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,358
I kept adding more layers until now.

413
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,235
He must have been...

414
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,239
so lonely.

415
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,540
He must have...

416
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,379
missed people so much.

417
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:41,344
We can imagine how happy he was
when he met someone like Tilda.

418
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,559
I bet Tilda was happy, too.

419
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,396
That of all people,
she could be his cure...

420
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,859
for the person she loved.

421
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,408
Doctor.

422
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,119
Is it possible...

423
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,372
for the cure...

424
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:14,043
to be something other than a human being?

425
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,296
For example,

426
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,884
can it be a doll that looks exactly
like a person?

427
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,554
Or could it be a robot?

428
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:30,226
Does that mean the robot...

429
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,395
is the cure?

430
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,065
Do you know...

431
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,693
Dr. Hong Baek-gyun?

432
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,298
Hello.

433
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,441
What are those flowers for?

434
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,734
Could they be...

435
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,487
-for me?
-Could they be?

436
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,405
No way.

437
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,491
Give them to me. I'll accept them.

438
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,952
I'm sorry, but these aren't for you.

439
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,537
You're too shy.

440
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,792
What is it?

441
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,629
Why are you smiling?

442
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,257
Aren't you very grateful to me?

443
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,843
You're so grateful that you feel shy.

444
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,263
Stop talking nonsense and get a drink.

445
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,431
-I would like the same, please.
-Okay.

446
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,432
Copycat.

447
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,102
I would like it in a bigger size.

448
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,186
Okay.

449
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,942
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

450
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,862
All right.

451
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,990
Congratulations on your full recovery,

452
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,575
Min-gyu.

453
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,455
It's Ji-a.

454
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,624
Ji-a, my dear Ji-a.

455
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,585
-How did the screening go?
-Did you do well?

456
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,879
Of course, she did. She worked so hard.

457
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,381
What's with that look?

458
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,049
Did you blow it?

459
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,470
Who are you?

460
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,186
Who are you, sir?

461
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,401
Excuse me, sir.

462
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,662
My goodness.

463
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,706
I'm asking who you are!

464
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,875
What's going on, Ji-a?

465
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:03,046
Did you know about it, too?

466
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,009
Did you all know?

467
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,386
Wait, what are you talking about?

468
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,722
What's going on here?

469
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,934
I told you to send a robot,
not a human being!

470
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,102
Do you realize what you've done?

471
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,605
You could have killed someone!

472
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,734
Where's Dr. Hong Baek-gyun?

473
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,155
PAI

474
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,416
Drink more.

475
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,419
I already did.

476
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,963
Tell me what's on your mind.

477
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,757
You told me...

478
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:53,346
to train the robot.

479
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,392
To share feelings.

480
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,812
And to input emotions.

481
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:01,813
I did.

482
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,731
When I did what you told me--

483
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,067
You're fully recovered.

484
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,612
I fell in love.

485
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,074
What was it?

486
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,371
I love...

487
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,169
Aji 3.

488
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,089
I love her.

489
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:37,015
I don't want to admit it, but I have to.

490
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,307
So tell me.

491
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,645
Did you expect this kind of result...

492
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,315
when you were planning...

493
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,737
Aji 3's deep learning process?

494
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,823
Obviously...

495
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,410
No.

496
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,664
Then...

497
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,209
what's wrong with me?

498
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,257
Come to think of it,

499
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,511
starting from a certain point,

500
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,850
I found myself waiting for Aji 3 to come.

501
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,227
When evening came,

502
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,483
I willed it to become morning,
that morning would come faster.

503
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:34,113
I loved having someone
who would listen to me.

504
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,657
Knowing that there was someone

505
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,660
watching over me and remembering me

506
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,455
thrilled me every day.

507
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:47,710
That's because you were alone for so long.

508
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,463
Because you never had a friend before.

509
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:54,217
She cured your illness,
and before you knew it,

510
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,594
you became obsessed.

511
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,721
I thought that was it too.

512
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,389
But...

513
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,270
when I'm with Aji 3,

514
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,442
I can feel that I am...

515
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,237
alive.

516
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,280
Get a grip, Kim Min-gyu.

517
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,116
Aji 3 is a robot.

518
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,826
Exactly.

519
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,870
But...

520
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,125
I think that...

521
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,544
Aji 3...

522
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,463
loves me too.

523
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,006
What kind of nonsense...

524
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,096
That can't be.

525
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:44,058
She just... She says and does
what we programmed her to.

526
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,687
What you think is love
is just a result of your input.

527
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,397
Exactly!

528
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,651
But that's what I feel,
and it's driving me crazy!

529
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,612
My head tells me that...

530
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,283
everything I feel right now...

531
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,494
is fake, an illusion.

532
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,830
But my heart says

533
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,707
all of this...

534
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,502
is true, that it's happening.

535
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,754
Do you know how crappy

536
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,840
this feels?

537
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,847
What should I do?

538
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,100
What should I do...

539
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,228
to resolve this situation?

540
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,900
Tell me.

541
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,529
You must know.

542
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,962
Bring him this way.

543
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,380
My goodness.

544
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,592
Why did he drink so much?

545
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,177
Carefully.

546
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,683
Wait, how did you carry him
on your back...

547
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,061
Please look after him.

548
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,957
Did you really send me
in there knowing he was sick?

549
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:32,875
What?

550
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:37,171
Did you send me in there knowing
that Kim Min-gyu was allergic to humans?

551
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,218
Dr. Oh came by.

552
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,847
-Ji-a.
-Oh, the 50-billion won.

553
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,726
The 50-billion won investment.
That makes sense.

554
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,645
He didn't do it for--

555
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,604
Pai, silence.

556
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,358
Why did you do that to me?

557
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,735
Ji-a, curse me instead.

558
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,904
I'm the most responsible.

559
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,741
All this happened
because I destroyed Aji 3.

560
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:09,704
No, if I hadn't texted you then...

561
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,330
They did nothing wrong.

562
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,125
It was my decision and my responsibility.

563
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,377
Why did you make that decision
on your own?

564
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,921
You should've let me decide as well.

565
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,300
Yes, he's cured now.

566
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,302
And I'm happy that I cured him.

567
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,720
But...

568
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,972
I'm so scared.

569
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,685
If he had found out...

570
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,981
He could've died because of me.

571
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,525
You didn't think about that, did you?

572
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,570
Now,

573
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,824
I can't say anything to him
to explain or make an excuse.

574
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:51,746
I can't even ask him to believe me.
Do you know what that means to me?

575
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,457
Why did you do that to me? Why?

576
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,172
Ji-a.

577
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,299
Ji-a.

578
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,345
Dr. Hong sincerely wanted Director Kim
to get better.

579
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:11,807
That's why he refused other investors
to partner with Director Kim.

580
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,518
We honestly thought

581
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,563
that we could fix Aji 3 soon
and swap her with you,

582
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,107
and that it would be okay.

583
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,318
You...

584
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,490
should have told me that exactly.

585
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:47,343
Why won't this annoying Aji 3 come out?

586
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,070
Hey, she's pretty.

587
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,530
She looks familiar.

588
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,449
-I've seen that face.
-Right?

589
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,243
I saw her somewhere.

590
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,877
-Aji 3?
-Aji 3?

591
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,632
Isn't that Aji 3?

592
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,801
It is. She got a new wig.

593
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:32,638
She can change her wig 100 times,
but she can't deceive our eagle eye.

594
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,557
-Follow discreetly.
-Okay.

595
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,232
What's going on here?

596
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,942
Did the robot run away from home?

597
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,904
Why? And to that place?

598
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,530
Who lives there?

599
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,007
KM FINANCIAL

600
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,552
PERSONNEL FILE

601
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,595
Found it. Cho Jin-bae of Investigations.

602
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:41,517
Then... this is where Cho Jin-bae lives?

603
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,228
Cho Jin-bae.

604
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,528
-I saw...
-Ji-a's back.

605
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,394
It sucks being away from home, right?

606
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,355
Sleep well and take a good rest.

607
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,109
Jin-bae.

608
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,570
What?

609
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,823
I should've listened to you back then.

610
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,954
I should've built up my resume
and tried to get a job.

611
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,498
If I had done that,

612
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,961
I wouldn't be such a mess.

613
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,758
How are you a mess? You're still young.

614
00:43:56,258 --> 00:44:01,388
Not many people know what they want to do
and dedicate their lives to it.

615
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,765
Even I didn't do that.

616
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,185
So what if I did?

617
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,606
I shot myself in the foot,

618
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,275
and my life gets worse in every turn.

619
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,117
Hang in there.

620
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,458
Do you...

621
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:33,629
really think that Aji 3 cured Min-gyu?

622
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,882
As long as he thinks she's a robot,

623
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,510
it's Aji 3 that he loves.

624
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,721
I was angry at first,

625
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,809
but thank you for curing him.

626
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,645
What about the side effect?

627
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:54,983
How are we going to help someone
who believes he is in love with a robot?

628
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,571
If the two can start over
from the beginning,

629
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,325
there might be hope.

630
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,414
Do you have the courage to tell the truth?

631
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,291
That Aji 3...

632
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,461
is actually not a robot?

633
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:25,889
Aji 3.

634
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,559
Go online with Kim Min-gyu's account.

635
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,438
Hello, Doctor.

636
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,148
Aji 3.

637
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,359
What's your relationship with Kim Min-gyu?

638
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,405
My master and I would not be embarrassed
to share embarrassing stuff.

639
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:46,535
I can be his closest of friends,
but never someone he loves.

640
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,123
I think that...

641
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,625
Aji 3...

642
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,753
loves me too.

643
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,634
Did you cut yourself?

644
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,053
Why are you cooking so aggressively?

645
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,016
This is when you must kiss.

646
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:16,106
...if you ever wished that the robot
were human.

647
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,693
I'm...

648
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,237
not a robot.

649
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,827
HONG BAEK-GYUN

650
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,596
Are you at home?

651
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:48,680
Yes.

652
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,308
Did you eat?

653
00:46:56,605 --> 00:47:00,025
Someone who almost got
another person killed has no right to eat.

654
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,361
I shouldn't have...

655
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,031
gone to you that day.

656
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,370
Don't blame yourself.

657
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,831
I was blinded by the money.

658
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:16,959
I should have...

659
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,170
told you the truth then.

660
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,715
-What do I do now?
-The Turing test.

661
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:28,554
We send in an identical-looking human
and robot in turn

662
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,514
to see which appears more human.

663
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,475
You're not deceiving anyone, but you must.

664
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,270
That's how you'll contribute greatly
to the advance of robotics.

665
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,023
I'm the crazy one
who believed it was a test.

666
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,152
I felt like something was off,

667
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,989
but I didn't think of looking into it.

668
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,491
I got carried away.

669
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,788
I stayed even though
I had the chance to leave.

670
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,166
It wasn't purely because I wanted
to help Min-gyu.

671
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,003
The new, deep learning method...

672
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:05,132
and the fact that my robot
was healing someone...

673
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,467
made me ecstatic.

674
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,346
I wanted to see the test
through to the end.

675
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,682
In the process,

676
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,561
I overlooked the possibility
that Min-gyu...

677
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:20,606
could get hurt again.

678
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,899
That's why...

679
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:28,030
I think we should be honest
before it's too late.

680
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,616
Yes.

681
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:32,868
Tomorrow,

682
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,828
we'll tell him everything.

683
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,529
Hi,

684
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,199
Aji 3.

685
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,413
I love you, master. How may I help you?

686
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,151
Did you call me, master?

687
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:52,280
I finished the list of dresses
for Ye Ri-el to wear.

688
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,577
Aji 3.

689
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,165
Seeing you...

690
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,753
is too...

691
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,132
hard for me.

692
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,427
Did I do something wrong?

693
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,143
Each time I see you,

694
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,315
I realize what it is...

695
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,152
that I can't do.

696
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:33,405
What can you not do with me?

697
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,077
I am now...

698
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:45,375
able to do anything.

699
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:48,920
That's why...

700
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,050
there's so much
I want to do with you, but...

701
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,639
I can't...

702
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,602
see you grow old.

703
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,192
I can't cook for you...

704
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,488
or hug you.

705
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,075
You haven't changed.

706
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,998
But I feel uncomfortable. I've changed.

707
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,506
My feelings have grown so great...

708
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,092
that I don't think...

709
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,431
I can handle this for the rest of my life.

710
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:46,812
You said we should be together forever.

711
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,067
I'm sorry.

712
00:51:57,113 --> 00:52:00,367
It looks like you're the one
being punished.

713
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,079
You look sad and in pain.

714
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:08,875
Your master is...

715
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,255
a hot mess, isn't he?

716
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:18,260
Regardless of your looks,
you are my master.

717
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,408
Let's go.

718
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,081
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING
SANTA MARIA

719
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,295
They're leaving.

720
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,845
That's Dr. Hong Baek-gyun.

721
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:07,100
So he picks up Aji 3
from Cho Jin-bae's home.

722
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,435
Why?

723
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,186
It got easier.

724
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,315
We just have to raid a tiny apartment.

725
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,739
He's quick. It's Mr. Yoon.

726
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:21,823
I see.

727
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,285
Mr. Yoon, I have something to report.

728
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,328
Aji 3.

729
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,746
Have you abducted it?

730
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,416
Oh, that. Not yet.

731
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,209
But we have incredible information--

732
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,253
You're worse than amateurs!

733
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,297
You're fired.

734
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:41,092
Wait, what I just saw was...

735
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:44,137
The robot comes and goes
from Cho Jin-bae's house.

736
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,514
Aji 3 is... Hello?

737
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,309
Mr. Yoon.

738
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,188
Well?

739
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,440
-We're fired.
-Set fire?

740
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,442
We're fired. Fired.

741
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,153
We're dismissed. Don't you get it?

742
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:23,051
-Hello?
-Johnny Brown died.

743
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,095
Are you listening?
You can't tell him the truth.

744
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,348
He got an allergy shock and died
because Tilda scammed him.

745
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,813
We don't know what might happen

746
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:38,483
if he finds out that everyone took part
in deceiving him.

747
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,026
So you need to stay quiet.

748
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,029
You can never run into him.

749
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,011
It looks like...

750
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,098
it's going to snow.

751
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,436
You're right.

752
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,358
I'll tell you what you need to do today.

753
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,655
Let's...

754
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,700
reset Aji 3.

755
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,555
You were upset

756
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,850
because I've scolded you so much, right?

757
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,271
I'm going to compliment you big today.

758
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,190
So listen to me carefully.

759
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,361
For the past month,

760
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,906
you were my friend,

761
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,451
my treasure,

762
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,746
and my cure.

763
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,457
You were also...

764
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,712
my door out to the real world.

765
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,468
Every minute with you...

766
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,849
was a miracle for me.

767
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,225
Thank you.

768
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,395
And...

769
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,941
I'm sorry.

770
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,658
I'm not the one who cured you.

771
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,245
Deep down in your heart,

772
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,415
you had a longing for someone special.

773
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,209
That's what cured you.

774
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,421
You...

775
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:49,924
would've become better
even if it weren't for me.

776
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:55,138
So from now on, I hope...

777
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,640
that you'll be happy...

778
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,311
and have fun, whatever you do.

779
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,486
I'm going to compliment you big as well,
so listen.

780
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,532
You...

781
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:20,163
made me realize that I'm someone valuable.

782
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,585
You were my friend.

783
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,380
You treated me like a treasure.

784
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,177
And you made me feel special.

785
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,767
Everything you did for me,

786
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,896
and what it meant...

787
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,691
I will never forget it.

788
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,197
Thank you.

789
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,369
And I'm sorry.

790
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,129
Aji 3.

791
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,550
Operation Mode.

792
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,514
How may I help you, master?

793
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,976
As of this moment,

794
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:25,979
I'm going to...

795
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,232
reset you.

796
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,902
Once you reset me,

797
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:37,240
all the memories we made together
will be deleted,

798
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,993
and they cannot be restored.

799
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,580
Will you still proceed?

800
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,752
Proceed.

801
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:56,050
Please press the button
on the back of my neck for five seconds.

802
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,345
Then the reset process will begin.

803
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,059
There's one last thing...

804
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,024
I would like to input into your system.

805
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,527
That will also...

806
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,405
be deleted soon.

807
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,063
I love you.

808
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,865
Every single moment...

809
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,827
I spent with you made me happy.

810
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,003
