1
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,272
-What?
-What?

2
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,192
No. Hold on.

3
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,945
I'm still inside!

4
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,823
Excuse me! There's someone inside!

5
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,201
Excuse me!

6
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,328
There's someone inside!

7
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,166
Excuse me!

8
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,009
My gosh, did I seriously get locked up
in this storage room with him?

9
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,802
This can't be.

10
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,557
I'll either suffocate or freeze to death
before morning comes.

11
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,189
Don't worry. We keep our guests safe.

12
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,358
I'll get us out of here no matter what.

13
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,112
If we don't, I'll lose my mind.

14
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,326
Help will come once I make a call.

15
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,535
One moment.

16
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:20,914
There's no reception.

17
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,458
Come on.

18
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,920
Come on.

19
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,923
Please work.

20
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,217
Please.

21
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,263
There's no reception.

22
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,808
Don't worry.

23
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,976
I know how to survive on the street.

24
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,812
Trust me.

25
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,868
Oh, right.

26
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:04,165
If I leave the lights on,
people will know that someone is inside.

27
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,709
Then someone will come...

28
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,344
Don't be scared.

29
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,139
I can see easily in the dark.

30
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:23,351
I won't let you stay locked up
until the next morning.

31
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,145
It's okay.

32
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,438
I'm used to being locked up.

33
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,777
I'm also used to the cold.

34
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,286
This is terrible.

35
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,414
Can it get worse than this?

36
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,376
You must have indigestion.

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,171
You ate a lot of sashimi after all.

38
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,298
That wasn't me.

39
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,924
Was it me, then?

40
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,264
It's me.

41
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,143
I skipped lunch and dinner, so...

42
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,613
The number you have dialed
is not available.

43
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,824
Ji-a isn't picking up.

44
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,868
I can't get in touch with Min-gyu's phone.

45
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,704
It's getting worse.

46
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,873
Go inside. It's cold.

47
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,500
It's okay. I'll fix it with you.

48
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,210
You'll catch a cold.

49
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,795
I'll be fine.

50
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,756
Listen to me.

51
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,466
I get distracted if you're next to me.

52
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,800
I can't do anything. Go inside.

53
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,677
It's because you're tired.

54
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,013
Get some rest in the car.

55
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,975
-We don't have time.
-A little rest won't kill you.

56
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,771
If you stay tired and drive,
you might kill us later.

57
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,441
Okay.

58
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,943
I'll go inside.

59
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:25,682
Let's find something to keep us warm
until someone comes.

60
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,477
There should be something to cover us.

61
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,354
Okay.

62
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,236
I found something.

63
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,118
These are thick, and there are a lot.

64
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,245
We won't freeze to death.

65
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,955
Wait.

66
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,668
You're saying we'll cover ourselves
with those?

67
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,962
Use the straw as mats
and the sacks as covers.

68
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,673
They make pretty decent bedding.

69
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,593
Wait for a second while I set things up.

70
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,553
Okay.

71
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,180
There.

72
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,850
Let me see.

73
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,355
Hey.

74
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,112
What are you doing? Let go, I'm fine.

75
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,573
You got a splinter.

76
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,866
I know.

77
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,951
It'll sink deeper inside.

78
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,622
What's your credit card for?

79
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,937
There.

80
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,231
It came out.

81
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,758
Are you okay?

82
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,468
Why do you ask?

83
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,516
You wanted to get back together with Ji-a.

84
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:38,231
When you found out
that Ji-a and Min-gyu love each other,

85
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,442
how did you feel?

86
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,989
When Min-gyu failed his second attempt
at deep learning Aji 3...

87
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,869
what he might have felt,
that's what I felt.

88
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,956
Now...

89
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,251
I cannot find the Ji-a I knew.

90
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,130
Whatever I said,

91
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,300
she would smile and cheer me on.

92
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,387
She's gone for good.

93
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,183
I realized why we broke up,

94
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,562
so I wanted to make up for my mistakes.

95
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,733
But Ji-a was no longer the same Ji-a.

96
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,737
And I wasn't the same either.

97
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,783
There's no going back.

98
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,537
It's irreversible.

99
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,331
That's so sad.

100
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,590
Doesn't it hurt?

101
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,758
It does.

102
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,386
It hurts.

103
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:55,433
But compared to the pain they feel...

104
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,311
it's nothing.

105
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,407
That's nice.

106
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,078
Let's rest until the song's over.

107
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,640
Climb up.

108
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,642
That's your bed for tonight.

109
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,645
What about you? There's only one.

110
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,523
I can... I will exercise.

111
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,274
I'll do jumping jacks.

112
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,402
Jumping jacks in the middle of the night?

113
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,322
Does he want me to lie beside him there?

114
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,616
And die of a heart explosion?

115
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,205
Exercising is the best way
to stay warm on a cold night.

116
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,915
I'll stay up all night.

117
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,417
You can climb up and get some sleep.

118
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,355
Hong-ju, come here.

119
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,693
There's a heater.

120
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,195
We won't freeze to death.

121
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,280
And...

122
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,662
Dried anchovies, makgeolli, and ramyeon

123
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,164
This is amazing.

124
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,085
Don't these belong to someone?

125
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,336
Can we eat these?

126
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,172
We can and then replenish the stock.

127
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,925
Then shall we just have a taste?

128
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,275
Here.

129
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:16,073
From the sound you made earlier,
we could eat everything here...

130
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,953
and it would still not be enough for you.

131
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,495
Can't you stop looking?

132
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,746
It's amazing.

133
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,165
That I look so much like her?

134
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,458
No.

135
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,711
Then what's so amazing?

136
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,424
You said you're cold, you're hungry,

137
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,344
we ate instant noodles together,
and drank rice wine.

138
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,307
Everything I wanted to hear
and see Aji 3 do,

139
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,143
you're doing it right now.

140
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,027
Of course.

141
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,196
I'm a human.

142
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,282
How old are you? I'm 28.

143
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,827
No, I'm not. I'm 29 now.

144
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,746
Same.

145
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,958
-Same?
-We're the same age.

146
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,085
Why don't we be friends?

147
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,879
No.

148
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,631
Why not?

149
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,967
Would you want to be?

150
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,888
Why don't you ask me my name?

151
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,392
I know yours, Hong-ju.

152
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,979
I don't want to know your name.

153
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,565
Kim Min-gyu.

154
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,984
Not a guest, not a "you."

155
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,277
Kim Min-gyu.

156
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,321
So...

157
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,078
If you won't drink that, I will.

158
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,163
No.

159
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,003
Why did you follow me and get locked in?

160
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,673
I like it.

161
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:39,842
Like what?

162
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,553
This situation.

163
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,680
Everything.

164
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,978
What you just said.

165
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:55,191
Your girlfriend would get
the wrong idea if she heard it.

166
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,237
I don't have a girlfriend.

167
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:05,910
Anyway...

168
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,121
this rice wine is really good.

169
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,253
What?

170
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,173
The headlights went out.

171
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,620
Is it raining?

172
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,747
Those are the waves

173
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,749
and the wind.

174
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,920
It sounds like rain.

175
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,216
Do you like the rain?

176
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,344
I have an unforgettable memory.

177
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,972
On a rainy day...

178
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,641
I had my first kiss.

179
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,857
I want to tell you about Aji 3 a bit more.

180
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,069
If it isn't too uncomfortable,

181
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,489
would you just listen to me talking?

182
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:33,539
I've never told anyone about her properly.

183
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,665
That's because...

184
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,751
the things I shared with her

185
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,547
are really hard to explain in words.

186
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,134
So it's quite hard for anyone
to actually understand.

187
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,468
But...

188
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,764
I want to talk to you about her.

189
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,313
But I won't...

190
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,107
if you don't want me to.

191
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,904
I'll let you tell me.

192
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,199
Only if you promise
to stop bothering me starting tomorrow.

193
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,914
I honestly feel uncomfortable
being around you.

194
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,169
I promise.

195
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,672
Instead, will you please
ask me questions about Aji 3?

196
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:28,135
I don't exactly know where I should start.

197
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,852
When did Aji 3...

198
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,731
start feeling special to you?

199
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,442
I can answer that precisely.

200
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,696
I felt that way starting
from the first day she came to my house.

201
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,368
You'll be laughing all night
if you listen to my story.

202
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,369
Listen.

203
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,455
She flabbergasted me right from the start.

204
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,999
The very first thing
she ever said to me was,

205
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,876
"My goodness!" And she's a robot.

206
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,711
So I asked Doctor Hong about it,

207
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,713
he said she was in Friend Mode
or something.

208
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,674
So I told him that I got it.

209
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,133
Then I prepared a question.

210
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,636
I put an egg inside a box.

211
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,138
She was supposed to solve a quiz
to open the lock.

212
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:17,184
But she suddenly punched the box
and the box broke.

213
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,853
I was so surprised
at how strong the robot was.

214
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,897
Anyway, she managed to take the egg out.

215
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,232
Oh, there's one more.

216
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,861
I slipped on a soap
with a bottle of perfume in my hand.

217
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,739
But she chose to save the bottle
instead of...

218
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:35,995
I wonder what would've happened
if she had told him the truth then.

219
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,455
My gosh.

220
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:42,292
I already told you numerous times.

221
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:47,423
If she told him the truth,
Min-gyu could've died.

222
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,259
There's a possibility
that he might not have died.

223
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,677
We can't calculate...

224
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,222
that possibility.

225
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,598
I understand.

226
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,103
Only the heart could be able
to figure that out, not the mind.

227
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,147
It's all about trust.

228
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,149
You believe with your heart.

229
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,360
I'm saying you didn't trust

230
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:13,532
that he would believe you
even if you told him the truth.

231
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,828
You thought Min-gyu's love for Ji-a

232
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,833
and for the Santa Maria Team

233
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:29,089
wasn't enough for him
to believe your confession.

234
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,385
But...

235
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,308
how are you going to prove
that you made the right call?

236
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,271
Doctors even perform surgeries on patients

237
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:49,568
who only have a 99% possibility of dying.

238
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,615
And that remaining 1%
sometimes makes miracles happen.

239
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,867
That 1%.

240
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:01,163
No, you do have a point, Seon-hye.

241
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,291
-But--
-You're right. Doctors can do that.

242
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,668
They can risk everything on that 1%.

243
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,378
But the patient's family...

244
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,256
can't.

245
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,052
Can you send your parents
into the OR if they have...

246
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,931
99% chance of dying?

247
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,644
We think of Min-gyu...

248
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,064
as our family now.

249
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,734
This guy is becoming more
and more attractive.

250
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,736
Who?

251
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,448
Me?

252
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,458
Yes, Doctor Oh.

253
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,960
Are you there yet?

254
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,088
No, not yet. Our van broke down.

255
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,339
Oh, dear.

256
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,676
Give me an update on them
as soon as you get there.

257
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,887
And if, by any chance,
Min-gyu gets rashes, open his bag.

258
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,473
There will be an injection
he carries around for an emergency.

259
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,976
That won't ever happen.

260
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,602
I hope so.

261
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,521
Seeing how Johnny died,

262
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,190
that injection might not be enough
to calm it down.

263
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,567
Please stay alert.

264
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,860
Okay.

265
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,198
Where did she go?

266
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,539
Why didn't you wake me up?

267
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,332
You were sleeping deeply.

268
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,835
You still should've woken me up.

269
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,633
-Let's go.
-Wait.

270
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,061
I'm good. Let's go.

271
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,147
It's okay.
We can go after I wipe your hand.

272
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,360
I'm sorry for not listening to you
back then.

273
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,403
But...

274
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,115
I don't regret having stayed with Min-gyu.

275
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,828
You also did your best.

276
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,539
And that's also...

277
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,210
what you can't undo. Irreversibility.

278
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,681
I...

279
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,771
ended everything by resetting Aji 3.

280
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,274
Like a moron.

281
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,820
This is the end of my story.

282
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:45,077
I don't think it's exactly the end.

283
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,038
It is the end.

284
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,082
No, what I mean is...

285
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,670
you need to tell me how you've been doing
since you reset her

286
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,546
for your story to fully end.

287
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,882
You can't just stop in the middle.

288
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,134
That story won't be any fun.

289
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,096
I'll decide myself if it's fun or not.

290
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,223
Do you really want to know?

291
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,401
At first...

292
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,737
it really hurt.

293
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,408
And it was hard to get by.

294
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,246
But after some time,

295
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,331
I became a little better.

296
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,882
And I started working at my company
like a normal person.

297
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,469
And I eat like everyone else
at the cafeteria.

298
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,305
And I go home like everyone else as well.

299
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,309
I also go to movies...

300
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,562
and bookstores by myself.

301
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,575
If...

302
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,955
Aji 3 saw how you're doing right now...

303
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,294
she would compliment you...

304
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,423
by saying, "Good job."

305
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,176
No.

306
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,513
This is...

307
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,349
what she would've said.

308
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,071
You did your best.

309
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,118
"You did your best."

310
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,967
See? I told you it will be boring.

311
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,553
No, that's not it.

312
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,141
But...

313
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,270
why did you say...

314
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,816
you were a moron for resetting her?

315
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,485
That's a secret.

316
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,280
Can you please tell me?

317
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,032
I'll tell you if you agree
to be my friend.

318
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,493
Because friends shouldn't keep secrets.

319
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,497
Do you want to be my friend?

320
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,300
By the way, you're really cute.

321
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,392
Sorry.

322
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,478
Then tell me the secret.

323
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,448
After resetting her,

324
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,909
I tried another deep learning with Aji 3.

325
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,663
I wanted who I trained...

326
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,667
to come back.

327
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,463
I said everything I said to her
when we first met.

328
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,132
I also behaved exactly the same.

329
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,845
I stayed up all night inputting things
I had input before.

330
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,224
My friend...

331
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,395
never came back.

332
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,359
Thinking back,

333
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:51,031
this is what my heart kept telling me.

334
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,494
Everything that I feel is real.

335
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,250
I was scared.

336
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,881
So I ignored that thought.

337
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,507
In the end,

338
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,261
as a consequence...

339
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,306
I was punished.

340
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,107
So now, I'm sitting here...

341
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,487
rambling in front of you.

342
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,416
After time passes...

343
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,503
will things go back to the way they were?

344
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,965
If it isn't possible now,

345
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,509
the passage of time won't matter.

346
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:58,473
Min-gyu would have to completely
believe Ji-a and what we tell him.

347
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,351
Everything depends solely on that.

348
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,772
But how could we explain
such a complicated situation?

349
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,234
Even if we explain, who would believe it?

350
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,444
Even I can't.

351
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,660
You got an offer to be a professor.

352
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,831
Sorry, I didn't mean to see the message.

353
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,251
I'm not interested.

354
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,545
Why not?
Such opportunities don't come often.

355
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,463
I'm happy where I am now.

356
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,426
I hope that you'll take the offer.

357
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,679
-It'll be good for your future--
-Once it's time to leave,

358
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,848
I'll leave quietly,
so that you won't notice.

359
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,477
Please concentrate on driving for now.

360
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,105
You're so stubborn.

361
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,237
It's dawn.

362
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,327
Time flies.

363
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,750
I talked too much about me.

364
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,960
Tell me about yourself.

365
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,467
May I ask you a question?

366
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:17,927
Tell me about your family.

367
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:24,517
I have a brother, a sister-in-law,
a niece and me.

368
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,687
They'll have another child soon.

369
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,357
Do you live off of your brother?

370
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,610
Sorry.

371
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,865
I'm not careful with my words sometimes.

372
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,911
Right, old habits never die.

373
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,829
Pardon me?

374
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,957
What's your next question?

375
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,963
Who do you miss the most right now?

376
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,637
My ideal man and a lifelong mentor.

377
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,721
Who is it?

378
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,100
It's my late father.

379
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,814
When I was young, my dad ran a garage.

380
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,193
I played in the garage after school.

381
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,406
When broken and damaged cars came in,

382
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,367
he fixed them and made them shiny.

383
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,160
Made them run once again.

384
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:30,250
Dad could fix anything that was wrong
with a car.

385
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,252
It was like magic.

386
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,551
I wanted to be like my dad.

387
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,637
Only with what I'm good at.

388
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,392
I see.

389
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,978
I can picture it clearly.

390
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,482
But what you hope for and your talents
are always different.

391
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,653
It feels like everyone else is lucky
but you.

392
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,364
At some point,

393
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:07,036
I wondered if I was a useless person
in the world.

394
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,713
How did someone come up with this?

395
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,465
Was he a genius?

396
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,342
Or a craftsman?

397
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,973
I would love...

398
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,727
to meet the person who made this.

399
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,023
One person...

400
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,693
reassured me that I'm useful

401
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,572
and that I should never give up.

402
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,286
I don't know who it was,

403
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,123
but if he heard what you said,
he should be proud.

404
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,293
Do you think so?

405
00:29:56,169 --> 00:30:02,467
The fact that you were important
to someone is encouraging.

406
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,179
I see.

407
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,767
When you see him next time,

408
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,728
you should tell him that.

409
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,024
I will.

410
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,410
Mr. Kim Min-gyu.

411
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,456
Now...

412
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,668
you told me enough about you.

413
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,880
I listened to you enough.

414
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,092
As you promised,

415
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:50,056
go back to Seoul without regrets.

416
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,855
As time passes,

417
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,859
you will be able to look back

418
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:06,155
and smile about the whole ordeal.

419
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,910
Everything will remain as warm memories.

420
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,208
I hope you'll be happy, Min-gyu.

421
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,546
With all my heart.

422
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,828
Gosh, you startled me.

423
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,762
THE MONAMI FOLDER WAS LEAKED

424
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,101
We succeeded in opening the folder,

425
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,771
but the video file was damaged
while transferring.

426
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:25,068
But we managed to save
a few minutes long clip.

427
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,323
But their password was a little funny.

428
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,741
It was "Sandwich."

429
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,910
Okay.

430
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,340
We failed to steal Aji 3's technical file,

431
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:50,093
but we managed to save
an unexpected video clip.

432
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,303
Yes, sir.

433
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,921
My goodness!

434
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,634
"Friend Mode"?

435
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,430
-How dare you?
-Look at this Mr. Smart-ass.

436
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,306
Do you think I'll let you be my friend?

437
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,101
He had no idea
what a fool he made of himself.

438
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,486
Dad.

439
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,032
You know I love you, right?

440
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,076
Of course, I do. And I love myself, too.

441
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,330
Then will you let me go now?

442
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:08,504
I want to live the way I want.

443
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,674
I like someone

444
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,762
and I don't want to be engaged to
or marry Min-gyu.

445
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,348
This place makes good coffee.

446
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,350
Dad, please.

447
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,645
I'm talking to you sincerely.

448
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,023
I'll be sincere with you as well.

449
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,902
Your half is Kim Min-gyu.

450
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,155
Don't make me lose...

451
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,908
the respect I have for you.

452
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,285
Please.

453
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,132
HONG-JU'S BED AND BREAKFAST

454
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,015
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING, SANTA MARIA

455
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,270
I'm really sorry.

456
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,065
We're booked for lunch,
so I can't take any more guests.

457
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,025
Well, we aren't here to eat.

458
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,195
-Is Cho Ji-a here?
-Hello.

459
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,696
Hi.

460
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,659
-Where's Min-gyu?
-Upstairs. He'll be in the shower.

461
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,286
Did you...

462
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,663
He didn't find out.

463
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,458
He promised not to bother me again.

464
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,502
Are you okay?

465
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,174
Take him home before the customers arrive.

466
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,484
Hello?

467
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,944
I'm on Geoje Island.

468
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,113
Do you want anything?

469
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,534
We're fine.

470
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,120
Just come back to Seoul with Doctor Hong.

471
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,957
Do you miss me that much?

472
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,585
Of course, we do, brother.

473
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,336
Get back here soon.

474
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:17,216
I heard the yuzu bread is famous here.
I'll get you some.

475
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,011
And I heard it'll be cold tonight.

476
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,096
You can all sleep in my house.

477
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,807
I bought more beddings. Okay?

478
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,686
Brother!

479
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,983
This is just so...

480
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,069
Just get back here safely.

481
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,992
You people are being punished
in such odd ways.

482
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,247
I shouldn't have...

483
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,711
made such a promise.

484
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,974
You look better than you did
when you got here yesterday.

485
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,061
Did you work out the misunderstanding?

486
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,690
I need to work. What do I do?

487
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,443
The reserved customers are coming anyway.

488
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,488
You were in the cold all night.
Go get some rest.

489
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,074
I want to work, nana.

490
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,200
Oh, dear.

491
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,582
Hello.

492
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,127
Why? Today?

493
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,004
How come?

494
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,967
Okay, I'll come right over.

495
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,010
Is something wrong?

496
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,888
Old people tend to get into accidents
in the winter.

497
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,390
I must go to the hospital.

498
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,561
It's Hong-ju's.

499
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,230
I can't do lunch today.

500
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,816
Go eat somewhere else.

501
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,694
All right. I called you, okay?

502
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,613
I shouldn't be gone for long.

503
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,825
Close the restaurant for me
after your friends leave.

504
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,326
Take care.

505
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,494
I will.

506
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,674
You've lost a lot of weight.

507
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,636
There's no better diet than heartbreak.

508
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,604
Are you okay?

509
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,066
Yes.

510
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,735
Let's go back to Seoul right away.

511
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,738
I need to tell you something about work.

512
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,574
Then let's go to Seoul.

513
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,756
I apologize, Hong-ju.

514
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,925
He won't do anything like this again.

515
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,388
I trust you won't.

516
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,725
You promised.

517
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,686
I should go.

518
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,701
Goodbye.

519
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,123
Bye.

520
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,278
SEAFOOD NOODLES, SASHIMI
SEA SQUIRT BIBIMBAP, SASHIMI WITH RICE

521
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,198
Don't be silly. That's nonsense.

522
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,117
-It's not nonsense, okay?
-I'm starving to death.

523
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,493
-Come on.
-Okay.

524
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,495
You're such a joker.

525
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,788
Ma'am.

526
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,456
Ma'am, we're here.

527
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,500
-Oh, hello.
-Hello.

528
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:23,003
She called to say
she can't take you today.

529
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:23,963
No.

530
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,923
We didn't get such a call.

531
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,968
You can't cancel the day off.
We never got the call.

532
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,636
Is this your first day at work?

533
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,638
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

534
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,390
Skip the apology.

535
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,892
We don't need anything extravagant.
Just bring us food.

536
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,436
Come on in, guys.

537
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,647
What was the delay for? I'm starving.

538
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,608
-Come on in.
-Let's sit down.

539
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,318
-Hey.
-My goodness.

540
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,028
-Anything will do.
-I'm really sorry.

541
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,656
There's no one to cook at the moment--

542
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,657
Assorted sashimi...

543
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,785
seafood stew, and seafood pajeon
is on the menu.

544
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,747
If that will do,
please sit and wait in silence.

545
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,876
If you don't,
you won't get any food, okay?

546
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,628
-Just feed us anything.
-We're starving.

547
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,046
Get us some soju first.

548
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,799
What are you doing?

549
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,968
Get out. You promised.

550
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,595
Can you cut sashimi?

551
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,054
-No.
-What about pajeon?

552
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,474
No.

553
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,142
I can.

554
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,227
I'll leave right after this.

555
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,232
Ji--

556
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,360
Hong-ju, what should we do?

557
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,029
What should we do?

558
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:34,116
Hong-ju can assist me.
You two can serve. Okay?

559
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,910
-Get moving.
-We serve.

560
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,703
Okay. Yes.

561
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,849
Hello, Mr. Cho.

562
00:41:58,933 --> 00:41:59,892
Hello.

563
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,353
Why did you call me?

564
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:06,440
Why? Can I not
since I'm no longer your CEO?

565
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,276
No. Please go ahead.

566
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,655
You have a younger sister.

567
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,867
I think I saw her before.

568
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,787
What do you mean?

569
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:25,709
It seems like there are some people
who look just like Aji 3.

570
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,462
Your sister.

571
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,174
Do you have anything to say?

572
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,426
I think...

573
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,888
there's a misunderstanding.

574
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,935
My sister knows nothing about robots.

575
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:47,231
Doctor Hong just made a robot
based on her.

576
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,527
Your sister knows nothing about this?

577
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:52,987
Yes.

578
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,740
You don't know her well.

579
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,826
What?

580
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:04,248
I wonder why Doctor Hong gave Aji 3...

581
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,959
your sister's face.

582
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,878
They used to know each other.

583
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,674
It's true.

584
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,927
My sister has nothing to do with this.

585
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,533
Hong-ju, pass me a small plate.

586
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,963
-God, I'm starving.
-Chopsticks.

587
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,680
Pass them down the table.

588
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,016
The food's here.

589
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,112
Hong-ju.

590
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,969
-It's really good.
-The soup is crazy good.

591
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,598
Here you go.

592
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,142
-Try some.
-You must have some.

593
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,061
Gosh, the sashimi tastes great.

594
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,107
-Let's go.
-I'm full.

595
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,316
That was good.

596
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,317
Thank you.

597
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,361
-We enjoyed that.
-It was great.

598
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,654
-See you later.
-Thank you.

599
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,301
There. We should eat as well.

600
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,068
Hong-ju.

601
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,071
Is your surname Kim or Ji?

602
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,700
I thought she was
about to call you Ji Hong-ju.

603
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,077
That was my mistake.

604
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,871
She's Kim Hong-ju.

605
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,539
Yes.

606
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,499
Oh, Kim Hong-ju.

607
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,253
Kim Hong-ju, enjoy your meal.

608
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:00,257
It'll be the first and last time
you try my cooking.

609
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,510
Eat up.

610
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:09,850
Do you...

611
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:11,894
like it?

612
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,188
It's very good.

613
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,191
Try this too.

614
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:21,111
It's a seafood pajeon made
with my mom's recipe.

615
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,793
It's a work of art.

616
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,047
And try this too.

617
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,096
It's so good.

618
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,852
I should've told Director Kim the truth.

619
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:57,689
That Aji 3 has my sister's face,
and that she dated Doctor Hong.

620
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,525
I should've just told him.

621
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,110
All right.

622
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:06,031
Before things get out of hand,
I'll have to tell him now.

623
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:14,957
Hello?

624
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,875
It's about Aji 3.

625
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,628
I'll call you back. I'm eating right now.

626
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:21,964
Okay.

627
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,269
Why? Am I stuffing my face?

628
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,353
No.

629
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,231
I once wondered...

630
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:44,820
how it would feel
if Aji 3 could try my cooking.

631
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,366
I thought this must be how it would feel.

632
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,624
Sure.

633
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,419
Stop it before she gets sick.

634
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,046
Sorry.

635
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,298
It's fine.

636
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:07,134
This will be your last time anyway.

637
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,215
Was that President Martin?

638
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:50,052
He found out that you resigned.

639
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:52,888
Tell him...

640
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,682
that I'll come back as a director.

641
00:48:56,558 --> 00:49:00,020
And you can gather
the board of directors again.

642
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,066
-What for?
-Doctor Hong Baek-gyun

643
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,401
and the Santa Maria team

644
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,237
have been fooling Kim Min-gyu.

645
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,282
-What?
-I wasn't the one...

646
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,534
that should have resigned.

647
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,828
It should've been Min-gyu.

648
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,586
What's this?

649
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,421
"Mon ami"?

650
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,174
That's French for "my friend".

651
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,387
Hoktal, this one here.

652
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,056
I told you to check and delete it before.

653
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,349
It's not mine.

654
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,393
Then who made it?

655
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,603
-It's not Doctor Hong's.
-What?

656
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,480
Then whose is it?

657
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,320
Wait.

658
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:53,990
Ssanip.

659
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:58,370
Do you remember when Aji 3
made her own backup folder last year?

660
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,371
Yes.

661
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,998
That messed
with all the deep learning folders

662
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,835
we had extracted patterns from,
and it drove us crazy.

663
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:09,548
This robot made her own backup folder?

664
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:10,632
Just a moment.

665
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,758
Aji 3.

666
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,594
The Monami folder.

667
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,097
Did you make it?

668
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,015
Yes, I made it.

669
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,350
Hey!

670
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,437
You can't keep bringing out folders
we put in the recycle bin.

671
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,313
It wasn't from the recycle bin.

672
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,315
I saved it before the reset.

673
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,778
Everything you did for me,

674
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,574
and what it meant...

675
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,453
I will never forget it.

676
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,048
What's that?

677
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,844
Didn't we delete everything?

678
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:59,598
Then the folder that got leaked...

679
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,726
contains a video
of our brother's deep learning...

680
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,355
Brother? Kim Min-gyu?

681
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,650
I kept a promise to my friend.

682
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,076
OVERSEAS TRAVEL

683
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,787
EASTERN UNITED STATES

684
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,833
You finally got paid extra
and can afford to go to the Alps.

685
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,628
Why are you pouting like a child?

686
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,923
The Alps isn't the problem
right now, Uncle.

687
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,925
Then what is?

688
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:35,967
She...

689
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,055
wanted to know what kind of person I am.

690
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,598
Who did?

691
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,186
Who are you?

692
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,271
I would like to get to know you as well.

693
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:52,609
No one had ever said that to me.

694
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,444
Didn't I ever say that to you?

695
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,205
We should go before it gets dark.

696
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,168
Min-gyu.

697
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:14,840
We all ate.
Shouldn't we do the dishes too?

698
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,051
It's okay, I'll do it. I'm strong.

699
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,511
Then would you do it with me?

700
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,763
No, I'll do it.

701
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:22,931
Let me help.

702
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,433
Hong-ju, take her outside.
She's a nuisance.

703
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:30,981
Let's go.

704
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,946
You couldn't take the hint.

705
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,198
You could've just let me
and Hong-ju do it.

706
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:42,784
How uncomfortable would that be?

707
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,620
You would have stared at her
while you did all these dishes.

708
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,249
When I look at her, my heart...

709
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,129
It beats fast like when I saw Aji 3.

710
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,466
I become excited, itchy, and happy.

711
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:02,512
I want to see more of her.
What am I supposed to do?

712
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,932
And I find it strange...

713
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,435
to feel...

714
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,313
that my connection with her...

715
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,481
won't end here.

716
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:18,904
I think there will be a next time
and something more.

717
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,366
Isn't that strange?

718
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,084
While I was locked up with him...

719
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,630
I was really scared
that he might find out.

720
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:40,884
But I was also happy.

721
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,721
However...

722
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,683
I slowly started to become greedy.

723
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,646
I thought since he likes me so much,

724
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:57,150
if I honestly told him
what really happened,

725
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,279
maybe he would forgive and believe me.

726
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,826
Once I started to become greedy,

727
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,788
it got a little difficult towards the end.

728
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,708
But...

729
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,463
I shouldn't do that, right?

730
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,231
It's...

731
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,151
really goodbye now.

732
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,666
I really enjoyed the first
and the last meal you made.

733
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,255
Then let's be friends.

734
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,845
You promised
that I would never see you again.

735
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:08,805
Keep that promise.

736
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,601
But...

737
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,895
why do I feel like...

738
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,481
we're going to meet again?

739
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,486
That's not going to happen.

740
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,614
It never will.

741
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:46,468
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING
SANTA MARIA

742
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:56,037
You promised
that I would never see you again.

743
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:57,956
Keep that promise.

744
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,168
But...

745
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,295
why do I feel like...

746
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,006
we're going to meet again?

747
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,973
That's not going to happen.

748
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,101
It never will.

749
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:23,898
Here.

750
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:25,733
Didn't you overeat yourself ill?

751
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,318
I'll be fine if I take medicine.

752
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:33,992
Yes?

753
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,494
What?

754
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:39,706
What are you saying? Be more specific.

755
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,543
What should we do?

756
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:48,590
We never imagined
that Aji 3 would have done such a thing.

757
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,967
We're on our way back to Seoul.

758
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,344
I want you to check
how much of the video got leaked.

759
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,305
What happened?

760
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,724
Aji 3 had a backup file
of Min-gyu's deep learning process.

761
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,934
-What?
-We need to hurry.

762
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,686
Okay.

763
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,355
FISHING GOODS

764
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,318
Where did he go?

765
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:12,614
Come in.

766
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,079
Yes?

767
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:27,045
Yu-cheol showed me everything already.

768
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,714
He's learned how to handle business.

769
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:32,383
Something additional came out,
and I looked into it.

770
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,594
It's something very interesting.

771
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,222
-What?
-Director Kim...

772
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,057
has an illness.

773
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,477
It was bad enough for him
to be dismissed from his position.

774
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:50,109
HONG-JU'S BED AND BREAKFAST

775
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,672
The owner's not there right now.

776
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:14,008
I'm looking for a young woman.

777
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,678
She's about this tall,
and she has short hair.

778
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:19,305
She packed her bags and left.

779
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,016
What? She left?

780
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,435
When? Where did she go?

781
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,479
She just left. She went that way.

782
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,189
About five minutes ago.

783
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,952
I'm sure he went back
to the sashimi place.

784
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,532
Gosh. There she is.

785
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,434
That's...

786
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,145
That's...

787
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:37,235
That's the necklace I gave to Aji 3.

788
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,723
Let me explain everything.

789
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:15,857
Have you been...

790
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,279
lying to me this whole time?

791
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,461
I'm going to throw up.

792
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,365
