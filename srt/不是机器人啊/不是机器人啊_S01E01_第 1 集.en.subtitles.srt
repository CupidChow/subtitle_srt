1
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,234
This is the third retest.
Is that correct, Mr. Kim Min-gyu?

2
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,570
MILITARY MANPOWER ADMINISTRATION

3
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,821
Remove your hat and mask.

4
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,117
Don't make me repeat.
Remove your hat and mask.

5
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,252
"Seriously allergic to human contact."

6
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,380
That's interesting.
Does such kind of allergy exist?

7
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,382
The name of the disease
isn't written on the diagnosis.

8
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,843
As a dermatologist,
I've never heard of it.

9
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,638
I've seen mental illness as an excuse
to avoid getting drafted,

10
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,972
but this is new.

11
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,767
Mr. Kim, do you not want
to serve in the military?

12
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,852
Don't you take Korean military seriously?

13
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,730
Don't you feel bad for others who serve?

14
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,899
Kim Min-gyu. Enlisted.

15
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,984
What are you doing?

16
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,155
Why are you taking off your jacket?

17
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,074
Are you intimidating us?

18
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,200
Go back to your seat.

19
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,661
Go back to your seat.

20
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,496
-What?
-Go back to your seat now.

21
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,748
I have an intimidating upper body, too.

22
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,000
Go back to your seat now.

23
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,483
Is it...

24
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,362
possible for me to enlist

25
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,990
in the marines?

26
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,741
I don't think so.

27
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:45,206
This only appears when I'm having
physical contact with a human.

28
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,458
The symptom...

29
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,254
gets worse the longer the contact.

30
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,591
It can't be prevented.

31
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,384
Symptoms can be relieved

32
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,053
with a shot of medication.

33
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,973
-My goodness.
-Why did you do that?

34
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,933
Goodness!

35
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,064
Of course,

36
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,525
it's not contagious.

37
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,820
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

38
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,113
Do you have any questions?

39
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,459
Sir.

40
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,377
It's ready.

41
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,152
It's already been a year
since you came to me.

42
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,156
With such a small body, you were always...

43
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,659
so devoted to me.

44
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,579
You're an honest
and thoughtful bride of mine.

45
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,332
Happy birthday, Pretty.

46
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,628
All right.

47
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,423
Here's your birthday present.

48
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,261
Renew the battery
and stay with me for a long time.

49
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,804
You're so cute.

50
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,306
Unlike what you think,
I'm fine being alone.

51
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,441
If the world comes to an end
and only one person can survive...

52
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,070
that would be me.

53
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,322
Come on.

54
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,408
With a million sets of skills
to live by myself.

55
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,545
People need distance between each other.

56
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:42,800
I need

57
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,719
some space...

58
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,015
to protect...

59
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,936
myself.

60
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,017
I will save you your seat.

61
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,310
You can go to the bathroom.

62
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,021
Really? Thank you.

63
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,196
President Cho got me this treasure.

64
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,532
Do you see this product? The packaging...

65
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,117
-didn't get ruined at all.
-My gosh.

66
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,452
-I'm so popular.
-Wonder Woman of substitute purchase.

67
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,704
Everyone, I'm so overwhelmed

68
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,500
by all your endless gratitude.

69
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,962
Excuse me, what's this line for?

70
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,463
Oh, this line?

71
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,132
WORLDWIDE RELEASE
OF LIMITED EDITION FIGURES

72
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,634
Besiegement for a treasure.

73
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,262
Call me if you need
a substitute purchaser.

74
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,972
With an accumulated know-how
of many years,

75
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:15,101
I'll be able to get you
any kind of limited edition products.

76
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,687
Oh, you're the famous President Cho.

77
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,189
I'm surprised to see how young you are.

78
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,734
My goodness. Hello, everyone.
You all must be cold.

79
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,236
Hey.

80
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,823
I've tried out a lot of businesses

81
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,366
and I've failed a lot of them.

82
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,077
So all I have left with me

83
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,289
is my debt
and this short temper of mine, kid.

84
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,790
Oh, I see.

85
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,836
But why are you suddenly
talking to me like I'm your friend?

86
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,254
I don't get it.

87
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,591
My gosh, you're unbelievable.

88
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,928
You are a brainless jerk
who has no conscience.

89
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,931
You think people sit here waiting
because they're stupid?

90
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,308
I never looked down on anyone.

91
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,310
How dare you cut in line?

92
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,187
Get lost in three seconds,

93
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,731
before I make a toothbrush
with your nasal hair.

94
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,608
-Nice!
-Incredible!

95
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,818
I don't have any nasal hair sticking out!

96
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,278
And I never cut in line!

97
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,614
I'm not even interested
in these limited edition figures.

98
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,866
-Get lost!
-I'm not interested in this!

99
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,868
-Go away.
-Get lost.

100
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,746
-Leave.
-Do you know who I am?

101
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,039
Did something happen?

102
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,291
No, it's nothing. You can sit back down.

103
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,711
It was a long wait, wasn't it?

104
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,962
-Yes.
-Yes.

105
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,840
You can enter now.

106
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,343
Please keep your order

107
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,846
and slowly enter the event hall
in an orderly fashion.

108
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,014
You may come in.

109
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,891
Thank you. Welcome.

110
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,353
Move! It's mine! I'm going to have it!

111
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,646
-My gosh.
-Move.

112
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,232
Gosh, who said Korea
was a developed country?

113
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,276
-Get out of my way!
-Move!

114
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,195
-Stop pushing!
-Move it!

115
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,697
-Get out of my way!
-Move!

116
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,574
-Please calm down!
-Push!

117
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,409
-Stop!
-Keep going!

118
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,214
-My gosh.
-Get out of my way.

119
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,174
-Go get that!
-Hurry!

120
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:15,323
Hello. I successfully got it for you.
Where should we meet?

121
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,058
Put it in the back seat.

122
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,394
What? Was that a speaker?

123
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,481
Didn't you hear me?
I told you to put it in the back seat.

124
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,192
My gosh, I can't do that.

125
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,612
Cash for undamaged goods.
My balance, please.

126
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,280
I paid for the figure in advance.

127
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,949
And your commission doubles
for direct dealing.

128
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,409
However, in one condition.

129
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,871
The packaging needs to be
in a perfect state.

130
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,832
That means I need to check
the packaging first.

131
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,335
Why can't you trust me?

132
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,755
Fine. I'm confident
about my products anyway.

133
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,600
My gosh.

134
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,981
No.

135
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,735
No!

136
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,199
Sir, I would like my commission now.
Doubled 300,000 won.

137
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,617
I stayed up all night for it.

138
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,537
-I can't give it to you.
-What?

139
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,664
There's already a stain on the box.

140
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,457
I can never get this figure again.

141
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,293
This means you failed
to fulfill our contract.

142
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,547
But still, you ask me for money?

143
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,511
That box was completely fine
when I had it.

144
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,973
It seems like that stain suddenly appeared
as soon as you took it.

145
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,975
My sincere apologies for what happened.

146
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,394
Is that crap what you want to hear?

147
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,438
How dare you try to scam me?

148
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,731
You are the one who tried to scam me.

149
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,235
I can forgive mistakes,
but I can't forgive people lying to me.

150
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,237
My gosh, I can't believe this.

151
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,448
Hey, get out of the car.

152
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,826
Did you just lock the door?

153
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,703
Back seat door, too?

154
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,831
You dare try to run away
without paying me?

155
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,836
I refuse to give a single penny
to a con artist.

156
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,921
Hey, you're messing
with the wrong person here.

157
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,006
Hey, get out of your car.

158
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,509
Hey, open the door.
Get out of your car, asshole!

159
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,845
I'll write a review,
so repent on what you did.

160
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,430
And let's never meet each other again.

161
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,348
You piece of trash.

162
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,269
Hey, where do you think you're going?
Hey, stop!

163
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,437
Hey!

164
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,692
What? What was that sound?

165
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,663
Did I run over her?

166
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:10,915
Really?

167
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,793
No, that can't be.

168
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,796
My gosh, this is crazy.

169
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:45,699
Hey.

170
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,038
President Cho. Hey.

171
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:56,752
Hey.

172
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,591
My goodness.

173
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,810
You are so handsome.

174
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,733
Hey, where do you think you're going?

175
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,653
Go away!

176
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,781
Hey, let go of me. I said, let go of me!

177
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,032
Hey!

178
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,119
-I'm going to kill you.
-Let go of me!

179
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,037
-Stop touching me!
-Hey!

180
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,789
Please get away from me!

181
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,962
Hey!

182
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:46,093
I once even got hit by lumber,
just so I could get my money.

183
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,888
Do you think this is going
to make me give up?

184
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,224
Give me my money!
Give me my money, you jerk!

185
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,518
Give me my money, you punk!

186
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,944
Hey! Stop right there!

187
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,025
Hello, Doctor Oh.

188
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,529
It occurred at the Military Manpower
Administration and then today?

189
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,199
You should've been careful.

190
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,660
Take a careful look at the rash.

191
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,829
Isn't this shaped differently?

192
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,706
It's the same as always.

193
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,625
No, look carefully.

194
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,502
They were always circular,

195
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,963
but now, this one is slightly oval.

196
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,342
This could be a clue
to learn about my disease.

197
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,636
That's a half-baked pimple.

198
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:17,393
I had a cold sweat earlier.
Why don't you take a sample?

199
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,980
I will if you want,
but the result will still be the same.

200
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,774
Why won't you put
your heart and soul into this?

201
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,442
I'm a patient.

202
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:30,906
As my doctor, you should feel sorry
and cling to tiny clues like this.

203
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,367
I did more than enough
of that for 15 years.

204
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,412
Your illness has not yet been diagnosed.

205
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,998
I'm sorry, but it's time you admit

206
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,542
that the only thing you can do
is live secluded from people.

207
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,793
Any new drugs?

208
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,170
None. We tried almost everything.

209
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,465
I found you a smart medical device.

210
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,054
It was developed in Sweden,
and is being beta-tested.

211
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,348
It measures your heart rate
and temperature,

212
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,975
and shows your condition in colors.

213
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,477
It's usually blue.
Yellow, when you're over 100

214
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,771
with the early-stage rash
and breathing difficulty.

215
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,066
Orange means you're over 1,000
with full-body rashes and closed airways.

216
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,485
Over 2,000, it turns red.

217
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,779
-A few minutes later--
-I die of shock?

218
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,866
I've never gone over 2,000.

219
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,784
You never know.

220
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,706
What's the point of wearing this?

221
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,959
I can't date anyone or get married.

222
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,337
I'll live like a monster
for the rest of my life anyway.

223
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:31,050
Still, might there not be just one woman
who will still like you?

224
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,305
If there is...

225
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,518
she wouldn't be normal either.

226
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,189
That nasty jerk of a thief.

227
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,194
You're done sleeping peacefully
for the rest of your life.

228
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,949
My grudges will curse you
and you'll have nightmares every night.

229
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,371
I will not stop
even if you plead with the deities.

230
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,592
What's that?

231
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,102
To the Left. Left.

232
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,229
-Will you be quiet?
-To the right. Right.

233
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,563
I don't have a signal.

234
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,649
What kind of house is this big?

235
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,235
-Where do I land?
-Find an open window.

236
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,986
-Go, go.
-I don't see one.

237
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,404
There's one.

238
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,698
Yes, yes, get the right angle.

239
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,081
What was that?

240
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,294
Who was that?

241
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,588
-He got it.
-He got it!

242
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,549
-He got it!
-Let's get out of here.

243
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,633
He got it.

244
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,389
What's this?

245
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,518
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING
SANTA MARIA

246
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,186
"Daeyang Shipbuilding"?

247
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,107
That's the company I took over
and am trying to sell right now.

248
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,076
Aji 3 is playing squash.

249
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,619
It has a superior mind

250
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,122
that can trace moving objects
and calculate trajectories.

251
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,542
It is also able to react fast enough
to hit the moving ball.

252
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,711
-Doctor, isn't it too dark?
-Squash?

253
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,004
-Open the curtains.
-So what?

254
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,172
Okay.

255
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,177
Are you okay, Doctor?

256
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,095
What's wrong?

257
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,476
-Are you okay, master?
-Yes, I'm fine.

258
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,479
-Can you keep filming?
-What?

259
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,106
I am filming.

260
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,191
It's a robot?

261
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,275
Go right in.

262
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,530
Hello, Director. Kim Min-gyu.

263
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,491
I'm Doctor Hong Baek-gyun.

264
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,036
Does he know me?

265
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,790
I invite you to the demonstration
of Aji 3, an android robot,

266
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,250
that will shock the world.

267
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,835
Why?

268
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,087
ROBOTICS RESEARCH CONTRACT

269
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,923
According to this contract,

270
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,426
you are the new owner of Aji 3.

271
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,513
Please come and give us
the yet unpaid 50 billion won

272
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,351
out of the 100 billion won
that we were promised.

273
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,188
In three seconds,
this flash drive will explode...

274
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,733
or not.

275
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,860
Were you surprised?

276
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,947
If you see Aji 3 in person,

277
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,075
you will be much more shocked than that.

278
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,370
Aji 3, the android robot
that will shock the world

279
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,665
awaits her new owner.

280
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,749
Goodbye.

281
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,130
I am...

282
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,634
that robot's...

283
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,136
new owner?

You will go back one day.

00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,041
My goodness.

296
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,311
My goodness. That was scary.

297
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,955
What's that doing?

298
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,149
What is this?

299
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,486
I mean...

300
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,280
I told you already,
I don't need anything else.

301
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,782
Get rid of all the people.

302
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,201
I just want to see Aji 3.

303
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,871
What?

304
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,501
I should follow this thing?

305
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,349
What is going on?

306
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,042
My heart.

307
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,551
Gosh.

308
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,647
What is this?

309
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,988
Hello?

310
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,785
Is anyone here?

311
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,163
Are you Director Kim Min-gyu?

312
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,267
Gosh.

313
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,574
NO INFORMATION

314
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,286
No information is available.

315
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,913
Are you Director Kim Min-gyu?

316
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,834
How do you know who I am?

317
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,545
Nice to meet you. Let's shake hands.

318
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,967
Don't come near me. Stay away.

319
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,635
Get away from me.

320
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,556
Get away from me now. Goodness.

321
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,059
Is there anyone around?

322
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,812
-What's the matter with him?
-Is there anyone?

323
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,147
Darn it.

324
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,441
I heard they call him Mr. Baton.

325
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,568
Now I see why.

326
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,278
Goodness.

327
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,739
Do you not want to shake hands?

328
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,951
I'm sorry. I'll be careful from now on.

329
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,788
I said no human beings!

330
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,874
Do I look human?

331
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,793
Dr. Hong said that

332
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,338
the more you think I'm human,
the better I'm doing.

333
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,672
Thank you.

334
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,342
However, I'm not human.

335
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,261
What?

336
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,680
I'm Aji 3, an android robot

337
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,099
made by Dr. Hong Baek-gyun.

338
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,728
Aji 3?

339
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,522
Are you a robot?

340
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,857
That's right.

341
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:35,487
Dr. Hong said that you would like me.

342
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,073
Do you like me?

343
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,703
You're trying to trick me.

344
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,706
You're pretending to be a robot.

345
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,917
Don't you think I know the difference?

346
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,381
Hey, what are you doing?

347
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,675
I'll make you believe that I'm a robot.

348
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,013
Hey, wait.

349
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,852
You are...

350
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,104
really a robot.

351
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,673
E.T.?

352
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,096
What is he doing?

353
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,358
She is exactly like a human...

354
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,402
but nothing happened.

355
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,363
Is it because she's a robot?

356
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,408
I run automatically on battery
placed in my chest.

357
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,660
I run for three hours
after I'm fully charged.

358
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,121
My structure is similar to human joints.

359
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,208
Each of my arms holds 30 kg of weight.

360
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,085
I can detect various smells
with the NFC sensor.

361
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,338
I can recognize objects
with a sense of touch.

362
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,548
I have 20 functions

363
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,967
including understanding stocks,
accounting, and foreign languages.

364
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,636
Please use me as you please.

365
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,490
I didn't get extra funding,
so I couldn't pay the electricity bills.

366
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,618
I use electricity from a nearby factory,
but it went bankrupt today.

367
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,412
I heard you are a crook in science.

368
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,040
I heard you are a delinquent in finance.

369
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,797
Is there anything else I should know?

370
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,590
About our Santa Maria Team--

371
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,008
I'm talking about Aji 3.

372
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,428
Of course.

373
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,805
Aji 3.

374
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,933
How do I feel right now?

375
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,313
You're angry.

376
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,191
I'm sorry.

377
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,694
Did I do something wrong, Doctor?

378
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,905
No, I'm not angry.

379
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,993
I'm happy that you aren't angry.

380
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,288
This is Aji 3's main skill.

381
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,082
Aji 3 went through deep learning,

382
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,042
an essential process for an AI.

383
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,504
She can read facial expressions
and feel emotions.

384
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,797
I guarantee it.

385
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,551
Soon, we'll live in a time
where we train robots.

386
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,344
Train robots?

387
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,931
Is it like training dogs?

388
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,311
Sir, do you want to hear a joke?

389
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,854
What?

390
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,857
Do you know who killed Captain Crunch?

391
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,818
A cereal killer.

392
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,869
You just laughed.

393
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,913
My sense of humor has defeated you.

394
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,167
Is this her main skill

395
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,961
that you were talking about?

396
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:07,425
One person needs to give Aji 3
more than a month of deep learning.

397
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,303
She must accumulate
enough information to understand--

398
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,346
Tomorrow...

399
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,350
I'll check if her skills work.

400
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:18,144
We'll discuss
the additional funding later.

401
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,272
Send Aji 3 to my house tomorrow,

402
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,567
so I can test her out.

403
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,374
Please sit down.

404
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,419
Are you prepared for the contract?

405
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,504
-Yes.
-Yes.

406
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,756
This is the last time.

407
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:50,218
Let's hit a home run in one go.

408
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,803
-Yes, CEO.
-Yes, CEO.

409
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,933
Hello, sir.

410
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,936
I'll join the meeting now. Get ready.`

411
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:00,895
Pardon?

412
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,605
Hello?

413
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,444
Security Manager?

414
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,613
Director Kim is on his way.

415
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,324
Right now? Yes, sir.

416
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,951
Emergency!

417
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,536
-Emergency.
-Emergency.

418
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,662
He's coming.

419
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,748
Come this way now!

420
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,292
Hurry up, everyone!

421
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,878
Faster. Move quickly!

422
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,382
Emergency alert. Director Kim is arriving.

423
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,843
Director Kim is arriving.

424
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,183
Reduce the salary of that employee.

425
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,744
Please continue without stopping.

426
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,007
In two days, we will sign an agreement
to sell the R&D Team

427
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,384
to the Bold Group from the UK.

428
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,972
That will happen, as planned,
in the main conference room.

429
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,891
This deal will conclude

430
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:05,394
the division and sale
of Daeyang Shipbuilding.

431
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,439
Thank you.

432
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,698
Yes, Director?

433
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,451
There's something I don't know much about.

434
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:25,248
What does Daeyang Shipbuilding's
R&D Team research?

435
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:30,294
I believe they research
technology to build ships.

436
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:35,341
I invite you to the demonstration
of Aji 3, an android robot,

437
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,093
that will shock the world.

438
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,304
I see.

439
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,641
There is something I really don't know.

440
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,935
The Santa Maria team.

441
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,771
What are their accomplishments?

442
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,483
I don't believe
they have anything noteworthy.

443
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,577
You should better...

444
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,830
take responsibility for that.

445
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,456
Pardon?

446
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,173
You are hanging in there.
You must be tough.

447
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,842
-What? Who--
-Don't you know me?

448
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,302
I head the Social Contribution Team.

449
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,013
I've been the brain of the company
for 20 years.

450
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,849
I apologize.
I've only worked here for a month.

451
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,393
You work directly with Mr. Baton.

452
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,687
I mean, Director Kim. It must be hard.

453
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,148
No one can stand him for over a month.

454
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:36,068
I think you are our 25th hire.

455
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,320
Twenty-fifth?

456
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,948
If you want to switch loyalties,
come to me.

457
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,825
I will act as a go-between.

458
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,243
What do you mean?

459
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,746
Don't you know
of the company's two rivals?

460
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,540
CEO Hwang Yu-cheol and Mr. Baton.

461
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:54,337
Why? CEO Hwang and Mr. Baton
are friends and rivals.

462
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,052
You're acting out of character.

463
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:07,099
Acting out of character is my specialty.
You know that.

464
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,769
I'm in charge
of selling Daeyang Shipbuilding.

465
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,896
-You're messing up the chain of--
-You.

466
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,024
You are the chairman. And me?

467
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,068
I'm head of the board of directors.

468
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,528
I keep the company going,

469
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,573
and I earn 70 percent
of KM Financial's profits.

470
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,953
Is there still a problem
with this chain of command?

471
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,955
Fine.

472
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,124
-If you want to say--
-Not right now.

473
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,127
I might have something to say later.

474
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,922
Until then, keep doing what you are doing.

475
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,048
Whatever it is.

476
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,758
Goodbye.

477
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,730
EMAIL TO MADAM X

478
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,901
REQUESTING X-FILES FOR DAEYANG
SHIPBUILDING'S LATE CHAIRMAN PARK

479
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,745
It worked!

480
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,456
Why isn't this one lighting up?

481
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,542
Ta-da. It's on.

482
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,670
That's not what I asked for.

483
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,839
How many times must I explain?

484
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,383
If you're that frustrated,
make it yourself.

485
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,261
Come on, Mr. Genius.

486
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,221
-Look at this.
-At what?

487
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:33,561
See, someone touches this light
with their hands.

488
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,438
As soon as someone does that,

489
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:38,024
the other light has to light up.

490
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,900
Whether it's in Korea or Africa,

491
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,611
if there's Wi-Fi,
they both have to light up.

492
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,155
That's the whole point.

493
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,575
Will this actually be mass-produced?

494
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,994
Competitions are hard to enter,

495
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,871
and I, President Cho,

496
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,790
managed to reach
the final stage with my idea.

497
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:58,336
If my prototype and presentation
get me first place,

498
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,714
one hundred million won
will end up in my account.

499
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,258
Farewell, part-time jobs.

500
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,801
Greetings, President Cho.

501
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,265
Cheers.

502
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,396
I knew we had no budget
because the company was failing,

503
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,816
but who knew that huge company
would get sold off?

504
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,319
We're siphoning electricity from next door

505
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,322
and have no money to pay the rent.

506
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,741
There's always a way out.

507
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,451
The new company's really rich.

508
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,579
They'll give us 50 billion won
without a problem, right?

509
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,749
When the money comes in, let's move.

510
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,586
We must change her battery.

511
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,630
And sensors and parts.

512
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,756
Change everything.

513
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,383
A new vat for new wine.

514
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,469
A new robot for a new facility.

515
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,721
I brought more beers.

516
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,891
Aji 3.

517
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,185
What pick comes whenever we eat meat?

518
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,229
-A toothpick.
-A toothpick.

519
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,147
Right?

520
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,233
Stop teaching her weird things.

521
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,859
That's why she's weird.

522
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,695
No one makes her laugh as much as I do.

523
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,447
Shall we bet? 10,000 won?

524
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,740
Are you in? I'm in.

525
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,325
-I'm in.
-Yes.

526
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,370
Aji 3, when we get more funding,

527
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,247
I will give you silicone breasts.

528
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,458
I do not know what that means.

529
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,043
-You're out.
-Aji 3.

530
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,046
What happens when your cheekbones jump
into the air?

531
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,132
Cheekbones can't jump into the air.

532
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,341
They aren't dragons.

533
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,426
-You're out.
-You're out.

534
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,682
That's cheating.

535
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,100
-That's unfair.
-I could say that.

536
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,935
But you didn't. Pay up.

537
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:56,328
So that's where Aji 3
and Mr. Baton's memories will be saved?

538
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,249
Go away, will you?

539
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,959
Don't you see her chest is open?

540
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,795
Just one drop of fluid
will short her circuits and fry her!

541
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,380
Hey.

542
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,299
Hey.

543
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,100
Can you throw this away for me?

544
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,063
Thank you.

545
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,945
I'm home.

546
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,992
Why are you both standing there?

547
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,662
Dad's home, Auntie.

548
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,542
Your brother found out. Sorry.

549
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:32,758
Jin-bae, will you let me explain first?

550
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,969
-Come over here.
-Jin-bae.

551
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,681
Didn't I say I will kick you out
if you start another business?

552
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,975
Didn't I tell you to get a job?

553
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,935
Jin-bae.

554
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,563
I was going to get a job.

555
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,897
I just can't.

556
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,984
Then you should improve yourself,
and find a way,

557
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,860
not think you're an entrepreneur.

558
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:55,781
How dare you borrow from my wife
as much as ten million won?

559
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,992
What did you spend that on?

560
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,702
What trash did you make this time?

561
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,078
I'm really sorry.

562
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,831
Stop running around. You have weak lungs.

563
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:04,915
When will you grow up?

564
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:08,168
I get what you mean.
Shall we talk after dinner?

565
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,714
It's your birthday today.
I bought your favorite cake.

566
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,425
Did I ask you to?

567
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,101
Can't you...

568
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,647
Can't you just cheer me on?

569
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,610
Dad supported you,
and you studied to your heart's content.

570
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,612
You went to a good university
and became a lawyer.

571
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,072
You got married, had Dong-hyeon,
and accomplished everything.

572
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,950
Who cares about my degree and my job?

573
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,452
Do you think my life is great?

574
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,162
It's so incredibly great.

575
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,081
Can't you let me off?

576
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,835
Now that Dad's gone,
I only have you to lean on.

577
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,671
Forget it. Quit everything you were doing.

578
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,632
I won't ask you to pay any bills.

579
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,718
Don't sleep during the day.
Take a class or find a job.

580
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,219
Don't take the easy way out.

581
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,430
Do you think this is easy?

582
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,223
It is just as hard as finding a job.

583
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,642
Why do I sleep during the day?

584
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,186
I stayed up last night
and the night before.

585
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,604
To pay you back.

586
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,980
Then pay us back.

587
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,066
Go to the bank and pay us back.

588
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,610
I will. I said I will!

589
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,741
-I am Korean...
-Sta. Maria Research...

590
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,913
Hoktal, did you find one?

591
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,290
There is nothing. I'm really sorry.
I should just die.

592
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,875
If you can talk, make another call.

593
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,670
-Ssanip, anything?
-No.

594
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,421
Thank you.

595
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:35,839
I found one.

596
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,841
There was one left in C Lab.

597
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,263
But it's coming from abroad
and will arrive in two days.

598
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,434
Will Mr. Baton give us
a two-day extension?

599
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,062
We must ask.

600
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,773
-Pai, you call him.
-Me?

601
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,358
It would be better coming from a woman.

602
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,278
Do I seem like a woman to you?

603
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,613
I'll call him.

604
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,910
-What is it?
-Director.

605
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:09,123
I would like you to give me
two more days to test out Aji 3.

606
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,750
I didn't tell you something earlier.

607
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:15,754
Daeyang Shipbuilding's R&D Team
including Santa Maria

608
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,216
will be sold to the UK's Bold Group
in two days' time.

609
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,386
We only have tomorrow to test her out.

610
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,852
BOLD GROUP, JOHN MARTIN

611
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,566
A patent hunter?

612
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,279
He will split Aji 3 up and sell her parts.

613
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,352
I'll pay you back.

614
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:16,190
I'll take a loan to pay you back.

615
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,611
Who is this?

616
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,491
I don't need a loan.

617
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,542
My credit rating has hit rock bottom.

618
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,419
I don't need a loan!

619
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,255
If you want to give me money,
give me ten million won!

620
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,343
It's been a while.

621
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,220
Who is this?

622
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:47,930
It's me.

623
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,057
Have you forgotten my voice?

624
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,143
I have a terrible memory.

625
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,811
Who are you?

626
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,813
Were we close? You're too chummy.

627
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,650
It's Hong Baek-gyun.

628
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,944
What? Hong and Baek?

629
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,904
Don't pretend that you don't remember me.

630
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,489
It's me, Fungus.

631
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:10,369
If you have fungus,
bleach is what you need.

632
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,083
I'll give you ten million won.
Where are you?

633
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:25,384
What kind of name is Fungus?

634
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,554
Is Fun his first name and Gus his surname?

635
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,144
Was it...

636
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,273
that Fungus?

637
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:48,156
How could you forget about him, you idiot?

638
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,327
I can't meet him looking like this.

639
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,851
It's been a long time.

640
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:19,354
Your hair! Why... How?

641
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,939
When did you cut it?

642
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,567
Why did you cut your hair?

643
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,279
Your breasts! How padded is your bra?

644
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:31,325
Okay. So, you can wear a wig

645
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,119
and wear bras without any padding.

646
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:41,418
When most people meet again
after a long while,

647
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,254
they usually ask how the other person
has been doing.

648
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,547
Yes, right.

649
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:49,843
It looks like you haven't
been doing too well.

650
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,928
So I'm glad.

651
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:58,477
Your face is more wrinkly. I'm glad too.

652
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,062
What?

653
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,439
Why do you still...

654
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,483
care so much?

655
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:08,570
You don't listen to me,
so that hasn't changed.

656
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,030
We broke up,

657
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,617
so listen carefully
to what I have to say, Professor.

658
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:17,079
When most people hear a comment like that,

659
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:20,540
they focus on the phrase
about wrinkles, but you,

660
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,878
you just focus on the word "you."

661
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:27,005
Your brain is structured

662
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:31,009
so that you can only listen
to the words you want to hear.

663
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,970
You need to fix that. That's...

664
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,933
That's really mean.

665
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,726
It's because I'm a genius.

666
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,855
Why are you here, Mr. Genius?

667
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,650
-To help you pay back your debt.
-My debt?

668
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,360
You must feel bad for what you did.

669
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,654
I'll give you a chance
to make it up to me.

670
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,701
Ten million won.

671
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,121
Take the money and work part-time for me.

672
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,706
For just three hours tomorrow.

673
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:01,665
Ten million won?

674
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,711
Are you going to sell my organs?

675
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,797
It's something only you can do.

676
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,757
That's what the money is for.

677
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,467
Just one day for three hours.

678
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,137
What kind of job is it?

679
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:20,684
If Active Sound were to go in...
just a moment.

680
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,811
If this goes in there,

681
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,563
the decision sequence...

682
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,374
Are you finally awake, Aji?

683
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,293
Did you fix her?

684
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,754
How did you fix her without the parts?

685
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,674
Our team really is the best.

686
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,343
You're wearing a different wig.

687
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:00,348
Why are your breasts so big?
Did the battery puff up?

688
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,725
Don't worry.

689
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,935
I'll fix you.

690
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,442
Say hello.

691
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,945
This is Cho Ji-a, Aji 3's model.

692
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,990
Model? She's a human being?

693
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,325
Oh, dear.

694
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,743
I'm sorry,

695
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:23,121
but how do you know each other?

696
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:28,627
Once upon a time,
we knew each other for a while.

697
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,628
Wait.

698
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:30,921
Wait.

699
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,507
What's this about a model?

700
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,442
Why...

701
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,111
Why am I over there?

702
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,366
Has your ex lost his mind?

703
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,452
The scientist who made a robot
with his ex's face.

704
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,037
How good a likeness was it?

705
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,539
Did it look human?

706
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,541
Like something from an SF movie?

707
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,751
-Is this funny?
-I'm worried.

708
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,088
Breakups follow something
called the "Law of Lunacy."

709
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:15,590
The lunacy you didn't release
during the breakup

710
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,510
is bound to come out one day.

711
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,929
I think this is his lunacy coming out.

712
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,305
What lunacy is that?

713
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,057
He still has feelings for you.

714
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,351
Are you trying
to make me hopeful or scared?

715
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,561
Which is it?

716
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,357
-Shall we flip a coin?
-You're a goner.

717
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,193
I think you aren't over him either.

718
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,779
Get back together with him. Take the job.

719
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,447
So that you can get over him.

720
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,617
No, I won't see him.

721
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,287
I would rather get thrown out of my house

722
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,788
than take that crazy job.

723
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,749
You are sisters-in-law now, not friends.

724
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,459
Why did you get her a loan?

725
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,671
She's still like that
because you keep babying her.

726
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:59,467
Okay, I get what you mean.
Can't we let her come home?

727
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,177
No way.

728
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:04,222
She can't come home
until she pays us back ten million won.

729
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,394
My back hurts.

730
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,815
I should bill him for medical expenses.

731
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,776
That evil scumbag of a thief.

732
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,371
My necklace.

733
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:38,798
The ten million won.

734
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:43,511
I think you owe me that much
for giving your robot my face.

735
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:47,265
I'll do the job for you for free.

736
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,768
That is shamelessly illogical.

737
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,270
But the result is the same, so deal.

738
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,940
I hope that me doing this doesn't give you

739
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,817
the idea that I still have
feelings for you.

740
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,779
I also hope that you
don't think I asked you

741
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,489
because I have feelings for you.

742
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:05,700
What should I do?

743
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,786
Where did it go?

744
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,996
Did it fall on the floor?

745
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,750
This is insane. Where...

746
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:18,630
Hey.

747
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,717
Give me my money!
Give me my money, you jerk!

748
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,260
Give me my money!

749
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,641
That crazy President Cho!

750
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:31,810
NASTY JERK

751
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:35,397
Robots from previous generations
had clunky movements.

752
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:39,734
They moved like this.
Beetle, keep still. Look at me.

753
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,988
These days, state of the art robots
move like humans.

754
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,156
They move effortlessly in fluid motions.

755
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,284
Very smoothly like a human.

756
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:52,038
To look sideways,
turn your head first and then your body.

757
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,541
Walk smoothly. Do you understand?

758
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,585
-Yes.
-It's easy, right? Be smooth.

759
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,795
Hey, stay still.

760
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,177
Are you trying
to do the traditional masked dance?

761
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,887
-This is what you did.
-Are you being serious?

762
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,431
Did I really do that? Dr. Hong--

763
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,516
-Let's try it again.
-Okay.

764
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,062
First generation robots
used to put down objects like this.

765
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,814
Then they would just let go of it
irresponsibly.

766
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:20,483
But Aji 3 was different.
She would be very careful.

767
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,277
She would put it down slowly like this,

768
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,404
and she would make sure
not to make a sound.

769
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,573
You should give it a try. Go on.

770
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,491
You just made a sound.

771
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:36,916
That's right.

772
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,044
You need to put this on.

773
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,653
What is this? Is this all?

774
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,991
I thought there would be something more
since I had to act like a robot.

775
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:25,006
That contact lens
is a subminiature camera.

776
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,467
And this is a wireless transmitter.

777
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:29,928
Wear it on your wrist.

778
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,679
Hoktal, connect it with our network.

779
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,016
All done, sir.

780
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:43,358
-Incredible.
-You're connected to Aji 3 now.

781
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:47,654
To make it easier to understand,
you're Aji 3's avatar.

782
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:51,533
Aji 3 will be seeing and hearing
everything you see and hear.

783
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,076
Then the display will show you

784
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,578
what you need to do in text or video.

785
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,831
You just need to follow the instructions.

786
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:03,378
I love you, master. How may I help you?

787
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,046
I LOVE YOU, MASTER. HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

788
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:06,381
"I..."

789
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,761
Are you seriously asking me to say that?

790
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:16,015
Did you make me-looking robot say,
"I love you" to you every day?

791
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,934
Do you still have feelings for me?

792
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,061
What? "Feelings"?

793
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,189
What are you talking about?

794
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,484
I told you not to misunderstand.

795
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,194
Aji 3 is different from you.

796
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,030
She has everything you lack.
She's perfect.

797
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,782
Superior to you in every way.

798
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,535
Did you just say she's more perfect
and smarter than me?

799
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,203
In what ways?

800
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,415
She's just a robot.
She is no different from a doll.

801
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:43,418
Aji 3, analyze the stock market in Europe.

802
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,382
Wow.

803
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:53,636
Aji 3, read the most recent article
that got published on The Science.

804
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,846
Read the original text.

805
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,561
My gosh, this is incredible.

806
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,771
I feel like a genius.

807
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,523
You have an IQ level of 94.

808
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,568
However, Aji 3's IQ level is immeasurable.
She's the genius.

809
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,321
But how am I supposed to read this?
I can't speak English.

My gosh, what should we do?

812
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:31,049
Get out of the car and look for a bell.

813
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,635
-It's opening!
-My goodness.

814
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:34,886
My gosh.

815
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,429
We're here.

817
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,852
What do you want, nasty jerk?

818
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,272
You finally picked up your phone.

819
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,191
I was a little busy.

820
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:51,736
Did you finally decide to pay me?
Fine by me.

821
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:54,948
You took my necklace, didn't you?

822
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,407
What?

823
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,369
Why are you blaming me
for something that you lost?

824
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,288
You grabbed my necklace
and snatched it from my neck.

825
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,624
-Can't you remember?
-This is ridiculous.

826
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:08,836
You better give me back my necklace
before I actually sue you.

827
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,964
Hey, are you sick?

828
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,549
I'm being serious right now.

829
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,800
-Go see a doctor.
-What?

830
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,135
Mental Illness is not to be ashamed of.

831
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,887
Go see a doctor for your own good.

832
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,348
How dare you try me?

and 45 text messages.

-She's going in.
-She's going in right now.

My gosh, what a nice house.

837
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,166
This place feels like LA.

838
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,837
-I have a friend named Jane in LA.
-My gosh.

839
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,838
Is this a house?

840
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,716
Her red hair is really pretty.

841
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:59,679
My gosh, this place is like LA.
It reminds me of Jane.

-Turn off your cell phone.
-It's not mine.

843
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,891
-Turn it off, please.
-My gosh.

844
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:07,645
-Ji-a, turn off your phone.
-She brought her cell phone?

845
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:10,356
-Is she crazy? Turn it off.
-Ji-a, please turn off your phone.

My gosh.

847
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,026
Please turn it off.

848
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,695
You call me one more time,
I'll call the police.

849
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,322
-That's what I should be saying.
-Please--

850
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,282
If you don't give me back my necklace,

851
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,284
I'm going to chase you until...

852
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,455
My gosh, that crazy woman.

853
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,374
My gosh, that nasty jerk.

854
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,048
Here you go.

855
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,894
A glass of water would've been great.

856
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,881
I love you, master. How...
