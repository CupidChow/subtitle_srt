1
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:19,811
Fold your finger...

2
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,735
if you ever wished that the robot...

3
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,532
were human.

4
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,859
I'm...

5
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,447
not a robot.

6
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,383
I feel like Seon-hye got us good.

7
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,011
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,055
It's because I got on her bad side.

9
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,891
She is Ji-a's soulmate.

10
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,478
Based on Seon-hye's reaction,

11
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,439
I must have done something wrong to Ji-a.

12
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,402
I feel like I have a crush on her.

13
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,031
Despite everything,

14
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,325
you got this far.

15
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,160
It's all thanks to you.

16
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,997
If I didn't send
a threatening letter to MIT,

17
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,999
things wouldn't have turned out so badly.

18
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,794
If you want to apologize, fix Aji 3 soon.

19
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,462
Okay.

20
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,342
The moon is so bright.

21
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,221
It's a crescent moon.

22
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,314
Why are you touching his ear?

23
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,653
So that he can sleep.

24
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,072
-Go back to sleep.
-What is it?

25
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,580
There's a problem in the grip sensor.

26
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,623
She must be stabilized.

27
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,757
She's moving. Is she fixed?

28
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,217
She needs to be stabilized

29
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,760
and to be synchronized.

30
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,305
"Stabilized"?

31
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,224
-"Synchronized"?
-Here's what I mean.

32
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,518
Aji 3, grab a glass.

33
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,649
As you can see, the system is unstable.

34
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,860
While Aji 3 was deep-learning
with your data,

35
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,612
there was a conflict in the system.

36
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,781
Min-gyu shouldn't find out
when Aji 3 replaces you.

37
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,783
So this isn't good.

38
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,453
I understand.

39
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,622
After four days,
Aji 3 will take your place.

40
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,040
And the test will be over soon.

41
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,168
That's when I'm going
to tell Min-gyu everything.

42
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,755
Until then, you should never let him
find out that you're human.

43
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,134
The results of this test
is crucial for him as well.

44
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,637
Four days...

45
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,640
Okay, I'll wait.

46
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,310
By the way, I have a favor to ask.

47
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,271
Can I come to work
in the evening tomorrow?

48
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,233
I have to be somewhere in the afternoon.

49
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,943
Okay.

50
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,195
Thank you...

51
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,781
for explaining things in detail.

52
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,242
Leaving nothing in question for me.

53
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:36,025
I'm back in Korea.
I'll finally be able to meet Aji 3.

54
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,360
I have a patient this afternoon,

55
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,445
so would it be okay
if I pay you a quick visit?

56
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,283
You should come next time.

57
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,412
Why? Is there a problem with the robot?

58
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:48,955
No.

59
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,874
There is a problem with me.

60
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,376
What kind of problem?

61
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,296
You didn't ask for sleeping pills lately
so I thought you were fine.

62
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,006
Is there another problem?

63
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,967
It's an unpredicted problem.

64
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,844
I'll fix it today.

65
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,096
Well, I hope you take care of it.

66
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,389
Today, we take your blood sample.

67
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,640
Send it right away.

68
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,062
He was so happy that a robot liked him.

69
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,482
I wonder what happened in just two days.

70
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,943
What should I say to him?

71
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,446
How am I supposed to say hello?

72
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,200
Gosh, calm down.

73
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,660
Calm down.

74
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,296
Master.

75
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,184
Where are you?

76
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,813
Master.

77
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,608
Get changed.

78
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,402
We're going out.

79
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,323
What should I wear?

80
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,908
Wear something warm.

81
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,911
Your battery might die
because of the cold.

82
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,081
PRETTY ROOM

83
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,256
I can't let you wear that.

84
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,386
What's going on?

85
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,015
Is this...

86
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,268
a date?

87
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,174
I'll take everything
the mannequin is wearing.

88
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,217
Yes, sir.

89
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,410
Hold that bag.

90
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,710
Let's go.

91
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,923
What was that?

92
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,718
He didn't look at me.
And he didn't even say I look pretty.

93
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,137
What's the point of buying me stuff?

94
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,029
Excuse me. You have to come this way.

95
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,592
I'll prepare your preordered meal.

96
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,234
Thank you for agreeing to meet.

97
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:50,071
I wanted to have dinner
with you and Ri-el anyway.

98
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,077
No wonder.

99
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,165
But still,

100
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,210
he could've given me a heads up
so I could be prepared.

101
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:42,915
Well...

102
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,335
How is the food?

103
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,337
It's delicious. I like it.

104
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,464
I'm glad you like it.

105
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,050
I like it, too.

106
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,471
What is the important news
you wanted to share with us?

107
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,434
I would like to get engaged first.

108
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,734
I want to take the proper steps
for Ri-el's sake.

109
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,402
What are you talking about?

110
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,446
I never even got to kiss you yet.

111
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,240
That's a good idea.
The formalities matter.

112
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,701
-Dad.
-It's important to officially announce

113
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,829
that you and I are families.

114
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,915
That way, they won't try
to make any vain attempts.

115
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,501
I agree with you.

116
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,504
Excuse me, but I'm the one
who's getting married here.

117
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,590
Can you listen to my opinion as well?

118
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:33,966
Let's eat.

119
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,307
Please excuse me for a minute.

120
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,501
Since when did you have feelings
for Ri-el?

121
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,252
It's been 15 years.

122
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,841
Ri-el sent me birthday cards every year.

123
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,261
Thank you for that, Ri-el.

124
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,304
Birthday cards?

125
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,014
When did I...

126
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,811
She's very affectionate.

127
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,374
Dad, what was that earlier?

128
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,627
Did you send Min-gyu birthday cards
under my name?

129
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,628
Why would you--

130
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,798
If I sent them,
that also means you sent them.

131
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,676
You should go home first.

132
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,220
I'm going to tell Min-gyu the truth.

133
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,013
He thanked you for those cards.

134
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,224
If you tell him the truth,

135
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,809
it will end up hurting him.

136
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,270
This is so annoying.

137
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,897
Gosh, look at her.

138
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,900
She's not eating anything
in a restaurant that's so hard to book.

139
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,861
What a waste of money.

140
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,039
Get up. Let's go.

141
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,975
Are you okay?

142
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,269
What do you mean?

143
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,857
You can't eat what others cook.

144
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,360
-That's why--
-Are you really worried?

145
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,739
Or are you just saying
what's been input to you?

146
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,951
Why did you bring me with you today?

147
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,953
Because I needed you to be there.

148
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,709
Do you even remember
what you said last night?

149
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,003
I said I wished that you were human.

150
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,090
I remember everything I said. So what?

151
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,134
What meaning does that have?

152
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,595
Why?

153
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,015
Would you marry me or something?

154
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,021
If that bothers you,
delete it like you did last time.

155
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,149
I don't care if you remember it or not.

156
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,027
You're really nasty.

157
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,363
I said I would reset you
if you activate Friend Mode!

158
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,531
Reset me!

159
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,076
I still need to say it.
Why are you like this to me?

160
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,209
Why are you doing this to me?

161
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,879
Why must I care for your feelings
when you're just a robot?

162
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,257
Why make me wonder what you're thinking?

163
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,427
Why, when you don't even have
feelings or thoughts?

164
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:21,026
Compile a list of dresses
for Ri-el to wear.

165
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,321
That is your job as a robot.

166
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,265
What's wrong?

167
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,184
-Nothing's wrong.
-Did something happen with him?

168
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,686
Nothing happened.

169
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,815
What did that jerk do this time?

170
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,534
I said I wished that you were human.

171
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:11,994
So what?

172
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,121
What meaning does that have?

173
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,706
Why?

174
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,168
Would you marry me or something?

175
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,725
HONG-JU

176
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,727
Are you busy?

177
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,313
Can you take Dong-hyeon to see a doctor?

178
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,838
FROM RI-EL

179
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,800
I WISH YOU A HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

180
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,177
FROM RI-EL

181
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,846
The handwriting...

182
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,518
is all different.

183
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,944
Why didn't you notice this before,

184
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,363
Kim Min-gyu?

185
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,696
Welcome to my shop.

186
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,073
Hello and welcome.

187
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,993
Welcome to my shop.

188
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,161
My goodness.

189
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,705
Why does that look so much like a human?

190
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,916
Welcome to my shop.

191
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,502
Hello and welcome.

192
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,117
Get out.

193
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,410
Aji 3 isn't here.

194
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,829
You can talk from there.

195
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,580
You got much better. Get out.

196
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,249
I need to talk to you face-to-face.

197
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,093
What do you want to say?

198
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,887
I asked you
not to treat her with disrespect.

199
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,807
With disrespect?

200
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:07,938
You talk as if someone hurt
the robot's feelings.

201
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,648
She means a lot to me.

202
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,484
Doesn't she mean much to you?
She healed your illness.

203
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,154
She's a robot without feelings.

204
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,738
You trained her.

205
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,198
You spent time and effort.

206
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,158
So what?

207
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,994
Did your robot develop feelings?

208
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,289
That's not possible.

209
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,999
In the end, she is nothing.

210
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,625
How is she nothing?

211
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,753
Think of the time you spent together.
Is that nothing?

212
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,090
Everything you did became part of her.
How is that nothing?

213
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,842
If it's not nothing...

214
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:39,970
delete it.

215
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,181
It's that simple.

216
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,893
Kim Min-gyu.

217
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,607
Is he going through puberty?

218
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,613
Let's talk.

219
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,253
Ssanip ate food that Ji-a cooked.

220
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:17,007
I saw her give him
everything she had made, the whole lot.

221
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:23,055
Reflecting on ourselves
for thinking Ji-a is simple-minded,

222
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,433
I analyzed her data.

223
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:31,271
First, the reason she accepted
this part-time job was money.

224
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:35,442
But why did she come back
and agree to work for free?

225
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,946
She said I had paid her too much
and that she felt uncomfortable.

226
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,197
Doesn't that mean...

227
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,616
she cared about me a little?

228
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,534
Could that really be all?

229
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,869
At this juncture,

230
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,581
we should have a look at the items
in her suitcase.

231
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,668
This is baggage for accommodation.

232
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,255
But why did she pack
two bulky heart balls?

233
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,049
Why did she demand we let her stay here?

234
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,262
Because of me?

235
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,097
You are a constant.

236
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,142
But sometimes,
a variable controls the situation.

237
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,522
A while ago,
KM Financial hosted a competition

238
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,650
to encourage young entrepreneurs.

239
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:21,196
I found out that Ji-a's Heart Balls
had reached the final round.

240
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,074
I also found out,
after so much internet surfing,

241
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:28,161
that the precursor to this design
had reached the second round

242
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,539
of a competition four years ago.

243
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,127
Ji-a treated these heart balls
as if they were relics.

244
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,963
You failed to even recognize them,

245
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,298
but fixed them for her.

246
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,968
The single item that connects
the past and present.

247
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:47,514
Could these lamps
be your cause of the error?

248
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,099
That's my conclusion.

249
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,106
HYOSEONG VILLA

250
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,735
Gosh, that looks really bad.

251
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,069
Is it very itchy?

252
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,904
Is your nose runny?

253
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,033
I'm fine. Hold your horses, Auntie.

254
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,409
Sorry.

255
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,286
I had stomach cramps.

256
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,706
Hi, nephew.

257
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,167
Don't give your mom a hard time.

258
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,878
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

259
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,671
I'll be fine after some rest.

260
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,258
However, Dong-hyeon should see a doctor.

261
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,843
Have you eaten?

262
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,972
That looks delicious.

263
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,435
Wow! That looks really good.

264
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,062
It brings back memories.

265
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,105
At our school picnic,

266
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,108
the kids made fun of you
for bringing these.

267
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,195
I liked my rice balls a lot.

268
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,074
I was upset when no one
wanted to eat mine.

269
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,200
If you think about it,

270
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,203
It was really good,
considering a child made it.

271
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,538
Isn't it good?

272
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:08,053
I made an appointment
with the best allergy specialist in Korea.

273
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,264
It's her first appointment,
so explain things for me.

274
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,688
Dong-hyeon, it must've been really itchy.
Good job for not scratching.

275
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,692
Not only is she allergic to peanuts,

276
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,821
but she's also allergic
to green grapes, egg whites,

277
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,823
tomatoes, and tick.

278
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,158
-Could you get her scanned?
-Okay.

279
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,576
Come with me.

280
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,871
Confirmed allergies,
and her oxygen saturation isn't well.

281
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,123
I'll give her a prescription.

282
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,625
I'm worried. It's gotten worse recently.

283
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,544
The possibility is low,

284
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,922
but there could be an emergency,
so I'll also prescribe epinephrine.

285
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,676
Doctor.

286
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,762
May I ask you a question?

287
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:56,893
This may sound funny and ridiculous,

288
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:03,859
but is it possible
to be allergic to human contact?

289
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,952
There's only a few in this world,
but you can be allergic to human contact.

290
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,288
However, the treatment is difficult

291
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,790
because the cause
may also be psychological.

292
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,963
Why? Do you know someone
who has that allergy?

293
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,464
No.

294
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,927
How can you treat being allergic to human?

295
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:35,473
Someone was cured
by finding someone he could truly trust.

296
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,393
The human mind is interesting, isn't it?

297
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,315
Such an allergy does exist after all.

298
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,195
Is Min-gyu allergic to human beings?

299
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,323
But I am human.

300
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,409
I saw him having human contact.

301
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,788
It doesn't make sense.

302
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,710
Since you behaved at the hospital,
I have a present for you.

303
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,382
Hong-ju asked me to go grocery shopping.

304
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,093
Dong-hyeon, I'll be right back.

305
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,804
-Get me some snacks, please.
-Don't tell Mom.

306
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,936
SUMMER SNOW

307
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,323
I need to use the bathroom.

308
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,618
It will take some time.
If customers come--

309
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,663
I know. I'll keep them here.

310
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,290
You're the best, Dong-hyeon.

311
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,616
For me, it's peanuts.

312
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,661
What?

313
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,038
I'm allergic to peanuts.

314
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,040
What are you allergic to?

315
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,128
It's worse than yours.

316
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:31,298
I'm also allergic to tick, eggs,
and tomatoes.

317
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,675
I'm allergic to one thing.

318
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,885
But it's very bad.

319
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,387
I'm Dong-hyeon.

320
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,307
-What?
-I'm Cho Dong-hyeon.

321
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,059
That's my name. What's yours?

322
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,109
Kim Min-gyu.

323
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,528
My aunt doesn't have a boyfriend.

324
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,783
What does that have to do with me?

325
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,328
My aunt made it.

326
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,208
Is that for me?

327
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,668
No, it's mine.

328
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:16,217
My aunt went on a picnic
when she was my age.

329
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,845
She didn't know how to make gimbap,

330
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:22,057
so she made herself rice balls like this.

331
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,017
That was the first time she made them.

332
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,604
Why would a child make gimbap?

333
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,649
She didn't have anyone to make it for her.

334
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,360
It's really delicious.

335
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,198
I bet...

336
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,285
a lot of kids made fun of her
at the picnic.

337
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,537
No one ate with her,

338
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,207
but my mom did.

339
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,418
That's why
she became my mom's guardian angel.

340
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,884
Are you Kim Min-gyu?

341
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,807
Thanks to your help, I got engaged.

342
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:10,855
Does the person who took away
your first kiss know about it?

343
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,357
She does.

344
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,150
She was next to me when it happened.

345
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,653
What a nasty jerk.

346
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,030
Pardon me?

347
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,200
A jerk passed by over there.

348
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,204
Look at that idiot.

349
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,498
What?

350
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,628
I'm sure you didn't come here to say that.

351
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:43,138
At that time,
you said that she and I flirt.

352
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,558
Do you think she was...

353
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,602
interested in me?

354
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,064
Yes, definitely.

355
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,024
What makes you say that?

356
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,490
RICE CAKE

357
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,912
PICKLED FISH

358
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:15,128
That pickled fish is specially made
for Researcher Number One...

359
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,672
from Masan.

360
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:22,051
She was staring at you all the time.

361
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,513
The eyes always follow the heart.

362
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,350
The heart?

363
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,773
There's no way to verify that.

364
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,692
How can you verify something invisible?

365
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,945
What you feel is the most certain.

366
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,073
That's all I'll say.

367
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,159
If I we continue,

368
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,370
I might start punching you.

369
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,300
Are you willing to accept her feelings?

370
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,265
Regardless of how she looks?

371
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,554
Please give me a cup of coffee
with a lot of syrup.

372
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,264
I'm craving something sweet.

373
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,767
A really pitiful man came by earlier.

374
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,353
What a great timing.

375
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,898
I heard he is going to get engaged.
He came by just now.

376
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,776
Did he come all the way here
to tell you that?

377
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,862
So confessing your love is up over?

378
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,746
Are you willing to accept her feelings?

379
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:18,126
Regardless of how she looks?

380
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,422
I hope you'll recognize me
even if I change.

381
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,383
Regardless of what I look like.

382
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,437
What did you just say?

383
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,689
Marry me.

384
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,734
I think...

385
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,070
you like me too.

386
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,323
-Me?
-Yes.

387
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,283
Why else would you be here?

388
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,827
Because you said it was urgent.

389
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,829
Still, in the middle of a date...

390
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,915
you came to see another man.

391
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,042
You're no man to me. You're just a friend.

392
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,339
Am I really...

393
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,092
not a man to you at all?

394
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,264
I'm going to marry your friend.

395
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,141
Watch your manners.

396
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,936
I'll let you off tonight
since you're drunk.

397
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,911
How long were you standing there?

398
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,128
I'm getting engaged to Min-gyu.

399
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,423
Let's all eat out together
and patch things up.

400
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,467
We'll have to bump into each other.

401
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,376
Hello?

402
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,796
I'm Jang Du-sam.

403
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,340
-Hi.
-Tell Director Kim Min-gyu.

404
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,261
If he promises to put Chairman Hwang away,
I'll give him all the recordings I have.

405
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,264
Okay. I'll call you back.

406
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,274
-Mr. Cho.
-Yes?

407
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,485
-Mr. Yoon.
-Great timing.

408
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,862
Come with me.

409
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:53,698
Sure.

410
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,243
Come in.

411
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,996
CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE

412
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,128
Are you Cho Jin-bae?

413
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,130
-Yes, sir.
-Have a seat.

414
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:16,262
I would like you to help CEO Hwang.

415
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,767
I know what you do for Kim Min-gyu.

416
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,727
I'm not telling you to stop.

417
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,230
Whatever you find out,
I want us to know first.

418
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,985
KM Financial will go through
a company-wide personnel changes.

419
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,864
The system in which Min-gyu lorded over us

420
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,949
will become history.

421
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,220
Do you think he sided with us?

422
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,013
He doesn't have to...

423
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,224
as long as he's not with Kim.

424
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,059
What about Jang Du-sam?

425
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,979
The robotics industry
isn't profitable yet.

426
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,524
Kim Min-gyu won't invest.

427
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:13,277
Why don't you sell that part
to Britain's Bold Group?

428
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,279
I know Martin Bold very well.

429
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,572
Chairman Hwang.

430
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:20,326
I can persuade Director Kim.

431
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,703
I just need your support.

432
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,458
Either way, I'm quite impressed,
Chairman Park.

433
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,962
How did you think of developing
such a robot

434
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,214
under the name of R&D?

435
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:38,761
We must find him before Min-gyu does.

436
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,848
-Yes, sir.
-So, what about Aji 3?

437
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,559
Just tell him how you feel.

438
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,644
It's wrong for a robot to love a human,

439
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,813
but not for a human to love another human.

440
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,191
It's not like you're an alien.

441
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:57,113
Would Min-gyu kill you or something
for not being a robot?

442
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:01,409
I had a plan set up to tell him
when the test is done.

443
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,370
But think about it.
He insults me when he thinks I'm a robot.

444
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,415
He would really want to kill me
if he knew I'm human.

445
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,541
No way.

446
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,171
Let's wear this to the presentation.

447
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,549
Even your brother won't recognize you.

448
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,134
Even I would ignore you.

449
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,136
This is awesome.

450
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:24,015
We need to look super tough
so they don't look down on us.

451
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,476
Yes. You're the crazy witch
of the neighborhood.

452
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,146
-Let's go to KM Financial.
-Let's go.

453
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,111
Aji 3 ate something?

454
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,322
Yes. Ice cream.

455
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,282
But she's a robot.

456
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,868
I didn't see it. He did.

457
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,161
She really ate.

458
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,164
Like this.

459
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,166
Then she's human, not a robot?

460
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,585
No, she definitely is a robot.

461
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,962
A robot ate ice cream?

462
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,173
I stabbed her with this.

463
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,966
It snapped in two.

464
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,636
As if it had made contact with steel.

465
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,890
Any human being would've screamed
and bled like crazy.

466
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,267
But she didn't even flinch.

467
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,853
I think she's an incredible robot, Uncle.

468
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,314
The last abduction attempt failed

469
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,441
because we were checking
if she was human or not.

470
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,151
But next time, we will--

471
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,110
Are you kidding me?

472
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,279
What kind of an excuse is that?

473
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,739
A real robot--

474
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,494
The ex-head
of the Social Contribution Team

475
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,746
hired you nitwits and ran?

476
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,749
How much did he pay you?

477
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,962
We got 30 million won upfront...

478
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,422
with 30 million more to come.

479
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:43,386
The remaining 40 million, he embezzled.

480
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,721
My goodness.

481
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,183
You have one more chance.

482
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:54,105
You have three days
to bring Aji 3 to me, okay?

483
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,080
What's the matter?

484
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:12,873
Is it uncooked?

485
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,252
Why are you so nice to me lately?
It's so weird.

486
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,006
-Do you not like it?
-It's not like...

487
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,927
I'm afraid you want me
to do something else for you.

488
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,519
You reached the final stage.

489
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,814
-What?
-Of KM Financial's competition.

490
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,652
Slow down, I won't steal your food.

491
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:45,114
Director Kim won't judge it.
The Social Contribution Team will.

492
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,200
I'll wear a disguise
so even my brother won't recognize me.

493
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,494
You really don't have to worry.

494
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,830
I could've helped you
if you had told me sooner.

495
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,291
There's nothing to help me with.

496
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,502
Four years ago,

497
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,172
you entered a competition
with the same item.

498
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,757
How did that work out?

499
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,967
You took long enough to ask.

500
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,180
Of course, I didn't win.

501
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,140
But I'm confident this time.

502
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:15,478
Someone called me a genius. A craftsman.

503
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,313
What lunatic called you that?

504
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,857
He said that to con you.

505
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,739
Why didn't you call me when you failed?

506
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,991
I did and you didn't pick up.

507
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,284
I didn't pick up?

508
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,745
Then you should've come to--

509
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,501
You did. You came to see me.

510
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,505
That day...

511
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,300
wasn't the day we broke up, was it?

512
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,894
UNIVERSITY STUDENT IDEA COMPETITION

513
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,857
When members of a family get into a fight,

514
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,236
they go into their own rooms.

515
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,864
You can use this
to show you want to reconcile.

516
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,699
So basically...

517
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,494
it connects a heart to another--

518
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,371
What about mobile phones?

519
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,208
Ji-a, did you apply
to add something to your resume?

520
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:27,800
We have to align the axes
of the eight-bit joints.

521
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,138
Won't that section become too thick
and look weird?

522
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,976
If the axes aren't aligned,
the inverse kinematics might not work.

523
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,437
The person you are calling
cannot answer the phone.

524
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,689
You will be connected to voicemail.

525
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,611
Are you at the lab?

526
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,905
Were you up all last night again?

527
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,702
I miss you so much right now.

528
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,457
I'll come over right now.
Can I just see your face?

529
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,980
HEART BALL

530
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,823
If we use the Jacobi method,
there won't be any problems.

531
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,367
You're all smiles.
Are you getting somewhere?

532
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,244
I think we'll get some good results.

533
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,329
Good luck.

534
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,207
-Ji-a is in your office.
-Is she?

535
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,708
Did she ask you to make her stuff again?

536
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,003
Don't help her too much.
You're just encouraging her.

537
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,841
I like to help her.
She never asks me for help.

538
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,885
It's the same thing. She's so clueless.

539
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,721
She's my girlfriend. Watch your manners.

540
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,105
What are you doing here?

541
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,066
Hello.

542
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:10,236
Why do you do things I didn't ask?
Think before you act.

543
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,695
Did I ask you to clean up here?

544
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,656
Are you a janitor?

545
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,012
Ji-a, I found a new route
to the search algorithm.

546
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,598
The thing that you had been pulling
your hair out about?

547
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,516
How?

548
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,143
The core of emotional communication
between a human and a robot

549
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,311
is pattern recognition.

550
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,398
It's about how quickly and accurately

551
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,109
the robot can patternize
and pick up human emotions.

552
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:53,779
The three-dimensional data
will turn into a layer of horizontal lines

553
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,239
and extract patterns.

554
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,826
With great accuracy and great speed.

555
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,620
-You didn't get it.
-I didn't.

556
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,164
But I know that it's something incredible.

557
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,208
A robot that can communicate feelings.

558
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,127
I will make it.

559
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,462
Congratulations.

560
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,721
MIT wants me to come right away.

561
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,639
Then, you'll go to America?

562
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:21,557
Yes.

563
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,225
You should study English.

564
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,769
I'm coming too?

565
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:26,729
Of course.

566
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,648
Come with me and do whatever you want.

567
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,984
Don't waste time with pointless endeavors.

568
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,407
What...

569
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:40,993
do you mean?

570
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,579
You said you're tired. Just don't do it.

571
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,581
You keep doing what makes you tired.

572
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:46,957
We're not the same.

573
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:54,882
Let's break up.

574
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,641
Let's never see each other again.

575
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,434
Take care.

576
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:37,383
The night before he died,
Chairman Park Seong-jin met Hwang Do-won.

577
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,677
And there's a recording

578
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,512
of that conversation?

579
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,429
Yes.

580
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,767
Chairman Hwang knew from early on
that Santa Maria developed robots.

581
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,312
You know very well...

582
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,189
what that means.

583
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:55,943
It's evidence that Chairman Hwang
knowingly sold Daeyang for nothing.

584
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,489
We can't press legal charges,
but can dismiss him from the board.

585
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,117
His son, CEO Hwang,
can't avoid the blame either.

586
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,119
He was at the helm
of Daeyang Shipbuilding's sale.

587
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:10,124
There's no way they didn't pocket part
of the profits they must've made.

588
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,250
I agree.

589
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,001
The rebates must've been enormous.

590
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,047
It's like when Yoosung Group made a profit
by failing to disclose information.

591
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,842
Give Jang Du-sam my contact information
as he wants.

592
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:24,763
To protect Santa Maria,
I need the recording

593
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,266
before they find out it exists.

594
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:30,936
I'll give you my ID and password
with which you can access everything

595
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,938
about KM Financial.

596
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,107
Get more evidence.

597
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,609
-There's no time.
-Yes, sir.

598
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,239
What time will you come
into work tomorrow?

599
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,740
What?

600
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,119
You told me to go ahead
with the start-up support system.

601
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,996
I thought you could attend.

602
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,832
The Social Contribution Team
will handle that.

603
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:52,833
Yes, sir.

604
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,923
I'm sorry for having the wrong idea
about you.

605
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,346
A bo...

606
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,099
A bonus.

607
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:13,479
When this is over,
I'll give you a month's salary.

608
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:16,482
Three hundred percent.

609
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:19,818
Two hundred.

610
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:21,862
That's final.

611
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,614
Sure.

612
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,121
The moon was bright?

613
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,332
"The crescent moon's so bright."

614
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:36,043
I know. It was a crescent moon.

615
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,836
But it was so bright.

616
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,963
-Where did you go without me?
-We didn't leave.

617
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,216
I saw you two leave.

618
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,678
You left me on the bench in the cold
and walked off, I saw you go.

619
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,181
-We didn't.
-Stop imagining things.

620
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,599
-What?
-Did you two...

621
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,435
kiss or something?

622
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,811
Kiss? What?

623
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,941
Seon-hye wanted to go to the toilet
and I walked her.

624
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,527
You're scaring me now.
Can you please stop?

625
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,028
You're scaring me.

626
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,364
Can you stop so we can go inside?

627
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,823
You're buying...

628
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,243
the coffee today. I'm freezing.

629
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,330
Why should I keep buying
when you're up to no good?

630
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,133
Do you like my coffee that much?

631
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,677
It's cheap.

632
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,097
I love your coffee.

633
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,184
It's not acid enough for me.

634
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,605
Do you know that coffee and dating
is very similar?

635
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:43,860
You mix various beans,
roast them, taste them.

636
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,446
You look for the blend
that suits your taste.

637
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,615
Dating is like that.

638
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,118
It is. It is looking for...

639
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,620
your perfect match.

640
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:55,872
That's dating.

641
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,250
It's not easy to find something perfect.

642
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,419
If nothing is to your taste,

643
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:01,962
why keep coming back?

644
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,257
Because it's cheap.

645
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,386
-What an odd way to play.
-What?

646
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,762
-What?
-You said something.

647
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,264
Let me join in.

648
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,308
She mumbled like this last time.

649
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,022
Oh, hello, Doctor.

650
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,024
Help me.

651
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,444
I know I made a lot of mistakes.

652
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,112
So help me.

653
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:32,451
-Don't we have electricity?
-This isn't working.

654
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:35,078
-Why isn't this working?
-What's wrong?

655
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,125
You should have told us.

656
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,127
We are all willing to help.

657
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,838
Yes. You can take first place
and second place too.

658
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:47,591
You promised me a bonus and insurance.

659
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,217
What?

660
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:51,970
Sorry, everyone.

661
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,014
And thank you.

662
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,224
The final stage
will be held like a flea market.

663
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,352
That means it must be fun.

664
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,146
Pretend that we're judges
and explain your entry.

665
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,233
Are you there?

666
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,612
I'm right here.

667
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,115
Wherever they are,
however far apart they are,

668
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,409
these two are always connected.

669
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,790
Is...

670
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,125
something wrong?

671
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:27,839
Ji-a, did you study quantum physics
or something?

672
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,009
What's that?

673
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,763
That's it.

674
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:40,352
It's a theory where two particles
that are far apart are still connected,

675
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:44,523
so the action of one particle
influences that of the other.

676
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:48,694
However far apart in the world they are,
they're connected.

677
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,404
That's fascinating.

678
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,072
Yes, it's fascinating.

679
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,825
We burst our heads open to study that
and you just got it?

680
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:58,203
The real genius is right here.

681
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:03,125
Do I have the right
to join your group of geniuses now?

682
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,251
You're in.

683
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,920
Give me one later on. I want one.

684
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,923
-To give to whom? Tell me.
-My mom.

685
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,758
Can we go on?

There's something my dad always said.

693
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,760
"One person is enough."

694
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:44,142
Just one person is enough
to keep a person going.

695
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,445
We are searching for that one person

696
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,073
and hope to be that one person
for someone else.

697
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:04,162
That person can be the one
and only meaning in my life.

698
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:15,173
And I hope that person will be the star
that lights up my path.

699
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:27,227
You may already be someone's one
and only special person.

701
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,836
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

702
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,463
I can feel our baby kicking.

703
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,549
-Can you?
-Yes.

704
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,944
Why isn't he picking up?
Did something happen to him?

705
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,322
Results from his blood are amazing.

706
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,991

00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,567
Thank you so much, Ji-a.

00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:42,737
We were able to come this far
because of you.

716
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,156
-You're right.
-I agree. Thank you.

717
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,909
Gosh, don't thank me.
All I did was encourage you.

718
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,328
It's all thanks to everyone's efforts.

719
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,123
Let's all do our best today,

720
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,667
and let's clap
for whoever wins the contest.

721
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,961
-Okay.
-Okay. Good luck

722
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:58,962
Good luck.

723
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,507
Did you want to see me, sir?

724
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:07,846
Reregister the supervisor
of today's contest as the CEO.

725
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,976
Why is CEO Hwang suddenly taking part?

726
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,562
It's his gesture of trying to support you.

727
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,689
The person in charge
will get a good evaluation

728
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,524
if a contest becomes supervised
by the CEO.

729
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,704
Thank you for being considerate.

730
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,457
It's for Ri-el.

731
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,472
Hello.

732
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,767
-KM Financial, please.
-Okay.

733
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,437
FINAL SCREENING OF
NEW START-UP ITEM CONTEST

734
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,816
LEE JEONG-CHEOL,
YE RI-EL

735
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:04,986
CEO HWANG YU-CHEOL

736
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,827
Hi. I'm Ye Ri-El,
the head of Social Contribution Team.

737
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,246
And I'm in charge
of today's final screening.

738
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,999
First of all,
as the person in charge of this project,

739
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:23,838
I'm very honored to be able to gather
such competent entrepreneurs in one place.

740
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:29,010
And today, the CEO of KM Financial
will join us as the judge.

741
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,681
He's the one who'll be giving one of you
100 million won.

742
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,267
Please welcome him
with a round of applause.

743
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,551
Do you realize what you've done?

744
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,803
You could've killed someone!

745
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,972
Did you know about it, too?

746
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,682
Did you all know?

747
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,310
He could've died because of me.

748
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,687
You didn't think about that, did you?

749
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,981
Ji-a, we'll tell him everything.

750
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,025
Are you listening?
You can't tell him the truth.

751
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:09,986
You can never run into him.

752
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:12,363
What are you going to do now, Kim Min-gyu?

753
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,868
