1
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:24,983
Yes, Doctor.

2
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,235
I have to spend the night here.
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

3
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,571
-We're not done yet.
-Okay.

4
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,699
Doctor is coming back tomorrow morning.

5
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,035
In that case...

6
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,039
-Hey.
-Hurry up.

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,796
We're taking Aji 3.

8
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,007
Wait.

9
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,217
Wait a minute.

10
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,722
If you didn't have dinner yet...

11
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,265
We already ate.

12
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,185
I see.

13
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,187
They already ate.

14
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,275
Hanwoo beef.

15
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:08,985
Steak.

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,071
Abalone.

17
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,115
-Braised spicy seafood.
-Hoktal.

18
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,576
I also have lobsters.

19
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,370
Let's eat. He prepared it for us.

20
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,455
Ssanip.

21
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,332
Do you have enough for us?

22
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,851
-Cool!
-Wait a minute.

23
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,228
What?

24
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,275
That pickled fish is specially made
for Researcher Number One...

25
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,820
from Masan.

26
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,322
For Researcher Number Two,

27
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,366
I prepared a cheese dish.

28
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,369
That's for you who studied in the States.

29
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,621
For Researcher Number Three,

30
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,957
I couldn't come up with anything.
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,047
Don't you know our names?

32
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,258
Is that necessary?

33
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,431
What kind of fish is this?
I've never seen it before.

34
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,934
Even my grandpa wouldn't like it.

35
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,896
My hometown may be Masan,

36
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,648
but I eat like people in Seoul.

37
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,359
I don't want this either.

38
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,986
When I was short on money in the US,

39
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,655
I ate something like this every day.

40
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,199
Fine, I'll eat them instead.

41
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,329
What?

42
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,795
This is...

43
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,009
dope. So freaking delicious.

44
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,720
What's wrong?

45
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,931
-What?
-I knew you lack manners,

46
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,309
but you cooked
and still managed to upset them.

47
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,227
How can you just eat?

48
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,687
You told me to cook for them.

49
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,065
To ask them a favor,
you must get to know them better.

50
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,192
Start a conversation naturally.

51
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,446
If they ask you questions,
answer them honestly.

52
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,074
-Fine, I will.
-Okay.

53
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,961
What do...

54
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,590
your parents do in the US?

55
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,471
They run a laundromat.
They're 1.5 generation immigrants.

56
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,433
What do your parents do?

57
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,979
They're lying in the grave side by side.

58
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,735
How did it happen?

59
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,987
Half of their car...

60
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,073
crashed into a truck.

61
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,742
It got bent.

62
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,577
It was destroyed.

63
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,288
Only I survived.

64
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,808
Dr. Hong is looking for a new investor?

65
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,559
Yes, I'm sure of it.

66
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,603
Did he get on bad terms with Director Kim?

67
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,105
I don't care about that.

68
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,690
This is our golden chance.

69
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,609
Do you know what must be done?

70
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,404
Yes, I'll give my orders.

71
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,074
Thank you.

72
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,036
Thank you.

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,873
He's the smartest of all my pupils.

74
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,209
He does excellent research as well.

75
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,003
I guarantee it.

76
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,379
Let me pour you a drink.

77
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,183
CHOI JEONG-GUK
HANBYEOL FUTURE INDUSTRY

78
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,155
They ate everything I cooked.

79
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,407
Does that mean they'll do me a favor?

80
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,950
The time is now.

81
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm happy that you enjoyed my food.

82
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:39,922
Where would you have a chance
to eat such fancy food, right?

83
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,802
I promise you.

84
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,721
If you stay at my house--

85
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,934
You cooked so much for nothing.

86
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,021
I was taught to never leave food
on my plate.

87
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,649
I forced myself to finish it,
and now my stomach hurts.

88
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,609
Let's go.

89
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,736
Wait.

90
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,113
After finishing all the food,

91
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,200
you can't just leave like this.

92
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,785
Did we ask for it?

93
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,288
You're being impolite.

94
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,791
If you enjoyed it, do the dishes at least.

95
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,125
You're just going to leave?

96
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,006
Hoktal is amazing at doing dishes.

97
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,176
You're good at cleaning up.

98
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,972
What?

99
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,402
Pai.

100
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,282
Can't we...

101
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,953
just stay?

102
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,289
After losing his parents,

103
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,751
he lived alone in this big house
for 15 years.

104
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,047
He's not strange. He's just awkward.

105
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,550
He's softhearted.

106
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,014
You'll see if you give him more time.

107
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,809
It's already over.

108
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,271
Doctor is meeting investors now.

109
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,698
Then...

110
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,410
before you leave,

111
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,246
can you thank him for dinner?

112
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:41,919
I hope that he remembers today
on a positive note.

113
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,547
No.

114
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,593
Unless we'll see him again,
it's better to end badly.

115
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,559
AJI 3 REMOTE CONTROL

116
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,352
Come to my room.

117
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,938
Aji 3.

118
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,421
I feel nauseous.

119
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,470
What should I do...

120
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,059
to make them open up to me?

121
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,232
It's difficult.

122
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,529
It's too difficult.

123
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,046
You did your best.

124
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,926
All right, shall I go?

125
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:55,886
I'll go...

126
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,514
and do whatever it takes.

127
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,289
-What do you think you're doing?
-My gosh.

128
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:27,126
Pretty, are you okay? Did you get hurt?

129
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,088
What? What's wrong with you?

130
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,008
Are you okay? Wake up.

131
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,302
I noticed that it was broken a while ago.

132
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,180
We'll fix it for you.
We can fix it in no time.

133
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,890
-Hand it over.
-My gosh.

134
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,559
-Give it.
-Let us take a look.

135
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:44,935
My gosh.

136
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,896
Put it down.

137
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,534
You're back.

138
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,622
I'm so glad, my pretty.

139
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,169
It has a face now.

140
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,464
We gave it some finishing touches
while fixing it.

141
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,257
It'll cry when the filter's dirty,

142
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,759
and smile when it's clean.

143
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,261
You're back.

144
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,263
I'm so relieved.

145
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,188
He's not a pervert.

146
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,566
He's really kissing a machine.

147
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,653
I guess he was always just like that.

148
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,283
Gosh, I'm thirsty. I'm craving some beer.

149
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,912
I haven't used my brain in so long,
so I'm starting to get hungry.

150
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,664
Well...

151
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,083
I...

152
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,919
I have chicken.

153
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,464
I have Korean chicken at home.
The one with really big legs.

154
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,551
"The one with really big legs"?

155
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,718
Yes, it's over there.

156
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,432
-I want to eat chicken legs.
-No, you can't.

157
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,309
If you eat chicken legs, you'll run away.

158
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,353
This is so annoying.

159
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,106
Then you should eat chicken legs
and run away.

160
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,150
Please go somewhere far away.

161
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:24,118
I have a question for you guys.

162
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,621
I offered you a lot of money earlier.

163
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,793
I don't understand why you refused
to take my offer.

164
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,338
That was a huge sum of money.

165
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,966
You could take that money
to convince Doctor Hong.

166
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,720
He already made up his mind.

167
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,225
My gosh, you guys must trust him a lot.

168
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,936
Those who cannot trust anyone...

169
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,106
can never earn the trust of others.

170
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,694
I wonder why I'm suddenly reminded
of that saying.

171
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,654
What is she saying?

172
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,575
I want to eat chicken wings.

173
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,743
No.

174
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,746
-If you eat chicken wings--
-You'll fly away.

175
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,830
You'll fly away.

176
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,626
-You'll fly away.
-You lunatic. You know it all.

177
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,003
-Gosh.
-Please fly off to somewhere far.

178
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,129
Go ahead.

179
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,009
I'm sorry.

180
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,303
I'm sorry, too.

181
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,140
Come on.

182
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,144
-My gosh.
-Here.

183
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,106
Eat this wing
and fly off as far as you can.

184
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,067
It's okay.

185
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,276
My gosh.

186
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,615
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING
SANTA MARIA

187
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,451
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,622
Someone must have told them
about what happened in the States.

189
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,501
I tried my best,
but I don't think it will work.

190
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,302
Hello?

191
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,805
Yes, it's me.

192
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,974
You want to invest?

193
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,664
Aji 3?

194
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,004
What?

195
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,797
Where are they?

196
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,929
My gosh.

197
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:51,849
Yes, Doctor Hong.

198
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,560
We're on our way back from a walk.

199
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,270
Yes.

200
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,315
Tell him you came here for your bag.

201
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,525
Don't ever tell him
you slept at Mr. Baton's house.

202
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,986
-Hurry up.
-My gosh.

203
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,490
My goodness.

204
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,244
Why are you coming in with them?

205
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,414
I came to get my bag.

206
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,042
-Oh, I see.
-We met her right outside.

207
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,460
One, two, one, two.

208
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,505
Okay, take your bag.
I want everyone's attention.

209
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,424
We have a new investor.

210
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,468
He wants us to bring Aji 3 for a preview.

211
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,511
We can't show him a perfect preview yet.

212
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,513
Meet him once all the parts are stable.

213
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,724
She just can't walk.
Everything else works fine.

214
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,768
We can take her on a wheelchair
and convince him.

215
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,394
Hurry up. We have no time.

216
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,023
-Okay, let's go. Let's do this.
-Okay.

217
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,107
Well...

218
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,618
Doctor Hong is going to park his van here.

219
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,954
Before he takes Aji 3 out,

220
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,581
tell him that you wish
to drink tea with his team.

221
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,417
Then take them to the café
on the first floor.

222
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,419
-And then?
-Then,

223
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,631
I'm going to take the van
that has Aji 3 inside.

224
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,467
You're going to come outside

225
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,387
saying that you really need
to go to the bathroom

226
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,805
and wait for me at the entrance.

227
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,057
Then I'll come and pick you up.

228
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,810
What if someone says they'll stay
inside the van?

229
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,692
-Holy cow!
-My goodness.

230
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,213
I asked the US branch,

231
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,966
and it seems like a fellow professor
slandered Doctor Hong.

232
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,969
He dropped the lawsuit
to protect his teammates.

233
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,930
He gave all his research materials
to that fellow professor.

234
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,019
Okay. Thank you.

235
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,968
Should I take this MOCCT apart
before we unplug the power cable?

236
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,511
Wait. Let me check first.

237
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,764
Hoktal, check the NTS.

238
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,765
Okay.

239
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,143
The NTS is backed up. Check.

240
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,687
The other parts are all backed up as well.

241
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,398
I'm going to remove the cables now.

242
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,859
-All done.
-Turn it off.

243
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,569
Okay, I'm going to unplug it now.

244
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,654
All done.

245
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,573
I'll remove the power cable now.

246
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,703
Wait.

247
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,122
I'll drop you off.

248
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,126
May I go inside?

249
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,189
We found a new investor.

250
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,899
We'll be able to leave soon.

251
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,985
What is that you want to say?

252
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,239
We need to go now.

253
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,575
I found out...

254
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,789
why they call you the crook in science.

255
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,671
The branch manager of KM Massachusetts
is best friends with the state senator.

256
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,214
That's how...

257
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,008
I was able to find out
everything in detail.

258
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,971
I asked him to help you...

259
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,140
regain your reputation.

260
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,851
Who do you think you are?

261
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,771
Who do you think you are
to help me regain my reputation?

262
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,523
You were falsely accused.

263
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,899
I don't care what happened.

264
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,153
I'm going to regain my reputation
on my own.

265
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,989
If you came here to say that, piss off.

266
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,493
I guess Aji 3 was right.

267
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,745
I guess I'm really bad...

268
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,291
at talking to people.

269
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,023
What are you doing?

270
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,608
Let me go.

271
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,026
Let go--

272
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,504
Help me...

273
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,216
Baek-gyun.

274
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:25,474
I'll tell you in one sentence
how great your accomplishment is.

275
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,393
The robot you made...

276
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,646
saved a life.

277
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,392
I actually feel a bit sad
that we have to leave.

278
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,728
Mr. Baton isn't a pervert.

279
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,898
Doesn't that mean we can stay?

280
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,025
Shall I talk to Doctor Hong?

281
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,486
Do you still not know what he's like?

282
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,948
Whatever he decides to do,
once he decides, it's final.

283
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,492
There's no way the new lab
will have a pool.

284
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,786
Or a gym.

285
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,758
It's time, Doctor.

286
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,260
The investor is waiting.

287
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,349
Let's go.

288
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,705

289
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,179
MEDICAL CHECKUP FOR ENLISTMENT

290
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,556
I've had four military
physical examination so far.

291
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,643
The Pathological Society
doesn't acknowledge my illness.

292
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,104
They believe it doesn't exist.

293
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,065
Of course, there's no treatment.

294
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:43,320
So each time a new allergy medicine
is released,

295
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,782
I buy some and test it on myself.

296
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,956
I know you call me Mr. Baton.

297
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,959
No one knows it's a weapon...

298
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,087
that keeps me alive.

299
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,005
That's how I lived...

300
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,382
for 15 years.

301
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,302
I had prepared myself

302
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:11,056
to live this way
for the rest of my life until...

303
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,479
I met a miracle.

304
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,274
Aji 3.

305
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,738
We're turning back.

306
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:30,867
Doctor.

307
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,332
Don't do it if you don't want to.

308
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:38,250
I'll do it.

309
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,418
Don't if you're bothered at all.

310
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,336
I'm in.

311
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,964
Can't you at least think a bit first?

312
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,259
It's the first time.

313
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,262
-What is?
-That you asked me first.

314
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,013
I never asked?

315
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,475
Anyway, thanks for everything.

316
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,484
We had the wrong idea about Director Kim.

317
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,612
He explained it
and promised the 50 billion won fundings.

318
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,489
There's no reason to leave.

319
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,950
I decided to stay.

320
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,706
Pai, let's talk.

321
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,218
I'm against it.

322
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,263
Is it because of Cho Ji-a?

323
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,682
Do you want to keep her close?

324
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,393
-No.
-Then what is it?

325
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,396
Mr. Baton hasn't found it out yet.

326
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,566
You know this is the last chance
to set everything straight.

327
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,445
If he finds out,
you'll be named a fraud yet again.

328
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,530
What will you do then?

329
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,534
The results of the test
were way beyond anything we imagined.

330
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,827
Whatever it was...

331
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,455
it was all Ji-a's doing.

332
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,456
No.

333
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,792
Director Kim thinks Ji-a is a robot.

334
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,920
Aji 3 did it.

335
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,298
When the new part arrives and we fix her,

336
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,300
Aji 3 will take her place.

337
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,802
Pai.

338
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,555
I want to see how this ends.

339
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,141
We did something amazing.

340
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,812
That is the reason we make robots.

341
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,157
Our plan fell through.

342
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,286
Shall I put Plan B in motion?

343
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,916
Okay. Got it.

344
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,254
What is it? Do they want the money back?

345
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,464
We must get her by all means.

346
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,883
This robot.

348
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,281
If you sign the agreement,

349
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:18,285
KM's board will approve it,
and then you will receive the money.

350
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,413
We will also discuss the new laboratory.

351
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,669
Do I sign here, fella?

352
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,506
Did you hear that?

353
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,884
He drank beer with us
and became friends with him?

354
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:38,096
You're the youngest here.
Let's get the hierarchy in order.

355
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,682
You have four seniors now.

356
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,767
Lucky you.

357
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:45,937
I'm--

358
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,525
Hello, little brother.

359
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,862
This is what it feels like
to have a rich little brother.

360
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,572
Doesn't Sheikh Mansour have a brother?

361
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,115
Why?

362
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,492
Are you upset?

363
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,999
There's one most important detail.

364
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,835
If you refuse, I won't sign.

365
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,965
Promise me that you'll never touch Aji 3.

366
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,092
If you do, we leave.

367
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,690
Bear with me, my hearties.

368
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,318
I'll make you as good as new.

369
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,195
Is that your Heart Ball?

370
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,655
Yes.

371
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,075
I'll fix them for you.

372
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,285
If you'll pay me.

373
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,495
How much?

374
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,748
I'll tell you after they're fixed.

375
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,709
What are you up to?

376
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,462
-I won't do it, then.
-Okay.

377
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,632
Will a day be enough?

378
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,346
What?

379
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,098
"Hi, brother"?

380
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,393
"Hello, little brother,
Sheikh Mansour has a brother"?

381
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,978
What a bunch of snobs.

382
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,398
I fed them one meal,
and they're leeching off me.

383
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,691
-I shall leave, then.
-Wait.

384
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,361
-Sir?
-Find someone for me.

385
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,117
-His name is Jang Du-sam.
-I got it.

386
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,702
-Why do you need him?
-It's about Santa Maria.

387
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,914
-Find him at all costs.
-Yes, sir.

388
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,059
What is it, master?

389
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,787
From now on,
I will pick you up every morning

390
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,373
to maximize the use of your battery.

391
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,959
So,

392
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,211
don't move too much

393
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,839
and don't run too much, okay?

394
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,549
Is it because...

395
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,760
I'm a treasure?

396
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,096
Whatever.

397
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,390
Get ready for a scolding.

398
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,226
It's wrong to scold me
for no reason, master.

399
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:32,937
There is a reason.

400
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:34,898
Friend Mode.

401
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,069
Friend.

402
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,579
My goodness.

403
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,082
When did he become an Uber driver?

404
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,376
You left me alone yesterday.

405
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,880
Do you know how flustered I was
when I woke up?

406
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,510
Keep doing that
and I'll sell you for scrap metal.

407
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,431
When I'm meeting anyone,

408
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,099
stay within my sight.

409
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,976
Why?

410
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,108
If you don't, it's a breach of contract.

411
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,529
Just shut up and input it. No matter what,

412
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,448
you must stay where I can see you, got it?

413
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,200
Okay.

414
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,704
Also, clean up here.

415
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,376
You told me not to work
and use up my battery.

416
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,378
Just do it.

417
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,632
How fickle.

418
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,347
PRETTY ROOM

419
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,568
PRETTY

420
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,156
You don't look good in pink.

421
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,121
I'm not giving them to please you.

422
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,748
You'll go outside with me.

423
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,167
Your outfit should be nice and neat.

424
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,629
Otherwise, I'll be embarrassed.

425
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,217
Put on whatever you like.

426
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,189
She's still making these?

427
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,591
Do I look weird?

428
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,635
You look pretty.

429
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,803
Really?

430
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,432
You look so pretty.

431
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,312
Wait, I shouldn't do that.

432
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,272
Why not?

433
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,650
I made a promise to Dr. Hong.

434
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,903
Promise me that you'll never touch Aji 3.

435
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,822
My body is mine.

436
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,491
He has no right to tell him that.

437
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,494
Aji 3.

438
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,122
I have something to tell you.

439
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,044
I want to kiss...

440
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,471
Ri-el.

441
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,519
I have three dates with her.

442
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,270
I need to plan out a great date,

443
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,190
and make up for the mess I made last time.

444
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:08,152
And on our last date, with a kiss...

445
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,822
I propose.

446
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,950
But the problem is that kiss.

447
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:17,912
I'll do whatever I can
to prepare our date.

448
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:23,793
But I can't seem to think of when
or how I'm supposed to kiss her.

449
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,670
I need to...

450
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,839
capture Ri-el's heart.

451
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:29,882
I've never...

452
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,635
kissed anyone before.

453
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,688
She's so good at making useless stuff.

454
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,565
But what's this for anyway?

455
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,486
-Wear what you normally wear.
-No.

456
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,487
It's the repair cost.

457
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,782
I wore this enough.
Let me wear something new.

458
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,202
Plus, I'll be leaving soon.

459
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,912
Why don't you care about my welfare?

460
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:03,875
And this is not a problem right now.

461
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,711
-He wants to kiss.
-What?

462
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,588
He wants my help with his first kiss.

463
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,882
How am I supposed to help him with that?

464
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,759
It's not like I can let him
practice on me.

465
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,761
Screw practice. We'll help him.

466
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,512
-What?
-We will?

467
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,806
That's going to be impossible.

468
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,517
You got rejected by Ji-a.

469
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,769
And Hoktal...

470
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,146
is describable in one word. Virgin.

471
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,273
And my last date was back in...
When was it?

472
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,983
-And Pai--
-Gosh.

473
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,029
Gosh, I suddenly need a drink.

474
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,990
Why did you live like that?

475
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,493
Is there anyone
who knows these kinds of stuff?

476
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,669
Who's that?

477
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,171
I don't know.

478
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,964
A woman just got out of the cab.

479
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,634
Let me see.

480
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,755
Nice to meet you.

481
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:37,301
I'm Ji-a's friend, Hwang Seon-hye.
And I'll be your kiss teacher today.

482
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,345
Nice to meet you.

483
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,389
They're my teammates, and I'm--

484
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,598
My gosh.

485
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,436
My goodness,
she really looks exactly like you.

486
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,440
Ji-a, how did you put up with this?

487
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,277
If it were me,
I would've broken it already.

488
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,070
We're going to sue you if you do.

489
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,698
Who's this?

490
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,450
You must be Doctor Hong's bodyguard.

491
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,705
The coffee here tastes amazing.

492
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,711
You never know when it might go down,

493
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,505
so I advise you to come
as fast as you can.

494
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,382
I already stamped the coupon for you.

495
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,095
The name of this café is very irrational.

496
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,306
There's no snow in summer.

497
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,475
And there's no bald soprano
in the play The Bald Soprano.

498
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,562
Irrationality is the life itself.

499
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,526
I'm going to introduce you
to Kim Min-gyu as my acquaintance.

500
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,237
Keep in mind that you don't know Aji 3.

501
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:42,450
That means you need to think of me
as a human, not a robot.

502
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,120
Where's my pupil?

503
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,875
You're the goddess...

504
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,752
of kissing?

505
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,921
Her name is Hwang Seon-hye.

506
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,757
She's an acquaintance of mine,
and she's a real star.

507
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,301
Aji 3, search the web for me.

508
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,722
Hwang Seon-hye, 28 years old.

509
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,725
A relationship counselor
and also known as the goddess of kissing.

510
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,686
She's dated countless men,
and with that experience,

511
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,481
she became a mentor
for men and women in their 20s.

512
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,234
Mainly focuses on kissing.

513
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:20,112
Many people claim to have succeeded
in their first kiss thanks to her.

514
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,324
We'll have to see about that.

515
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,035
Why don't you begin?

516
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:29,121
I'm going to end the lecture
if I don't think it's right.

517
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,665
Fine.

518
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,086
You need to come.

519
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,003
PAI

520
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,630
Please excuse me.

521
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,399
When a man and a woman meet,

522
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,527
they normally go through three stages
before kissing each other.

523
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,862
First.
Attempts to make themselves appealing.

524
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,031
Second. A romantic moment together.

525
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,827
Third. Advance to a physical relationship.

526
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,330
That's why you need at least three dates
to kiss someone.

527
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,459
But I heard you're dealing
with your first love

528
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,503
whom you've known for quite a while.

529
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,464
So you can skip all those stages
and go for it right away.

530
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,966
That means...

531
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,135
you have...

532
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,764
three chances of kissing her in total.

533
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,477
I like what you're saying. Keep going.

534
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,444
I would like a cup of cold water with ice.

535
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,195
Wait.

536
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:47,408
She's not a housekeeper.

537
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,911
Then...

538
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,538
She's a friend.

539
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,963
I'll be careful.

540
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,798
Sorry.

541
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,343
Continue.

542
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,221
When a man and a woman are friends,

543
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,557
the pro is that they're very close,

544
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,353
but the con is that
she won't see you as a man yet.

545
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,315
You need to go from a friend to a man.

546
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,108
What do you need for that?

547
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,736
Sexual tension.

548
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,072
That is what you need.

549
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,074
Kissing is about timing.

550
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:32,661
When everything falls into place
and screams, "Right now!"

551
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,289
What do you need at that moment?

552
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,459
Sexual tension?

553
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,586
Correct, sexual tension.

554
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,755
Mr. Kim.

555
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,341
Have you ever dreamed of kissing her?

556
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,851
No, never.

557
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,311
What a relief.

558
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,814
-Why is it a relief?
-What?

559
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,611
Because that way,
we can move on to the next step.

560
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,826
You two, follow me.

561
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,292
What is it?

562
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,169
I can't attach this.

563
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,463
Attach it first,

564
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,216
then use the O2 plasma on top of that.

565
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,218
Why did you call me?

566
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,594
You can do this on your own.

567
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,013
Yes. I sprained my wrist.

568
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,723
Your wrist? Let me see.

569
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,687
It's swollen.

570
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,314
Let's put something on it.

571
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,531
It's begun.

572
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,534
-My favorite part is the opening.
-Agreed.

573
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,956
You two are on a date.

574
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,959
Walk slowly, side by side.

575
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,220
Don't think about anything else.
Just walk slowly.

576
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,492
Mr. Kim,

577
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,370
is she still just a friend to you?

578
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,336
It's impossible.

579
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,839
There's no way I can ever think of her
as a woman.

580
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,177
Stop fooling around.

581
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,429
Let's get to the point.

582
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,847
I'm not fooling around.

583
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,600
That just now was the point.

584
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:51,235
That feeling you just felt,
the atmosphere,

585
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,320
the gaze. Don't forget that.

586
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,156
That is sexual tension.

587
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,700
And that...

588
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,952
is when you must kiss.

589
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,129
I'll give you one more tip, for free.

590
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,466
If it rains, don't forget an umbrella.

591
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,357
Min-gyu and Ri-el
are going to get married, right?

592
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,776
Yes.

593
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,695
If you were the majority shareholder,

594
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,240
Director Ye would have chosen you
as his son-in-law.

595
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,744
How shall I help you?

596
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,832
Will you just let Min-gyu
take her from you?

597
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,500
No.

598
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,210
Before that,

599
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,713
I must deal with Aji 3.

600
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,484
I should tag along.

601
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,902
What for? I'll be there.

602
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,820
You'll be on a date with your first love.

603
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,865
What if Aji 3 falls, gets damaged,
or loses power?

604
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,492
Will you run off with her mid-date?

605
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,995
Don't worry. I'll protect Aji 3.
I won't interfere.

606
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,957
Shall we get going?

607
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,460
What a mess.

608
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,631
-Come on.
-I said no.

609
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,549
-Are you trying to lie down?
-Let's go home.

610
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,884
Just come with me.

611
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,136
Why did you bring me, too?

612
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,847
I want your help.

613
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,890
Look at me.

614
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,976
I need more help than you.

615
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,354
See, just be the person you are.

616
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:53,565
Just sit there in silence,
and you'll be helping me.

617
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,025
Amazing, right? Let's go.

618
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,069
-We aren't going in.
-Do this for me.

619
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,862
-Please.
-No.

620
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,406
SUMMER SNOW

621
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,454
You actually came.

622
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,665
I like coffee.

623
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,876
And would like to ask you out--

624
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,628
How sweet.

625
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,924
Do you both want an Americano
with two shots?

626
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,969
I would prefer a latte.

627
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:27,266
A hand that says latte
when everyone else says Americano.

628
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:28,976
I like that.

629
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,812
An Americano and a latte.

630
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:32,980
Thank you.

631
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,863
It will be hot.

632
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,158
They should be on the date by now.

633
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,534
Where did they go?

634
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:49,037
The first date can be at any place
that isn't crowded.

635
00:45:57,212 --> 00:46:00,174
You want us to go on a date here?

636
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,385
Yes. It's a hot place.

637
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,846
The street of youth.

638
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,684
What's that?

639
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:11,977
An umbrella.

640
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,479
They said it will rain today.

641
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,106
I don't think it will.

642
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,691
We'll see.

643
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,068
I think I might be right.

644
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,571
It must be a hot place.

645
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:26,450
Okay. I left you in charge of the date.

646
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,951
Let's see how it goes.

647
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,079
Shall we?

648
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,710
It's best to avoid a place you went to

649
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,712
with an ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend.

650
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,466
You'll end up comparing your current date
with your ex.

651
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,771
Have a look. Isn't this cute?

652
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,439
It is.

653
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,240
Should I get one for Dong-hyeon?

654
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,284
Boys prefer this nowadays.

655
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,204
Dong-hyeon's a girl.

656
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,706
Come here.

657
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,794
I'll pick one for you.

658
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,337
PRETTY

659
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,506
Here, try it on.

660
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,092
It will ruin my hair.

661
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,390
Look. What do you think?

662
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,934
You look familiar.

663
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,812
You were with a young lady.

664
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,106
Sorry.

665
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,150
I'm right.

666
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,236
If they meet someone they know,

667
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,488
things will get very sticky.

668
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,367
I bet Doctor Hong must feel excited too.

669
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,244
Why is that?

670
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,662
He tagged along.

671
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,206
Is he crazy? Why did he tag along?

672
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,425
Seon-hye.

673
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,843
I need to pee.

674
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,136
Where's the toilet?

675
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,096
Over there. There's no tissue.

676
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,639
I just need to pee.

677
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,725
I'll just pee.

678
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,519
-Wash your hands when you're done.
-Gosh.

679
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,841
Why are your eyes bulging?

680
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,093
The robot just drank juice.

681
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,095
The robot drank something?

682
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,015
What are you talking about? Get a grip.

683
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,569
Wait here for a bit.

684
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,909
Where is he going?

685
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,209
You want me to wear those?

686
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,087
You should've told me if your feet hurt.

687
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,298
Sorry.

688
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,274
They're comfy.

689
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,361
Not elegant, but comfortable.

690
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,453
Those two...

691
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,414
make a nice couple.

692
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,337
They do.

693
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,381
They look nice.

694
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,973
Those two...

695
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,559
are everywhere we are.

696
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,437
Are they?

697
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,565
I didn't notice them at all.

698
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,570
They suit each other.

699
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:36,324
I'm not sure about that.

700
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,454
That's mine.

701
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,089
Why are they always together?

702
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,340
Don't they go to pee?

703
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,843
We must separate them.

704
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,679
Our drinks are ready.

705
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,809
They can't see you. Eat.

706
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,770
So I can work hard?

707
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,022
Okay.

708
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,367
We used to go on a lot of dates.

709
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,870
We never came to places like this.

710
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,790
We did. Think carefully.

711
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,249
You just don't remember.

712
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,883
Why are your eyes bulging even more?

713
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,552
She's not a robot. She's human.

714
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,388
This time, you think she's human?

715
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:41,765
What do you mean?

716
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:45,477
Earlier, she drank something.
Now, she's eating ice cream.

717
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,191
-Are you hallucinating?
-She really ate.

718
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,777
-How can a robot eat?
-Exactly.

719
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,239
If you're going to talk nonsense, go home.
I can do this alone.

720
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,157
Fine, Uncle.

721
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,369
I will prove it to you myself.

722
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,039
Just drink your drink.

723
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,002
Why do they call you Hoktal?

724
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,257
Planet of the Apes.

725
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,843
No way.

726
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,888
You're too handsome to be a primate.

727
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,974
Who gave you that nickname?

728
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,350
I'll smack him for you.

729
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:36,319
You didn't say anything
during the short time I was away, did you?

730
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:40,907
Do you think they'll succeed
in kissing today?

731
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,536
Which of them will succeed?

732
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:46,621
I am curious.

733
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,374
This is pretty.

734
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,626
They're expensive in New York.

735
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,669
Do you want them?

736
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:55,297
No, I was just checking out the design.

737
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,515
How long do we have to stay?

738
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,100
Until their date's over.

739
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,227
Then the kiss--

740
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,729
What's that?

741
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,106
Never mind.

742
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,526
Watch out.

743
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,903
-Sorry.
-It's fine.

744
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:30,874
It might rain.

745
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,252
I'll get an umbrella. Wait here.

746
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,073
She is a robot.

747
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:08,620
-Isn't this an interesting design?
-It is.

748
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,249
Just a moment.

749
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,761
I have to go. Something urgent came up.

750
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,388
You're leaving already?

751
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,391
Can't you stay a little longer?

752
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,685
-It'll come soon.
-What will?

753
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,020
The rain.

754
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,815
Sorry, it seems urgent.

755
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,609
We haven't had dinner yet.

756
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,736
When will our next date be?

757
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,072
-I'll call you.
-Then...

758
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,117
take the umbrella. It really will rain.

759
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,786
I doubt it will rain a lot.

760
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,165
Today's date...

761
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,003
was better than your hot chocolate.

762
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,338
Bye.

763
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,038
Uncle.

764
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,498
She's a robot.

765
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,168
No human could break a twig like this.

766
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,794
What did you want to prove?

767
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,713
You have way too much to learn.

768
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,299
It's raining.

769
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,832
This is what I'm using the umbrella for.

770
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,713
This is my favorite umbrella.

771
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,132
Be honored I'm sharing it with you.

772
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,178
Hey.

773
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,223
Shall I show you something?

774
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:51,074
When I use this umbrella
to look up at the rain,

775
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,284
then...

776
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,163
I feel all my frustrations melt away.

777
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,419
How did someone come up with this?

778
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,213
Was he a genius?

779
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,882
Or a craftsman?

780
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,596
I would love...

781
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,058
to meet the person who made this.

782
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,048
This is when...

783
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,718
you must kiss.

784
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,081
Just tell him you like him.

785
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,709
Would Min-gyu kill you or something
for not being a robot?

786
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,419
I really can't stand this.

787
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:11,256
Do you know how disgusting it feels
to look at you?

788
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,299
How much lower will you bring me down...

789
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,093
You've gathered a lot of shares.

790
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,469
I'm going to propose

791
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,846
the dismissal of Director Kim
during our next board meeting.

792
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,266
When are you going to bring Aji 3 to me?

793
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,434
Was that all fake?

794
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,103
They all meant nothing?

795
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:27,105
Please let go of my hand.

796
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,356
I don't want to.

797
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,070
