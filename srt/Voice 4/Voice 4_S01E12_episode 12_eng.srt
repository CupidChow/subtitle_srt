1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560


2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,320
   

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,460
   

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,090
   

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,920
   

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,900
   

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,900
 This program contains virtual and indirect advertising. 

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,100
  Voice 4 
   

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,230
    

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,110
 Can you hear anything? 

11
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,800
It's coming from over there.

12
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,390
What's that? Hold on there!

13
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,880
Detective Jo?

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,900
Detective Jo?

15
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,380
 Director, whereabouts is it? 

16
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,520
Dispatch 4 here. I think Dong Bang Min that bastard escaped the perimeter.

17
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,330
We will search here first.

18
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,710
Dispatch 5 here. Center Director.

19
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,940
Center Director, can you hear me?

20
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,250
Detective Jo!

21
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,900
Detective Jo!

22
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,650
 Didn't you say once that we were a family? 

23
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,000
Who are you?

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,930
 It can't be. You don't remember me? 

25
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,560
Come this way.

26
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,210
Are you all right?

27
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,490
You nearly fell off.

28
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,500
Are you all right?

29
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,690
Suddenly after a sound of a bird, a child who appeared to be about 12 years old approached and called me "Noona."

30
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,380
Then I could see Dong Bang Min...

31
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,100
Center Director...

32
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,240
To be honest, I also saw an apparition, too.

33
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,520
Right now...

34
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,680
I think we were both poisoned somehow.

35
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,180
Can you walk?

36
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,340
That's it.

37
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,320
Center Director!

38
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,580
Are you all right?

39
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,620
Someone poisoned us so we'd see hallucinations.

40
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,150
There was a smell of medicinal herbs as we climbed up, come to think of it.

41
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,500
I don't think it is a one-man job.

42
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,480
I'll call the agents and search the training center's perimeter.

43
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,280
Why don't you go to the dispensary and treat yourselves first?

44
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,860
Yes, let's.

45
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,180
Dispatch 2 here. We found Dong Bang Min.

46
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,710
The bastard is sleeping peacefully on a bench.

47
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,220
Mr. Dong Bang Min. Mr. Dong Bang Min!

48
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,840
Young Master!

49
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,740
We will look after Young Master. Why not take your leave?

50
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,270
Can't you see that we are investigating?

51
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,850
Enough already.

52
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,850
Just how much longer are you going to harass Young Master when Kwak Man Taek has been long discovered as the culprit?

53
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,890
This is your final warning.

54
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,110
Go on and speak again. What? Are you punks all high or something?

55
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,160
Hey, let go. Come on, don't do this.

56
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,120
- I said stop it. 
 - Young Master!

57
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,060
What's going on?

58
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,550
- Were you watching me in case I commit a crime? 
 - What?

59
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,630
Isn't there something more pressing going on?

60
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,030
You want to have a go, you bastard?

61
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,180
Ah, let go, please. I said let go.

62
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,700
Don't mess around.

63
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,320
Why don't we go, then?

64
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,920
Dispatch 2 here. Center Director, I heard something happened earlier?

65
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,990
You are all right, right?

66
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,760
Please report back to the agency, both of you.

67
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,410
And I suspect Dong Bang Heon Yup is the culprit of today's happening.

68
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,260
We'll talk again when we return.

69
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,580
Let's go.

70
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,180
   

71
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,500
   
   

72
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,630
    

73
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,920
Your pupils are enlarged and your hands are shaky. I'd say you were exposed to a narcotic hallucinogen.
    

74
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,130
 Can't be the same ingredients? 

75
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,290
About 10 minutes would be enough to affect you Detective Jo, but

76
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,250
Center Director's condition is not as good.

77
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,320
I'll administer a 30-minute draining shot as an antidote.

78
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,980
Detective Park, head in first.

79
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,790
Continue to search through Dong Bang Min's past with Agent Han.

80
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,020
Okay. Call me anytime.

81
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,370
You got it.

82
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:51,080
Thank you. If it weren't for you, I would have fallen off the cliff, Detective Jo.

83
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:59,500
You would've done the same for me, Director. The effect of the drug would've generated a feeling of guilt, fear, or hallucination.

84
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,600
I think we both felt those kinds of feelings.

85
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,430
 Feeling of guilt? It looked like Dong Bang Min's childhood. 

86
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,870
Director Kang, I have the suspicion there's an insider at the Vimo Village.

87
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,500
Someone who's working for Dong Bang Heon Yup.

88
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,760
It's Team Leader Park.

89
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,700
 Team Leader Park, Detective Jo is with me just now. 

90
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,440
Yes. I heard about what happened. You are okay, right?

91
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,410
I'm all right. What was the result of the first round in the autopsy?

92
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,500
What Kwak Man Taek swallowed is called a Vimo herb.

93
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,730
 They say there was a large dose of toxin from the painkiller. 

94
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,760
A painkiller?

95
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,290
It's the type of precious herb that only grows in remote areas like Vimo village.

96
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,620
 If consumed in large doses, a hallucination and heart attack can result. 

97
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,120
Kwak Man Taek has been consuming it over a prolonged period of time, but today the quantity exceeded the common dose

98
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,190
and he may have died from the overwhelming burden on his heart.

99
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,970
Ah, and Center Director, the results of the final autopsy are out as well and

100
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,850
the family murder case is identical to the one in Jachang.

101
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,170
Well done.

102
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,100
I think we consumed the Vimo herbs.

103
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,450
Who did you say gave you the vitamin drink earlier?

104
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,430
 What are the drinks for? 

105
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,790
 The Criminal Affairs Division was distributing them to all the departments. 

106
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,420
He said the Criminal Affairs Division was treating everyone.

107
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,860
 This is identical to the Vimo village's blackmail case. 

108
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,900
 That outsider 

109
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,720
 was chased out without catching the culprit in the end. 

110
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,090
Oh, Detective Shim.

111
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,360
Did something come out?

112
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,130
 I searched to the top,  

113
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:52,490
 but there wasn't any strange character, but there were traces of Vimo herb burning around the training center. 

114
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,150
 Vimo herb? 

115
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,230
Ah, Detective Jo.

116
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,090
I think I found the commonality among Dong Bang Min's multiple characters.

117
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,790
The voice file that Circus Man sent was the hint.

118
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,330
There were 3 additional side noises, so I analyzed the ones that were similar,

119
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:18,270
 and it happened to be the sound of the Circus Man personality having difficulty in breathing due to asthma 

120
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:29,600
 and the Center Director personality drumming something with her fingernails, 

121
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,200
 and yet another personality 

122
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,020
 made sounds like the cracking of a neck. 

123
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,590
Sound of a cracking neck?

124
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:45,320
Yes. As if there's some sort of problem with his bones, muscles, or joints.

125
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,360
- So they didn't catch the culprit, simply put? 
 - That's correct.

126
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,340
They are still on a manhunt,

127
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,330
but he isn't anywhere to be found. Don't you think it might be Dong Bang Min's doing?

128
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,990
It takes longer than 10 minutes from the hospital to the scene.

129
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,760
It's probably the Sonang Village people.

130
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,110
The way they were coddling Dong Bang Min earlier in that way...

131
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,150
What's this about Center Director being in danger due to a hallucination?

132
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,900
I think they both inhaled a strange herb's scent and saw hallucinations.

133
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,540
Detective Jo seems to suspect that someone has added poison to a vitamin drink.

134
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,770
- That beverage you drank at the hospital was something you brought, right? 
 - That's right.

135
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,440
There they are.

136
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,320
I took one because I saw a vitamin drink.

137
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,300
Elder, I'm sorry. 
    

138
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,020
That American detective caught on, so...

139
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,890
At any rate, I checked that the Vimo herb-boiled water took effect.

140
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,950
I understand. Take your leave.

141
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,690
 Drove the stake in the wilderness, 

142
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,190
 it's the Village Sonang I started with my bare hands. 

143
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,700
 Gathering all the uprooted people 

144
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,940
 and cultivated them through blood as fertilizer, 

145
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,200
 this is the fruit of my effort and my kingdom. 

146
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,880
 Should anyone touch my kingdom, 

147
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,450
 he shall have to pay the price in blood. 

148
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,110
How can you suggest we reinvestigate when we have no right of arraignment due to the victim's passing?

149
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,860
Kwak Man Taek falsely confessed.

150
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,920
We are in the process of gathering evidence of a hole in Dong Bang Min's alibi by using his multiple personality disorder.

151
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,040
We will prove it during witness questioning without fail.

152
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,000
He confessed he was the culprit in his own words.

153
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,980
A corpse and the murder weapon were found as well.

154
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,760
Also, Seoul Agency was happy that suspect Sil Chang Seok got off with a lack of evidence.

155
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,230
From now on, our Vimo Station is off this case.

156
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,090
When Team Leader Park comes, why don't you take over the case, Chief Yang?

157
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,910
Commissioner, you know that that will only spur on some people's desire to close the case.

158
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:39,750
We gave the whole of the investigation to a team that isn't even our local team.

159
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,980
Under the guise of a special Korean American network, we gave our full cooperation as well. What more are you asking for?

160
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,350
Sounds like to me, you want to take your hands off the case before the evidence comes out.

161
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,330
Is that my misunderstanding?

162
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,840
What did you say?

163
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,400
Was this the reason why you asked us to keep everything under wraps from the get-go?

164
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,940
We know full well that this station is taken care of by the Sonang Village.

165
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,990
Just what the heck will that old man pay you in exchange for letting Dong Bang Min slip through?

166
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,240
Detective Jo!

167
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,720
Do I really need to mention this story with my own mouth?

168
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,140
I heard the reason you accused your foster-father of child abuse

169
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,060
was to make money off of him.

170
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,920
And I hear that the real abuser of your sister is none other than you, Detective Jo.

171
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,150
Commissioner!

172
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,840
Anyway, this case is closed.

173
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,770
Return to your country as soon as possible and take care of your emotions.

174
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,460
Is a person who is the commissioner really going to condemn a story after only a few lines of a background check?

175
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,450
I think I understand just where you learned to bully someone with the weakness of being an opponent.

176
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,750
Fine.

177
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,690
Just know that this case is within my jurisdiction until the transfer of the case is finished.

178
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,000
Detective Jo!

179
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,120
He overcame a horrific trauma from abuse to become a police officer.

180
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,640
You know very well that it is difficult to overcome trauma from childhood abuse.

181
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,220
You as an outsider,

182
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,910
I can understand your disinterest in getting involved with the island's problems, that's no different from your disinterest in child abuse cases.

183
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,620
If we were to ignore Sonang Village's actions now,

184
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,460
even a bigger monster will be produced in the future.

185
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,730
What are you talking about?

186
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,240
I don't get it. You want us backing out now?

187
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,650
 I still have 2 more days and I know I can fix this. 

188
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,920
I already warned you about this.

189
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,150
I told you if you cause trouble, you'd be coming home.

190
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:50,500
 And now I'm getting these very disturbing reports that even break the agreement. 

191
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:56,950
 Even your father thinks that this need for vengeance of yours has become an obsession. 

192
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,580
And you believe all that bullshit from him?

193
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,220
If there were any kind of revenge, it will be on that dirtbag himself.

194
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,320
It doesn't matter, Derek!

195
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,400
 What matters is that you are a US citizen 

196
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,140
and a Los Angeles police officer!

197
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,020
And if you do not comply, you are going to lose it all.

198
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,150
 Everything? 

199
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:25,280
Fine. Then from now on, I do whatever I want to do.

200
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,750
I'll apologize instead of Commissioner Kam.

201
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,350
Do you know why I became a police officer?

202
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,540
I wanted to show my foster father

203
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:44,320
what a real police officer is. I wanted to prove to him that he wasn't a police officer, he was just trash.

204
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,180
But no matter how hard I tried, nothing changed.

205
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,660
Detective Jo... You are already an excellent police officer.

206
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,650
Hey, Chad.

207
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,580
I've tracked down the room rented by Dong Bang Min on the day of the incident.

208
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,170
Only one security camera captured him entering room 1203

209
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,550
and he stayed there for 55 minutes.

210
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,280
And I also had a chance to talk to cleaning staff

211
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,560
saying that the room was filled with an overpowering smell of ammonia.

212
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,120
Yeah, they say some of the special effects make-up products smell like it.

213
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,690
All right, good work. Come back safely.

214
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,620
Yes, Cap.

215
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,450
The circumstantial evidence is coming out one by one.

216
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,620
Let's stay hopeful.

217
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,390
Detective Shim.

218
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,250
This is Sonang Village's financial statement.

219
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,260
The village head is Dong Bang Heon Yup and a total of fifty people live there.

220
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,070
The sales they make from selling their stone products are divided between each household.

221
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,500
They're clean as far as these documents are considered.

222
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,360
Thank you. Good work.

223
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,700
Yes, Team Leader Cheon?

224
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,200
All right.

225
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,420
He said they were getting bombarded with calls all of a sudden. I need to go.

226
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,430
   

227
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,760
Hello, this is the 112 Emergency Center.

228
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,890
- Where are you right now? 
 - Hello, this is the 112 Emergency Center.

229
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,390
What items were stolen?

230
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,640
Two students are fighting?

231
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,940
- Our team will be there soon. 
 - Half a bottle of rice wine?

232
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,020
- Bok Shil disappeared? 
 - You see a UFO

233
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,160
- floating in the sky? 
 - You scolded your child due to his marks and he hasn't come back yet?

234
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,950
 You hung your laundry to dry 

235
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,250
 and someone stole it? 

236
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,450
 Oh, yes, I understand. Yes. 

237
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,620
- Team Leader Cheon. 
 - We have been getting a crazy amount of calls in the last 30 minutes.

238
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,110
Director Kang, the caller is Go Pal Do from 14-Hyojin District.

239
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,150
He says his children came to visit him and his eldest son stabbed his second son and ran out.

240
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,970
But when I looked into his personal details,

241
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,640
under family relations, it says he has no sons.

242
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,940
 37-Yongil Neighborhood, Hyojin District... 

243
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,260
You are in 21-14 Ayeon Neighborhood, Hyojin District, right?

244
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,560
Hyojin Neighborhood, Hyojin District?

245
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,250
Team Leader Cheon, check if all of these calls are coming from Hyojin Neighborhood, Hyojin District.

246
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,730
Okay, just a minute.

247
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:12,430
They are all from the Hyojin District. Even some callers saying they're from other districts are actually from the same place.

248
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,510
I'm glad you are feeling better now.

249
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:22,400
You did very well. If you hadn't taken care of this,

250
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,050
then we would have suffered because of those outsiders.

251
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,670
Elder, please do not take what I say in the wrong way.

252
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:39,270
Your grandson has been through a lot lately. Sending him somewhere to rest—

253
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,620
Thank you for your concern.

254
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,970
Anyhow, I will consider this as a payment for all of my debts to you.

255
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,720
It seems my feelings were a debt to you.

256
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,800
But human relationships can't be calculated so neatly.

257
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,790
 If I wanted to profit off of you 

258
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:05,900
 then I wouldn't have given you a position that was well above your capabilities. 

259
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,550
All of this means that we

260
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:12,340
are an eternal family.

261
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,430
   

262
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,980
- Yes, Agent Han? 
 - Director Kang,

263
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:30,190
Do you remember I told you about the program that Dong Bang Min planted in the community? I found it.

264
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,040
I'll be there soon. Call Detective Jo as well.

265
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,710
Okay.

266
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,550
Oh dear, our Young Master's face

267
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,540
has slimmed down to half of what it was.

268
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,400
What a scumbag that Kwak Man Taek was.

269
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,380
This is the ticket to Fiji that you had asked for.

270
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,520
The departure is tomorrow night so you should head to the hotel right away.

271
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,200
I will go there soon and arrange a place for you to stay.

272
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,060
    

273
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,700
It's fine. You should leave.

274
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,340
I'll take care of it myself.

275
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,640
You are suspicious of me.

276
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,370
You find me scary, don't you?

277
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:12,230
Young Master, are you alright?

278
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,880
Yes.

279
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:22,560
By the way, it's incredible how much the Sonang villagers

280
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,920
love their families.

281
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:32,820
Considering they've been living on this tiny little island for 30 years, monitoring each other.

282
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,310
Oh yes! I heard all the victims were killed using an ax.

283
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,750
I wonder where he started.

284
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,040
Their head? Their shoulders?

285
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,170
Their arms?

286
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,910
Or...

287
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,510
maybe it was from their legs.

288
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,670
- You should rest now. 
 - Okay.

289
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,660
You still think he's not the killer? You heard what he just said.

290
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,460
You heard all those creepy things he said.

291
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,900
- It's not like that. 
 - What do you mean?

292
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,050
Criminals from Korea flee to Fiji because they know they can't be forced to come back.

293
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,950
You know that he framed Kwak Man Taek.

294
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,480
I keep telling you it's not him!

295
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:42,170
Anyhow, if we just tend to him until tomorrow, our work is done. Just turn a blind eye and bear with it for today.

296
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,870
Why are you leaving me behind?

297
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,760
 Despite being in pain, 

298
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,710
 those children left clues for us so that they could protect their families. 

299
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,970
How interesting.

300
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,920
I wonder which one it was.

301
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,950
 What? You scared me! Who said you could come in? 

302
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:23,330
 Raising a kid in a place like this... no wonder he turned out like this. 

303
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,810
 Who are you? 

304
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,480
 Me? Who do you think? 

305
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,980
 Your favorite cop. 

306
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,170
 What? Is it really you? 

307
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,090
 You got the photo, right? 

308
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,970
 You came at the perfect time. Get rid of all the evidence. 

309
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:51,310
 That's funny. Did you really think I'd do that for you? 

310
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,610
 Hey, stop kidding. 

311
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,500
 This isn't what you promised me! 

312
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,990
 That's interesting. This is why kids need to learn a lesson. 

313
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:08,120
 How easily they forget that I helped them escape from their pain. 

314
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:16,230
 Don't forget who reported those jerks. 

315
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:23,230
 If I say a word about your involvement then your life will be hell again. 

316
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,590
 That's why I did everything you told me to! What more do you want from me? 

317
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,950
 No. Noona, please. 

318
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:39,620
 Please save me this one time. I did everything you told me to. 

319
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:45,120
 Look here. I think my grandson has wronged you in some way. 

320
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,910
 He may look all grown up but he isn't fully mature yet. 

321
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:53,440
 I'll take any punishment for his mistake. 

322
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,000
 So please... please forgive him. 

323
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,830
 I have one last thing for you to do. 

324
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,930
 Kill these two. 

325
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,350
 Then you will be free. 

326
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,360
 Oh dear. Beom Tae. Beom Tae. 

327
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,500
 Beom Tae. Beom Tae. Beom Tae. Beom Tae. 

328
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,150
 Hey! Can a cop even do something like this? 

329
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:49,480
 Do whatever you want to, you psycho! I don't care whether you tell on me. 

330
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,430
 Just do what you want to! 

331
00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:01,400
 Grandpa! Grandpa, I was wrong. I'm sorry. 

332
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,350
 I'm sorry. 

333
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:23,930
 How annoying. No matter how bad the situation is, you're still family? 

334
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,700
 Beom Tae! 

335
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,760
 Beom Tae! 

336
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:55,720
 Aren't you grateful toward me for killing your vermin grandson? 

337
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,100
 Beom Tae! 

338
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:04,640
 Who are you? My grandson! Bring my grandson back! 

339
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,890
 It's not like you chose to have ties with him. Living like this, stuck with him for no good reason. 

340
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,020
 Didn't you find it revolting? 

341
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,730
Oh, it was him! Joo Joo.

342
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:32,990
Hang on. He said he told someone about me.

343
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,470
   

344
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:44,550
What? If the killer died, it should all be fine.  How annoying.

345
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:58,540
    
He's really gone mad! Ugh, creepy.

346
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:16,540
Why didn't you pick up? Daddy just wanted to apologize to you.

347
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:23,860
I don't need your damn apology. Touch me again and I'll sue you.

348
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,660
What for?

349
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,610
Suing me won't change a thing.  That's how it is with parental rights.

350
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:40,860
You can never run away from me.

351
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,250
You know how it is.

352
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,720
- Daddy is really lonely. 
 - Who are you?

353
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,430
I know where you are now. I'll be back.

354
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,660
   

355
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,780
 The customer you have called is currently busy. After the beep... 

356
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,970
Why won't they pick up?

357
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,410
   

358
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,830
   

359
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:08,970
   

360
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,650
 And there's KILL4U, I don't really know her... 

361
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:19,250
 But she's totally a loser so no one in the community talks to her. No one will get to know. 

362
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,170
KILL4U?

363
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,220
Police impersonator?

364
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,130
   
   

365
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,190
KILL...

366
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,750
4...

367
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,480
U.

368
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,260
    
    

369
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,640
    
  I reported my foster parents for domestic violence. I'm hiding in a shelter now. 

370
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,530
 I have no one to help me anymore nor do I have anywhere I can go. 

371
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,530
 This will only end when I kill them and go to jail, 

372
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,060
 or when I die. 

373
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,450
I found you.

374
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,900
What the hell do you guys know? How can you say that?

375
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,000
 Are you all right? It seems like you're going through a very hard time. 

376
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,880
  Get lost. Stop playing tricks. 

377
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,140
 I have a cop who's helping me. 

378
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:03,500
   
   
   

379
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,630
He picks his victims using an algorithm? 
    

380
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:13,260
Yes. When you're shopping on the internet and you view a certain item,

381
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,690
you'll keep getting ads for similar products.

382
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,370
He's using a similar principle.

383
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:22,110
So he's using a program to find his targets.

384
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,590
Exactly.

385
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,600
When I made the fake ID,

386
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,180
it was Dong Bang Min who sent me a message first.

387
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,310
I figured he'd found me by coincidence,

388
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,480
but it was actually his program that analyzed what I had written on the forum

389
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,210
and recommended me as a suitable prey to Dong Bang Min.

390
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:42,830
What you see here is a list of specific word frequencies.

391
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,260
It was thanks to you, Director Kang, that I survived that day.

392
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,980
If I had been alone when I met him...

393
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,130
- But what does the "Prey No.4" here mean? 
 - Oh that...

394
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:03,690
It means his next prey is on June 25th... I mean

395
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:08,530
I think it's on a constant auto-search for future victims.

396
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:15,630
Oh, and I was short of hands so I asked a foreign hacker friend of mine to help with the decoding.

397
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:19,770
He found the initials of the person who wrote this program.

398
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,340
BGC which stands for "Bang Gak Com." It was a

399
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:28,940
computer club at Hankuk University. It was very popular in the 90s.

400
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,820
Did you look into his personal details?

401
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,540
Of course.

402
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:38,140
He has been missing for the last 28 years. 
    

403
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,760
   

404
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,530
We should call Mr. Sim Young Seob's mother.

405
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,770
She might have heard something about Dong Bang Min from her son.

406
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,360
Okay.

407
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,350
Is this Mr. Sim Young Seob's mother?

408
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,180
I am Director Kang Kwon Joo from the Vimo Provincial Police Agency.

409
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,670
He only went to that island because he was told he would receive a lot of money

410
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:06,300
if he became the tutor for a rich family's grandchild.
    

411
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,570
 But the police there 

412
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,320
 said my son stole jewelry from that house and fled. 

413
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,460
They said he didn't go missing but ran away instead.

414
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,950
He said the kid he was teaching was constantly abused. He was always worried for the kid.

415
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,440
 Hit me! 

416
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,420
 Mom! 

417
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,200
That grandfather in that house hated his son and his daughter-in-law so much that

418
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,770
he even harassed his grandson.

419
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,840
 Dad! 

420
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,510
 Mom! Mom! 

421
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,700
 Mom! 

422
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,320
He worried about the child all the time so he tried to get him out of there.

423
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,070
 No! No! 

424
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:02,440
  Mr. Sim! Mr. Sim! Mr. Sim! Mr. Sim! 

425
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,950
 - Mr. Sim! Mr. Sim!   
 - After that, he never contacted me again.

426
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,110
Thank you for your cooperation, Ma'am.

427
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:13,630
If we find any leads in your son's case, then we'll contact you.

428
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,360
This is an interview that Mr. Sim Young Seob did.

429
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,260
Wait a minute. 
    

430
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,450
 He had a spinal condition?  
    

431
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,990
 The sound of someone cracking their neck? 

432
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:33,410
 Yes. As if they have some sort of issue with their bones, muscles, or joints. 

433
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,980
 Could he be Dong Bang Min's third personality? 

434
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:54,580
 The video in which Detective Jo took Seung Ah to his foster father's room 

435
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,570
 caused him to lose the child abuse trial? 

436
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,440
 And the video was recorded by the foster father in advance? 

437
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,540
 Yes. I'm sure he forced Detective Jo. 

438
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,690
 And Captain suffers from   

439
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,280
 analgesia in his left arm   

440
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,020
 from childhood abuse. 

441
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,410
 It seems to be worsening these days, so I'm worried. 

442
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,780
Dong Bang Min has booked a flight to Fiji for tomorrow night.

443
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:32,040
So what you're saying is that I need to tell you everything

444
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,650
the Golden Time Team is doing to track Dong Bang Min.

445
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:44,140
You are quite outspoken, young man.

446
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,520
You committed a crime for your father's sake so

447
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,860
I'm sure you understand my feelings.

448
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:59,500
If you just switch out any evidence related to my grandson,

449
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,750
then I won't ask you to do anything else.

450
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:07,100
That way Min can comfortably leave this country.

451
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,990
Take this.

452
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,320
You won't be disappointed with the amount in there.

453
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,570
   

454
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,300
I like how quick you are when it comes to getting things done.

455
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,170
However, you must protect my identity.

456
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,920
As you already know, they're extremely tenacious.

457
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,470
Of course.

458
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,810
You should get going.

459
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,650
Do you remember the woman we killed because she saw us killing Sim Young Seob?

460
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:15,320
The single mother who had come here with a son and a daughter.

461
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,080
That American detective is the son.

462
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,960
Her son?

463
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,560
Her son?

464
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:33,060
 I was contacted by one of Dong Bang Heon Yup's men a while ago. 

465
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,570
 He offered me a huge amount of money. 

466
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,930
 So I told him I'd do it. 

467
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,160
 What? Detective Shim, you can't do that! 

468
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,700
 We don't have much time as it is. What if we lose him? 

469
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,230
 No matter how hard we dig into cults like those, we won't find even a speck of information. 

470
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:50,910
I should infiltrate the organization to find out what's going on. That would be the fastest,

471
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,480
so let's just do that.

472
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,080
 You cannot do that! 

473
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,290
 I didn't ask you to join the team for you to do this. 

474
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,330
 Director Kang, I am a police officer as well. 

475
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,640
 I just want to get rid of the psycho who  

476
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,710
 ruthlessly killed Detective Jo's sister and those innocent families and 

477
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:09,350
 the old geezer who takes advantage  

478
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,460
 of people who have hit rock bottom in their life. 

479
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,930
 Let me redeem myself for 

480
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,600
 what I did to you back then. 

481
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,700
 - Detective Shim— 
- Okay. 

482
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,390
 However, if you think you are in danger then you must stop right away. That's the condition. 

483
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,080
 Don't worry. 

484
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,780
 After all, I survived near-death blows from a kettlebell. (A cast-iron weight) 

485
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,040
Are you saying we should post something

486
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,540
that would entice Dong Bang Min into using a real member's ID?

487
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,050
That's right.

488
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:43,760
Dong Bang Min started developing multiple personalities as a result of the abuse Dong Bang Hyeon Yup put him through.

489
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,540
So far, we know that Eom Seok Gu, the kidnapper, is one of the personalities.

490
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,660
There are also Sim Young Seob, his former live-in tutor,

491
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,810
and the personalities that imitate Director Kang.

492
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,930
But the leading personality becomes stronger with time.

493
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:01,040
In Dong Bang Min's case, that's Circus Man, which means his desire to kill will become stronger.

494
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:08,530
So it's highly likely that he'll try to kill someone before leaving for Fiji if the opportunity allows.

495
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,300
We must lure him and catch him today, no matter what.

496
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,090
But what if he doesn't take the bait?

497
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,780
What will we do then?

498
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,730
We'll make him take the bait.

499
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,620
The location is Gowol Beach, Cultural Mansion, Unit 105. It's owned by Director Yang's acquaintance.

500
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,920
Detective Shim is trying to approach Dong Bang Hyeon Yup at the moment,

501
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,920
so he won't be joining us on this operation.

502
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,980
Got it.

503
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,120
You two, check and block all exits around Cultural Mansion.

504
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,950
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

505
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:39,190
Agent Han, try to find members of the community who may be suffering a similar type of abuse.

506
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,080
Got it.

507
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,410
Hello? Yes.

508
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,490
You're here?

509
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:32,050
I'll go to the exhibition hall, so meet me there.

510
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,050
Okay.

511
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,290
   

512
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,550
Detective Jo, I found it.

513
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:14,050
Let's go with the second one, "Cowboy," 
    

514
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,100
   

515
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,000
His name is Woo Ye Joon. He's 18.

516
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,420
I did some digging because he hasn't logged in recently,

517
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,690
and he left to study in the States three months ago.

518
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:33,530
Then change the address on the account and post something as if his grandfather abused him.

519
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,540
Yes, Sir.

520
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,470
 I have no parents and live with my grandpa, and I think he's a demon.  

521
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:46,540
 He's mad rich. He buys luxury watches if I ask. 

522
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:52,280
 What? Saet Byeol's adoptive parents said they'd take it to court? 

523
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,770
 Look. We've been short-staffed lately. 

524
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,760
 We try to give her a lot of attention, but it's hard. 

525
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,660
Then raise our budget or something.

526
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,530
 Not to be insensitive, but you just dumped her on us. 

527
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,820
Don't rebel. We're bound to meet.

528
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:15,460
We understand the feeling of hopelessness the best.

529
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:26,470
What? Cowboy?

530
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:31,960
   

531
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:45,030
I'm more drawn to him.

532
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,560
It brings back memories. Joo Beom Tae.

533
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,440
   

534
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,400
   

535
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,610
It's here.

536
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,880
- What? 
 - What?

537
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,360
   

538
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,020
K? The ID is different.

539
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,640
- See if it's him. 
 - Okay.

540
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,420
It is Dong Bang Min, I'm positive.

541
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,760
Be careful. He caught on last time when we set a trap using "Angry."

542
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,680
Okay.

543
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,680
 Whatever. My grandpa is still super strong. 

544
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,680
   

545
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,660
   

546
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,130
 Have you experienced this too? 

547
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:49,330
The important thing is, you are very lucky.

548
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:51,740
You met me.

549
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,540
   

550
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,260
We got a message asking for our address.

551
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,180
- Send the time and place. 
 - Got it.

552
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,880
Cultural Mansion, Unit 105 at 30 Gowol 4-gil, Gowol town.

553
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,060
 COWBOY: You can teach my grandpa a lesson tonight, right? 

554
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,420
   

555
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:23,290
 COWBOY: Of course. I wouldn't live with that psycho if I had parents. 

556
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,560
   

557
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,520
 KILL4U: I'll just squeeze in with you in the back seat. Drop me off at the Port of Busan. 

558
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,220
 KILL4U: I'll just leave if you're late. 

559
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,560
Two prey at once.

560
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:51,750
Let's go first and get in position.

561
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,690
- I'll run things here at the center. Be careful. 
 - I will.

562
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:58,290
- Keep checking the messages. 
 - Okay.

563
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,320
   

564
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,000
Director Kang! Dong Bang Min left the community.

565
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,080
He logged out.

566
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:20,590
Darn it. This jerk. He was two-timing me while we were messaging.

567
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,330
Director Kang, It's Kill4U.

568
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:32,390
He messaged Kill4U first.

569
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:36,040
Kill4U? That's Saet Byeol.

570
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,120
Team Leader Cheon. Please check Kwon Saet Byeol's cell phone.

571
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,600
She was a student involved in the stalking victim case from a few days ago. It's urgent.

572
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,610
Darn it. You will die by decapitation?

573
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,600
Gosh. What a bad fortune—

574
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,260
You scared me.

575
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:11,020
Are you going out?

576
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,890
I'm not sure at all.

577
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:21,120
I've always wondered...

578
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,710
if you could foresee your own future if you have divinational powers.

579
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:28,120
What do you mean?

580
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:33,340
That's right. You wouldn't know because you're a fake.

581
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,740
Mother. Oh my gosh.

582
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:48,120
Mother. Wake up, Mother.

583
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,010
Young Master.

584
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:06,800
Please...

585
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,040
H-Help...

586
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,520
Don't worry.

587
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,550
I'll finish you off later

588
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,800
along with that kid.

589
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:39,410
Wait. Come to think of it, you look like a family.

590
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:43,060
Dad, Mom,

591
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,860
and daughter.

592
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,140
How nice.

593
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,940
A family.

594
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,290
   

595
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:05,010
Director Kang, here you go.

596
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,580
 The call cannot be completed. 

597
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,790
Team Leader Cheon, track Saet Byeol's cellphone.

598
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,310
Got it.

599
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,520
    

600
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,930
This is the New Day Shelter, right? I'm Director Kang Kwon Joo from the Vimo Police Agency.

601
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,120
By any chance, is Saet Byeol there?

602
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,990
Yes, she's probably in her room. 
    

603
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,590
She's not here.

604
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:38,120
Ma'am! Actually, Saet Byeol's adopted father almost dragged her away from here a while ago.

605
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,010
What!

606
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:42,140
He says Saet Byeol's adopted father almost dragged her away.

607
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,700
 Hold on. 

608
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,760
Oh, there's a note here.

609
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,880
It says that someone she knows will drop her off at the Busan Port. What should we do?

610
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,400
All right.

611
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,690
 In that state she logged on to the community and Dong Bang Min approached her on purpose. 

612
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,590
 Would he actually show up as his true self? 

613
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,080
We have a Code One case. 
    

614
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,500
Kwon Saet Byeol is assumed to be missing after

615
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,930
exchanging messages with Dong Bang Min on the Circus Pierrot Community.

616
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,260
Her location is Saenal Shelter, 14-Hami Road, Hami District.

617
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,120
Requesting Dispatch teams and patrol officers in the area to head out.

618
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,050
 Director Kang, what did you just say? 

619
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:19,160
 I'm sure Dong Bang Min has changed his target from Cowboy to Saet Byeol. 

620
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,420
 Saet Byeol was in a state of panic because her adoptive father 

621
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:26,650
almost took her away from the shelter. She just happened to exchange messages with Dong Bang Min.

622
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:28,420
After which she did leave the shelter.

623
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,500
Agent Heo, track the location of Dong Bang Min's phone number which we have in our records.

624
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,450
Got it.

625
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,960
   

626
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,830
   

627
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:43,480
Director Kang! We've got the location from Dong Bang Min's cellphone!

628
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,760
He's on Route 50 right now. He just left Hyojin Road and is headed toward Hami Neighborhood.

629
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,890
Looking at the speed at which he is moving, he must be in a car.

630
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:53,090
Now check Dong Bang Min's car and see if it's headed toward Hami Neighborhood as well.

631
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,680
Got it.

632
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,380
Director Kang, the car on Route 50 heading toward Hami Neighborhood, is registered to Dong Bang Min.

633
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,050
It's a black Maxus, License 43Ra1403, it passed by 2 minutes ago.

634
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,880
It matches up to the location of the cell phone almost perfectly.

635
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,910
 This is the center. Dong Bang Min's car, 

636
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:13,080
 a black Maxus, License 43Ra1403, is heading toward Hami Neighborhood. 

637
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,780
Except for the agents who are receiving emergency calls, everyone else track car license 43Ra1403 using the real-time security footage.

638
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,190
 - Yes, Ma'am. 
 - Yes, Ma'am. 

639
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,250
What's going on?

640
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,320
Why aren't they here?

641
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:51,020
 Is that the correct car? 

642
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,630
 What's going on? It's not even raining. 

643
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:01,080
 Why does he have a raincoat on? 

644
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,820
   

645
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,710
Director Kang, I've found it!

646
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:21,440
This is Center. Dong Bang Min's car has already passed by the shelter in Hami Neighborhood and is now headed toward Gowol.

647
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,480
I'll ask for backup from the local stations. So make sure to track down

648
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,810
Dong Bang Min's car.

649
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,410
Isn't there a shortcut we can take?

650
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:31,350
Wait a minute.

651
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,140
Hold on. Isn't that him? The black Maxus!

652
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,270
That's right!

653
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,990
Wait...

654
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,220
He's just pushing his way through!

655
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:51,960
Hold on tight!

656
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,550
Dispatch Team, are you all right?

657
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:03,300
 This is Dispatch 3. We are all safe. 

658
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,290
 We'll continue to follow him. 

659
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:31,060
If you go straight you'll reach the Gowol market.

660
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:33,100
There's an alley with a dead-end behind the market.

661
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,530
We're still on it.

662
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,550
We've found Dong Bang Min.

663
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,980
Saet Byeol! Wake up, Saet Byeol!

664
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,080
She's still alive!

665
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:02,910
Call an ambulance!

666
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:05,730
Detective Jo! There's a person back here too.

667
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,330
She's still alive.

668
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:14,010
Hurry and call the ambulances. Hurry!

669
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:16,600
Did you see anyone get out of the car?

670
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,590
He went into that building.

671
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:21,270
Let's go.

672
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,780
This is Dispatch 3.

673
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,460
A man, who we suspect as Dong Bang Min, has entered this building.

674
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,490
 Be careful. 

675
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:33,660
   

676
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,970
I'm going to head down to the basement. You two go upstairs.

677
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:01,240
 Detective Jo! Move! 

678
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:12,370
You're quick.

679
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,390
Looks like you do want to live

680
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:18,290
even after you left your sister to die.

681
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:32,430
   

682
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:37,270
   

683
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:45,610


684
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:52,730
   

685
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:56,290
 You woke me up, so you have to pay for that. 

686
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:58,310
 Director Kang, come out. 

687
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:03,300
 Tell me why you have been following me all this time? Why did you make a personality that mimics me and kill people while disguised as me? 

688
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,010
 Tell me now! Now! 

689
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,040
 He was nothing short of the devil. 

690
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,650
 Whether you call a lawyer or not, do as you wish. 

691
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:09,770
 How dare you! 

692
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:11,170
 My memories are slowly coming back to me. 

693
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:13,210
 Then, Dong Bang Min, do you admit to these charges? 

694
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,210
 Don't answer. 

695
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,280
 I'm sorry. 

696
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,790
 I'll pay for my consequences.
