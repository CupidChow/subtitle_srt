1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600


2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,550
   

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,530
   

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,370
   

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,830
   

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,700
   

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,050
    
    

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,360
   

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,000
    

10
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,190
Hold on. Isn't that him? The black Maxus!

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,480
That's right! That's right!

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,950
Wait...

13
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:08,960


14
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,310
He's just pushing his way through!

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,170
Get out!

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,910
Hold on tight!

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,560
Dispatch Team, are you all right?

18
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,400
 This is Dispatch 3. We are all safe. 

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,390
 We'll continue to follow him. 

20
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,730
In the end, you made me come out.

21
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,160
Now, all of you, stay out of this.

22
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,170
I was going to kill you with my own hands. I'm sorry.

23
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,190
There isn't enough time.

24
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,490
Excuse me.  Nothing is going to happen to us, right?

25
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:57,460
You woke me up, so you must pay the price.

26
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,500
   

27
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,130
   

28
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,990
   

29
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,050
   

30
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,840
We've found Dong Bang Min.

31
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,760
   

32
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,430
Saet Byeol! Wake up, Saet Byeol!

33
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,480
She's still alive!

34
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,420
Call an ambulance!

35
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,400
Detective Jo! There's a person back here, too.

36
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,720
- She's still alive. 
 - Hurry and call an ambulance.

37
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,570
Hurry!

38
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,080
Did you see anyone get out of the car?

39
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,180
He went into that building.

40
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,980
Let's go.

41
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,870
Come out, Center Director.

42
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,230
This is Dispatch 3. A man, who we suspect as Dong Bang Min, has entered this building.

43
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,290
 Be careful. 

44
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,830
I'm going to head down to the basement. You two go upstairs.

45
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,080
- You go that way. 
 - Yes.

46
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,280
 Detective Jo! Move! 

47
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,290
You're quick. It looks like you want to live

48
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,210
even after you left your sister to die.

49
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,160
Detective Gu. Detective Park. Dong Bang Min is attacking Detective Jo right now.

50
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,250
- Please back him up. 
 - I'll go!

51
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,590
 Detective Jo, Detective Gu is coming over. 

52
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,910
Detective Gu?

53
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,080
Why? You're not enough alone?

54
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,020
 He heard the director over the radio. 

55
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,480
 He definitely has something in his ear. 

56
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,660
Detective, every action relating to each personality

57
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,530
can become a trigger said the psychoanalyst. Do you remember that?

58
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,050
 Seeing how different the personality from the recording is from the one at the emergency,  
   

59
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,530
 it seems like the bond between the sub-personalities is strong. 

60
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:07,490
 One way is to tell the main personality what the sub-personalities have been doing. 

61
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,020
Eom Seok Gu. Sim Young Seob.

62
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,950
We figured out your identities.

63
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,100
Those two personalities you've created,

64
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,010
both got murdered because of you.

65
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,450
Am I right?

66
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:25,480
I'm not sure. I don't know what you are talking about Detective Jo.

67
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,040
All right. I know that you were abused as a child.

68
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,730
However, do you think it's an excuse to kill innocent people?

69
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,620
You just wanted to use those poor kids to kill someone, you bastard!

70
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,770
What do you mean by "use"?

71
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,530
Detective Jo, those kids wanted to kill their parents.

72
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,390
I was just helping them.

73
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,210
In fact, we found out while investigating Sim Young Seob,

74
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,740
how Dong Bang Heon Yup believed in that grotesque god

75
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,820
led to your going insane.

76
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,460
Admit to the murders committed by your personalities.

77
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,130
That is if you want to receive punishment as a human and not as a monster.

78
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,900
Detective, I think the real Dong Bang Min is reacting right now.

79
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,710
 And remember... 

80
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,470
No matter how you try to deny it!

81
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,070
Everything was done by you.

82
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,170
Everything was done by you bastard!

83
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,420
Bastard.

84
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,420
This bastard.

85
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,770
Get up.

86
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,640
Get up, youâ€”

87
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,580
What do you think you know that you can spout nonsense?

88
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:15,020
If it wasn't for us, Dong Bang Min would've committed suicide already. Got that, Detective Jo?

89
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,860
This is Dispatch 2. Dong Bang Min is escaping through the alley behind Gowol Market.

90
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,880
The dispatch team and all other teams in the vicinity should block the area around Gowol Market and search!

91
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,860
- Are you okay? 
  - Yes.  

92
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,880
I'm fine.

93
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,170
 And I have the thing that was in Dong Bang Min's ear. 

94
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,800
 It looks like a hearing aid. I'll hand it off to the dispatch team. 

95
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,030
- Did you see him? 
 - I don't see him.

96
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,530
Please hand this off to the dispatch team.

97
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,390
Let's go this way.

98
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,060
Team Leader Cheon, please check if there is a CCTV behind Gowol Market.

99
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,840
Yes.

100
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,070
Center Director, there is one CCTV at the end of the alley behind the market.

101
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,090
Oh? That looks like Dong Bang Min.

102
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,930
This is Center. Everyone, please listen.

103
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,040
Serial killer Dong Bang Min is escaping through an alley behind Gowol Market

104
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,720
after attempting to kidnap and attacking the police.

105
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,510
   

106
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,740
This is a micro digital hearing aid that reaches all the way into your eardrum.

107
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,150
I've never seen this brand before. What is it?

108
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,780
Agent Han, I'll send you a picture. Look into this hearing aid.

109
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,300
Yes.

110
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,300
 Why did he go this far to impersonate me? 

111
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,840
Center Director, over there.

112
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,000
This is Center.

113
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,200
 Dong Bang Min has gone into a building in Susang Neighborhood. 

114
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,740
- Susang Neighborhood? 
 - It's over there!

115
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,370
   
   

116
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,420
Please save me!

117
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,250
This is Dispatch 2. Dong Bang Min has taken a hostage.

118
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,920
 Let that person go. Quickly. 

119
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,750
Don't come near me!

120
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,260
Detective Jo.

121
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,870
What do I do?

122
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,450
I think I've killed someone.

123
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,980
Stop spouting nonsense, you psycho. Let her go.

124
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,220
- Quickly! 
 - Don't come near me!

125
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,930
Please...

126
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,000
I might cut this person. Please don't come near me.

127
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,620
 Dong Bang Min is howling with anguish, but something's off. 

128
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,250
I'm counting to three.

129
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,950
One...

130
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,230
Two...

131
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,290
Come here, you bastard.

132
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,020
Detective Jo.

133
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,330
Just kill me.

134
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,380
Detective Jo!

135
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,410
Just kill me.

136
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,260
The fact that I killed someone

137
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,800
makes me want to die.

138
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,340
   

139
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,010
Detective Jo! You can't! Stop!

140
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,640
Detective Jo!

141
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,290
Detective Jo!

142
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,310
 Detective Jo! You can't!  

143
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,080
Detective Jo, let's catch him first.

144
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,310
After we arrest him, we can decide whether we'll kill him or keep him alive. Okay?

145
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,130
Just pull the trigger.

146
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:34,750
A bastard like me, just kill me already!

147
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,360
 Detective, your mother and Miss Seung Ah 

148
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,290
 will be sadder to see you fall apart 

149
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,620
 for the sake of revenge. 

150
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,130
You did well.

151
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,820
Good job! Good job!

152
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,250
Dong Bang Min, I am arresting you for the family murder case and attempted murder.

153
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,480
You have the right to remain silent and the right to consult a lawyer.

154
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,250
This is Dispatch 1. We have arrested Dong Bang Min,

155
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,050
and we will return once we clean up the area here.

156
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,520
What? Dong Bang Min?

157
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,200
You caught him at the scene displaying his multiple personality disorder?

158
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,150
  Yes. I'll give you the details once we return,  

159
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,660
  but we personally witnessed his multiple personalities.  

160
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,150
All right. Great work, Team Leader Park.

161
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,230
The culprit in the Sanggae Neighborhood Family Murder case is Dong Bang Min.

162
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,390
He also killed Gong Su Ji.

163
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,300
The Golden Time Team was chasing him

164
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,320
and is bringing him back from Gowol Market.

165
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,350
So go to the hospital and get victim statements while we're waiting for the questioning.

166
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,070
Yes.

167
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,520
Chief, we have a problem. Someone must've notified the press

168
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,280
- because the reporters heard and are coming to the scene. 
 - What?

169
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,980
Are you believing Min's words?

170
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,720
 We will be receiving Min's statement here. 

171
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,460
Please call a lawyer if you wish.

172
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,420
What are you going to get from

173
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,560
a patient with a sleepwalking disorder?

174
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,960
There is no evidence more solid than a personal statement, right?

175
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,050
Should we send someone...

176
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,620
or would you like to come here yourself?

177
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,350
 Please tell me which condition you prefer. 

178
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,860
This is the best I can do.

179
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:06,490
It was I who even took in your daughter. How can you do this to me?

180
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,620
My daughter, Mi Yeon, is not in her right mind right now because of her sick daughter,

181
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,950
 but she will return to normal shortly. 

182
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,860
Fine.

183
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,870
I'll come there with a lawyer.

184
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,250
I heard.

185
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,920
You caught Dong Bang Min in the act.

186
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,020
Go ahead and finish with all you've got.

187
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,060
I'll help as much as I can until he's handed off to the investigation team.

188
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:37,150
I'd like to apologize for not believing you until now.

189
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,450
To tell you the truth, I owed the old man

190
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,390
a long time ago for the resort

191
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,050
that my husband ran.

192
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,190
You told me.

193
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,180
Crimes are being hidden

194
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,840
because we are staying silent on behalf of our families.

195
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,250
I am open to punishment

196
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,020
so don't worry,

197
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,030
and finish this case up the way you'd like.

198
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,030
Thank you for being honest.

199
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,370
I will do my best.

200
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,160
 The real perpetrator of the Sanggae Neighborhood Family Murder case that happened on the 25th has been arrested,  

201
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,480
 and was taken to the Vimo Police Station just now. 

202
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,030
 The perpetrator was revealed to be a president of a worldwide special effects studio, 

203
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,380
 Mr. Dong Bang Min. 

204
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,860
 Mr. Dong Bang Min suffers from a multiple personality disorder 

205
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,960
 and has testified that it was not him, but his other personalities that committed the crimes...  

206
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,730
Good work.

207
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,730
Dong Bang Min's testimony is what's important.

208
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,100
He wouldn't get caught this easily.

209
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,990
I was going to say. Dong Bang Min's voice is different from what we heard at the hospital.

210
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,960
At the hospital, it might have been because he was nervous, but his larynx was stiff

211
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,330
and completely different just now.

212
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,600
Let's go.

213
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,060
Commissioner.

214
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,060
This is Han Si Hyeong, a psychoanalyst and profiler.

215
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,790
He says that you are already acquaintances?

216
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,360
Yes. Hello.

217
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,100
I am Han Si Hyeong.

218
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,120
Multiple personality disorder crimes are not common,

219
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,920
so I already looked at the videos,

220
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,630
but I will discuss them with you once they talk.

221
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,890
Instead of doing it like this, let's start with the jurisdiction of the first case.

222
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,630
Technically, shouldn't the Central Office start first?

223
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,270
Why are you being greedy and starting first?

224
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:57,630
Chae Young. I mean, Attorney Ok Chae Young.

225
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,100
I understand your respectful feelings

226
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,720
for Sonang Village having grown up there after your parents died.

227
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,670
But Min already has two cases of attempted murder, only on Vimo Island.

228
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,360
Don't waste your energy.

229
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,690
Young Master, if you don't remember, don't admit to it.

230
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,770
He might've testified incorrectly because of your coercive investigation.

231
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,660
No. I am slowly remembering everything.

232
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,270
I will receive my punishment.

233
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,360
Then, Mr. Dong Bang Min,

234
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,790
do you admit to your psychological problems?

235
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,920
Don't respond.

236
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,540
I do.

237
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,360
Please.

238
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,290
Lock me up somewhere...

239
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,030
and treat me.

240
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,440
The memories slowly coming back is even worse for me.

241
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,520
I'd rather just forget everything.

242
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,620
If you respond honestly, we can help you.

243
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:28,210
Have you ever felt more than two personalities or identities that are different from your own?

244
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,990
Yes.

245
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,000
I got to know that very well today.

246
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,390
When did your memory of the trauma incidents start cutting off?

247
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,150
Well...

248
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,080
I keep remembering that moment...

249
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,900
I'm sorry.

250
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,650
 Something's weird, for sure. Why is he acting like that all of a sudden? 

251
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,770
I'm sorry.

252
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,220
I'll need a precision analysis to be sure,

253
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,710
but I think it's obvious that he does have multiple personality disorder.

254
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,960
All right. Explain your crimes in order.

255
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,090
Starting from the September 2020 case.

256
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,780
Hold on, I'm sorry.

257
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,790
I'm confused by all the memories

258
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,510
that are coming back to me.

259
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,540
Commissioner, I have something to check.

260
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,810
Chief Yang, please let Detective Jo meet the victim.

261
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,400
Detective Jo, don't let your emotions get the best of you.

262
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,740
Stay calm.

263
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,180
Look carefully at what you've done.

264
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,170
- I can't. 
 - No.

265
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,290
You have to. Look at me while you talk.

266
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,820
Why did you kill my innocent sister like this?

267
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,460
Tell me.

268
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,500
- Tell me, you bastard! 
 -What are you doing?

269
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,220
- Tell me! 
 - Detective Jo, what are you doing?

270
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,460
Do you want to be excluded from the investigation?

271
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,830
I probably envied the fact that she had a family to believe in and rely on.

272
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,680
All I have for a family...

273
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,160
- is a grandfather who abused me.

274
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,880
What? Envy?

275
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,430
I'm sorry, Detective Jo.

276
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,290
I'm sorry.

277
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,730
You're crying?

278
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,920
Do you think it's over if you cry about putting my sister in this state?

279
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,180
You bastard, I should have killed you back there.

280
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,710
A bastard like you doesn't even have the right to be punished under the law!

281
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,640
Take him out now!

282
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,760
- Take him out! Take Detective Jo out! 
 - Let go!

283
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,800
Do you want to be sued for assault?

284
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,280
I'll kill you. I'll be sure to kill you.

285
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:07,170
We should get a warrant for treatment at a closed ward.

286
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,200
How are we supposed to testify in such a scary environment?

287
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,070
Chief Yang, wrap it up

288
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,770
 and lock him up. 

289
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,640
We won't let you get away with today's abusive language.

290
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:54,520
Dong Bang Min, you worked so hard to impersonate me until now.

291
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,030
Because of that, something became very clear to me.

292
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:02,010
We've... met before, right?

293
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,400
Why did you make a personality that impersonates me,

294
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,960
and why did you kill people using my appearance?

295
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,260
Tell me now. Now!

296
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:15,080
I don't know. I can't remember.

297
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,630
It must simply be

298
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,030
because I was abused at a young age.

299
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:26,800
Young Master, just go. There is no need to engage.

300
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,710
Dong Bang Min. Dong Bang Min!

301
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,820
Stop.

302
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,350
You're saying that you remember killing that family?

303
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,120
No, Grandfather.

304
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,310
I didn't do it. The other personalities inside my body did it.

305
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,820
Please help me.

306
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,240
You, Daegeun.

307
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,200
You know that I helped your father in Sonang Village, right?

308
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,620
Just 5 minutes.

309
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,660
Other personalities?

310
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,530
Whatever happened,

311
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,550
in the end, they're all things that you did.

312
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,340
And didn't you go around saying

313
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,920
that this grandfather killed them all?

314
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,020
You insolent bastard.

315
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,260
Tell the police

316
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,790
that you lied. Now!

317
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,180
You know better than me

318
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,570
that I'm not lying.

319
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,470
If you keep acting like this,

320
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,720
you and I are over!

321
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,170
It's become more obvious now.

322
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,460
He's not Dong Bang Min right now.

323
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,890
We're seeing him for the first time.

324
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:15,820
What do you mean?

325
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,840
When he was looking at the pictures of the victims,

326
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,730
I don't know if it was because of the change in his hormones, but his gaze changed for a second.

327
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:26,330
He already knew the situation inside those pictures, and he had no feelings of regret whatsoever.

328
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,050
 A bastard like you doesn't even have the right to be punished under the law! 

329
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,840
 Take him out! 

330
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,240
 Take him out! Take Detective Jo out now! 

331
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,080
He doesn't make any characteristic noises, like the other personalities.

332
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,220
Instead, he was enjoying it.

333
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,870
So a new personality is impersonating Dong Bang Min?

334
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,640
No. There is a high likelihood that

335
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,690
this personality is the real personality.

336
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,850
Are you trying to use me as a scapegoat

337
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,140
and escape with your hands clean?

338
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,480
You killed them, those people.

339
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,590
This bastard...

340
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:08,580
still hasn't gotten ahold of his senses.

341
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,520
Why?

342
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,280
Should I tell you more about the dirty things you've done? What should I tell you about?

343
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,500
The fact that you play with those stupid people in Sonang Village and beat them to death like a dog once they mess up?

344
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,970
Or the fact that you abused your adopted son, my dad, until he died?

345
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,560
Or the fact that you touched my mother

346
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,910
and gave birth to me?

347
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,170
Father.

348
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,370
I didn't know I had so many brothers and sisters.

349
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,180
When you beat my mom and dad...

350
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,260
No.

351
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,340
When you beat that man and woman in front of my eyes, I decided,

352
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,160
"If I don't act obediently in front of this person, I'll die too."

353
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,480
That's why I made those personalities that you like so much.

354
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,810
Why?

355
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:08,600
Because if I die at your hands, I can't punish this horrible world.

356
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,220
So before I reveal everything,

357
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,210
move me to the hospital.

358
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,190
Do you understand?

359
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,800
Father?

360
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,770
He is different from the Circus Man who is always angry.

361
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,610
He is someone who leisurely enjoys killing people.

362
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,860
That guy knew what the other personalities were doing.

363
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,530
Of course. Even though he's arrested now, if he brings the innocent Dong Bang Min out,

364
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,130
his mental and physical weakness can shorten his sentence to 5 years.

365
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,590
- Yes, Agent Han. 
 - Center Director,

366
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,880
I've got the expressed hearing aid analysis results from the scientific investigation team.

367
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,060
The frequency band is extremely wide, and it has up to 72 channels. 
     

368
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,720
Most people hear up to about 8,000 Hz,

369
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,680
but this device can hear up to 20,000 Hz.

370
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,120
 It's in a different class from normal hearing aids. 

371
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,960
This is almost on par with the communication equipment used by the U.S. Special Forces.

372
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,450
Did you look into the brand "FR" that is written on the device?

373
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:14,380
I looked everywhere for it,

374
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,690
but there is no hearing aid with that name.

375
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,410
Do whatever you can to find out what that "FR" means.

376
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:24,190
Yes. And I just found out because of that detour IP,

377
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,290
Dong Bang Min ordered some suspicious things

378
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,200
from a special effects store called SFX World to Sonang Village.

379
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,660
A silicone adhesive called Telesis,

380
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:38,010
anti-counterfeit PVC film, a white wig, and even a beard.

381
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,830
White wig?

382
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,280
- All right. Good work. 
 - Yes.

383
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:50,940
It looks like Dong Bang Min is trying to get out by disguising himself as an old man.

384
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,480
Center Director.

385
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,870
Here.

386
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,570
Dong Bang Heon Yeop brought this out of a prayer room and was burning it, so I looked at it,

387
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,380
and it was Dong Bang Min's DNA test

388
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,020
and the results of a development test.

389
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,370
If you look here,

390
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,920
it says he doesn't match his dad, Dong Bang Nam Joon,

391
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,920
but matches with Dong Bang Heon Yup.

392
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,650
What?

393
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,440
Are you saying that Dong Bang Min isn't his grandson,

394
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,850
but his son?

395
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,110
That's not all.

396
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,680
This is a statement of opinion on a developmental test

397
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,040
that Dong Bang Min did at age 7.

398
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,480
 He is better developed than average children his age in all aspects. 

399
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,260
 He may have a conduct disorder but generally, he is good in all aspects, particularly since his intelligence is excellent. 

400
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,070
 ...He has a high likelihood of a personality disorder but he doesn't have any psychotic symptoms but a future re-test is required.  

401
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,930
It says that he is still a child, but has a high likelihood of a personality disorder.

402
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,150
If his main personality had a personality disorder,

403
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,220
his reaction when he looked at the photos makes sense.

404
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:53,550
 This situation is similar to Team Leader Do and Kaneki. 
 (Characters from Voice 3) 

405
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:59,640
Detective Park, I received a Statement of Opinion that Dong Bang Min most likely had a personality disorder when he was young.

406
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,260
Look for any related information, and it also turns out his father was really his foster father.

407
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,640
Look into that as well.

408
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,770
 A lowly human dared to wake me, 

409
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,350
 so you must receive your punishment. 

410
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,870
 Please. Please get me out of here. 

411
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,040
 I'm scared. 

412
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,900
Don't be scared.

413
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,520
Soon... you'll disappear as well.

414
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,530
   

415
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,820
   

416
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,740
   

417
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,130
 You dared to wake me? 

418
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,140
 You should pay for disturbing us. 

419
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,780
 Stop lying. You attacked me with a different personality just now. 

420
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,610
 Eom Seok Goo. The Center Director that lures kids with her hearing. 

421
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,080
 The one that plans everything, in total three personalities! 

422
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,170
 You three went around killing that family. 

423
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,970
 Don't you think it's disgusting, living together 

424
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:17,290
 over something as simple as this? 

425
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:21,130
 You must have put your life on the line in order to run away from us. 

426
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,700
 Please save me. Please. 

427
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,110
 Beom Tae! 

428
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,310
 Beom Tae! 

429
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,110
 Stop! 

430
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,100
 Don't do it! 

431
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,050
I really...

432
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:42,600
 No. You're not the real Dong Bang Min, so don't worry. 

433
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,640
 You're just a personality I created. 

434
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,410
 You're a fake. 

435
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,700
Who are you?

436
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,240
 Me? 

437
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,040
How ignorant.

438
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,370
Agent Park, how are Saet Byeol and Ko Kyeong Hee?

439
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,310
Saet Byeol woke up after the anesthesia wore off.

440
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:45,040
Ko Kyeong Hee is finished with her emergency surgery,

441
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,180
but the doctors say we have to wait and see.

442
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,610
Center Director, give me a second.

443
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,580
Please save me!

444
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,780
Miss Ko Kyeong Hee, please calm down.

445
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,220
It's okay. We're at the hospital.

446
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:06,210
Dong Bang Min has been arrested, so rest assured.

447
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:11,750
Are you sure... he was arrested?

448
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,610
I'll tell you everything about that monster Dong Bang Min.

449
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:25,480
And that grandpa.

450
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,820
Center Director, I think you should head over here.

451
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,970
All right. I'll go there right away.

452
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:33,110
I think I'll have to head over to the hospital.

453
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,540
Detective Shim, please look into Dong Bang Min along with Agent Han.

454
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,180
Yes.

455
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,220
Let's go.

456
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:49,650
That wasn't Young Master at all.

457
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:53,410
He was the Devil himself.

458
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,610
 I've always wanted to ask you this, 

459
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:59,770
 but if you're a shaman, can you predict your own future? 

460
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,650
 Don't worry. I'll finish killing you later. 

461
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,540
He said he would finish killing you?

462
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,210
Yes.

463
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:19,910
I was so, so scared.

464
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,550
It's all right now.

465
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:28,590
Miss Ko Kyeong Hee, you are safe now.

466
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,980
If it's too difficult, shall we take a break?

467
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,630
No... I'll tell you right now.

468
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:44,350
I shouldn't have come to this village in the first place.

469
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,550
I was escaping after committing fraud

470
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,970
and I only came here

471
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,620
after hearing about a village for people who had nowhere to go.

472
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:57,280
 Village Chief! 

473
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,730
 Hello, princesses. 

474
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,460
 Have you eaten? 

475
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,650
 - Of course, of course. 
 - Have you come? 

476
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,900
 Yes. Hello. 

477
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,810
 Today, I will introduce this lady to you all. 

478
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,750
 This lady right here 

479
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,330
 is here to share your health, your worries, 

480
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,370
 and all of the misfortunes in your life 

481
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,390
 and will teach you the form of mind. 

482
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:35,480
 So, I will introduce her as your representative mother. 

483
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,150
 Nice to meet you. 

484
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,970
 Thank you for coming. 

485
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:45,030
Sonang Village follows a fake god called the Diety

486
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:48,550
and is a village that cruelly cons people who have been

487
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,760
abandoned or scarred.

488
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,840
- Family Head Park Min Soo. 
 - Yes.

489
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,510
- Family Head Han Dong Chul. 
 - Yes.  
    

490
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:59,140
- Have you all checked your deposits? 
  - Yes. 

491
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,060
- Clap! 
   - Thank you! 

492
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,470
 Thank you! 

493
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,890
Then everyone please return your account books

494
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,330
and let's work hard this month

495
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,540
for the development of Sonang Village.

496
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,520
Clap!

497
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,050
Clap!

498
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,810
Bow to our Village Chief.

499
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,780
He took everyone's money, saying that he would expand them.

500
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,940
 All you have to do is write honestly. 

501
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,160
     

502
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,350
    

503
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,350
 Comfortably. 

504
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,270
    

505
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:39,600
When I received my shamanic abilities, as the representative mother,

506
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,500
I controlled people.

507
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,650
 If you pray, luck will come. 

508
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,110
We fed a hallucinogenic drug called the Vimo Grass,

509
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,400
to brainwash the people who had suspicions,

510
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,670
saying that it was medicine

511
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,800
sent from the Diety.

512
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,360
What's worse is that...

513
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,040
that old man impersonated the Diety

514
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,590
and did awful things

515
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,130
to the girls in order to

516
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,020
fulfill his greed for children

517
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,510
Out of the children who were born like that,

518
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,190
the smartest one was Young Master,

519
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,790
Dong Bang Min.

520
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:24,650
When someone tried to report the truth, he killed them without anyone knowing.

521
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:29,730
The villagers of Sonang Village were Dong Bang Heon Yup's slaves.

522
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,470
Not a family.

523
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:36,830
By any chance, is that tattoo on your arm

524
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,880
a symbol of Sonang villagers?

525
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,260
This?

526
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:46,760
Only the weakest people within Sonang Village have this.

527
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,980
Of course, they were told that they were "chosen" or some bullshit.

528
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,080
The loners.

529
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,220
The people who have no one to ask for help no matter what.

530
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,490
The people who are in desperate need

531
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,830
of a wall and a family.

532
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:07,640
These words. Can you repeat them in court?

533
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,280
I will testify.

534
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,020
In the materials store I often visit,

535
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,700
I hid a double book there.

536
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,150
I thought I should have a backup card just in case.

537
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,280
Good job.

538
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,070
Go tell Team Leader Park

539
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,370
to go with Detective Gu and get the double book that Miss Ko Kyeong Hee just talked about.

540
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,720
And Detective Park, go back to the Center.

541
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,960
I understand.

542
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,360
Yes, Chief Yang.

543
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,400
Already?

544
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,890
They're saying that Dong Bang Min is being transferred to a mental hospital right now.

545
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,780
I guess that's even better.

546
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,910
Let's start right away.

547
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:03,060
Chief, I have something to tell you.

548
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,420
  You get one visit and one check-in a day. 
    

549
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,330
We'll be injecting a stabilizer for the time being, so don't worry.

550
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:15,030
We also have a security fence, so he'll never be able to escape.

551
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,440
That's a relief.

552
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,060
- Thank you for your care. 
 - Of course.

553
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,860
This way.

554
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,160
We're here.

555
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,370
This too...

556
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,350
Yes, this way.

557
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:48,430
   

558
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,120
Open your mouth after swallowing it.

559
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,160
I won't wait.

560
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:35,930
Yes, Center Director. Dong Bang Min just went into the hospital ward,

561
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,180
and all the other patients have been moved to a different floor.

562
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,620
We'll head over to Sonang Village

563
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,190
and wait until the warrant comes out.

564
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,880
Yes.

565
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,900
   

566
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,760
Detective Gu said he is heading over to Sonang Village.

567
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,820
    

568
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,910
Yes, Team Leader Park.

569
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:58,350
Center Director, we found the double book that Ko Kyeong Hee talked about.

570
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:01,000
This looks like enough for a search and seizure.

571
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,260
Good work.

572
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,220
Now, we just need Detective Shim to do a good job.

573
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,210
Let's trust him.

574
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,140
 10 minutes later, the door will open.  

575
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,770
 Your old man bribed me, saying that you have to leave Korea in order for him to live.  

576
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:57,950
 It's your choice. Leave if you want. But when time passes, the doors will close, so figure it out yourself.  

577
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:36,930
How does it feel, hiding there?

578
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:41,360
Are you hiding in a hospital because I keep bothering you?

579
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,430
Center Director.

580
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,330
I came here in order to be treated.

581
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,940
I don't think you should be acting that leisurely.

582
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,340
The Center Director personality sent me a secret email.

583
00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:00,320
 She told me that she installed a camera in your basement behind your back, 

584
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,140
 and it should have recorded the fact you knew about all the other personalities. 

585
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,340
I'm in front of your house right now with the other detectives in order to obtain that evidence.

586
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,430
 This is the end, Dong Bang Min. 

587
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:15,610
 I will expose your main personality to the rest of the world. 

588
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,180
I guess I have another personality that I didn't know about.

589
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,250
I guess you didn't know.

590
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:27,130
I guess a despicable killer like you who hides behind fake personalities because you're scared of your grandfather,

591
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:31,590
would have never guessed

592
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:35,410
that your Center Director personality that impersonates me and uses that weird hearing aid

593
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:39,000
 would betray you in order to save other people. 

594
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:46,580
I guess that's a relief, that one of my personalities is trying to save people.

595
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,730
I know that's not true,

596
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:51,600
from the sound of your breath.

597
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,990
 I told you. 

598
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:56,520
 No matter, I will catch you, 

599
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,650
 the one who uses those personalities to kill innocent people. 

600
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,050
 Just wait. 

601
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:01,900
I'll let you rot

602
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,990
and die in misery in that prison cell.

603
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,940
This is Dispatch 3. We've ended the call. How is the situation there?

604
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:22,620
All the security sensors are down and I'm about to open the door and the gates.

605
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,310
I got it. Be careful.

606
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:29,430
Center Director, you dumb thing.

607
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,030
Chad, when Detective Shim comes down, guard the entrance.

608
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:04,470
The only exit is there, so wait there and follow him.

609
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,380
Yes, Cap.

610
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:10,050
This is Center Director. Police officers, how far are you?

611
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:13,220
 This is Signal 1. We'll be arriving soon. 

612
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,110
You want me to come out, don't you?

613
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,620
   

614
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:17,850
Detective Jo, there's a blackout all of a sudden.

615
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,610
What's going on?

616
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,410
Detective Jo.

617
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:43,140
I heard a strong gust of wind coming from that window.

618
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:08,380
This is Dispatch 4.

619
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,360
That scumbag Dong Bang Min jumped out of a window.

620
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,040
 He's trying to escape using the alley behind the hospital. 

621
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:21,900
I'll go this way, you should look for him over there.

622
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,660
Okay.

623
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,590
Detective Chad!  Detective Chad wake up!

624
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,500
Detective Chad!

625
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,800
This is Dispatch 4.

626
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,570
Director Kang, we are at an underpass that's over the alley behind the psychiatric hospital.

627
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,640
Detective Chad has collapsedâ€”

628
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,900
Detective Shim! Detective Shim!

629
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,230
This is Director Kang. We're heading to the back alley of the psychiatric hospital right now.

630
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,540
Detective Chad and Detective Shim seem to be in some sort of trouble.

631
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:23,120
Call the rescue team and ask the backup team to go to the alley behind the hospital.

632
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,730
   

633
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:34,360
Director Kang, I looked into Dong Bang Min

634
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:38,000
and I found out he was admitted to F Children's Nursing Hospital at the age of 12.

635
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,230
But the strange thing is, there's no information on that hospital at all.

636
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:45,660
All I found was the hospital shut down after it was discovered that it was operating illegally. 
    

637
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,950
I think even the doctor had a fake license.

638
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,980
 F Children's Nursing Hospital? 

639
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,240
 Why does it sound so familiar? 

640
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:12,150
I heard you went undercover to catch me.

641
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:16,230
Why risk your life for something so useless?

642
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:21,260
Were you that bored?

643
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,370
You're quite talkative today.

644
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,440
Give up.

645
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,000
You will never be able to get off this island!

646
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:59,250
Why do you think humans smell different when they are scared?

647
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:02,900
Now. Beg for your life.

648
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,990
You never know, I might let you live.

649
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:13,100
Cut the nonsense, you bastard!

650
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:17,830
I'm not going to plead for my life in front of jerks like you ever again!

651
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:22,180
I... I don't care how you were born.

652
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:25,560
But if you're going to do such things using that as an excuse,

653
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:31,400
then you're just a f*cking bastard who can never receive any salvation.

654
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,900
Don't f*cking curse at me.

655
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:42,720
Now. Beg for your life.

656
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,340
You never know.

657
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:49,300
You have something stuffed in your ears, you jerk!

658
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,520
I told you!

659
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,680
I'm not going to plead for my life in front of jerks like you ever again!

660
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,300
Are you thrilled?

661
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,790
Does this excite you?

662
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:32,180
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

663
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:36,570
After all, Dong Bang Heon Yup's blood runs through your veins.

664
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,600
Looks like you thought your teammates would come to save you if you stalled for some time.

665
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,540
 But you guys can never catch me. 

666
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:48,460
I am a different being from you all.

667
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,730
Detective Shim!

668
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:58,450
 Kwon Joo, you have such pretty ears. 

669
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:02,130
 Isn't that why you can hear sounds that other people can't? 

670
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:08,630
 If I asked for those ears of yours, would you give them to me? 

671
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:36,340
    

672
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:48,630


673
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:55,710
   

674
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,330
 We have a Code Zero case. 
    

675
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:59,770
 The suspect Dong Bang Min has escaped from the Vimo Psychiatric Hospital. 

676
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:02,260
 I'm putting an APB on him.  

677
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,220
 You dare take one step forward! 

678
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,650
 Let's protect this island! 

679
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:06,780
 You think the Circus Pierrot game belongs to Fabre? 

680
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:07,790
 Yes, exactly. 

681
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:08,820
 Isn't this Director Kang? 

682
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:11,510
 This is accurate information about my ears.  
   

683
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:14,620
 What's the point of having those ears when they only cause you pain? 

684
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:17,990
 Kang Kwon Joo, you can put it down now. 

685
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:23,760
 I'll give you a blessing and all you need to do is accept it.
