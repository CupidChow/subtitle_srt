1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560


2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,630
   

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,480
   

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,140
   

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,420
   

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,450
   

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,380
    
      

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,020
   

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,930
    

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,950
Stay calm and I'll call you back.

11
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,490
Cap! Cap, Gong Su Ji has gone missing.

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,580
- What? 
 - Well, Nick says it happened when he was in the bathroom.

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,170
Let's move to the hospital. Secure the CCTV.

14
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,240
I'll call you back later.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:11,250
♫  My baby, sleep tight  ♫

16
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,770
♫  My baby, go to sleep  ♫

17
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:25,720
♫  My baby, go to sleep  ♫

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,520
Gong Su Ji!

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,590
   

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,780
I'm on my way. Report everything right away!

21
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:03,250
   

22
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,730
   

23
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,860
-  Mr. Kim, 44 years old...  
   - A hit-and-run murder has occurred...  
    

24
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,810
- The 77-year-old adoptive father... 
    

25
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,890
    
    

26
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,820
  He constantly sexually assaulted his elementary school daughter.  
    

27
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,820
    
      
 (T/N: A Hanyeo is a female diver) 

28
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,430
   

29
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,290
   

30
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,020
You still haven't found her? 
    

31
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,550
 No, sir. I checked all the rooms on the fifth floor but I couldn't find her. 

32
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,660
   

33
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,380
   

34
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,380
Captain, we got her.

35
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,580
I found her patient ID in front of the elevator.

36
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,000
 She's getting away by car! 

37
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,230
Please stop! I'm Nicholas Jackson of LAPD.

38
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,360
We need your cooperation for the investigation on the incident in Sanggae-dong.

39
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,030
Miss Gong, open the door now!

40
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,790
Open the door!

41
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,730
No, stop the car. Miss Gong!

42
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,290
If you do not comply, I will fire.

43
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,420
Get out of the car!

44
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,590
Get out of the car!

45
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,630
Gong Su Ji, you are a suspect in the murder of Lisa Jo.

46
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,230
- You will be arrested if you— 
 - Stop! Ah...

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,790
- Get up! 
 - I can't. 
 - Come on, get up!

48
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,090
I think I tore my stitches!

49
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,050
   

50
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,590
 Director Kang. 

51
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,380
Team Leader Do?

52
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,430
- Are you all right? 
 - What? Oh, yes.

53
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,700
Detective Gu, you should go ahead.

54
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,420
Yes.

55
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,840
Cap?

56
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,960
 Kang Kwon Joo. Get a hold of yourself. 

57
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,400
 Team Leader Do is dead. 

58
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,190
 No one can keep us apart. 

59
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,560
 We are family. 

60
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,860
 Born from the same body. 

61
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,290
- Yes, Detective Gu? 
  - Director Kang, are you still downstairs? 

62
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,130
There was something I needed to look into here. I'll head up right away.

63
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,550
Why did you run away?

64
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,390
Well, do you have a warrant? I'm not talking unless you have one.

65
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,530
I'll ask you again.

66
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,920
What were you doing three hours before arriving at the Gimpo airport, on March 25th?

67
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,260
I don't know anything about that. I told you I'm not telling you anything unless you have a warrant.

68
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,290
Gong Su Ji!

69
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,100
Do you think we're joking around here?

70
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,820
If you continue to not cooperate with our investigation then you may get arrested on suspicion of murder.

71
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,190
What are you saying?

72
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,040
Are you okay, Miss?

73
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,730
No, well, don't you know what give and take is?

74
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:47,670
I need to be getting something out of this as well and then I'll talk...

75
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,590
Well, something like immunity from punishment.

76
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,660
Fine.

77
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,560
If you're not the person I'm looking for then you won't be punished.

78
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,600
So don't waste any more of my time and tell me everything, honestly. Got it?

79
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:18,160
I was at the club for a birthday party and took a few pills.

80
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,830
Pills that I brought from the States.

81
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,430
I mean, students get some serious academic stress these days!

82
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,230
You know... It's not illegal in America.

83
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,720
There are tons of essays for my final!

84
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,260
If my dad got to know I had some pills, he'll definitely kill me!

85
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,460
Would I have left after causing this mess if it wasn't going to turn out so bad for me?

86
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,060
It may be legal in America but here in Korea, it's illegal.

87
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,260
Whatever!

88
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,840
Anyhow since I told you something, all of you have to keep your promise.

89
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,160
I have no relation whatsoever with that murder case. Okay?

90
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,390
Hold on, please.

91
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,030
Look here.

92
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,130
Look at the date and the time stamp on this post.

93
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,190
    

94
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,360
What are you doing?

95
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,600
Gosh, why are you doing this?

96
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,500
She's not it.

97
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,890
She's not the suspect.

98
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,540
Gong Su Ji,  give me a call if there's something you remember later on.

99
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,700
   

100
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,270
And I'll tell them that you cooperated with the police investigation.

101
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,130
But you should get investigated for bringing in pills.

102
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,460
That would be what's best for your future.

103
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,840
No, wait! Stop, wait a second!

104
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,500
Hey, you can't do this!

105
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,990
You said you wouldn't tell anybody!

106
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,100
You can't move around right now—

107
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,930
Don't you dare tell my dad about any of this.

108
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,090
Of course not.

109
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,820
Is everything alright, Cap?

110
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,780
As of today, all passengers on that plane will be put back as suspects.

111
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,580
Yes, Cap!

112
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,990
And also, it looks you have a panic disorder. Get treated before it's too late.

113
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,670
I'll take care of myself.

114
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,040
I'm not saying this because I'm worried about you.

115
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,610
It's because I need you to be able to catch criminals.

116
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,610
Take care of yourself.

117
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,160
Director.

118
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,200
You can always tell me when things get hard.

119
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,610
Then I'll be able to help...

120
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,070
I'm all right.

121
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,450
They say that Gong Su Ji fled because she was afraid of being caught for taking "speed."  (Speed=methamphetamines) 

122
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,570
But Circus Man was the prime suspect.

123
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,360
Then, who is the suspect?

124
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,970
That's what I'm saying.

125
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,860
It feels like we're chasing after a ghost.

126
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,330
Did your wife prepare those again?

127
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,070
I'm the one who brought these!

128
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:39,090
My wife is so upset that I've been dispatched to Vimo Island that she doesn't even talk to me.

129
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,270
But... Director Kang earlier on...

130
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,390
Don't mind me. Never mind.

131
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,290
This rascal. Why did you stop talking? We're friends.

132
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,750
Abuse?

133
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,400
Among my colleagues, I know someone who works at the embassy in the U.S.

134
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,960
There are rumors that Detective Jo was abused by his father who was a commissioner.

135
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,780
The rumors about his younger sister are even worse.

136
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,070
He also quit his medical career because of his adoptive father.

137
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,100
Also, this.

138
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,410
This is the child abuse lawsuit that was filed after they left that household.

139
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,270
As they lost the case, they threw away the last name of Scott

140
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,980
and they changed their last name back to Jo and lived together.

141
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,360
They were the only family of each other.

142
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,290
And now that his younger sister has died,

143
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:43,300
it's really impressive how Detective Jo is able to be mentally well.

144
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,390
Ah right! Team Leader Park said

145
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,690
he will need a dispatch officer who knows the area well.

146
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:59,000
Did you know what Sergeant Shim lives on Vimo Island?

147
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,750
Detective Shim?

148
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,040
After his successful rehabilitation, he was assigned to

149
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,170
the Public Safety Department, but he took a leave of absence.

150
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,460
He's now a scuba teacher at Umiri Beach on Vimo Island.

151
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:15,290
So, he knows the area well and has experience in the Golden Time Team.

152
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,520
What do you think about him?

153
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,780
Let's meet with him tomorrow.

154
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,280
 Nobody can separate us. 

155
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,220
 We are  family. 

156
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,780
 Born from the same body. 

157
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,570
 That voice earlier was strangely clear. 

158
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,990
 As if, I was in the forest with her. 

159
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,360
   

160
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
   

161
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,500
   

162
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,620
   

163
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,070
   

164
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,550
   

165
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,900
 The suspect purposely approached Lee Hyun Min, who had family problems, just like the case of Moon Ah Ram and Joo Beom Tae. 

166
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,120
 While Lee Hyun Min was threatening his family with a hatchet, 

167
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,340
 she came in quietly and killed the entire family. 

168
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,400
 Similarly to the previous two cases, she was thinking of making it into a parricide. 

169
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,830
 But then, Seung Ah appeared suddenly. 

170
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,010
 She hid in the closet and saw that bastard's tattoo. 

171
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,920
   

172
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,060
   

173
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,480
 The suspect returned to Unit 205 and found Seung Ah. 

174
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,870
 After she received horrible physical abuse, she was dragged to the emergency staircase. 

175
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:35,000
 She headed to a remote junk shop in the village 

176
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,560
 and murdered Seung Ah. 

177
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,240
 She was taking her time slowly, 

178
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,290
 as if she was giving punishment. 

179
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,500
 Seung Ah died of extreme overkill. 

180
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,400
 The majority of the abuse signs happened when she was alive. 

181
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,400
 These... are your sister's belongings, 

182
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,900
 although it's against the rules. 

183
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,990
 To whom I love, my dear brother, 

184
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,820
 You're surprised that I wrote this letter, right? 

185
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:31,620
 But... I feel like I have to confess as to why I was so keen on following you 

186
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,950
 on your dispatch overseas. 

187
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,030
 You told me that 

188
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,010
 we were not abandoned 

189
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,720
 but that we had no choice to be separated. 

190
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,000
 When I was younger, those words were comforting. 

191
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,190
 And when I grew up, this thought came to me. 

192
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,620
 If that is true, then our dad would also be looking for us. 

193
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,150
 He would be very sad as well. 

194
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,200
 To be honest, I wanted to find Dad. 

195
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,020
 So, I called the adoption center in Korea. 

196
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,320
 I'm sorry I couldn't tell you. 

197
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,630
 A few days ago, a paper came. 

198
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:15,230
 It says that there is someone who has similar DNA to me. 

199
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,660
 And I'm going to meet that person. 

200
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,160
 My heart is beating so fast! 

201
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,560
 They say that a tree whose roots are deep doesn't budge much when the wind blows. 

202
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,190
 You had a hard time since you were blocking the wind for me too, all by yourself, right? 

203
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,250
 Now, I want to help you find your roots. 

204
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,470
 Dad will be proud of you when you meet him, 

205
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,590
 since we grew up well this whole time. 

206
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:49,290
 From your sister who loves and adores you the most, Lisa." 

207
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,200
 Seung Ah, just wait a bit more. 

208
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,390
 The pain that you received, I will return it to that bastard a thousand times more. 

209
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,460
   

210
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,330
 Honestly, I was surprised 

211
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:22,530
that Head Commissioner sent the Golden Time Team to the Vimo Police Agency.

212
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,180
I should've informed you earlier.

213
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,630
The Seoul Police Agency is already tracking down another suspect.

214
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,920
And if things go wrong, Head Commissioner could get blamed.

215
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,830
That's why I thought it was strange that you applied to be dispatched elsewhere.

216
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,400
I heard that Derek Jo joined the Golden Time Team.

217
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,400
We absolutely need his cooperation on this case.

218
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,860
He doesn't look easy to control.

219
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,660
As of now, he is also the sole witness who has seen the suspect.

220
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,590
The Golden Time Team will investigate with the Vimo Police Agency without disrupting their usual work.

221
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,890
All right. I'll inform the Situation Manager. What else do you need?

222
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,950
We also need permission to be able to arrest without a warrant, do house searches, and look at autopsy reports.

223
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,980
I'll do my best.

224
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,380
But under one condition, don't rush too much.

225
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,350
Don't forget that this island has its own unique culture.

226
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,320
I'll keep that in mind.

227
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,390
Here! How is it?

228
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,650
It was on short notice, so this is what we have.

229
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,130
Well, it's nice that it's clean and spacious!

230
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,440
What is that over there? It doesn't look like a memorial table.

231
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,270
You know amulets, right?

232
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,190
This is the reason that I'm still alive at this age doing this job.

233
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:58,030
Oh right!  How are the American detectives?

234
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,050
They normally have a strong authority, so it must've bothered you.

235
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,280
We were dispatched together... and well, we understand each other, so don't worry.

236
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,660
Really? Well, work hard...

237
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,850
and if you need anything, tell me right away.

238
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,320
- I understand. 
 - Okay.

239
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,310
Work hard.

240
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,590
Thank you for taking us in!

241
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:22,590
Starting today, we will be in charge of the emergency calls coming into the Vimo Police Agency for a 6-month pilot project.

242
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:28,220
You all know that we are a team that saves lives within the "golden time."

243
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,050
The officers can reach the Soon, Tamseo, and Dosang neighborhoods, etc., within 3 minutes.

244
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,490
There's a total of 10 areas we can dispatch officers to in urgent cases.

245
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,490
Let's do our best starting now.

246
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,220
Understood!

247
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,750
Please continue your work.

248
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,930
Eun Soo, I'm going to go meet Detective Shim Dae Sik. Please take charge of the center.

249
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,660
Yes. Have a nice trip.

250
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,860
Cen—

251
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,560
Agent Park, do you have time? I have something to ask you.

252
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,200
Yes, what is it?

253
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,300
I have a friend who wants to transfer to the Golden Time Team.

254
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,460
He's from the Safety Department at the Tamseo police station and he has great cyber investigative skills.

255
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,620
He is outside right now. Could you please take a look at his application?

256
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,390
Sure.

257
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,180
Attention.

258
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,260
You are Golden Time Command Team Leader, Park Eun Soo, right?

259
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,920
I am Officer Han Woo Joo from the Tamseo Police Safety Department.

260
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,720
I came because I would really like to join the Golden Time Team.

261
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,020
   

262
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,670
- Is this your application? 
 - Yes.

263
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,620
I will relay this.

264
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,390
Please give me an opportunity to appeal. I run the Golden Time Team's Fan Cafe.

265
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,440
I would like to do awesome things that are worthwhile, like the Golden Time Team.

266
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,280
Are you a policeman for fun?

267
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,590
Yes. I do look at safety and pay, but fun is the most important when it comes to my job.

268
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:18,370
For real, even if you give me constant back-to-back shifts, I will work my hardest if you put me on the Golden Time Team.

269
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,270
Oh, right! Did you find anything else on the Sanggae neighborhood Lisa Jo incident?

270
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,550
Seeing as her older brother, who is an American dispatch officer, got added to the team, there must be something. 
      

271
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:31,420
It was a hot issue on our internal network. Look at this.

272
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,760
Even on social media.

273
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,140
The Korean killer murdered the little sister of an American police officer. Wow!

274
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,120
Your curiosity is crossing the line.

275
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,730
Wait!

276
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,050
Please listen to one more thing.

277
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:51,710
Yesterday, I checked the high school victim Lee Hyun Min's Insnap. Look at this.

278
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,830
He filmed the unboxing of a Pierrot Smile badge.

279
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,310
It's a limited item for max-level users in the game Circus Pierrot.

280
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:05,750
I think that this case is either Lee Hyun Min's acting or done by his fellow gaming friends.

281
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,050
When you look at the kids that play this game, none of them are normal.

282
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,540
Well, if not, too bad. I will be waiting for your call.

283
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,580
Did I act too haughty?

284
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,380
I should really stop being so immersed in emotion.

285
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,470
   

286
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,650
   

287
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,410
Senior, I have something to ask.

288
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:06,990
Do you remember Joo Beom Tae from the Weoldok Village case? Is there any chance...

289
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,490
   

290
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,850
Long time no see,

291
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,590
Director Kang.

292
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,900
It's late, but congratulations on your healthy return.

293
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,900
What would you like to talk about?

294
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,770
I'll be straightforward.

295
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,960
I need your help.

296
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,800
Please return to the Golden Time Team.

297
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,750
Is Korea lacking detectives?

298
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,460
So much so that you came to look for a corrupt detective like me?

299
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,090
You still have regrets, don't you? Isn't that why you submitted a leave of absence instead of resigning?

300
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,910
To be honest, there is a serial killer here who has special hearing, like me,

301
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:20,470
and she's already killed three families.

302
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,740
I need someone who knows a lot about this island.

303
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,100
I think you came here in vain.

304
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,850
I can't be of any help to the Golden Time Team.

305
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,850
Well, I have a lesson to teach.

306
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,160
Director.

307
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,300
Do you know what the best thing is about going into the ocean?

308
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,290
You can't hear anything.

309
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,310
Today, you will learn how to attach an oxygen tank and a buoyancy compensator

310
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,780
to a diving regulator. Then,

311
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:22,040
you will try diving in a safe zone with your equipment on.

312
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,810
Yeah, Agent Park. What's up?

313
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:27,580
Director, Lee Hyun Min and Joo Beom Tae played the same game,

314
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,460
and the name of that game is Circus Pierrot.

315
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,910
Isn't that a weird overlap to call a coincidence?

316
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:39,210
- I'll head over there right away. 
  - Turn this to secure it. 

317
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,780
- Go ahead and try. 
 - Okay.

318
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,200
   

319
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:59,390
  You still have regrets, don't you? Isn't that why you submitted a leave of absence instead of resigning?  

320
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,070
  Do you know what completes a human?  

321
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,650
 Pain. 

322
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,310
Instructor, are you okay?

323
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,740
Do that process one more time.

324
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,710
  Hey, Instructor Shim!  

325
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,590
- Did Instructor Chae ever tell you that they would be out today? 
 - No.

326
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,290
What are they doing, not answering the phone?

327
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:41,640
We have a bunch of lesson appointments on our schedule.

328
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,570
The LAPD recovered Lee Hyun Min's deleted phone account

329
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,450
and they found evidence that he communicated with someone through Telenote.

330
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,890
It's impossible to recover everything,

331
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,950
but it is evidence that he secretly communicated with someone quite regularly.

332
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:00,880
So the Circus Man might have approached Lee Hyun Min through Telenote.

333
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,330
It was probably the same for the other victims, too.

334
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,790
Currently, all suspects have been cleared of all allegations, so we must start again from the beginning.

335
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,660
Director Kang should take charge of the Korean side and we will start with Telenote.

336
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,280
We can share information as we find it.

337
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,580
We'll start right away.

338
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,330
Right. There was a cyber agent that applied for our team.

339
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,100
He said that Lee Hyun Min was a gore game user in a game called "Circus Pierrot."

340
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,720
When I checked, Yangyeong's Joo Beom Tae also played that game.

341
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,410
It's the same game?

342
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,900
Where is that cyber agent?

343
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,940
Hello. I am Han Woo Joo.

344
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,940
It is an honor to meet you, Center Director, Kang Kwon Joo.

345
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,210
Thank you for coming. Follow me.

346
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,770
Yes.

347
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,320
It is a game on the dark web and it is a popular game for teen enthusiasts.

348
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,170
It is famous for being an immoral game.

349
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,860
You can only get to a higher level if you earn points in the easy level,

350
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,180
and then the main event is when the user becomes Pierrot

351
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:21,250
and kills a friend, homeroom teacher, or a family member.

352
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,850
You can only become a hard level player once you clear the 5 easy levels,

353
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,610
but the weapons and killing methods are at the psychopath level.

354
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,300
If your target starts as a random stranger in the easy level,

355
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,930
they become closer to the player at the hard level, such as a classmate or family.

356
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,470
On the hard level, the weapons are on a level of their own.

357
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,560
Motor drill, chain saw, ax.

358
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,750
They even have a diver's gathering tool.

359
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,590
The gathering tool is like a scythe that divers use when gathering seafood.

360
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:57,220
And this is a badge of honor that is awarded to players in the top 1%.

361
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,530
This sticker was also on Lee Hyun Min's desk.

362
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,440
   

363
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,270
What's even creepier is that the rankers have a sense of affiliation with each other.

364
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,000
Good work.

365
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,900
If Moon Ah Reum played this game,

366
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,160
there might be a clue within this game.

367
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,630
Can you look into this a little more?

368
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,070
Don't worry! I will work my hardest!

369
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,700
   

370
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,010
This is 112.

371
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:43,520
Please help us! Please save us!

372
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,900
Please calm down.

373
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,760
Excuse me?

374
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,190
I just got a call from Diver Kam Soon from the Woomi Village Beach.

375
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:00,360
She said a senior diver is wielding a weapon against the fishing village chief.

376
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,270
Transfer the call.

377
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,730
Hello. I am Center Director, Kang Kwon Joo.

378
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,990
You said a diver is waving a weapon?

379
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,460
Yes, that's right.

380
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,150
Granny Soon Rye is trying to kill Go Soo Dong with a diver's gathering tool.

381
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,270
 Come quickly or someone's going to die! 

382
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:20,190
I saw my Ga Eun drown in that sea.

383
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,300
Didn't you kill my Ga Eun in that cast iron cauldron

384
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,550
to cover up your wrongdoings?

385
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,810
You crazy granny!

386
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,930
Come here!

387
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,400
Come quickly!

388
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,860
Could you please describe the situation a little more?

389
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,080
Ga Eun is Granny Soon Rye's granddaughter.

390
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,060
She is saying that Go Soo Dong killed Ga Eun and put her in a cauldron.

391
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:45,280
Are you saying a dead body was found in a cast iron pot in the sea?

392
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,790
 Yes, yes. 

393
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:51,230
Agent Park, look into Woomi fishing village's chief, Go Soo Dong, and female diver, Grandmother Go Soon Rye.

394
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,990
Oh, and also find out her granddaughter's, Go Ga Eun, phone number.

395
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,500
I understand.

396
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,750
     

397
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,380
    

398
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,320
   

399
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,760
Director, I found it.

400
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,940
Attacker Go Soon Rye, age 74, is living with her 20-year-old granddaughter, Go Ga Eun,

401
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,480
after the death of her daughter.

402
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,220
Both women are currently registered divers.

403
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,610
And victim Go Soo Dong, age 58, is a relative of Go Soon Rye.

404
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,750
I will try calling Go Ga Eun's registered phone number.

405
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,560
   

406
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,520
 The number you have dialed is switched off. Leave a message after the beep. 

407
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,980
Her phone is turned off.

408
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,090
Try looking for its location.

409
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,400
   

410
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,770
   

411
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,640
Director, Go Ga Eun's phone was turned off at Woomi Village beach today in the early morning.

412
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,260
Code Zero! 
     

413
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:46,590
We have received notice that diver Go Soon Rye is attacking Village Chief, Go Soo Dong with a gathering tool. 
    

414
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,020
Location Woomi Town Woomi Beach Road, nearby 317.

415
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,680
According to the caller, just now, a corpse, which is presumed to be Go Soon Rae's granddaughter, Go Ga Eun,

416
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,610
was found in a cast-iron cauldron in the Woomi Village Sea,

417
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,860
 and Go Soo Dong is presumed to be the perpetrator. 

418
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,330
The Woomi Police Office and any police in the area are dispatched to the seaside.

419
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,370
- Team Leader. 
 - Detective Jo.

420
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,350
Let's go.

421
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,160
Quickly.

422
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,200
The police have been dispatched and will arrive shortly.

423
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,870
Can you continue what you were saying?

424
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,880
Today was a little hectic

425
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,220
because Go Soo Dong sold our seaside area to someone.

426
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,410
 - Our chief has amazing business skills. 
      

427
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,060
 If we set up a resort here, 

428
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,350
 we'll be rich in no time. 

429
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,660
 What are you guys doing? 

430
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,200
 Building a resort in front of our sea? 

431
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,710
 Isn't it enough that you already sold our land to those stupid divers? 

432
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,770
 Oh and Ga Eun, 

433
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,730
 she's having drinking parties with those diver guys on that side of the sea. 

434
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,960
 You should crackdown on her more! 

435
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,910
 Crackdown? 

436
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,620
 Don't you dare touch my Ga Eun. 

437
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,220
 Do you think I'll sit still? 

438
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,590
 Oh, this granny. 

439
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,760
 You old granny— 

440
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,670
 You thug. 

441
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,740
 Oh, dear. 

442
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,520
 Anyway, Ga Eun, that girl, 

443
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,640
 is she still hanging out with those divers? 

444
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:16,430
 Do you think she told them about the secret place where the abalone grow? 

445
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,960
 Don't worry. She's not that type of kid. 

446
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,430
 Let's go in. 

447
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,160
 Isn't this human hair? 

448
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,810
 Don't do this, Go Soo Dong. 

449
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,590
 What do you mean? 

450
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,680
 There's a big problem. 

451
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,410
 There's a person inside a cast-iron cauldron in the sea. 

452
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,700
 This was there! 

453
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,920
 This! Ga Eun never takes this off! 

454
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,250
 This... This... 

455
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,200
 Why is this... 

456
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,700
 Granny! 

457
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,710
 Ga Eun! Ga Eun! 

458
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,690
 Ga Eun! 

459
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,960
 Ga Eun... 

460
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,610
Actually, a couple of days ago,

461
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:22,590
Go Soo Dong was drunk and raging that he would kill Ga Eun.

462
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:26,980
Ga Eun said that Go Soo Dong was growing opium poppies.

463
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,450
Is that why he killed her?

464
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:36,090
In our village, there's a superstition that you won't get caught if you kill someone and put them in a cast-iron pot in the sea!

465
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,790
Where did you find this cast iron cauldron?

466
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:44,160
If you go straight out from Woomi Village Beach, there's a turtle rock reef.

467
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,250
It was right under there.

468
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,020
Team Leader Cheon, please request the Coast Guard to investigate.

469
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,810
Agent Park, check if Go Soo Dong has any past history of embezzlement.

470
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,760
Yes, I got it.

471
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,280
This is 112 Call Center Inspector, Cheon Sang Pil.

472
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,750
We got a call that a dead body was found

473
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,740
in a cast iron pot under the turtle rock at Woomi Village Beach. We are requesting an investigation.

474
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,630
The victim is presumed to be 20-year-old Go Ga Eun.

475
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,890
Yes, all right.

476
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:12,590
Director, there is a patrol boat nearby and they say they will arrive in 5 minutes.

477
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:18,200
Is there anything else you can tell me about Go Ga Eun?

478
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,300
Go Ga Eun is Granny's only granddaughter.

479
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,980
Her mom died early, so Granny raised her with all she had.

480
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,000
 Getting too greedy... 

481
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,490
 will cost you your life! 

482
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,910
 A haenyeo (female diver) should work only for as long as she can hold her breath. How many times have I told you already? 

483
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,680
 There were so many abalone right in front of me and I wasn't supposed to touch them? 

484
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,780
 This is why you've been poor all your life. 

485
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,230
 I don't want to live like that. Got it? 

486
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,650
 Ga Eun, you should listen to your grandmother. 

487
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,980
 There have been many divers who ran into trouble because they got greedy. 

488
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,240
 In any case, if anything does happen to you, 

489
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,350
 make sure you drink the spring water in the Haeshim Village. 

490
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,920
 You know the Haeshim Granny is our divers' guardian angel, right? 

491
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,540
 Because of the hole that she made in the cave, 

492
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,050
 the seawater went into it and a natural spring opened up.  

493
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,960
 If you drink that water, you won't be out of breath anymore. 

494
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,850
 Grandma, I'm not like you. 

495
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:34,890
But the thing is, Ga Eun wanted to go to Seoul really badly, recently.

496
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,200
 Cheers! 

497
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,680
 What? 

498
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,640
 You're drunk! 

499
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,830
 Oh my god! Why are you doing this? 

500
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,170
 You didn't even come along to dive today. What are you doing here? 

501
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,610
 What's the problem? I want to have fun! 

502
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,490
 Why? Can't I have fun? 

503
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:00,600
 What money did you buy this with? 

504
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:06,880
 Did you blackmail Go Soo Dong for this money? 

505
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,660
 Grandma! Don't worry anymore, okay? 

506
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:15,360
 In return for not reporting the poppy field video, Uncle Soo Dong said 

507
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,690
  he'll send me to Seoul. 

508
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,580
 You immature one. 

509
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,900
 What are you going to do if Go Soo Dong harasses you because of this? 

510
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,560
 I'm telling you, it's okay! 

511
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,550
 I'll go to Seoul and bring back a lot of money. You'll live in luxury! 

512
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:34,100
 You learned to dive as soon as you walked. Why do you want to leave now? 

513
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,270
 -We should protect our traditions! 
 - Gosh, you're back at it! 

514
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,200
 Every time you do that, I feel suffocated! 

515
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,870
 Ga Eun! Ga Eun! 

516
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,760
 Ga— 

517
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:52,800
She lost the granddaughter she had raised since she was young. How can she be in her right mind now?

518
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,220
Director Kang, there have been a lot of conflicts recently between the female divers and the chief of the fishing village,

519
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,730
especially when Go Ga Eun reported Go Soo Dong for taking bribes.

520
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:04,110
She even had a video of the poppy field he had been growing in secret.

521
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,870
But she didn't submit the video so we don't know if it's true or not.

522
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:11,350
T-They're both going toward the rocks! My gosh.

523
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,320
This is Center. Response team, have you reached there yet?

524
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,520
 This is Dispatch 1. We're almost at Woomi Beach now. 

525
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,160
Why in the world is this granny doing this to me?

526
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,320
Let's die together. If Ga Eun is dead, I have no reason to live anymore!

527
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,650
She's using her sickle tool to fight!

528
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,430
At this rate, one of them is actually going to end up dead!

529
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:37,430
You need to hurry up and stop her!

530
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,170
She stabbed him in the back with her sickle!

531
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,470
Go Soo Dong, you jerk. You should die.

532
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,510
Die!

533
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,350
Stop!

534
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,480
Stop!

535
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:57,560
Soon Rye, please stop!

536
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,810
This is Dispatch 2.

537
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:03,170
Director Kang, we are at the rocks where Go Soon Rye is attacking Go Soo Dong.

538
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,520
Team Leader Park,  Detective Gu, and Detective Jo, please make sure you save them.

539
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,230
Grandma, I'm also a father with a daughter.

540
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,390
It's not that I don't understand you,

541
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,570
but please calm down.

542
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,100
Distract her by gaining her trust.

543
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,560
I'll go to the rear.

544
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,400
Grandma, did you really see Ga Eun in the ocean?

545
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,470
You could have seen it mistakenly.

546
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,620
That's not possible?

547
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,690
What grandma wouldn't be able to recognize their grandchild?

548
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,870
She always kept her mother's keepsake with her!

549
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:40,270
This granny has lost her mind due to the Diver's Disease!

550
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,450
Watch that damn mouth of yours!

551
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:43,930
Granny! Granny!

552
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:48,230
If you go to prison then who will hold Ga Eun's funeral?

553
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:54,470
We are going to help you so please put that down.

554
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,030
Why would this crazy granny make a sane choice right now?

555
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,340
Just shoot her!

556
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,780
You don't need to say anything right now!

557
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,460
Granny, you should calm down! Please.

558
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,140
- Put that down. Okay? 
 - Don't come over here!

559
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,970
Please calm down.

560
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,190
I'm going to kill this brute!

561
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,410
Stabbing him won't help you feel any better!

562
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,510
Leave it to the law to punish him.

563
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:23,090
I'll make sure this murderer rots in jail for the rest of his life,

564
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,440
so please trust me. Okay?

565
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,330
Give that here. Give it to me.

566
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,950
Don't lie to me!

567
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,810
Die!

568
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,530
Let go of me!

569
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:41,820
Go Soon Rye, you are under arrest for attempted murder.

570
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,310
You have the right to an attorney. You have the right to remain silent.

571
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:50,230
- My goodness, what are you going to do now? 
 - Ga Eun!

572
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,200
My baby.

573
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,960
Detectives, you should put her in a mental hospital right away!

574
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,950
Make sure she can never get out.

575
00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:00,480
Look here. It seems like you think you're clear of any charges.

576
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,880
But you will be investigated as the main suspect in this murder case.

577
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,090
What are you talking about? I'm a victim, too!

578
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:09,170
Take him, too.

579
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,810
- Get up. 
 - Oh my, oh my!

580
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,770
Let go of me.

581
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,780
This is Dispatch 2. Go Soon Rye has been arrested. Woomi Village Assault Case closed.

582
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,740
   

583
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,640
Ga Eun!

584
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,730
Ga Eun!

585
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,570
Team Leader Cheon. What about the Coast Guard?

586
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:46,530
I got a call a while ago. They're trying to recover the body.

587
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,880
I'll put you through to the Coast Guard.

588
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,820
This is Coast Guard 1. This is Coast Guard 1.

589
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,550
We have found the corpse of a young woman in an iron cauldron.

590
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:01,090
Due to the amount of decomposition the corpse cannot be identified as of now.

591
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:05,600
There is a stab wound on the body. It's a shape I have never seen before.

592
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,550
 This is Center. They have recovered a woman's body from an iron cauldron. 

593
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:13,180
 The face cannot be identified due to the high amount of decomposition  

594
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,820
And a stab wound was found on the body. They're saying it's a shape they haven't seen before.

595
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,550
Ga Eun? Is it my Ga Eun?

596
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,110
It's my poor Ga Eun!

597
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,400
Ga Eun!

598
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,410
My baby, Ga Eun!

599
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,820
Ga Eun!

600
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,920
Ga Eun!

601
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,660
My baby.

602
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,990
Calm down.

603
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:44,070
We can go and take a look.

604
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,990
Ga Eun!

605
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:06,580
Ga Eun!

606
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,290
What's this?  Why are police here?

607
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,610
 Ga Eun! 

608
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,880
Hey, it looks like a person is dead.

609
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,630
Let's go and see.

610
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:16,060
 My god! My god! 

611
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,270
Ga Eun!

612
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:22,380
Ga Eun!

613
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,860
 What shall we do? 

614
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,160
Ga Eun.

615
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,660
She is...

616
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,260
not my Ga Eun.

617
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:50,080
My Ga Eun is not as tall as she is.

618
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,820
What did you say?

619
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:57,230
Elder, please calm down and look carefully again.

620
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:01,110
Is she really not her?

621
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,870
It's true!  She is not.

622
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:06,000
She is absolutely not.

623
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,160
My Ga Eun doesn't have this kind of stuff on her hand.

624
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,110
It's true!  She is not Ga Eun.

625
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,090
 Oh my god, Elder! 

626
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:18,010
Gam Soon!

627
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,430
Is my Ga Eun

628
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,590
still alive?

629
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,240
Is she alive?

630
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,310
Oh my god! Oh my god!

631
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,960
That dolphin tattoo... Isn't it Instructor Chae's?

632
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,750
No way. Her tattoo doesn't look like that, does it?

633
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,070
That's her. Wait a minute.

634
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:41,890
You shouldn't go in.

635
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,380
I'll just confirm her quickly.

636
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,880
- You can't go in! 
 - Just let me!

637
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,730
Hold on!

638
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,780
Dae Sik!

639
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:54,560
What brings you here?

640
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,730
Hyungnim, she looks like the scuba diver instructor who works with me.

641
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,970
-  What? 
 - I'm just going in to check.

642
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,890
It's okay.

643
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,100
That's her.

644
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:18,570
She has the same tattoo on her hand, too.

645
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,920
Are you sure?

646
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,670
It's a scar from a trench spike knife.

647
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:39,060
That's a very vicious weapon that leaves a triangular wound that's hard to be sutured.

648
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:45,510
And these injection marks... These are the typical marks of drug addicts.

649
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,480
Weapon and drugs?

650
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:53,940
We need to transport her to the National Forensic Service now, so we're going to wrap her up.

651
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,230
Hold on, please.

652
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:59,660
Since there is circumstantial evidence on the corpse indicating that she did drugs,

653
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,140
- please make sure to check that out. 
 - Yes.

654
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:03,630
Come finish up.

655
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:07,440
And take the grandmother with you.

656
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,920
Let me go.

657
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,270
Let me go.

658
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:23,230
My goodness, Police Officer!

659
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:26,040
Please find my Ga Eun.

660
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,390
If the dead is the diver instructor,

661
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:33,350
something must've happened to my Ga Eun!

662
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,560
The two of them were close.

663
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,720
Let's go.

664
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,570
Ga Eun! Ga Eun!

665
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,110
Even if she is at the police station, she won't stay still.

666
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,280
In this situation, she doesn't know if her family member is alive or dead.

667
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,570
 Ga Eun! 

668
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,380
 My Ga Eun! 

669
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,580
Let me go!

670
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,790
Hold on!

671
00:51:55,790 --> 00:52:00,280
Something may happen for us to have to confirm with her, so we'll let her wait here.

672
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,440
Sir, thank you!

673
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,740
Thank you.

674
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,650
Dae Sik, what did you say the diver instructor's name was?

675
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,770
Chae So Yoon.

676
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:14,800
Dispatch Team 1, here. Director, please identify Chae So Yoon to see if the corpse is her.

677
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,770
Also, I'm sending a photo of the tattoo on her wrist.

678
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:25,480
Agent Park, do a background check on Chae So Yoon and search for her personal pictures or anything on SNS.

679
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,040
And check if there is a tattoo or scar in the picture.

680
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,940
Yes, I got it.

681
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:39,460
Director Kang, Chae So Yoon has violated drug laws and has taken out personal loans.

682
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:43,130
And here's the picture of her tattoo.

683
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:50,780
It's the same.

684
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,370
Agent Park, tell Officer Han Woo Joo to stop tracking Circus Man for a while

685
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:58,320
and gather all the information he can on Chae So Yoon.

686
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,010
Everything from her recent phone records to her minor financial transactions.

687
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:02,940
Yes, Ma'am.

688
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:07,940
This is Center. Seeing how the dolphin tattoo has the same location and shape in the two photos, it's likely that she is Chae So Yoon.

689
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:11,760
 She was convicted for violation of drug laws for using ecstasy 

690
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,010
and she's in debt due to personal loans.

691
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:19,470
I'll ask a colleague of mine in International Narcotics.

692
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:31,340
Excuse me. Were you aware that Chae So Yoon was doing drugs?

693
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,700
No.

694
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,510
Did you have any idea about this?

695
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:43,870
No, since she was to be an instructor for children, I only got consent to check her for sex crimes.

696
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:47,130
I didn't know she was doing something like that.

697
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,330
Is that why she was always wearing long sleeves?

698
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:56,380
Turns out that it is something the Black Dragon, a Russian-Chinese gang, brought in.

699
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,840
There's a rumor some of it was lost at sea recently.

700
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,750
What was it?

701
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,880
It's called MIDA.

702
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,600
"Starflower." It's a new drug.

703
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,530
It causes hallucinations and is very addictive.

704
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:12,870
High-purity "starflower" can be sold for high prices. They're probably looking all over for it.

705
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,220
Damn it, these bastards.

706
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,880
She sold drugs on Telenote,

707
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,210
not buying them?

708
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:21,870
Yes. She used stolen student IDs to create new accounts.

709
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:24,670
After tracking down the IP address, I did confirm it to be Chae So Yoon's.

710
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:29,180
She mostly sold ecstasy and marijuana but recently she put up a post saying she would now sell Starflower, too.

711
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,010
Looks like she sold it anonymously.

712
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:33,750
All right. Send me the files.

713
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,130
Director Kang, Chae So Yoon used to sell drugs on Telenote.

714
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,990
This is Center. Upon tracking Chae So Yoon's internet transactions,

715
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:54,000
we found out that she stole IDs and sold drugs.

716
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,100
So that means that the drugs those guys lost somehow landed up in Chae So Yoon's hands.

717
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,810
Looks like they murdered her while looking for them.

718
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:01,780
That's right.

719
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:06,500
In order to get a confession from Chae So Yoon about her hiding place, they must have tortured her and she died from the shock.

720
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,350
If Go Ga Eun was also involved in this, then she must be in grave danger right now.

721
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:18,680
Come to think of it, I remember seeing two women last night, carrying something to the sea.

722
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,010
 You think I'm doing this because I don't want to earn money? 

723
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:24,040
  It's because the economy is no good right now! 

724
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,960
 Just shut up. I'll call you later. Bye. 

725
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,080
I think it was the young female diver along with Instructor Chae.

726
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,780
They were carrying a brown bag.

727
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,330
   

728
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:52,150
Director Kang, recently, there was an unknown cash deposit in Chae So Yoon's account.

729
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,980
 This is Dispatch 3. Director Kang, 

730
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,860
There is a foreign man on site who's keeping an eye on us.

731
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,710
 I don't have a good feeling about this. 

732
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,250
A foreigner?

733
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:06,730
 Wait. Now that I think of it, I heard a foreign language on the radio earlier. 

734
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,660
 Were you aware that Chae So Yoon was doing drugs? 

735
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,990
 Do you have any idea about this? 

736
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,630
 "The police found the woman's corpse." 

737
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:32,100
 "We need to get rid of the woman we're holding now." 

738
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:37,780
 Detective Jo, as you said, I think Go Ga Eun has been kidnapped by a drug cartel. 

739
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,740
I'll get going.

740
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,550
Take care of Granny.

741
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:54,450
   

742
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:55,740
This is Kang Kwon Joo.

743
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,210
 Unni, please meet me right now. 

744
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:01,090
Gong Su Ji? Did something happen?

745
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:03,210
Well, you see...

746
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:07,280
The lullaby that I heard when I was running away yesterday, near the emergency staircase,

747
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,150
I think I heard it on the flight as well.

748
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,240
You heard a lullaby?

749
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,740
Yes. My grandmother also used to sing it to me.

750
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,980
♫  My baby, sleep tight  ♫

751
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,580
♫  My baby, go to sleep  ♫

752
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,800
♫  My baby, go to sleep  ♫

753
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,390
 Look... 

754
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:31,830
 Huh? 

755
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,750
Unni, I think that murderer has come to find me.

756
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:44,540
I think that man is following me because he knows I caught him in my video.

757
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:48,540
Gong Su Ji, we're looking for a woman, not a man.

758
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,880
No, I think he's caught me!

759
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,480
For now, send me the video and wait in your hospital room.

760
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,740
I'll be there right away.

761
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:02,250
I sent it to you.

762
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:07,900
I'm really scared right now so I can't be here anymore. Let's meet at Surok Park in ten minutes.

763
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,340
Damn it. Why isn't this opening?

764
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:28,040
Unni, weren't you at the police station? How did you get here so fast?

765
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,240
After all, it was you who called me.

766
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,340
How about we go somewhere quiet and talk?

767
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,460
That murderer might still be in this hospital.

768
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:40,180
 It's finally the day I get to go back to my Vimo Island house! 

769
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,370
 This isn't the flight to Vimo Island. Once I reach the airport... 

770
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:50,080
♫  My baby, go to sleep  ♫

771
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,780
♫  My baby, go to sleep  ♫

772
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,150
 Dang it. 

773
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:58,100
 He ruined it! 

774
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,980
 As expected this voice is completely different from Circus Man's voice. 

775
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,830
 It doesn't seem to be tampered with either. Circus Man is a woman, anyway. 

776
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:09,290
 This is a man's voice. 

777
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:30,050
 Your nails were clipped yesterday. 

778
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:33,120
 Gong Su Ji,  give me a call if there's something you remember later on. 

779
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,870
   

780
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:37,380
 Your voice is different, too. 

781
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:45,100
Oh, Unni. Now that I think about it, I must have been mistaken.

782
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,120
I saw a man

783
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,750
and you said it was definitely a woman.

784
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,560
So, who are you going to call now?

785
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,040
Stay still unless you want to get hurt.

786
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,040
Agent Park, I think something happened to Gong Su Ji.

787
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,600
I'm going to go out for a while to meet her.

788
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,410
Request local units to go to Surok Park and keep reporting to me the situation here.

789
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:16,540
You're just as weak as her.

790
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:19,410
You said you could handle it on your own, but what's this now?

791
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:22,110
How filthy.

792
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:25,840
♫  My baby, sleep tight  ♫

793
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:29,580
♫  My baby, go to sleep  ♫

794
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:33,680
♫  My baby, go to sleep  ♫

795
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:38,090
♫  My baby, go to sleep  ♫

796
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:40,500
♫  Come, little boys  ♫

797
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,860
Wasn't this the lullaby you heard?

798
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:45,880
Why are you doing this? I'm scared.

799
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,910
♫  Don’t run away,  Don’t cross the line  ♫

800
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:51,910
♫  Yeah, this is a nightmare  ♫

801
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,580
You scumbag!

802
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:03,380
   

803
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:08,110
 Your call cannot be connected. You will be directed to voicemail... 

804
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:27,340
    

805
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:36,540


806
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,370
♫  Cherish it carefully, precious  ♫

807
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,900
♫  Time, coldly fallen...  ♫

808
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,510
   

809
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:50,200
 Yes, this is the 112 Emergency Call Center. 

810
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,610
 I think someone fell into the sea. 

811
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:54,250
 There is a note in the bag. It looks like a suicide note. 

812
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,770
 We have to find Gong Su Ji, no matter what! 

813
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:57,090
 This is the cave. 

814
01:01:57,090 --> 01:02:00,040
 Even the villagers don't know of this place. 

815
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,080
 Do you hear something? 

816
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,470
 Not yet. I'll need some more time. 

817
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,350
 - From now on, we're in charge. 
 - Mind your own business. 

818
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:09,280
 Do as you please. However, we have the right to investigate as well 

819
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,880
 - since we're the special team. 
 - Look here, Director Kang!  You need to focus. You are a voice profiler. Just trust your ears. 

820
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,340
 Whatever monster it may turn out to be, I'll catch it. 

821
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,630
♫  Yeah, I like it  ♫

822
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:20,550
♫  Just go wild, if only I could stop it like this  ♫

823
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:21,850
♫  Yeah  ♫
