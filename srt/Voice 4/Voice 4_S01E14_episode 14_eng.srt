1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,830


2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,810
   

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,730
   

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,310
   

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,760
   

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,320
   

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,910
   

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,330
   

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:44,270
    

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,400
   

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,410
Director Kang, I looked into Dong Bang Min

12
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,720
and I found out he was admitted to F Children's Nursing Hospital at the age of 12.

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,890
But the strange thing is that there's no information about that hospital at all. 
     

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,640
All I could find was the hospital was shut down after it was found to be operating illegally.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,500
I think even the doctor had a fake license.

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,000
Why do you think humans smell different when they are scared?

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,650
Now.

18
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,640
Beg for your life.

19
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,560
You never know. I might let you live.

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,760
Cut the nonsense, you bastard!

21
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,380
I'm not going to plead for my life in front of jerks like you ever again!

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,880
Beg for your life.

23
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,130
You never know.

24
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:08,240
I told you I'm not going to plead for my life in front of jerks like you ever again!

25
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,260
So it's true. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

26
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,720
After all, Dong Bang Heon Yup's blood runs through your veins.

27
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,320
 Looks like you thought your teammates would come and save you if you stalled for some time. 

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,760
 But you guys can never catch me. 

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,460
I am a different being from you all.

30
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,640
Detective Shim!

31
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,140
 Kwon Joo, you have such pretty ears. 

32
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,670
 Isn't that why you can hear sounds that other people can't? 

33
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,580
 If I wanted those ears of yours,  

34
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,880
 would you give them to me? 

35
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,420
 Just who is this? 

36
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,670
   

37
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,510
 The 44 year old Coach Jung...  
    

38
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,130
 That is when she stabbed her adoptive father...  
    

39
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,620
 She was continuous sexually assaulted by her father.  
    

40
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,390
    
    

41
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,300
   

42
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,990
   

43
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,780
I love this smell.

44
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,000
This smell...

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,490
right before humans die.

46
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,000
Cut the nonsense.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,900
Just kill me already, you scumbag.

48
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,210
I told you, didn't I?

49
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,320
You can never...

50
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,230
get away.

51
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,860
Yeah.

52
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,080
You did well.

53
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,280
Don't go, you bastard.

54
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,530
 This is Unit 1.  We found a wounded police officer in the alley behind the Vimo Psychiatric Hospital. 

55
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,370
Detective Shim! Move.

56
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,910
To Sonang Village, please.

57
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,720
Detective Shim, wake up.

58
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,580
Detective Shim.

59
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,370
- Did you call the ambulance? 
 - Yes, it's almost here.

60
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,710
- Detective. 
  - Cap. 

61
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,020
Chad!

62
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,670
Chad. Chad.

63
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,570
Are you okay?

64
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,550
- C-Cap... 
 - Okay, okay, okay.

65
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,370
Okay. Please watch him.

66
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,700
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,020
Are you all right?

68
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,250
- Don't speak. 
 - Detective Jo.

69
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,800
I heard Dong Bang Heon Yup

70
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,630
talking to Yeom Byeong Cheol.

71
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,770
Your mother witnessed...

72
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,010
Sim Young Seob's murder

73
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,010
by mistake. That's why they killed her.

74
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,970
 Let me live. 

75
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,940
 Please, don't kill me! 

76
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,040
 She had packed her things and was trying to flee in the middle of the night. We barely just caught her. 

77
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,880
 Elder, 

78
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,410
 please let my children live. 

79
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,700
 Please. My children have suffered a lot because I was a bad mother. 

80
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,820
 Please let my children live. Please. 

81
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,600
 Finish her off well without anyone knowing. 

82
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,450
 Use the usual method. 

83
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,600
 E-Elder... Elder! 

84
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,410
 Please let my children live.  

85
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,280
 Elder! Please! 

86
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,650
 Please let my children live. Please! 

87
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,730
Your mother did that...

88
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,650
to save you and your sister...

89
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,290
I got it. Please don't talk anymore.

90
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,620
Director Kang,

91
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,650
you gave me another chance.

92
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,300
I'm sorry it had to end like this.

93
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,080
But still I...

94
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,790
This time I...

95
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,340
didn't beg for my life.

96
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,010
You don't have to explain, I know.

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,270
- Detective. 
 - Detective Shim.

98
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,000
Hurry!

99
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,500
- Detective Shim. 
 - Hang in there.

100
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,360
Detective Shim! Wake up! Detective Shim! Hurry!

101
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,670
This is Director Kang. Detective Park,

102
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,730
Dong Bang Min attacked two police officers and fled from the back alley of the psychiatric hospital.

103
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,460
- Check the CCTV footage. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

104
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,260
Detective Jo.

105
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,860
Agent Han, find the CCTV footage of the alley behind the Vimo Psychiatric Hospital.

106
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,390
Yes.

107
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,080
How dare he touch one of our own?

108
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,890
Detective Park, I think I found him.

109
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,020
The man in black clothes looks like Dong Bang Min.

110
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,780
This is Center. Director Kang,

111
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,200
a man wearing black clothes got into a taxi with license number 12Ba0208. He's headed toward the Shinwoo Intersection.

112
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,870
We think it's Dong Bang Min.

113
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,990
Keep searching and put an APB on Dong Bang Min. Right away. 
  (APB - All Points Bulletin) 

114
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,120
Yes, Ma'am. 
    

115
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,840
We have a Code Zero alert. The family serial killer, Dong Bang Min 
    

116
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,400
escaped from the Vimo Psychiatric Hospital where he was being kept under watch.

117
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,880
Currently, he's in a taxi, License 12Ba0208, and headed toward the Shinwoo Intersection.

118
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,810
I'm issuing an APB on him, across the entire island.

119
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,250
Requesting backup from local patrol units, airport security, and public transport security.

120
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,360
Where is the taxi now?

121
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,320
It's headed to Hyojin Road.

122
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,000
That's the road to Sonang Village.

123
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,890
Wait. Here's the warrant.

124
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,880
Don't you try and approach us!

125
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,490
All of us will die!

126
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,870
For our leader who is praying inside,

127
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,410
we will protect him!

128
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,110
 - Protect him! 
 - Protect him! 

129
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,960
 - Protect him! 
 - Protect him! 

130
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,640
This is how we can repay him!

131
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,620
 - We will protect him! 
 - We will protect him! 

132
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,020
Please snap out of it! You're all being used!

133
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,660
Dong Bang Heon Yup is a fraud! We even brought a warrant!

134
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,080
We don't need that, so leave us alone and just go!

135
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,370
Do not try to tear us apart!

136
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,160
- You outsiders! Go away! 
 - Go away!

137
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,530
 - Leave! 
 - Get out! 

138
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,180
- Stop it already! 
- Please calm down!

139
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,470
Stop it! What is wrong with you people?

140
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,040
What has gotten into you all?

141
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,550
 - Go away. 
 - Leave us alone. 

142
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,350
 - Go away! 
 - Leave! 

143
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:28,760
 - Don't do this!  
 ♪  Sleep tight  ♪

146
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,320
Are Dae Sik and Detective Chad all right?

147
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,310
I think Detective Chad is fine.

148
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,220
I received a call saying Detective Shim went into emergency surgery just a while ago.

149
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,540
Where's Dong Bang Heon Yup?

150
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,650
He's praying in that room there.

151
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,000
The villagers have been drugged for a long time and manipulated as well.

152
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,880
 I pray in earnest. 

153
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,620
 To those who persecute us, 

154
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,240
 lock down the Sonang Village. 

155
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,050
 I pray in earnest. 

156
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,620
 Never appear in front of my Min ever again. 

157
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,260
 It means everyone can become one family! 

158
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,820
 I pray in earnest to the Deity. 

159
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,730
 Do not show yourself around my grandson again. 

160
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,490
 Lock down the Sonang Village. 

161
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,290
Dong Bang Heon Yup isn't here. It's fake.

162
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,130
Dong Bang Min isn't here, either.

163
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,610
Dong Ban Heon Yup has fooled these people again.

164
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,230
Dong Bang Min will have gone to where he's hiding.

165
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,630
Didn't Detective Shim say Dong Bang Hyeon Yup

166
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,770
has a private prayer room in the museum basement?

167
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,600
Right. Let's go there first.

168
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,430
We'll head to the stonemasonry museum. Try to calm the villagers.

169
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,440
All right.

170
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,350
Be careful!

171
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,520
 - Go away! 
 - Leave! 

172
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,720
This is the smell of the Vimo Plant.

173
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,630
Min!

174
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,990
You look like you've seen a ghost.

175
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,660
Why? Did you think I'd be locked up forever?

176
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,990
I know how resentful you must feel.

177
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,220
Still, we are family.

178
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,690
I'm your father! Your father!

179
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,520
Family, my ass.

180
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,450
Now...

181
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,360
it's time to wrap everything up, Father.

182
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,760
You're out of your mind. You're crazy.

183
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,620
Min, will you let me off this once?

184
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,720
Min, help me.

185
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,720
Min.

186
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,230
 Noona, I'm scared! 

187
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,890
 The goshawk keeps following us. 

188
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,130
 Noona! 

189
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,360
 Don't worry, just trust me. 

190
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,230
 We can live if we go there. 

191
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,130
 I remember it now. 

192
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,600
 Dong Bang Min and I ran away from some woman into that forest. 

193
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,120
Listen. If we can't protect the elder,

194
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,030
the Deity will punish us.

195
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,870
 He's right. 

196
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:41,510
- We must overcome this to become a true family! 
  - You're right! 

197
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,760
Here, swallow this.

198
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,260
The Deity will protect us.

199
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,160
Drink.

200
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,680
Noona! Mi Yeon! It's me, Gwi Nam.

201
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,590
Remember you made me give out

202
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,520
the Vimo plant drink to hinder the investigation?

203
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,810
The Golden Time Team detectives drank that and almost killed themselves.

204
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,420
Think about it!

205
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,720
If that's the Deity's will,

206
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,010
the Deity is horrible!

207
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,710
What about those people from Sonang who call the cops every day?

208
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,180
Have you heard from them after they went to the mainland?

209
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,120
Just once, really think about it!

210
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,890
 - He has a point. 
 - He's right. 

211
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,050
 It's true. 

212
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,290
Brethren, will you listen to that gibberish?

213
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,150
Don't you want to make Seo Ha walk?

214
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,410
- Shut up! 
 - That noona...

215
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,990
Here, drink.

216
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,580
Drink this and have strength!

217
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,290
 - Protect him! 
 - Protect him! 

218
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,510
Dong Bang Hyeon Yup is not here!

219
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,120
He's a fake!

220
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,780
He's right there!

221
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,400
You are all being fooled!

222
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,350
You think we'll believe that bullshit?

223
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,640
We don't believe you!

224
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,800
Everyone! Everyone!

225
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,770
Ko Kyeong Hee already told us everything.

226
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,530
Here! Everything Dong Bang Hyeon Yup has done is in here.

227
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,940
- What's that? 
 - Check for yourselves!

228
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,550
All of the bank accounts that you entrusted to him are in his name.

229
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,450
If you look there, you can see what he did to women and even young kids.

230
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,350
This isn't the first time he's done something bad!

231
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,300
That's not possible.

232
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,280
Give me that, let me see.

233
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,830
Wait. Sir.

234
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,650
There's no way. No.

235
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:31,640
Everyone, quiet! I will go ask the elder if this is true or not.

236
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,460
That'll settle things.

237
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,700
You dare, when the elder is praying? Do you want to die!

238
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,580
Damn it.

239
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,100
 - My gosh! 
 - Oh no! 

240
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,990
Director Kang.

241
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,350
I remember now.

242
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:21,300
Dong Bang Min and I were locked up somewhere and we fled into that forest,

243
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,960
and a woman chased us with a goshawk.

244
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,660
The forest?

245
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,630
For now, let's find Dong Bang Min.

246
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,280
I think Dong Bang Heon Yup was dragged away as we predicted.

247
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,660
 Director Kang, the place has been set on fire! 

248
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,810
 It's going to be some time before 911 arrives. This is bad! 

249
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,770
Please come out!

250
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,690
You need to come out!

251
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,460
Please listen to us!

252
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,260
Even if I do leave, where would I go?

253
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,160
My husband divorced me

254
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,750
and this is the only place that accepted me when I had nowhere to go!

255
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,330
My children abandoned me!

256
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,820
We have no other place to live besides here!

257
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,690
Everyone, get out of there now!

258
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,670
I'm going to stay here until my daughter walks again.

259
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,170
So, please leave!

260
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,020
Are you really going to die! Get out of there!

261
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,460
Everyone, I'm truly sorry that I couldn't hear your cries for help!

262
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,650
I know you all came here because it was too hard to live.

263
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,940
It's not true!

264
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,920
However, he will never save you!

265
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,030
Rather, they use you for their personal gain.

266
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,830
It's too late, but you must listen to and follow the police now.

267
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,890
Don't listen to those cops.

268
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,320
They tricked us so many times. Protect the elder.

269
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,630
 Protect him. 

270
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,020
Get them out!

271
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,420
Yes, Director Yang. I'm coming.

272
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,060
- It's dangerous! 
 - Let go!

273
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,680
 We have nowhere to go! 

274
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,440
Get up.

275
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,460
I said, get up.

276
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,790
- Let go. 
 - Let go of me!

277
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,120
What...

278
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,770
Dong Bang Heon Yup is not here.

279
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,400
What?

280
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,630
For decades! You have all been fooled by Dong Bang Hyeon Yup.

281
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,030
Do you get it now!

282
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,890
You are under arrest for murder and murder-for-hire.

283
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:21,900
You have the right to an attorney. You may refuse to testify. You'll get a chance to defend yourself.

284
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,340
No.

285
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,230
You're Mi Yeon, right?

286
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,420
Please, there will be another path for your daughter.

287
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,720
We can help you.

288
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,100
 Over here! Director Yang! They're here! 

289
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,670
Seo Ha.

290
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,710
Grandpa, where's Mom?

291
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:11,740
Mom said not to leave this room.

292
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,090
Did Mom do something bad?

293
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:21,630
Is that why you came to arrest...

294
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,190
Is this my fault again? Because I'm sick?

295
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,460
Don't say that.

296
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,180
We'll split up and look for Dong Bang Min. Captain Park, Detective Gu, check the airport and terminals.

297
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,170
You and I will search around here.

298
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,160
Yes, Sir.

299
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,170
I think there's something in that forest.

300
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,050
I'm positive Dong Bang Min and I escaped from somewhere in that forest.

301
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,200
From in there?

302
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,760
T-That forest?

303
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,260
There is an old children's rehab hospital that was shut down.

304
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,790
The elder... I mean, Dong Bang Hyeon Yup said

305
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,770
it was already there when he bought the mountain.

306
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,310
Do you know the name of the hospital?

307
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,550
No, I don't.

308
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,610
We'll go there. You check the museum again.

309
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,660
Let's go.

310
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,480
   
   

311
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,520
Let's go in.

312
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,990
 That... That lady  

313
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,030
 terrifies me, Noona. 

314
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,600
 Okay. We'll run away from here today. 

315
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,130
 But since I can't see, you have to be my eyes. 

316
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,020
 Can you do that? 

317
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,290
 Y-Yes, I will. 

318
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,980
 I wish you and I were Siamese twins. 

319
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,690
 That way, we'd be with each other all the time. 

320
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,680
Director Kang.

321
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,560
I clearly remember it now.

322
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,360
Dong Bang Min and I were in this hospital.

323
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,610
I had to undergo brain surgery because I got into a car accident when I was 12.

324
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,480
I couldn't see anything after the surgery, as a side effect.

325
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,920
As I recovered my eyesight,

326
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:12,050
I started to hear better. I clearly remember the pinwheel I heard back then.

327
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,650
Perhaps this hospital has something to do with your hearing ability.

328
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,310
 Director Kang, there's something odd in Dong Bang Min's record. 

329
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:36,430
29 years ago, Dong Bang Hyeon Yup killed Dong Bang Min's parents using the villagers, and someone witnessed it.

330
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,010
But Detective Gu Hyung Tae covered up the incident once again.

331
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,710
What? Could you tell me in more detail?

332
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:46,450
His name was Hwang Bok Goo. He was secretly picking herbs on the land owned by Sonang Village,

333
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:52,690
 and a couple of them saw the villagers burying a man and a woman alive.  

334
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:58,620
They made the young Dong Bang Min put on a weird costume and forced him to watch his parents die, calling it a "salvation ritual."

335
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,960
They told him it was the will of the Deity.

336
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,900
 The witness said it looked like Dong Bang Min and his parents got caught while running away from Sonang Village. 

337
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,470
And soon after, the witness went missing as well.

338
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:15,480
All right. We're at F Children's Rehab Hospital inside the Sonang Village forest. Tell Agent Han to look into this hospital some more.

339
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,300
Yes, Ma'am.

340
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,920
Please be careful.

341
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,820
Let's go.

342
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,750
It looks like this building is soundproof.

343
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,200
The sound just disappears without echoing.

344
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,560
Detective Jo.

345
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,320
   

346
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,470
   

347
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,070
   

348
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,090
Detective Jo.

349
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,050
   

350
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,640
   

351
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,780
   

352
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,200
   

353
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,510
It's Dong Bang Min's chart.

354
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,730
There's a note that says his personalities are divided.

355
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:47,650
     

356
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,760
They gathered children with brain diseases.

357
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,450
Isn't this you?

358
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,450
   

359
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,350
   

360
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:13,560
   
  

361
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,450
 It's an accurate diagnosis of my ears. 

362
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,960
They fed you a high-potent drug when you were young,

363
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,760
so it's only natural that you developed dissociative amnesia.

364
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,430
And you're recalling those memories now that you're back here.

365
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,620
Detective Jo, I just heard something.

366
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:44,440
 I'll give you my blessing. 

367
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,800
 I'll give you my blessing. 

368
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,520
It's not clear because of the soundproof walls,

369
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,580
but I'm sure it's Dong Bang Min. He's upstairs.

370
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,060
This is Dispatch 3. Team Leader Park, we found Dong Bang Min's secret hiding place.

371
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,410
It's an abandoned building deep inside the forest of Sonang Village. Please hurry over here.

372
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,640
 It'll take us about five minutes to get there. 

373
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,030
We don't have much time. Let's go first.

374
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,600
Are you ready?

375
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,590
 We can leave this world sitting at the same table. 

376
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,270
 You have no idea what a great blessing this is. 

377
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,730
I'll give you my blessing

378
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,500
and you only need to accept it.

379
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,150
You see...

380
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,040
I used to hate Christmas the most.

381
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:41,440
That's the day you harassed people especially cruelly. You remember, right?

382
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:49,190
Just because my mom turned on these lights without you knowing,

383
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:53,650
you whipped her until her back burst open.

384
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:59,330
It's not that you didn't like Christmas. You were just afraid that the families would gather

385
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:03,200
and rebel against you.

386
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,170
Isn't that right?

387
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:18,560
♪  Go to sleep  ♪

388
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:25,990
♪  My baby, go to sleep  ♪

389
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:32,860
♪  My baby won't go to sleep  ♪

390
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,630
♪  My baby, go to sleep  ♪ 
 - Please don't kill me.

391
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,520
♪  My baby, sleep tight  ♪ 
 - I'm so sorry.

392
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,370
That's the lullaby my mom used to sing for me. You remember it, right?

393
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,990
It's your turn now.

394
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,180
I'll let you sleep forever.

395
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,150
 Dong Bang Min! 

396
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,340
Don't do anything stupid.

397
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,740
You're quite good. You followed me here?

398
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,850
Shoot him if you want to. This jerk killed your mother.

399
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,110
Please save me!

400
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,680
 Save me! 

401
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,660
Look how brazen he is, begging for mercy. Doesn't this make you sick?

402
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,630
All right. I'll give you a chance to kill two at once.

403
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,810
 Shoot us! 

404
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,020
No, Detective Jo.

405
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,770
You coward.

406
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,320
Dong Bang Min!

407
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:49,280
This is Director Kang. Detective Park! Dong Bang Hyeon Yup is having difficulty breathing.

408
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,490
Send the 119 Rescue Team.

409
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,320
Director Kang! Where is Dong Bang Min?

410
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,450
He got away. Detective Jo is chasing him.

411
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,460
Please send him to the hospital.

412
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,330
- Detective Gu, let's go. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

413
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,300
Please be careful.

414
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,400
Dong Bang Min, come out.

415
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,000
Come out, you scum!

416
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,220
You scum...

417
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,670
Come out.

418
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,890
Dong Bang Min.

419
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,630
Come out, you scumbag!

420
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:43,520
That's right.  You have a knack for hiding like a rat.

421
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,310
I must say, I applaud your persistence.

422
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:51,980
But you know, you'll be nothing but a handful of ash once you burn to death.

423
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:24,430
What? Are you surprised?

424
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,330
Dong Bang Min!

425
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,000
Drop the gun.

426
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,300
There you are.

427
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,940
I remember now.

428
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,520
You and I were at this hospital

429
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,720
and we escaped together.

430
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,560
So you remember it now.

431
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,900
That's right. I relied on you so much emotionally

432
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,010
that I even developed a personality that resembles you.

433
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,210
Too bad.

434
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,220
I wanted to play with you a bit longer.

435
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,360
Cut the nonsense. Just put the gun down.

436
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,720
What use are those ears? All they do is cause you pain.

437
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,690
Kang Kwon Joo,

438
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,390
you can just let it all go now.

439
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:04,140
I won't be swayed by a psychopath like you.

440
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,800
That's too bad. I was going to spare you for old times' sake.

441
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,930
No, you can't kill me.

442
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,580
You know that, too.

443
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,320
You know that you can't kill me

444
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,970
if you've truly imitated me.

445
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,010
You impersonated me and tried to kill people

446
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,020
with ears like mine.

447
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,270
But in the end, that personality chose to save people.

448
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,680
Dong Bang Min, I know why you had to develop multiple personalities

449
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,920
was because no one listened to you when you were suffering as a child.

450
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,950
However, it's not just you.

451
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,070
It's impossible to have your pains and sufferings

452
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,240
understood by others all the time.

453
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,290
So admit it already.

454
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,600
Admit how weak you really are.

455
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,910
Enough.

456
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:49,000
Sim Young Seob. Eom Seok Gu.

457
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,180
Your parents are still waiting for you to return home.

458
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,480
Shut your mouth.

459
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,200
And you. The Dong Bang Min that I knew...

460
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,170
was just a little boy who missed his mom and dad.

461
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,240
Please remember the child that you once were.

462
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,040
Shut your mouth!

463
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,070
I did my best to save him.

464
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,360
I wholeheartedly wished him all the best.

465
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,570
I sacrificed my life to get Min out of the miser—

466
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,810
I took him home,

467
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:39,030
but he said he was terrified of his grandfather

468
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,180
and refused to go home, no matter what.

469
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,020
Then I got caught.

470
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,220
I got killed because of him.

471
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,460
I'm not a murderer.

472
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,980
I didn't kill anyone.

473
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,510
Shut up, all of you!

474
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,450
I know you can't kill me anyway.

475
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,700
Detective Jo,

476
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,470
the law is on my side.

477
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:29,040
No. I swear, I won't let you off this time.

478
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,040
All of it has been recorded.

479
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,760
Everything you've said. Ready?

480
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:48,420
We have to get him today, no matter what.

481
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,810
And ...this is

482
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,180
for Seung Ah.

483
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,640
Go on. Kill me.

484
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,180
Just kill me, instead.

485
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,790
I've imagined this moment

486
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,350
hundreds of thousands of times.

487
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,640
I really wanted to kill you.

488
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,810
However!

489
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:41,390
I wouldn't be able to face Seung Ah with your filthy blood on my hands.

490
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,120
I don't think she'd want that.

491
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,560
So instead,

492
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,490
I want you to suffer in jail

493
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:07,640
and loathe yourself for the rest of your life,

494
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,270
until the day you die.

495
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,230
Detective Jo, we've got him.

496
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,040
Dong Bang Min, you are under arrest for serial and attempted murder.

497
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,720
You have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

498
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,380
You'll be given a chance to explain yourself.

499
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,620
This is the Center Director. We've arrested Dong Bang Min. The Sanggae Neighborhood Family Murder case

500
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:11,600
and all the other murder cases involving him... are now closed.

501
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,420
We did it!

502
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,200
   

503
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,740
- Well done. 
 - Great work.

504
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,170
Great work, everyone.

505
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,430
♫  What if this isn't over  ♫

506
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,010
Gosh, what's wrong with my hands?

507
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,910
I never get shaky hands. What's going on?

508
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,520
It's like that for everyone when it's their first time. I was like that too.

509
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:59,200
I'm surprised. I know I'm a police officer, but how should I put this?

510
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,320
I used to really hate having to give up my hobbies or leisure time for the sake of work.

511
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:12,000
But for the first time, I'm thinking it's not so bad to make such sacrifices for work once in a while.

512
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,720
That's pretty lame, isn't it?

513
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:20,070
No. I also turned down the offer to join the Golden Time Team at first.

514
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,730
Anyway, good work.

515
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:26,580
W-Wait, this is my first time hearing about this.

516
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,910
I must know more as a die-hard fan of the Golden Time Team!  This a rare story! Hold on!

517
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,310
Detective Park!

518
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:39,170
- My goodness, it's really over. Can we call it a day now? 
 - I wish.

519
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:45,830
 Dong Bang Min used his dissociative identity disorder to claim that he was feeble-minded,  
    

520
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:52,930
 but experts believe he was capable of making sound decisions while committing all of his crimes. We're still investigating. 

521
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:58,300
The police believe that domestic violence is a social issue,

522
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,810
not a domestic one. Therefore, we'll provide the teams with more support and manpower.

523
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:07,280
Thus, we can prevent future tragic cases of child abuse and domestic violence.

524
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,430
 The notorious murderer with multiple personalities was born into a life of domestic violence. 

525
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,490
 With Dong Bang Min's arrest, Moon Ah Ram and Joo Beom Tae 

526
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,120
 have been cleared of their charges, 

527
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,640
 but we know that this isn't the end. We'll keep watching 

528
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,900
 until Dong Bang Min and Dong Bang Hyeon Yup, 

529
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,010
 who created that monster, are punished severely. 

530
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:39,240
Not long after we escaped, the hospital was shut down. With that,

531
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,050
our last chance to escape Sonang Village

532
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,990
was also gone.

533
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,840
Why did you put the swirl-shaped tattoo on them?

534
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:54,540
That's the final game.

535
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,710
Figure it out.

536
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,480
Tell me.

537
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,660
- Wait, Director Kang. 
 - He needs his rest. Please leave.

538
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,330
 Please calm down. 

539
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,990
 You can question him once he recovers. 

540
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,420
Keep your ears safe.

541
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,500
They'll come for them.

542
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,380
   

543
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,140
You think Circus Pierrot is owned by Fabre?

544
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,490
Yes, that's right.

545
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:45,310
There are many communities that use this style, but I didn't want to believe it. Once I removed the veil,

546
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,750
it was the browser that Fabre used to use.

547
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,660
I think the "F" from F Children's Hospital

548
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,910
and the "FR" from the hearing aid are all related.

549
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:59,640
Did you figure out the owner of the F Children's Hospital?

550
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,990
- Find that first. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

551
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,400
    
 What is this? You people are too much.

552
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,840
You come to visit a colleague who was stabbed and you came empty-handed? Really?

553
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,370
I'm glad you're okay.

554
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:23,830
If you want to thank me, treat me to pork rinds and soju.

555
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,310
Director Kang.

556
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:36,290
I'm reporting for duty as soon as I'm discharged,

557
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:39,940
so don't remove my desk. Okay?

558
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,550
Once a GTT member, always a GTT member.

559
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:49,300
I wondered what I should say to you the entire way here. I see it was unnecessary.

560
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:55,640
Excuse me.

561
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:02,530
Hey, Dae Sik. You've got to take care of yourself, man.

562
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:05,150
Don't you know that's rule number one for every cop in the world?

563
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:07,850
You speak Korean well,  but you always speak English in times like this.

564
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:09,970
Speak Korean.

565
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,560
Learn English if you don't like it.

566
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,720
I'll teach you for cheap.

567
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,500
You must like being discharged.

568
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,600
- Darn it. 
 - You're such a weakling.

569
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,700
I was just about to call you.

570
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,240
 Don't worry about it. 

571
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,350
I already heard.

572
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:31,300
Great work, Derek. Now, hurry up and get home.

573
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,860
 And also, I've got some good news. 

574
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,240
Your old babysitter from when you were a kid.

575
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,110
She's come forward and she's willing to testify in your and Lisa's case.

576
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:44,660
 She couldn't get in touch with you, so she came here to find you. 

577
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:51,530
 We've got a strong witness on our side and the statute of limitations on first-degree child abuse has been lifted. 

578
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,820
Let's get it right this time.

579
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,540
 Derek. 

580
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:01,130
I feel... ashamed

581
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,360
for not believing you and Lisa all this time.

582
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:09,140
 I should've listened to you. I'm sorry. 

583
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,840
-  Truly.  
 - Thank you, sir.

584
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,230
Our old babysitter said

585
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,910
she will testify.

586
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,740
I'm going to bring charges again.

587
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,550
That's great.

588
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,660
Please show them that if you abuse children,

589
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,970
you will be punished severely.

590
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:50,430
Actually, the organization that Seung Ah supported called.

591
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:53,380
Our father's sister... So...

592
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,930
Our aunt contacted them.

593
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,930
Our DNA matched too.

594
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,050
But I don't have the courage to meet her.

595
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:14,210
If she's your father's sister,

596
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:20,560
she and your father were probably just like you and Seung Ah.

597
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:29,030
If it were me... I'd be so curious.

598
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,180
 - Cheers! 
 - Cheers! 

599
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,470
That's nice.

600
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:51,120
Detective Jo, I'm finally getting used to you. How could you leave already?

601
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,380
I know. Stay a few years. You're built for this.

602
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,100
I saw there's a program that allows foreign cops to work here.

603
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,210
What do you think?

604
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:03,720
- Should I? 
 - You should. Since they even have a program for it.

605
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,140
Think about it, okay? Promise?

606
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,170
Detective Park, what do you think about being on the Dispatch Team? Huh?

607
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,920
It's exhausting having to run around all day, isn't it?

608
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,770
You can go back to the Call Team then.

609
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:20,640
I thought about it a lot before I made the switch. I want to save female victims at the scene.

610
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,750
- Don't worry too much. I'll get used to it soon. 
 - Okay.

611
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,310
I'm an official member, right?

612
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:33,640
Well... We should see how you do a little longer.

613
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,470
What? But—

614
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:38,800
- But... 
 - Oh my goodness.

615
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,970
She says she'll see how you do. Shouldn't you do something then?

616
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:47,410
You should do something.

617
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:49,540
In light of that...

618
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,830
Traditional Vimo Island liquor. I swiped it from my dad.

619
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,210
You're an official member!

620
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,080
I like how you think.

621
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:12,620
- Okay. Chad. You know Korean traditional alcohol, eh.
 - Okay. Thank you.

622
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,410
Detective Jo.

623
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,410
Excuse me.

624
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,210
Director Kang.

625
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,830
And finally... me.

626
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,310
Golden Time Team!

627
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,990
- Forever! 
 - Forever!

628
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:52,500
 Team Leader Do, it's me. 

629
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:58,490
 I caught the killer who killed people disguised as me, with my own hands, 

630
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:01,630
 without any sacrifices.  

631
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:04,440
 Going forward, I'm going to try harder. 

632
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,180
 To become better as a police officer and the director of my center.  

633
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,030
 I'm not going to have nightmares anymore. 

634
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:19,160
 So wherever you are Team Leader Do, rest in peace. 

635
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:39,530
Am I interfering?

636
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,350
Not at all.

637
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,590
You're leaving tomorrow.

638
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,170
Yes.

639
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:54,040
I won't forget the time I spent here.

640
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,740
If it weren't for you,

641
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,550
I would have ruined everything.

642
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:09,250
You are a great police officer and you were the best partner I could have had.

643
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,340
You too were the best partner.

644
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:20,010
And don't forget that it was you

645
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:24,310
who decided not to take revenge.

646
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,270
Director Kang.

647
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,720
I wanted to give this to you before I forgot.

648
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,410
These are Golden Time Team's investigation files that I collected as a fan.

649
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,430
And...

650
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,620
I found listings for a special hearing aid similar to what Dong Bang Min used

651
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,710
on the Auction Fabre site.

652
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:55,820
That's amazing.  You did a great job.

653
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:58,030
I had to do at least that much in order to run the Fan Cafe.

654
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:01,180
By the way, what are the two of you doing here?

655
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,110
Let's go back in.

656
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:17,910
 It was strange that I couldn't find the owner of the nursing hospital so I looked into some foreign doctors. 

657
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:21,560
 Detective Chad told me about a Doctor Finder. All I had to do was enter the doctor's name 

658
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:26,080
  and it gave me all the information from medical mishaps,  over-prescriptions to even their sex crimes. 

659
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,790
 That's how I found this. 

660
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:32,130
 Goddess Lee. She's was a woman in her 50s. 

661
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:36,860
 But what's really strange is that I confirmed her name and that she is Korean but 
     

662
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,130
 I couldn't find anything else on her. 

663
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:45,340
  Her address turned out to be a non-profit research center for studying the auditory nerve instead of where she actually lived. 

664
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:51,640
   
  

665
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,450
   

666
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:57,470
   

667
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:01,210
  F Children's Nursing Hospital, the FR from the hearing aid... 

668
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:05,490
 and the Fbre Lab Auditory Nerve Research Center. 

669
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:07,580
 Could it be... 

670
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:18,730
 There was a time when I thought you were the cause of my pain. 

671
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:21,910
 I'm sorry I realized what you went through  

672
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,540
 so much later. 

673
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,270
 Please take good care 

674
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:29,540
 of Seung Ah. 

675
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:55,960
You should take this chance and take some days off.

676
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:01,000
Cap, there are times when it's important to take a break.

677
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,580
I think this is one of those times for you.

678
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,200
If you want to stay in Korea even after your break,

679
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,700
then your special agreement can be extended so that you can stay longer.

680
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:21,060
It will be a loss for us but I'm sure the Golden Time Team will love it.

681
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,150
Why?

682
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,990
You want to try being the captain while I'm not there?

683
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:33,750
Well, I wouldn't really mind being the Cap for once.

684
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:39,100
By the way, Agent Han told me that he suspects that the owner of the F Children's Nursing Hospital is

685
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,030
a foreign doctor. So I told him about the database that would help him track

686
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:45,490
doctors registered in the States.

687
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:52,040
Also, while you were talking with Director Kang at the Vimo Island Hospital,

688
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:57,210
I saw a man in a white suit telling someone on the phone that he approached Case 1.

689
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:01,230
The more I think about it,  the odder it seems.

690
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:09,810
 I see the target, Case 1, right in front of me. 

691
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:16,070
Case 1?

692
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,920
   

693
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,890
   

694
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:31,160
   

695
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:37,190
   
   

696
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,900
   
       

697
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,380
   

698
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,850
   

699
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:19,050
    More than 90% likely that the patient has superhuman hearing abilities.]  

700
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:25,780
   
    More than 90% likely that the patient has superhuman hearing abilities.]  

701
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,810
I didn't think you'd find this place.

702
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:36,060
 That's the voice of the woman in my memory. 

703
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,570
Who are you?

704
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:47,110
With your ears, finding out my identity will just be a matter of time.

705
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:51,290
Come with me. We can reminisce about the old days.

706
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,310
Do you think I'll do whatever you tell me to?

707
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:56,770
Identify yourself first.

708
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:00,730
Don't you want to know how you got your hearing abilities?

709
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,780
If you come with us, then you'll get to know the secret of your hearing ability.

710
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,610
How about we go meet them now?

711
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,180
What?

712
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:18,260
 I told Director Kang that Goddess Lee is the owner of the F Children's Nursing Hospital  

713
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:22,290
 and that she is related to the Fbre Lab Auditory Nerve Research Center in America. 

714
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,510
 But the name "Fabre" somehow bothered me so I looked it up and   

715
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:29,410
 found out that Dong Bang Min went to Sokpo High for a few months of his tenth grade.  

716
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:31,760
Director Kang!

717
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:42,350
   

718
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:45,700

725
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,070
