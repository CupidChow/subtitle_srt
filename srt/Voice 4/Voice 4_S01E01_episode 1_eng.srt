1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,470


2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,690
   

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,050
   

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,000
   

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,920
    
    

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,110
   

7
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:44,270
    

8
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,560
   
   

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,690
♫  Don't run away, don't trust if I  ♫

10
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,600
♫  Yeah, this is nightmare  ♫

11
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,220
 Right now, in the Myeongdong streets, due to all the people out and about with their families, 

12
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,130
 it really feels like Christmas.  
    

13
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,020
 A mass celebrating the birth of Baby Jesus 

14
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,970
 is going to start in ten minutes, at midnight. 

15
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,760
 Beom Tae... 

16
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,040
 Why are you doing this? 

17
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,960
All right, all right.

18
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,000
- I was the one in the wrong. 
 - Shut up, you old geezer!

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,920
Just stop talking and eat this chicken poo!

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,280
My poor baby...

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,890
Are you acting like this because we didn't buy you a new cell phone?

22
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,190
I was wrong.

23
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,560
So please have a change of heart.

24
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,480
We were wrong.

25
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,320
That's why you should have abandoned me, just like my mom and dad, from the start.

26
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,220
Why do you make me live like this

27
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,490
in such a crappy house!

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,220
My gosh, honey!

29
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,100
Beom Tae!

30
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,000
Wh-What are you doing right now?

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,830
Stop it, Beom Tae.

32
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,770
What are you doing right now?

33
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,790
What are you doing?

34
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,130
 Circus Man, 

35
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,500
 I took a picture as proof!  

36
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,630
  So erase everything. 

37
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,300
  Why aren't you responding?  

38
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,280
Beom Tae!

39
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,100
Who are you? Beom Tae!

40
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,350
Beom Tae!

41
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,340
Beom Tae!

42
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,380
Beom Tae!

43
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,290
Beom Tae!

44
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,340
Aren't you grateful toward me,

45
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,380
for killing your vermin grandson?

46
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,900
No! No! Beom Tae!

47
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,160
Who are you?

48
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,730
My grandson!

49
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,910
Bring my grandson back!

50
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,420
It's not even like you chose to have ties with him.

51
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,880
Living like this, stuck with him for no good reason.

52
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,120
Don't you find it revolting?

53
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,770
   

54
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,190
  - Abuse that has been going on for 40 years... 
 - the end is murder.  

55
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,810
   
   

56
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,450
   
   
   

57
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,310
   

58
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,930
    
   

59
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,650
   

60
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,130
   

61
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,830
 Director, the support team is arriving soon. Why don't we wait... 

62
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,050
No, we have to find Team Leader Do fast.

63
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,900
Team Leader...

64
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,830
Team Leader Do!

65
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,020
Don't move. Don't move!

66
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,840
What are you?

67
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,290
Why is it that you look like me?

68
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,600
Aren't you tired of people always asking you to save them?

69
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,710
You and I...

70
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,790
were born with a very special ability.

71
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,830
What is that supposed to mean?

72
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,950
Don't move.

73
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,110
Don't move!

74
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,510
 The same dream again. 

75
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,810
 After receiving that email, 

76
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,610
 I'm  suffering from a nightmare 

77
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,990
 of someone with the same face as mine committing murder. 

78
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,710
 If I hadn't... 

79
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,040
 been taken hostage that day, 

80
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,480
 would Team Leader Do still be alive? 

81
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,350
   

82
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:20,030
   
   

83
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,630
   
  
   

84
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,410
  
   

85
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,440
   
   

86
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,270
    
   
   

87
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,480
   
   

88
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,880
 This person knows too much about my secret hearing ability for it to just be prank mail. 

89
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,770
 They know about it all too well. 

90
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,650
 Besides the Golden Time family and the dead Bang Je Soo, 

91
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,980
 no one knows about it. 

92
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,490
No.

93
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,630
They must have guessed it knowing that I'm a voice profiler.

94
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,810
It's not like I haven't received this kind of threatening email before.

95
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,220
Let's not be overly sensitive.

96
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,570
 In 2019, the Golden Time Team and I 

97
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,480
 had a lot going on. 

98
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,840
 The owner of Auction Fabre, a terrible cybercrime cartel, 

99
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,640
 and the serial killer, born out of discrimination and 

100
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,060
 loathing, Masayuki Kaneki, 

101
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,940
 were both tracked down by us. 

102
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,260
 When Team Leader Do Kang Woo realized that Kaneki was his older brother, Woo Jong Woo, 

103
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,520
 and the culprit of the Fujiyama Miho case, whom he had thought was his father, 

104
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,090
 was actually himself and his brother, 

105
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,590
 he met with Kaneki alone, in order to pay for his crime. 

106
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,160
 I had followed him but Kaneki used me as a hostage instead 

107
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,020
 and tried to awaken Team Leader Do Kang Woo's 

108
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,310
 murderous instincts.  
 You can live however you want to.

109
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,510
 In order to condemn his own brother,  Team Leader Do Kang Woo 

110
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,120
 murdered Kaneki. 

111
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,390
 Under the false impression that Team Leader Do Kang Woo was armed, 

112
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,230
 the SWAT Team shot him. 

113
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,360
 From which he ended up dying. 

114
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,820
 However, I got to know that there was a different truth 

115
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,260
 behind what happened that day. Team Leader Do Kang Woo... 
     

116
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,830
 had planned to die,  

117
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,130
 and he wanted me and the team members to remember him   
    

118
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,760
 as a monster in order to save us from the pain.  
    

119
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,000
 Thoughts of me being unable to save him 

120
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,100
 have been causing me physical and emotional pain, all this time. 

121
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,860
 It was unfortunate that Agent Jin Seo Yul was transferred to  

122
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,350
 the Seongwon Cyber Investigation Unit. 

123
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,640
 Detective Park Joon Ki, who got to know my secret hearing abilities, 

124
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,790
 now leads the Dispatch Team. 

125
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,220
 Detective Koo Kwang Soo and Agent Park Eun Soo 

126
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,060
 have remained with Golden Time and continue to give their best. 

127
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,630
 To arrive even a second quicker to the caller 

128
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,210
 and defend the front line against crime, 

129
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:56,010
 it's because it's something our Golden Time Team still must do. 

130
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,660
Yes, this is Kang Kwon Joo.

131
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,600
 Director, you asked for the IP address of the threatening email you received before. Right? 

132
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,810
 We found out. It came from China's Jilin Province using a VPN. 

133
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,500
 They usually are used for voice phishing scams. 

134
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,990
 I think your personal information was leaked and that's why you received that fraudulent email. 

135
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,150
Oh, that's a relief. Thank you.

136
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,860
 It was just voice phishing? 

137
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,910
  
 Award Certificate being accepted by Inspector Kang Kwon Joo. 

138
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,640
With a strong sense of duty, you all have done your duty faithfully,

139
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,420
particularly by resolving an important case with your swift response,

140
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,710
you all have contributed greatly to law and order.

141
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,450
So we give you this award for being a "Best of the Best Team".

142
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,890
I'll take the picture now.

143
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,310
Your GT (Golden Time) Team is very popular these days.

144
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,620
So many people are asking for you to come and help them.

145
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,150
Take ten days off for a good rest

146
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,850
and go somewhere that's more comfortable.

147
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,870
You all worked very hard.

148
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,780
- Thank you. 
 - Great job.

149
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,130
Good job.

150
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,790
What is this?

151
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,660
- Oh, don't do this! 
 - Congratulations!

152
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,540
It was an honor to work with you!

153
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,660
This is a present from all of us.

154
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,010
Thank you. You are the ones who worked

155
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,720
so hard at the center. I will never forget it. Thank you.

156
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,990
- Thank you. 
  - Thank you! 

157
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,840
We're the ones who are thankful. Go on back to your work.

158
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,220
- We love you! 
 - Thank you!

159
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,270
- Fighting! 
  - We'll visit! 

160
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,650
Wow, I never thought this day would come!

161
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,060
We're now popular and even got an award certificate.

162
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,550
Shouldn't we have a dinner gathering?

163
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,980
Fine. It'll be my treat. Let's go.

164
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,630
Let's go!

165
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,350
Center Director, just a second.

166
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,660
What is it?

167
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,250
To be honest, you asked me to look into the case related to the Circus Man email threat,

168
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,750
so I posted an inquiry on the main office's notice board.

169
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,300
Yesterday, I got a call from a senior who works at the Yangyeong City Police Station.

170
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,670
 C-Circus Man... 

171
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,000
 said... 

172
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,730
 that... 

173
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,720
 She hears... sounds that... 

174
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,860
 other people... can't hear. 

175
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,020
He said Circus Man did it?

176
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:51,120
Yes. And he said it's a woman who has really good hearing.

177
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,550
The email you received on the 24th from Circus Man said, "25, where the sheep sleep forever".

178
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,000
What else did it say?

179
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,090
Red crest.

180
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,480
Hold on.

181
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,420
 Yangyeong City: A city in Gangwon Province. Name derived from letters, Yang for sheep and Yeong for  comfort. It looked like a place where sheep would sleep comfortably. 

182
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,760
"A place where sheep sleep forever..."

183
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,680
He used the exact meaning of Yangyeong City in Hanja.

184
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,480
Then the red crest is...

185
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,460
Joo Beom Tae's grandfather ran a poultry farm before he was murdered.

186
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,760
 Center Director, we have another Code Zero case. 

187
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,200
 Biduk District, Biduk 3-dong, 140, Gaewon Shopping Center, 3rd floor. 

188
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,360
 We got a terror threat call saying that they installed a bomb inside the Gaewon Cinema. 

189
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,120
All right.

190
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,190
It sounds like you should head over there.

191
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,010
- Yes, Ma'am 
 - Okay, Ma'am!

192
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,510
We don't have time now, so I'll head to the scene right away.

193
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,090
Agent Park, check if there was another case similar

194
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,530
to the Yangyeong case around September 25th.

195
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,530
I understand.

196
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,590
This is the Center Director. I plan to head to the crime scene and Agent Park Eun Soo will be in charge here and on standby. 
  

197
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,500
   

198
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,890
Move!

199
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,150
Excuse us!

200
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,260
Hurry!

201
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,350
This way!

202
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,700
- What about EOD?  (Explosive Ordinance Disposal)  
 - EOD and the Special Forces Unit are still on their way.

203
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,020
We don't have time. We will find the bomb.

204
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,890
Please make sure that no citizens enter the crime field.

205
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,700
I understand.

206
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,490
Do you hear anything?

207
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,960
   

208
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,200
   

209
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,100
 It's there. 

210
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,260
   
  

211
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,860
 Zoom in. 

212
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,720
 Wave detected. 

213
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,990
 I will open it. 

214
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,990
 What's this? 

215
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,860
 The ticking sounds dull. 

216
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,510
 There seems to be a tapping sound as well. 

217
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,120
It's probably going to be a toy.

218
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,810
It looks like someone pulled a prank.

219
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,070
 This is Alpha. I've checked it out. Case resolved. 

220
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,390
What a psycho!

221
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,360
Just because of this one freak, we couldn't help those who really needed saving!

222
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,530
Well, it's a relief that it wasn't a real bomb.

223
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,780
That's true. I can't believe our last call was a prank call.

224
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,150
This is Dispatch 2.

225
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,620
Bidukdong Explosive case closed as a prank.
    

226
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,660
Yes, Agent Park.

227
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,480
 Center Director, I think I found a parricide case that matches up with Joo Beom Tae's case. 

228
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,990
What?

229
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,910
I'll head over there right now.

230
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,810
 The Circus Man... said... 

231
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,260
 she hears... 

232
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,330
 sounds that other people can't hear... 

233
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,810
    

234
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,910
 So this guy with the skull tattoo is the number two in the LA drug cartel, right? 

235
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,720
That's right.

236
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,130
He's done so many street shootings that he'd even kill kids just walking back home.

237
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,960
Anyhow, we need to catch this guy in order to know their boss's hideout.

238
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,580
Could he be planning on doing a shooting here as well?

239
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,260
My goodness, it's embarrassing that you guys call yourselves cops.

240
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,290
Are American gangs any different from ours?

241
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,690
They're all the same thugs.

242
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,850
Did you look into that Team Leader dude?

243
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,910
LA Olympic Police Department. He's a team leader specializing in gang crimes.

244
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,360
 Name: Derek Jo. Age: 39. His nickname is Mamba. 

245
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,250
 - Mamba? 
 - It's a species of poisonous snake from the same family as cobras. 

246
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,000
 He's great at catching LA-based thugs. 

247
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,150
 He's good at Korean so he doesn't need an interpreter. 

248
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,420
Mamba? Looks like just about anyone is a poisonous snake.

249
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,410
They're here. They can't do both.

250
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,850
Team Leader Jo? I'm the Team Leader of Team 1 from the Seoul Region Investigative Unit.

251
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,440
Crash-3 10-97. We're good to go with firearms, Captain.

252
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,920
 Twenty staff... 

253
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,100
Eighty customers, two exits.

254
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,690
One front and one in the kitchen.

255
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,190
The target is drunk. Seems to be carrying a Glock.

256
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,040
 We'll go after the target. 

257
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,330
 The Korean team should cover their own people. 

258
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,510
On my count... we go in.

259
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,830
Roger that, Captain.

260
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,660
I'm Lieutenant Lee of the LAPD Gang Crimes Unit, Chad Lee is my name.

261
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,530
Captain is on stand-by inside.

262
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,960
We are going to go after the target. Your Korean team should protect their own.

263
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,550
Are you kidding me right now?

264
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,990
Do you think we're here as your lackeys?

265
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,360
- If you've agreed to cooperate— 
 - Wait a minute.

266
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,960
He's the gang's number two.

267
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,320
If he pulls out his gun in this tight space, there'll be no way to escape.

268
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,090
That's why Captain checked it out in advance.

269
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,530
 Target is on the move to the bathroom. Move in. 

270
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,860
We're moving in.

271
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,260
W-We should go in as well.

272
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,050
   

273
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,330
Cap...

274
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,660
You take the lead.

275
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,920
Nick, Matthew. Cover the back.

276
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,060
Hey, Captain Jo! I'm the Regional Investigative Team 1...

277
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,690
Let's leave the introductions for after we catch him. Why don't you move the people to safety first?

278
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,800
Hey there!

279
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,220
We're in the middle of catching someone wanted by Interpol, so start getting people out of here.

280
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,430
And don't turn off the music!

281
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,920
Move back, bro!

282
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,290
- The bathroom. 
- Back!

283
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,560
Get back!

284
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,680
- Freeze! 
 - Get down now! Get down! Get down!

285
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,530
- Hands behind your back! 
   - Hands-- 

286
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,560
Don't move.

287
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,160
No...

288
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,920
Mamba?

289
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,050
- Hands behind your back. 
 - Turn around!

290
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,900
Who are you?

291
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,670
Don't move!

292
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,650
Drop your weapon. Put it down. Don't make me shoot you.

293
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,640
Don't you move, bastard!

294
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,690
You take one step and I'll blow his head off!

295
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,860
Go ahead.

296
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,550
Try me.

297
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,940
- You don't think I'll do it? I'm not playing around!

298
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,500
Are you crazy?

299
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,480
You're safe here in Korea, huh?

300
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,690
Here with the Korean police? I'm going to kill you!

301
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,170
Okay.

302
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,250
Ricky... let go of the hostage and we'll talk.

303
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,280
But...

304
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,710
if anything happens to him,

305
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,510
you're a dead man.

306
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,020
I ain't ending it like this!

307
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,240
No! No!

308
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,320
Put down the gun!

309
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,730
Darn it!

310
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,850
Drop your weapon!

311
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,230
Are you all right?

312
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,310
Come on!

313
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,060
You can't win...

314
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,660
My family will find your mute sister

315
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,380
and cut her all to pieces!

316
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,490
Die, Mamba!

317
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,480
Keep talking, I can break you now.

318
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,430
You'll never see daylight.

319
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,680
Ricky Gonzales...

320
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,540
you're under arrest for murder,

321
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,770
overseas escape, taking hostages.

322
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,370
You have the right to remain silent.

323
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:11,160
And anything you say will be used against you in a court of law.

324
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,370
Take him!

325
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,650
You're crazy!

326
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,840
This isn't America, Cowboy!

327
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,730
My lawyers, they'll never let this go.

328
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,220
Under US-Korea Agreement, I've got immunity here.

329
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,260
- Let me go! Let me go! I'm going to kill you! 
 - Come on!  Let's go!

330
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,490
Captain!

331
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,350
I'm sorry, but he tried to shoot at me all of the sudden. I mean, what was I supposed to do?

332
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,240
How can you fire when there are a hostages around?

333
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,830
When you get back, you'll be assigned to the civil service office.

334
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,320
You can't do this to me, Captain! Not desk duty, all right?

335
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,230
You know how hard I've worked for this team.

336
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,370
It's over.

337
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,920
Captain, wait! Captain, wait!

338
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,350
Easy, easy! Matt! Matt!

339
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,410
Have you seen the captain go back on his words?

340
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,630
No.

341
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,590
- Derek speaking. 
 - I heard there was an incident?

342
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,110
At least the hostage is safe. 
    

343
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,660
Just remember,

344
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,180
the Koreans only agreed to allow us to take custody of Ricky Gonzalez.

345
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:26,090
We allow them to investigate this Korean criminal that snuck into the US.

346
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,570
 Wrap it up quick and get home safe. 

347
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,620
As soon as Ricky is passed down,

348
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,690
I'll take the night flight to return.

349
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,080
All right, we'll get the extradition process underway.

350
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,630
-  Good job. 
   - Yes, Sir.

351
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,530
   

352
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,340
Lisa, where are you?

353
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,080
(I'm still discussing it, I'll call you later.)

354
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,430
Where's the kid you sponsored?

355
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:07,900
(We went our own way after Jung Hoon and I ate together.)

356
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,410
(So, I came here to the sponsoring office.)

357
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,660
Why did you leave without saying anything?

358
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,600
Go back to the hotel first.

359
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,540
We'll take a flight to LA tonight, okay?

360
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,450
(No! Brother, do you think I'm still a child?)

361
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,240
(Mind your own business!)

362
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,130
Lisa! Li—

363
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,100
   

364
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,570
It looks like you didn't tell your brother.

365
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,650
   

366
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,690
His name is Jo Gyu Cheol.

367
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,560
He's 56 years old. 
     

368
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,640
As I mentioned over the phone,

369
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,260
the DNA and the genetic marker bundle found were similar.

370
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,460
This is Jo Gyu Cheol's address.

371
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,620
Seoul.

372
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,860
Seoam.

373
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,020
Sanggae-3-ro.

374
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,790
Soowan Apartment Building 2 Unit 403.

375
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,010
   

376
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,030
Did you say it was in the 2020 case files?

377
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,820
Yes.

378
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,240
Unlike Joo Beom Tae's case, it seems that he accidentally murdered

379
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,600
his father who was a high school teacher.

380
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,690
However, there is a clear point where they're similar.

381
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,900
In both cases, the murder occurred the day after you received that email.

382
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,530
Then...

383
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,680
Circus Man told me

384
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,260
through that email

385
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,920
that she was going to keep killing.

386
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,330
   

387
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,680
   

388
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,320
Is that the third email?

389
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,830
There is a voice recording this time.

390
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,100
 What on Earth are you doing with those ears? 

391
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,750
 Am I too far away, that you can't hear? 

392
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,140
 I'll give you one last chance. 

393
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,050
Twenty-five.

394
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,420
The Angel's Town.

395
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,890
Unit 206.

396
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:14,520
 I figured you would be lacking time this time, so I added a hint especially for you. 

397
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:20,230
 Don't forget, that we were born with a very special destiny. 

398
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,270
 She purposely made a sound only I could hear and sent it through the email. 

399
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:38,650
 Is it to make me believe that she has the same abilities that I have? 

400
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,380
Center Director, are you all right?

401
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,050
Yes. It was the voice of a woman in her thirties.

402
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,290
The clues are 25, Angel's Town, and Unit 206.

403
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,550
Angel's Town is probably a reference to a district name.

404
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,020
Director!

405
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,050
Sanggae is written as "Sang" meaning high and "Gae" meaning in between.

406
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,960
It means to be stuck in between the sky, so it is also called Cheonsa (Angel) City.

407
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,940
Although it isn't Angel's Town.

408
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,030
Sanggae City...

409
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,110
Team Leader Park! The email Circus Man sent,

410
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,640
wasn't a prank email. I'm certain it's a foreshadowing of a real murder.

411
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,920
Are you saying the insane person who sent you that email is really a murderer?

412
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,840
Yes, to be more precise, there's a high chance she's a woman with great hearing abilities.

413
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,590
We're coming to the station!

414
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,550
   

415
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,710
   

416
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,420
Well,

417
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,180
I don't have a brother.

418
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,930
Among my cousins,

419
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,540
nobody was sent out for adoption.

420
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,460
   

421
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,560
Get out! I'm tired!

422
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,930
Damn it!

423
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,980
Poor people should just die, that's what it is, isn't it?

424
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,150
 She definitely said she's going to give us another hint. 

425
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,850
 What is it? 

426
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,880
 I figured you would be lacking time, so I added a hint especially for you. 

427
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,430
 Don't forget. We were born with a very special destiny. 

428
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,600
 I figured you would be lacking time, so I added a hint especially for you. 

429
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,580
 If we get out of here... 

430
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:10,080
 Don't forget. We were born with a very special destiny. If we get out of here, there is nowhere else to go! 

431
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,620
There is nowhere else to go.

432
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,240
"There's nowhere else to go."

433
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,850
That sounds like a protest against a demolition.

434
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:26,220
Agent Park, look for places under reconstruction or demolition in Sanggae City.

435
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,570
   

436
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,530
No, Sanggae City actually has a problem of a declining population.

437
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,860
It doesn't have any demolitions on a large scale.

438
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,610
I definitely heard displaced people.

439
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,730
Where could it be?

440
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,590
   

441
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,170
People displaced due to demolished homes in the Sanggae neighborhood? 
    

442
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:57,110
Center Director, this morning in the Sanggae neighborhood, Seoam district in Seoul, there was a protest held by displaced residents.

443
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,090
 Angel's Town. Unit 206. 

444
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,950
There is a reason why she said Angel's Town and not Angel's City.

445
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,360
Because it wasn't the city of Sanggae but it was the Sanggae neighborhood!

446
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,290
We were mistaken. We need to contact the local police immediately.

447
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,730
Will they believe something like this?

448
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,000
There's a senior I know from the police academy, in the Seoul Regional Unit.

449
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,940
You should call Team Leader Park and tell him to come quickly.

450
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,920
Yes, Ma'am.

451
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,220
Yes, Senior.

452
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,220
What? Parricide?

453
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,700
 It might be hard to believe, 

454
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,430
but a family serial killer sent me a warning notice about the next murder by email.

455
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:39,140
She will make it look like a teenage boy killed his family.

456
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:43,860
 There is a high probability the location is the Sanggae neighborhood, Unit 206, where people are protesting against the demolition. 

457
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,500
Senior, you need to hurry.

458
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,180
Detective Kim, was there a case of parricide in the Sanggae neighborhood today?

459
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,890
Hold on.

460
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,210
No, there isn't.

461
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,430
We haven't received anything on our end.

462
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,660
Okay.

463
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,120
I'll let you know as soon as I know something.

464
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,720
Who were you talking to?

465
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,930
You should know her. It was Pungsan's Golden Time Team Center Director.

466
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,260
 Ah, that voice profiler or something? 

467
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,950
But why was she asking about a parricide?

468
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:17,320
She seems to have received some kind of prank email.

469
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,810
   
 Why are you doing this? 

470
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:41,430
Shut up!

471
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,130
Everyone's leaving

472
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:47,260
but we're the only ones left! Nobody else is left!

473
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,590
 My life's a mess because of you! 

474
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,950
 It's all your fault! 

475
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:01,110
 "I'll stop drinking, we can become rich." 

476
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:04,310
 They're all talk and chase after false hope. 

477
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,730
 In reality, you are about to be kicked out of the apartment that will get demolished soon. 

478
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,980
 Your parents have only been lying to you, too. 

479
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,020
 With the weapon I told you about, 

480
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,070
 cut off their fingers with the dirty wedding rings, 

481
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,520
 take a picture for proof. 

482
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,990
 Then everything will end. 

483
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,990
Please...

484
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:37,970
Darn it!

485
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,550
Why are you doing this?

486
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,830
Please shut up.

487
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:58,520
- Hyun Min, please. 
 - I said to shut it!

488
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,270
Just do as I say!

489
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:05,240
If I take a picture, it'll all end!

490
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,090
I know you're having a hard time.

491
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:12,430
So let's talk about it together. Please!

492
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,270
What do you know?

493
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,090
What do you know? Huh?

494
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:23,980
You say you know everything, but what have you done for me?

495
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,440
What have you done for me!

496
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,020
Please...

497
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,800
- Hey. 
 - Stop!

498
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,750
Please don't!

499
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,440
 - Stop! 
 - No, no! 

500
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,700
Son!  Son!

501
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:07,510
Son! Son!

502
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:14,720
My baby. Son.

503
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,350
- I can't do this. I just can't. 
 - My baby.

504
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,500
I can't do this.

505
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:35,880
♫  Come little boys, come little girls, 
here this is for you, come up here  ♫

506
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,800
♫  Don't run away, don't trust if I... 
 Yeah, this is a nightmare  ♫

507
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:53,830
♫  I taste blood, yeah, it's so sweet  ♫

508
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,830
Please don't kill me.

509
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,890
Hyun Min!

510
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,170
 Hyun Min! 

511
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:38,040
 Hyun Min! 

512
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,740
It's punishment for raising your child pathetically.

513
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,860
Hyun Min said...

514
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,130
that you're an alcoholic

515
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,030
and a loser in this society,

516
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:52,970
but you always acted as if you did so much for him.

517
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,290
It repulsed him.

518
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,120
You don't have to look so scared.

519
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,810
If you promise you'll live a better life from now on, without him,

520
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:05,990
I might let you live.

521
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:10,770
Who are you?

522
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:21,280
I'll kill you!

523
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,870
In the end, people are born alone and die alone.

524
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:31,270
So, why do they try so hard to live together?

525
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,660
It annoys me.

526
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,780
Hyun Min!

527
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,370
   

528
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:15,750
   

529
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,990
    
    

530
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:28,380
   

531
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,440
   

532
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,300
Hello, this is the emergency hotline.

533
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,520
Hello?

534
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,460
Why won't you—

535
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,920
What's wrong?

536
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,520
The caller can't speak.

537
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,060
- Pull up the phone registration. 
 - Okay.

538
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,250
   

539
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:54,800
   

540
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,740
   

541
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,760
   

542
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,860
It's a phone activated by an American company and is currently roaming.

543
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,380
It shows that the phone belongs to Lisa Jo.

544
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,520
Transfer the call to me.

545
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,120
Okay.

546
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,350
 Caller? 

547
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,760
Please calm down.

548
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,240
If you are in a situation where you cannot talk or if you are disabled,

549
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,390
can you send a text message to 112?

550
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,380
   

551
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,960
   

552
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,720
Senior, I was just told by an American caller with a language disability that

553
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,800
she saw a family murdered in Soowan Apartments, Building 2, Unit 206.

554
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,390
Currently, the caller is hiding in a closet in Unit 205.

555
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,960
Okay. Transfer the call to me.

556
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
Okay.

557
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:53,830
   

558
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,890
   

559
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,800
 This is the Center. 40 Sanggae 3-ro, Seoam district, Seoul,  
    

560
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,170
 Soowan Apartment 2, Unit 206, 

561
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,940
 a family was reported to have been murdered by a robber. 

562
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:44,200
If it's Sanggaedong Soowan Apartments, isn't that in the next block?

563
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,140
 The caller is Jo Seung Ah, English name Lisa Jo. 

564
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,940
 She is currently hiding from the suspect in Unit 205. 

565
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,180
What did he just say?

566
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,480
 The caller has a speech disability. 

567
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,700
Repeat it for me. What did he say?

568
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,550
 Any patrol in the area, please respond. 

569
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:03,140
An American named Jo Seung Ah saw a robbery and murder case and is in hiding.

570
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:14,200
   

571
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,580
   

572
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:44,970
See? If you don't hide well,

573
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:47,480
your hair will show. 
   (A Korean hide-and-seek game phrase.) 

574
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,680
   

575
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,630
(Do you think you will get away with this?)

576
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,320
(My brother is a cop.)

577
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,070
Interesting.

578
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:12,720
Usually, people ask for mercy in this situation.

579
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,150
You're brave and bold.

580
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:23,250
But a child who tattles on others

581
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,650
should be ripped to pieces.

582
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,080
If not,

583
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:32,920
even a good child like you...

584
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,880
will gain a very bad habit.

585
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,630
 I'm Team Leader Park Hyun from the Seoul Regional Unit. 

586
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,610
  I'm from Sanggae Patrol Station 2. Let's go upstairs. 

587
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:49,550
Seal off the entrance.

588
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:51,450
Yes, Sir.

589
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,450
Lisa.

590
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,160
What is this?

591
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,360
- Look around. 
 - Okay.

592
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,180
LIsa.

593
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,120
Lisa, I'm here.

594
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,040
Cap.

595
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,090
What about your sister? Did you find her?

596
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,400
She's not there.

597
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,670
It looks like she's been kidnapped.

598
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:11,950
This is Regional Unit 1.

599
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:16,170
It looks like the suspect has kidnapped the caller and fled the scene.

600
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:20,160
But isn't this situation very similar to what Center Director Kang Kwon Joo said before?

601
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,060
That's true.

602
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,540
Yes, Senior.

603
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,780
Yeah, Center Director Kang. I think something bad has happened here.

604
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,170
What did you say earlier? Tell me everything you know.

605
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:39,350
What did the person who sent the email say?

606
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,250
Has there been another incident?

607
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:45,770
Yes, a kid died in Unit 206 with his parents.

608
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,400
The witness was kidnapped.

609
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,890
The witness was kidnapped?

610
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:53,770
Who are you talking to?

611
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,600
A police junior.

612
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,650
She says the suspect sent an email talking about their murder plans.

613
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,950
Give it to me.

614
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:04,840
I'm Derek Jo, a captain in the LAPD. Please tell me everything you know about the suspect.

615
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,600
My sister has just been kidnapped.

616
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,210
The suspect, right now,

617
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,590
is a serial killer who has killed two families in the past.

618
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:13,070
Every 3 months, on the 25th, they murder someone.

619
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,070
There is a probability that the suspect is female.

620
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:17,020
Are you for certain?

621
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,490
The suspect has been emailing me their murder plans

622
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,380
under the name "Circus Man."

623
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:25,550
They have been showing a pattern of murdering whole families, disguising it as an immorality crime.

624
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,920
-  So?  
 - Tell me your phone number.

625
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,610
Then I'll call you, so don't hang up

626
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,790
and stay on the call line while on the search.

627
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,450
Yes.

628
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,640
Sir. Please keep me updated during the search.

629
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,070
Please hurry.

630
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,030
Okay, I got it.

631
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:13,670
I think she ran away this way. The road splits.

632
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:16,040
Let's split up and look. I'll go this way.

633
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,830
Wait, Captain, Team Leader Jo.

634
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,840
Take this.

635
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,610
Okay.

636
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,620
We're going this way.

637
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,920
Excuse me.

638
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,730
Wait.

639
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:03,070
Stop!

640
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,230
I'm tracking down the suspect. It seems to be a woman.

641
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,820
Stop right there!

642
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,920
Stop!

643
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:50,170
It's so exhausting.

644
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,640
- Move! 
 - What's his problem?

645
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,920
Stop there!

646
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,730
 The car engine sound is getting louder. 

647
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:03,260
 Detective, a car is approaching.  

648
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,760
- Oh no. 
 - Oh my gosh.

649
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,470
Are you okay?

650
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:23,340
I'm fine.

651
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,170
 I lost her. 

652
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:32,660
Could you tell me how the roads are split?

653
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,210
There's a Sanggae Transport Garage on the right.

654
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:36,830
A big road on the left.

655
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:38,060
 I see street lights. 

656
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,270
 It's just an alleyway. 

657
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,880
 There was an accident. 

658
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,070
 There was an accident, what should I do? 

659
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:59,710
Detective, does Seung Ah usually carry around some sort of alarm with her?

660
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:02,110
Yes, I gave it to her.

661
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:06,680
She can't scream for help even if she's in danger. She always carries it around.

662
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:12,790
 I can hear the sound from somewhere near. 

663
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,560
 Town Bus 3625 is closing down. 

664
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,510
It's the road to your right.

665
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:25,250
Wait! Are you saying that you can hear Seung Ah's alarm from there?

666
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,330
It's hard to explain but please trust me.

667
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:31,870
 It may even be Seung Ah's call for help after having escaped from the killer. 

668
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:34,710
I don't know what you heard that makes you say this,

669
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:37,580
but if you're wrong, my sister will be in danger.

670
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,880
Can you take responsibility for your words?

671
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,160
Please!

672
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,330
I know best what the culprit is thinking.

673
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,250
There's no time.

674
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:51,830
I'm sure she's alive.

675
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:00,150
Senior, I think Seung Ah is in the Sanggae Transport Garage.

676
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,130
Please send back-up.

677
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,240
 Seung Ah. 

678
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:23,800
I've reached it.

679
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,450
I don't hear anything, which way is it?

680
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:31,590
The sound got louder but it's still weak.

681
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,460
You still don't hear it?

682
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,940
 Hurry up! 

683
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:08,290
Wait.

684
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:11,670
The sound is getting weaker. It's the opposite direction.

685
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,690
Can you hear it?

686
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,980
It's near there.

687
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,680
 I hear the alarm sound coming from there. 

688
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:41,370
It's coming from a sedan in front of me.

689
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:45,430
Detective, please be careful.

690
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:12,770
 The only thing here is the alarm.  

691
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:16,000
 Did she lure me in using the alarm sound? 

692
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,250
 Does she already know I would contact the detectives on the scene? 

693
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,300
What the--

694
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,660
Jo Seung Ah.

695
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,660
Jo Seung Ah!

696
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,980
Team Leader!

697
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,840
That...

698
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,190
 What's this sound? 

699
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,620
What is this noise?

700
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,270
Is it...

701
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,310
 It's LPG gas. 

702
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:25,370
 Detective, it's a trap! 

703
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:26,730
 Gas is filling up. 

704
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:29,610
Run away immediately!

705
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:38,130
No!

706
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:52,800
 This is Regional Unit 1. 

707
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:57,010
 A dead woman was found in a junk shop at 54 Sanggae-3-ro, Seoam district 

708
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,740
 near the Sanggae Transport Parking Lot. 

709
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:01,700
 A young female with long black hair wearing a long dress 

710
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,070
 was tied up with Christmas lights. 

711
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:06,550
 She might be the caller that reported the family murder at Soowan Apartment, Sanggae-dong. 

712
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:08,450
 There is a high possibility it's Jo Seung Ah. 

713
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:12,030
 Requesting an ambulance and back-up from local stations. 

714
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:23,850
 That a family was able to leave this world at the same time. 

715
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:26,680
 They won't know how great of a blessing that is. 

716
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,050
♫  Don't run away  ♫

717
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:29,660
 I brought down that blessing. 

718
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,060
♫  Yeah this is a nightmare  ♫

719
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:33,250
 All you need to do is accept it. 

720
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,230
 Whether it is hell or Heaven where they land, 

721
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,830
 how happy must they be, going there together. 

722
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:45,450
♫  Yeah, it's so sweet  ♫

723
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:04,340
   

724
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:17,580


725
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:28,670
   

726
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:34,370
 Just do your job right. Don't meddle when you aren't capable.  

727
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:36,080
 I saw someone running that way. 

728
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,650
 I'm certain that guy is the culprit. 

729
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:39,390
 I'm sure he's the culprit. 

730
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:42,870
 It looks like your profiling was wrong this time. Leave this to us and get some rest. 

731
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:45,750
 We got the picture of the suspect and you need to take a look at this. 

732
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,880
 - Get on the ground. 
 - It's a trap. 

733
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,220
 Guys! Drop your weapons! 

734
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:53,850
 - Get on the ground. 
 - I thought you'd trust me of all people. 

735
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:56,250
 I must've been wrong.
