1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,490


2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,090
   

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,400
     

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,060
   

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,850
   

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,810
   

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,810
   

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,080
   

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,210
    

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,870
Are we really going to go see my kiddo?

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,420
That's what I said.

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,820
We cannot feed my kiddo a peach.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,200
If he eats a peach, a big problem happens.

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,520
That kiddo! Kiddo! All this bull!

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,320
Shut your mouth. Making too much noise.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,360
That kiddo, you will be able to meet him shortly. Okay?

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,790
When I meet my kiddo, I'm going to tell on you.

18
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,540
I understand now.

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,500
Why Kang Seok Chun killed Kim Eok Man, and why Kang Man Ho took Kang Seok Chun away.

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,350
Let's play a game. Come here.

21
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:33,890
If you close your eyes and count to ten, your kiddo will come to you.

22
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,060
Right here.

23
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,300
Really? All right.

24
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,260
- One. 
 - This kind of bull crap

25
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,370
- is over as of now. 
 - Two.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,660
- A being who didn't do his job as the head of the house, only to become a burden, 
 - Three.

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,890
- has such a long life span. 
 - Four.

28
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,290
Five.

29
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,400
You said you wanted to see Mom, right?

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,620
Six.

31
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,220
- She's in hell, 
 - Seven.

32
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,310
...so go and...

33
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,100
Eight.

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,240
...and meet up well. Okay!

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,250
Nine.

36
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,740
Are you saying it could be Kang Man Ho's dead father?

37
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,420
Yes. It looks like Kim Eok Man went to the nursing home

38
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,650
and brought Kang Seok Chun out to threaten Kang Man Ho,

39
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,170
but Kang Seok Chun accidentally killed Kim Eok Man.

40
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,150
Then why would Kang Man Ho kidnap his own father, Kang Seok Chun?

41
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,900
It was suspected that he killed his mother for her life insurance claim

42
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,830
and his father, Kang Seok Chun, has the same kind of life insurance.

43
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,620
It looks like he is trying to kill Kang Seok Chun

44
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,170
in order to cover up his immoral crimes.

45
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,290
Please go to the mountain that is 4 kilometers in the direction of the Saga Patrol Office.

46
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,510
Currently, Team Leader Park and Detective Jo are looking for him.

47
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,820
   

48
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,290
 A 44 year old Coach Jung... 77-year-old stepfather... 
   `

49
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,350
 A teen who posted a selfie after a fatal hit and run... 
   

50
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,580
 A female corpse in her 60's was found in the apartment...  
    

51
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,820
 The father is pleading not guilty.  
  ...She was continuous sexually assaulted by her father. 

52
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,360
   
   

53
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,930
   

54
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,720
    

55
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,250
Seeing as the engine is still on, it looks like he was planning on fleeing right after taking care of his father.

56
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,000
He wouldn't be able to go far with an old man.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,790
- Let's search the area. 
 - Okay.

58
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,070
Here!

59
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,670
These are Kang Man Ho's clothes.

60
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,390
There's blood here.

61
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,870
What is this?

62
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,340
By the marks on the ground, two people were dragged away.

63
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,570
Let's go see.

64
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,090
These tire marks. It looks like it was a truck.

65
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,120
They put them in the truck here.

66
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,330
 This glasswort only grows in salty areas. 

67
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,020
 A place where large amounts of glasswort can grow. 

68
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,380
 The salt that was on Kang Seok Chun's clothes... 

69
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:06,030
I think Kang Seok Chun was taken to a saltworks area, not a nursing home.

70
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,580
This truck was probably used there as well.

71
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,590
Director, did you hear anything weird when you were listening to Director Choi?

72
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,150
I think something happened to Kang Seok Chun and Kang Man Ho.

73
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,320
I think they were taken to a saltworks area.

74
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,790
Check if that Director Choi Gong Pil is really the director of Vimo Nursing Home.

75
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,700
- Agent Han, check if there is a Choi Gong Pil at Vimo Nursing Home. 
 - Yes.

76
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,520
There are many nursing homes with the name Vimo,

77
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,130
so I think it will take some time.

78
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,200
Look into it.

79
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,180
Bul Sang Doo. Sang Doo!

80
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,200
Director!

81
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,620
- He's not there. 
 - What about that bastard, Dong Cheol?

82
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,290
I can't get in contact with him either.

83
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,230
Hey! How'd it go?

84
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,820
What?

85
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,700
   

86
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,040
   
   

87
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,010
Gosh.

88
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,100
Old man.

89
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,130
Instead of doing nothing, try and get this off of me.

90
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,390
Get it off!

91
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,760
Damn it.

92
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,370
Hey, Bixby, call the police.

93
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,610
Bixby! Bixby! Police!

94
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,530
Old man, do you have any thoughts?

95
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,000
   

96
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,300
Do something before we freeze to death!

97
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,700
Quickly! Do something!

98
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,860
Quickly! Quickly!

99
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,430
- This is 112 Call Center— 
   - Is there anything you know how to do? 

100
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,910
- Hello? 
  - Anything? 

101
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,890
     

102
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,990
Director, I got a call from Kang Man Ho.

103
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,330
But I can't hear anything because of the background noise.

104
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,580
- Put me through. 
 - Okay.

105
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,760
Mr. Kang Man Ho? Kang Man--

106
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,670
- Agent Park, find the GPS coordinates. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

107
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,340
I have the base station location tracking, but the location keeps changing, so I think it will take some time.

108
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,630
Try to find them as soon as possible.

109
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,530
Kang Man Ho, can you hear me?

110
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,670
 Hey, you old man. 

111
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,220
 Why didn't you die, huh? 

112
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,090
 Why? 

113
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,860
Why'd you live and mess up my life like this?

114
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,570
Because of you,

115
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,690
I got kidnapped and it looks like I'm going to die, too!

116
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,100
 Do you think I'll regret abandoning you? 

117
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,790
 Nope. Never. 

118
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,450
 Never. 

119
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,250
 What is he saying? 

120
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,810
 Abandon? Regret? 

121
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,830
Son of bitch.

122
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,070
Do you have the right to do this to me

123
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,820
after robbing me of ₩10 million in coins? 
  ($10,000) 

124
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,760
 ₩10 million in coins? 

125
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,770
 His voice is wavering severely and is very stiff. 

126
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,730
I don't see anything wrong with this.

127
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,990
 Is there any chance...   
 Agent Park.

128
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,420
Can you look up the details on Kang Seok Chun's missing persons report

129
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,060
- from 2017? 
 - Yes.

130
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,100
I've sent it to you.

131
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,000
   
   

132
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,410
   

133
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,840
It just so happened that on the day Kang Man Ho was emigrating,

134
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,280
he brought his father on a trip to Vimo Island.

135
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,240
He filed a missing person report claiming that he lost his father in front of the Biduk rapeseed blossom field

136
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,510
and left for New Zealand.

137
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,650
Two years later, he returned and filed a death certificate.

138
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,030
The life insurance.

139
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,370
It wasn't a trip for his father. He had planned on abandoning him from the beginning.

140
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,350
Agent Han, in March of 2017,

141
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,530
about ₩10 million of cryptocurrency was deposited in an account.

142
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,890
- Can you find the account it was deposited in? 
 - Of course.

143
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,220
No matter how great cryptocurrency is, in the end, people always convert it to cash.

144
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,630
To do that, you need to confirm your identity.

145
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,110
   
   
    

146
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,510
Throughout February and March, Kang Man Ho deposited money

147
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,300
to a deep web website called Kkotsangyeo  (Flower Coffin)   through DropCoin.

148
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,620
   

149
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,330
It says they will send off your parents quietly and comfortably.

150
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,940
They even have different methods.

151
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,480
It sounds like they trap the parents in a closed area until they die

152
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,730
and then file the death certificate in return for money.

153
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,590
These bastar--

154
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,110
are complete trash.

155
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,270
I'll put up the link.

156
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,230
   

157
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,910
 What is that? 

158
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,510
 Do something! 

159
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,480
 I'm going to leave here. 

160
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,520
 I can't live with your father anymore. 

161
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,150
 All right. Be quiet. 

162
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,620
 Are you thinking about taking him to New Zealand, too? 

163
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,020
After killing his mother, Kang Man Ho planned to emigrate with the life insurance money

164
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,020
and he needed a way to take care of his father, who was in the early stages of dementia.

165
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,420
If he used a similar method, his insurance provider would know.

166
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,220
   

167
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,210
Then he came across Kkotsangyeo on the deep web.

168
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,760
So he wired the coins and went to Biduk Nursing Home with his father.

169
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,560
In case he failed, he must've locked the coins so they couldn't be cashed out.

170
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,210
   

171
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,840
 Father, I'll send you to a nice place. 

172
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,410
 It's really nice here. 

173
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,390
 Father, isn't it nice being outside? 

174
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,330
 It's so yellow. 

175
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,020
 Smell the flower. Is it nice? 

176
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,980
 Father, it's nice right here. 

177
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,710
 Let's take a picture. 

178
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,840
 I'm taking it. One, two... 

179
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,070
 How nice. 

180
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,510
 Father, I need to use the restroom. 

181
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,610
 You have to stay here. Wait here. 

182
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,220
 Don't go wandering off or anything! 

183
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,620
 Honey, I'm done. 

184
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,160
 Okay. I'll be there soon. 

185
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,100
And he abandoned his own father

186
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,790
in a field of rapeseed flowers.

187
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,440
 Wait. Two years later, Kang Man Ho returned 

188
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,950
 and got the life insurance using the papers he got from Kkotsangyeo. 

189
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:09,160
 But Detective Jo said that he thinks Kang Seok Chun was taken to a saltworks area. 

190
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,020
 What if... 

191
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,470
My kiddo is waiting for me.

192
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,500
I have to see my kiddo.

193
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,850
My kiddo...

194
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,010
is waiting for me.

195
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,650
I have to go see my kiddo.

196
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,950
 Wait. I keep hearing something that sounds like a fan inside a cargo compartment. 

197
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,370
 It sounds like the motor of a refrigerator. 

198
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,700
These bastards...

199
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,240
Do they think I'll die like this?

200
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,300
 I'm not going to die. 

201
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,590
 A refrigerated truck? 

202
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,700
You've never been helpful to my life.

203
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,640
It looks like Kkotsangyeo sold you off somewhere else.

204
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,950
You should have died instead if you were going to live that way.

205
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,250
Since when did you have such a burning will to live?

206
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,170
My kiddo is waiting for me.

207
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,860
I have to meet my kiddo.

208
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,090
 - Stop saying that over and over again!  
 - Excuse me, Kang Man Ho!  

209
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,260
Mr. Kang Seok Chun, are you okay--

210
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,120
Agent Park, look for a refrigerated truck on the Tamseogu Coastal Road.

211
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,450
Yes.

212
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,560
Agents. Aside from the agents receiving emergency calls,

213
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,870
I need everyone to look for any live footage of a refrigerated truck on the Tamseo Coastal Road.

214
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,160
- Yes. 
 - Yes, Ma'am!

215
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,860
Director, I've found it.

216
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,190
There is a refrigerated truck making a left turn on 64th Street near Soondeokro.

217
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,720
Past that is Duwandong Saltworks.

218
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,570
Agent Han, look into Duwandong Saltworks.

219
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,980
Understood.

220
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,890
This is Center. The refrigerated truck that is presumed to have been used to kidnap Kang Suk Choon and Kang Man Ho

221
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,800
is currently on Duwanro 40th Street headed toward the Duwandong Saltworks.

222
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,120
 Dispatch Team and any police officers in the area are to go to Duwandong Saltworks. 

223
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,650
Understood.

224
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,490
Please preserve the site here.

225
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,360
Yes.

226
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,560
Can you do this to me after taking

227
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,940
₩10 million worth of coins from me?

228
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,210
I have to go meet my kiddo.

229
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,870
My kiddo is waiting for me.

230
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,450
I have to go meet my kiddo.

231
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,000
 When Kang Seok Chun was talking about his "kiddo," 

232
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,730
 his neck muscles tensed up a lot. 

233
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,140
 as if he was holding back his tears. 

234
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,140
 What is it? 

235
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,860
   

236
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,800
   

237
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,900
Make sure the pigs don't get out of there.

238
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,350
Understood.

239
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,710
You're going there with me.

240
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,510
Bring them out.

241
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,480
So you're saying he gave them money in order to get rid of his father

242
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,430
and that organization sold Kang Seok Chun to the saltworks?

243
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,210
 Detective Jo was right. 

244
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,730
In 2017, he abandoned his father and filed a missing person report.

245
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,480
Then he filed a death certificate and received the life insurance money.

246
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,570
I will send over the picture of Kang Seok Chun that Kang Man Ho submitted to the police.

247
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,570
Because of Kang Seok Chun's age, it is dangerous for him to be in the refrigerated truck for an extended period of time.

248
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:10,560
Please hurry. I will share any information we find about Duwandong Saltworks.

249
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,520
Understood.

250
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,610
How could a person change so much in 4 years?

251
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,220
This is Dispatch 1 with information for the Duwan Police Department.

252
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,090
The culprit who faked his identity as the director of a nursing home,

253
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,630
has kidnapped an 80-year-old senior and a 50-year-old man.

254
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,820
Please send as much help as possible.

255
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,590
The driver's seat.

256
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,370
   

257
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,140
Looks like they've already left.

258
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,010
This is DIspatch 1. We found the refrigerated truck that Kang Man Ho and Kang Seok Chun were in.

259
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,130
We will search the area.

260
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,540
We will go this way. You guys go that way.

261
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,110
Director, there's something strange about Duwandong Saltworks.

262
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,910
It used to be very successful,

263
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,270
but five years ago, a typhoon destroyed everything and it got sold over to someone else.

264
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,810
After it was sold, salt production decreased a lot, too.

265
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:01,070
Whatever salt they sell is mostly for industrial purposes.

266
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,510
I don't know if that is enough to keep it running.

267
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:08,670
Most saltworks have at least 20 workers but there are only 5 here.

268
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,850
An old man like Kang Seok Chun isn't even registered—

269
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,750
The manager of the saltworks is Choi Gong Pil.

270
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:20,330
Isn't that the same name as the Director of Vimo Nursing Home?

271
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,350
Director Kang! Choi Gong Pil has a criminal record

272
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,250
and so do his listed employees, Kim Kwang Goon and Park Dong Cheol.

273
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,630
This is the Center. Choi Gong Pil is the owner of the saltworks. He has 7 past criminal convictions.

274
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,600
His listed employees have past records of violence.

275
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,190
It must one of the people accompanying Choi Gong Pil on the field earlier.

276
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,140
Their guts are giving me shivers.

277
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:46,590
If he was impersonating the director of a nursing home, there should be others at this saltworks besides Kang Seok Chun.

278
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,310
Don't move!

279
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,630
We are the police! Where is the elder?

280
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,590
 What are you doing here? What do you want? 
(in Tagalog) 

281
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,190
What is he saying?

282
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,330
Do you speak English?

283
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,670
Where is the elder? 
  (Tagalog) 

284
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,410
I don't know. 
  (Tagalog) 

285
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:32,270
Hey! If you don't tell me now, I'll arrest you.

286
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,560
Is that what you want?

287
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,400
No arrest! No arrest!

288
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,450
We see him sometimes, but we don't know where he is.

289
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,910
After work, all we do is go home and sleep.

290
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,940
Those bastards purposely picked foreigners who don't speak Korean.

291
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,190
This looks like a place for concealing an illegal business.

292
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,110
What is in that warehouse?

293
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,720
I have no idea, but it's always closed.

294
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,480
It smells like pigs and rotten meat.

295
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,890
 What is this smell? 

296
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,230
 It looks like the elder made a mistake. 

297
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:27,760
 The smell on Kang Seok Chun was closer to slowly  rotting meat than a "mistake." 

298
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,720
I think Kang Seok Chun is over there.

299
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,080
Let's go.

300
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,360
What are you doing! Hurry and pick it up!

301
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,930
Until when are you going to do this!

302
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,370
Get finished with all of this by today or you're all dead! Do you understand? 
    

303
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,530
If you want to see your children's faces, then hurry up and do it!

304
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,540
I said to rub harder! Harder!

305
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,690
- They are using the elderly as workers. 
 - What is this?

306
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,590
Why is there someone missing?

307
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,660
What is this? Did you come to play?

308
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,180
- Get up! 
 - Excuse me...

309
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,410
Please give me something for pain.

310
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:04,030
There is no place where

311
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:07,000
it doesn't hurt.

312
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,930
This grandma is so dirty!

313
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,570
You're slacking off, why the hell would you want drugs for?

314
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,060
- Don't move! 
 - Stay still!  We are the police!

315
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,760
This bastard!

316
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:33,340
Let go! Let go! I just did what I was told!

317
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,040
Stay still, you trash-like bastard!

318
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,180
This is Dispatch 1. We found the elderly in a warehouse.

319
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,550
They were using the saltworks to hide the fact that they were using rotten imported meat

320
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,980
and selling it as an expensive domestic by putting on new stickers.

321
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,830
Please send backup from the Duwan Police Station.

322
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,040
We are the police. Are you all right?

323
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,740
Police? No...

324
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,150
My son didn't send me here! Don't arrest him.

325
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,770
My son is such a filial son!

326
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,150
He is not a bad kid at all!

327
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,810
We are not here to arrest your son. Don't worry.

328
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,070
We are not going to arrest your son.

329
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,330
I was doing well at the nursing home my son picked.

330
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,290
Then suddenly I was kicked out and brought all the way here.

331
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,770
My son was probably short on money

332
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,590
and couldn't make the payment.

333
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:14,720
Even if I called him, it wouldn't go through.

334
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:22,130
My son will come and get me soon. Soon!

335
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:37,120
Please calm down. Well...

336
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,880
Perhaps, do you know this person?

337
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,150
That's the "kiddo" old man. He was preparing food earlier

338
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:51,170
and a man came to get him with the director following him.

339
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,170
He sleeps there.

340
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,710
- Go straight! 
 - Where are we?

341
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,080
- Go straight! 
 - Where...

342
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,060
Walk properly!

343
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,160
Go up there! Hurry.

344
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,580
The "kiddo" old man didn't talk much

345
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,210
and spent his time drawing.

346
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,490
The grandma next to him talked so much.

347
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:25,560
Was it two days ago? Her daughter came to pick her up.

348
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,210
Her daughter came?

349
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,830
It was a good day, so they went out.

350
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,910
A good day?

351
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,250
Can you explain it more?

352
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,880
We call the day that our children come and pick us up a good day.

353
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,120
That day, the director gives us a bath

354
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,810
and even lets us brush our hair.

355
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:51,620
Anyway, that grandma got hit by that rascal for a few days

356
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,720
and couldn't get up.

357
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,860
But her daughter came, so it was a relief.

358
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,260
Where did she take her?

359
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,250
There, behind the mountain.

360
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,570
- Then that "Good Day" is— Let's go quickly! 
 - Let's go!

361
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:16,660
Grandma, if you stay here, other police officers will pick you up.

362
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,030
- So, stay here for a bit.  
 - Yes.

363
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:53,650
 That's right. It wasn't butterflies, it was flowers. Dozens of yellow flowers. 

364
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,140
 Perhaps... 

365
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,170
 Please check what is behind the mountain by the saltworks. 

366
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,380
 It's the place where the elderly are brought on what they call their "Good Day."  

367
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,550
Understood. Agent Park, show me the satellite view of the mountains in the vicinity of the Duwan saltworks.

368
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,510
Yes, understood!

369
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,250
Detective Jo, there is a cliff at the very top of the mountain.

370
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,550
I think they are going to do something bad to the elderly.

371
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,810
Let's hurry up and go!

372
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,220
Why? Why?

373
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,540
Wh-Wh-What are you doing?

374
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,370
Four years ago, I-I was your customer! Don't you know?

375
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,470
I don't know.

376
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,160
Okay. Please save me. Please.

377
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:52,560
Please save me. If you want money, I'll give you any amount you want.

378
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,260
President... President!

379
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:03,190
Geez, this bastard.

380
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,420
My little one is waiting for me.

381
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:12,360
I have to go meet my kiddo! I've got to go!

382
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,640
This old man is so annoying today, dammit!

383
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,780
- Stay still! 
 - My kiddo is waiting for me! My kiddo is waiting for me!

384
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,730
I have to go meet my kiddo!

385
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:28,650
- Stop there! 
 - Hey, rascal! Stop there!

386
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,370
Choi Gong Pil.

387
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,620
Don't shoot me! If you are going to shoot, go shoot those bastards who abandoned their own parents!

388
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,190
I fed and gave housing to those abandoned elderly.

389
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,810
What did I do wrong?

390
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:48,340
What? I'll make sure you can never say those garbage words again!

391
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:53,540
Hey, Detective Jo! Stop it! Stop!

392
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,910
Stop it! Stop it!

393
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,990
Stay still! Choi Gong Pil,

394
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:02,580
you are under arrest for attempted murder and human trafficking. You have the right to hire a lawyer.

395
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,830
- You have the right to remain silent. 
 - Are you all right?

396
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:09,950
Kang Man Ho, we know that you abandoned your father and forged his death.

397
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,350
Kang Man Ho! Kang Man Ho!

398
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:19,000
- Drop the knife! 
 - Act rashly and this old man dies!

399
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:26,030
He is not my parent, nor am I Korean.

400
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,880
I have my citizenship now, so I'm going to get judged In New Zealand.

401
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,320
So get out of my way now.

402
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,230
Don't come!

403
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:39,490
Act rashly and this old man dies!

404
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,960
Kang Seok Chun,

405
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,800
are you going to keep helping your son?

406
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,220
What bullshit is this?

407
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,320
Your father does not have severe dementia.

408
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,640
He knows exactly what you are saying!

409
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,550
And what you are doing.

410
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:09,120
 This is Dispatch 3. Director, did you say that Kang Seok Chun got lost in a field of rapeseed flowers? 

411
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,800
 It was Biduk Rapeseed Flower Field. 

412
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,880
 Kang Seok Chun most likely has a mild cognitive impairment. 

413
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,240
 Alzheimer's is a degenerative dementia that develops more slowly than this type of disorder 

414
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,990
 and it helps to write something down every day. 

415
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,990
 Also, organizing your items and cleaning up after yourself 

416
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,430
 is not possible for a patient with dementia. 

417
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,660
 On top of that, he clearly remembers the rapeseed flower field that he went to with his son. 

418
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,180
 When he met Kang Man Ho again, 

419
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,410
 he most likely recognized him. 

420
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:40,180
 Why did you live and mess up my life? 

421
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:46,080
 Do you think I'll regret abandoning you if you do this? 

422
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,430
 Nope. Never. 

423
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:55,700
 My kiddo is waiting for me. 

424
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,110
 I have to go meet my kiddo. 

425
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,920
 That's why Kang Seok Chun's voice 

426
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,240
 sounded so sad. 

427
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,710
 Even though he was repeating his words, 

428
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:10,660
 he was getting hurt by Kang Man Ho's words. 

429
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,910
 My kiddo. He's waiting for me. 

430
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,020
 My kiddo. 

431
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,870
 I have to go meet him. 

432
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:26,820
 Kang Seok Chun was understanding every word. 

433
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,640
You're spouting nonsense in order to convince me.

434
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,410
We're saying that your father knows that his own son abandoned him.

435
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,340
He lived his life knowing that,

436
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,800
but Kim Eok Man came and tried to kill you,

437
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,700
so your father killed him!

438
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,570
No! That's not true!

439
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,490
There's no way this person did that.

440
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,310
Do you know what kind of father he was to me?

441
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,190
Stay still if you don't know.

442
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:55,430
This person did all sorts of bad things to me

443
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,120
in order to take money from me.

444
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,340
 Man Ho's father. Not this. 

445
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,400
 Not this. 

446
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,470
 What? Not this? 

447
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,200
 This wife of mine can't do anything to help my business. 

448
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,070
 Hey. Go get me some money. Huh? 

449
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,500
 Find some money! 

450
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,620
 Dad! What are you doing? Stop hitting Mom. 

451
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,110
 How dare you talk back! 

452
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,800
 Leave it! 

453
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,110
 It's your dad. 

454
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,550
That woman who called herself my mother was the same.

455
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,210
Parents? I don't have any.

456
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,820
These people abandoned me first!

457
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,980
I'd rather have been born as an orphan than live with these two people!

458
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,000
What? Orphan?

459
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,510
Because of people like you, the real victims are facing discrimination.

460
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:06,570
Hasn't Mr. Kang Seok Chun already repented for his actions

461
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,600
by hiding the truth of what happened four years ago?

462
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,550
Do you think you are a parent just because you gave birth to me?

463
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,180
All the things this person did to me!

464
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,280
Please disappear. Get out of my life!

465
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,200
- Kang Man Ho. 
 - Let go!

466
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,280
Come here, you bastard!

467
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,790
Look. Look!

468
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,010
Look with your own two eyes.

469
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,160
Look at how the father you hated is looking at you.

470
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,240
Look closely.

471
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,120
That is a parent.

472
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,240
That is what a parent is.

473
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,720
Be thankful you have a parent in the first place.

474
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,360
If you are at least human.

475
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,020
I get it. I understand.

476
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,500
Let go. I understand, so let go!

477
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,430
No! Man Ho! No!

478
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,270
No!

479
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,940
Man Ho, you can't.

480
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,390
You can't ruin your life because of me again.

481
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,300
 I can't live with your father anymore! 

482
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,040
 All right! Be quiet!  

483
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,940
 My head is already filled with so many thoughts.  

484
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,240
 Were you thinking of bringing him to New Zealand?  

485
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,430
 Father, I'll send you somewhere nice. 

486
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:48,700
 Why did you live and mess up my life? 

487
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,980
 Do you think I'll regret abandoning you? 

488
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,380
 Nope. Never. 

489
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,560
Kang Man Ho! Put down that knife!

490
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,560
You can't shoot him.

491
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,950
Please don't shoot him.

492
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,000
Detective.

493
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,330
Dad was wrong.

494
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,440
I'm to blame.

495
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,940
Don't forgive me.

496
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,760
Detective, my kiddo did nothing wrong.

497
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,490
 This is all my wrongdoing. 

498
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,030
 I put a nail in Man Ho's heart 

499
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,450
 and made it bruised. 

500
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,980
I killed my wife, Kim Eok Man, and everything else,

501
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,980
so please take me.

502
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:47,530
In return,

503
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,820
please save my son.

504
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,810
Shut up!

505
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:57,600
Stop putting on an act! I said stop putting on an act!

506
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,110
Why?

507
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:04,890
Why do you have to act like a father now?

508
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,060
Why?

509
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,040
Why?

510
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:31,060
Kang Man Ho, you are being arrested for attempted parricide and murder.

511
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,520
Are you okay?

512
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,060
Kang Seok Chun, you are being arrested for the murder of Kim Eok Man.

513
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:45,900
You have the right to a lawyer and the right of refusal.

514
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,560
Let's go.

515
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,380
Get up.

516
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,760
This is Dispatch 2.

517
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,040
Kang Seok Chun and Kang Man Ho have been arrested. The Kang Seok Chun and Kang Man Ho kidnap case is closed.

518
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,400
   

519
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,650
Phone.

520
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,960
Why do you keep asking for the phone?

521
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,160
Just let me have a phone call with my son in New Zealand!

522
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,560
We already tried, but your son doesn't want to receive your calls

523
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,010
because he's embarrassed.

524
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,690
Stop lying.

525
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:34,690
My son isn't that type of person. He's a good kid!

526
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,350
Man Ho!

527
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,670
Man Ho.

528
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,010
Man Ho! Don't say a word!

529
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,590
Your father will take care of everything!

530
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:47,580
I will make sure you get out of here!

531
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,080
Man Ho! Don't say a word!

532
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,580
Man Ho!

533
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:55,350
Parents always give everything to their children.

534
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,270
Good work, everyone.

535
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,550
Good job today.

536
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,660
I'll go ahead.

537
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,440
Bye.

538
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,270
He has seemed irritable since yesterday.

539
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:17,050
He's overwhelmed trying to catch his sister's killer. He must be exhausted

540
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,490
running around with us, too.

541
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,500
Let's go.

542
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:30,000
Sir! Here.

543
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,530
This is what you meant yesterday, right?

544
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,620
Okay. Get back to work.

545
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,210
Yes, Sir.

546
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,810
   

547
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:01,450
   

548
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,750
 My mom would never kill herself! 

549
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,630
 She wouldn't leave us like that! 

550
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,430
 A whirlpool ghost dragged my mom into the water! 

551
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,090
 It drowned her to death! 

552
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:15,060
 Throwing a fit won't bring your mom back to life! 

553
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:19,200
 Maybe it took your mom because you kept crying! 

554
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,400
 You're still a jerk. 

555
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,040
 I drove a  stake through that guy's heart- 

556
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,510
 twice. 

557
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,900
   

558
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:36,010
Hello? Kang Kwon Joo speaking.

559
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,010
Hi, Kang Center. This is Yang Bok Man.

560
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,070
Yes, Chief Yang.

561
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:44,020
Remember how I asked if Detective Jo ever lived on Vimo Island before?

562
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,930
I finally remember.

563
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:51,790
 I was the officer on the case... 

564
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,130
of his mother's suicide.

565
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:58,110
I was new to the force at the time...

566
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,480
 Check thoroughly. 

567
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,510
 Check thoroughly. 

568
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,620
 Do you hear me? 

569
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,280
   

570
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,370
   

571
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,640
 I asked around in the town where she used to live and they said she worked at a restaurant.  

572
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,460
 That's right. She has two kids. 

573
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:41,630
 Anyway, she told me once when she was drunk that her kids have different dads.  

574
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,770
 Seriously. 

575
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:47,680
 Why did she come all the way here to die, instead of doing so in her own town? 

576
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,810
 Process it as a suicide. 

577
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,370
 Mom! 

578
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,230
 Mom! 

579
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,210
 Who is this kid? 

580
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,770
 - I told you she had kids. He's her eldest son. 
 - Mom. 

581
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:09,980
 The second child is a daughter. 

582
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,400
 I hear they have different dads. 

583
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
 - Take him away. 
 - Yes, Sir. 

584
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,260
 My mom would never commit suicide! 

585
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,220
 She wouldn't leave us like that! 

586
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:21,030
 A whirlpool ghost dragged my mom into the water! 

587
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:24,220
 It drowned her to death! 

588
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:26,980
 - Uncle. 
 - Mom! 

589
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,510
 There's a swirl-shaped tattoo on her arm just as he said. 

590
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,810
 It's swollen since she just got it. 

591
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:36,190
 Officer Yang, we have outsiders die like this all the time. 

592
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:39,670
 Mister! You believe me, don't you? 

593
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:43,470
 The whirlpool ghost put that on her! 

594
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:47,160
 My mom didn't have that! 

595
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,930
 - Go! 
 - Mom! 

596
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:52,970
 No! 

597
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,290
 No! 

598
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,380
 Let's go! 

599
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,430
 Mom! Mom! 

600
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:04,160
The kid who was crying sadly back then was Detective Jo.

601
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,250
So that's why...

602
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:11,330
If you tell him I remembered what happened twenty-eight years ago, he'd understand.

603
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:14,900
 Tell him to go to the "Divers" restaurant. A lot of cops go there. 

604
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,860
 I'm sorry I'm asking you to do this. 

605
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:20,840
Not at all. I want to help.

606
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,500
Wait a minute. You guys haven't been properly introduced to each other.

607
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,710
Back when Jin Hyeok was with us, Dae Sik was on the same team.

608
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,990
We've greeted each other a couple of times.

609
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,270
It's been a while.

610
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,550
Gosh, why are you guys so awkward?

611
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:44,260
Didn't you both work so hard together to catch Mo Tae Gu?

612
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,630
Stop talking about the past as if it's a good memory.

613
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,990
This little...

614
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,390
   

615
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,580
Agent Han, what's up?

616
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,000
Detective Jo isn't picking up his phone.

617
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,230
I've been looking into Circus Pierrot like he told me to.

618
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:07,490
I think a just caught a big fish.

619
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:08,570
 You need to come and see it. 

620
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,790
All right.

621
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,280
The both of you should catch up.

622
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,830
That guy who came in, instead of Seo Yul, is making a big fuss about finding something.

623
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,550
Let's go.

624
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,160
Have you returned to the Dispatch Team for good?

625
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,130
No, it's just for a while. I'm not in a position to return full-time.

626
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:46,090
I was the one who recommended you to Director Kang.

627
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:50,270
So, if you're going to do this job, then make sure you do it well.

628
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,830
So what you're saying is you set a trap then someone suspicious approached you?

629
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,520
Exactly.

630
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,280
Look here. The atmosphere between the communities on here is really cut-throat.

631
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,720
They have really good security measures and any way of tracking the members' information is blocked.

632
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,320
So I set a trap for him to come and find me.

633
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,000
I made a character based on all of the victims' backgrounds.

634
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,090
Currently, 17 years old. 
    

635
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:24,460
He's a troublemaker who got suspended two years ago for school violence and car theft.

636
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,790
He was supposed to go to juvie but

637
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:29,330
his mother got him a really good lawyer and he barely just got out.

638
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:32,250
He has a bad relationship with his mother because she favors his brother.

639
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,440
I was worried if it was too perfect of a cover he wouldn't bite the bait.

640
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,570
So I made him complain about his allowance that was cut off about a month ago.

641
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:42,020
So? Did he fall for it?

642
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,090
Ta-da!

643
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,710
 -  : Aren't you sick of using the ax in this game? Didn't you consider pretending to be a robber and steal the money from your mother?  
- Is she a police officer?

644
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,020
 -  : It won't be easy because of the CCTV's. I'm a police officer. I might be able to help you out...  
 - She's a police officer.

645
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,700
What's the matter?

646
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,740
Chief Yang wants to buy you a meal as an apology for what happened yesterday

647
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:07,120
and he has something to tell you in private.

648
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,020
I'm fine.

649
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,980
He said he remembered...

650
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,180
what happened 28 years ago.

651
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,600
He asked me to tell you that.

652
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,150
I won't force you to go.

653
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:31,520
This place has the best perch.

654
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,670
You won't find this taste at any other restaurant in the country!

655
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:38,100
I don't think you called me out here to show off.

656
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,860
Please don't waste any more time and cut to the chase.

657
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,910
I'm sorry for what happened yesterday.

658
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,740
Both of us were in the wrong yesterday so it's all good.

659
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:51,960
Is there anything else... you have to say?

660
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:57,970
How impatient.

661
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:00,590
You're definitely Korean.

662
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,620
Excuse me for a minute, I'm going to use the restroom.

663
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:12,600
Just stay. As you said, we're partners.

664
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,060
You should hear this as well.

665
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:31,420
Your mother's case...

666
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:35,760
was my first case.

667
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:47,550
I never forgot the look in the eyes

668
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:50,140
of the kid

669
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:56,310
who insisted his mother didn't commit suicide.

670
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:05,920
If I were to make a shameful excuse, on this island where everyone is family,

671
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,420
I couldn't stand up to my senior, who was also my uncle.

672
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:16,750
What you said yesterday wasn't wrong.

673
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:22,420
My belief that my family wouldn't do anything wrong

674
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:26,260
did indeed make me go blind.

675
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:36,370
Which is why I'm going to fix my mistake. See for yourself.

676
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:40,690
After all, even garbage can be recycled.

677
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,660
If you're going to ask for forgiveness then it should be to my mother, not me.

678
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:54,350
Of course, doing that wouldn't erase the things that happened to my family.

679
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,970
I'll get going.

680
00:52:55,970 --> 00:53:00,380
I felt the same way as you.

681
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:11,160
Even in my eyes, it was most definitely a homicide case.

682
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:23,000
Truth be told, I heard it at the crime site.

683
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,190
Through the radio...

684
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:34,450
 Uncle! I think we've made a mistake. 

685
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:37,750
 -I think this was a homicide— 
 - What the hell do you know? 

686
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,720
 Stop meddling in this case. 

687
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,320
 Just go back and finish up the drunken accident report. 

688
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,730
 Stop investigating this case. 

689
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:52,060
 These orders are from the higher-ups so just cover it up. 

690
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,430
 Yes, Sir. 

691
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:03,850
"Orders from the higher-ups to cover it up?"

692
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,980
He's doing stonemasonry in the Sonang village now.

693
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:15,870
Isn't Sonang Village the tourist spot popular for its stone souvenirs? 
    

694
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:18,270
It's not just any tourist spot.

695
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:21,550
It's a traditional village built by

696
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,860
a respected elder on our island.

697
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:28,600
People who have nowhere to go are taken in there and they live like a family.

698
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:33,520
According to our tradition, it's a place where people can go to ask for help if they have any problems.

699
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,490
I don't need an explanation of how great that place is!

700
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:38,620
Because I'm going to suspect everything.

701
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:43,020
What's important is that my mother's death was a murder

702
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:48,610
and someone in a raincoat put a whirlpool tattoo on her wrist.

703
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,610
Do you understand?

704
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:57,400
If we're done here, then I'll leave.

705
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:03,140
Oh, and I'm not going to trust you again over something like this.

706
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:06,220
People don't change that easily.

707
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:09,040
Detective Jo!

708
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:14,050
I think he needs more time.

709
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,660
You should accept his apology at least.

710
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:31,040
You and I, both, are unfamiliar with this island.

711
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,400
Just trusting each other and cooperating won't be enough for this case.

712
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,860
Did you think I came here to make friends?

713
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:40,640
Sharing information is fundamental when working together. You told me that...

714
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,960
I haven't overcome the trauma that comes with being a police officer. You were right.

715
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,930
But looking at you now, I think you're the same as me.

716
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,780
If there really is something you are hiding from me,

717
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,430
then  I don't think this cooperation can go on any longer.

718
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:13,600
Twenty-eight years ago, I saw...

719
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:17,030
my mother's killer.

720
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,290
My mother's case and Seung Ah's case are definitely connected somehow.

721
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,670
   

722
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:44,110
Even then it wouldn't have been easy

723
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:46,700
for a single mother with two kids.

724
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,360
For our sake, my mother would take on any job that she could get.

725
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,490
 Enjoy your meal. 

726
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,850
 Come here. 

727
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,750
 Pour me a drink. 

728
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,550
 Come on, sit. 

729
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,010
 Gosh, what's this? 

730
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:58,560
 All right, I'll pour you some. 

731
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,720
 How pretty. 

732
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,970
 Have some, sir. 

733
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,800
 My darlings. 

734
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:16,200
 You were sleeping, Seung Ah? 

735
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,390
 Seung Ho. 

736
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:22,940
 My darling Seung Ho. 

737
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:26,500
 You smell of alcohol. Go away. 

738
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,660
 My darlings, come here. 

739
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,990
 Let's sleep hugging each other. 

740
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,780
 Come on over here. 

741
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,340
 My sweet children. 

742
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:40,680
 One day she said she got a lot of money for helping someone in the village. 

743
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,510
 She was very happy. 

744
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:44,270
 But then, that night... 

745
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:46,130
 Seung Ho! Seung Ho! 

746
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,720
 Seung Ho, wake up. Quick. 

747
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,520
 Seung Ah! Seung Ah! 

748
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,740
 Wake up. Hurry. 

749
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,270
 Mommy, are we going somewhere? 

750
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:57,480
 Seung Ho, get Seung Ah up. 

751
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,200
 We need to get out of here. Make it quick. 

752
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,930
 Get up. Now. 

753
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:08,740
 Hurry. 

754
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,200
 Stay in there. 

755
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,000
 Go on. 

756
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:17,040
 You have to stay hidden. 

757
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,460
 Whatever sounds you hear from outside, don't come out. 

758
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,340
 Got it? 

759
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:27,030
 You're her older brother, so 

760
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:29,640
 you'll protect Seung Ah. Right?  

761
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,270
 You can promise me that you will. Right? 

762
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,330
 I didn't see anything! 

763
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:52,360
 I didn't see anything! I really didn't! 

764
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,300
 I won't tell anybody about it. 

765
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,460
 I didn't see a thing. 

766
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,950
 I really didn't. Please! 

767
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:00,820
 Oppa. 

768
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:04,730
 No... 

769
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:06,480
 Please... 

770
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,480
 I didn't see a thing! 

771
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,320
 Help! 

772
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,170
 Let me live. 

773
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:17,810
 I really didn't... 

774
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:27,960
 Someone kidnapped my mother. 

775
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,190
 That was the last I saw of my mother. 

776
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,010
This killer with multiple personalities

777
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,140
has some connection to who killed my mother.

778
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:42,230
And there is something more to this that we don't know.

779
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:45,000
It must have been difficult for you to tell me this.  Thank you.

780
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:50,280
I'm going to catch them no matter what and

781
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,000
make them go through the exact pain

782
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:56,340
that my mother and Seung Ah went through.

783
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:00,220
Exactly the same.

784
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,960
Please... Please...

785
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,630
A little bit more.

786
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:30,300
Just a little bit more. Please.

787
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,800
   

788
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,900
What is this place?

789
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,520
What's this?

790
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,010
No.

791
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:16,200
No.

792
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,030
Please.

They say snitches should have their mouths ripped apart.

800
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:17,600
It's a bad habit.

801
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,990
Let me live.

802
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:33,050
Please.

803
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:36,390
Please, don't kill me!

804
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:43,370
I wanted to play more with you. But I can't help it, we have a rule, you see.

805
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:50,360
Someone who finds out about us... can never live to tell the story.

806
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,010
Yes, Detective Gu?

807
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:09,420
What?

808
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:19,450
How noisy.

809
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:24,260
How much longer are you going to lecture me!

810
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,700
Please.

811
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:37,390
Please.

812
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:43,390
You must have risked your life to escape from us.

813
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:46,890
All right.

814
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:51,550
I'll give you

815
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:55,260
an extra painful death.

816
01:08:55,260 --> 01:09:01,010
Circus Man approached the fake character made up by Agent Han?

817
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:32,720
   

818
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:40,640


819
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:48,090
   

820
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:51,430
 This user's personal information is private. He's online now, so I'm tracking him in real-time. 

821
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:55,590
 He fell into the cauldron by mistake. 

822
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,400
 Save me! 

823
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,060
 It is coming. 

824
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:01,790
 Everyone is a part of one big family. 

825
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:04,300
 That's what we think, here at Sonang Village. 

826
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:08,290
 - Let's watch her receive true education.
 - Let's make it legendary. 

827
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:11,330
 How dare they set up a trap for me? 

828
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:16,020
 Who the hell are you? Why are you using children so cruelly? 

829
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:20,390
♫  No way to go  ♫
