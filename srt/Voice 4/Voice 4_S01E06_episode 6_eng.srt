1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,470


2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,990
   

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,490
   

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,120
   

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,750
   

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,250
   

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,790
    
   

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,060
   

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,180
    

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,560
I ran the voice analysis as you requested,

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,260
 the female voice found in the e-mail 

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,470
 and the male voice from the video clip are identical. 

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,220
However, one person's voice sounding both male and female perfectly

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,330
is nearly impossible.

15
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,420
What was that exactly... I mean, please explain it so I can understand.

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,440
So what I'm saying is that Circus Man

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,000
may have both a man and a woman

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,290
living in one body, at the same time.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,250
What?

20
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,370
 Why not just lock him up somewhere? Why did you bring him here? Don't you know he is a prosecutor? 

21
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,290
 He is probably searching this island trying to find us. 

22
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,050
 Won't you shut your mouth! Just whose fault do you think landed us in this crappy situation! 

23
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,750
 If you hadn't sent that e-mail to that bitch Kang Kwon Joo... 

24
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,930
 God, give it a rest, both of you. 

25
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,760
 The end result is the same either way. 

26
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,280
Dear Director Kang Kwon Joo...

27
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,450
Just you wait and see.

28
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,980
More interesting events will be happening.

29
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:25,320
Very soon, I'm going to make the Siamese twins stab each other with a knife.

30
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,740
   
   

31
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,650
   
   

32
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,660
   
   

33
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,560
    
  A female corpse in her 60's was found in the apartment... 

34
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,280
   
  ...She was continuous sexually assaulted by her father. 

35
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,090
   
   

36
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,210
   

37
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,750
There was a horrific murder a few years ago at the San Jose River in America.

38
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,830
 Among the suspects, a person with night blindness was excluded. 

39
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,510
Come to find out, the personality with great vision was the one that carried out the murder.

40
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,890
 There's research that shows among multiple-personality disorder cases, a person can sound like both genders. 

41
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,280
When the personalities switch, their hormones change as well.

42
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,080
That is why there was no culprit found among the women passengers.

43
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,750
 That is correct. If it were a male, we can explain the fate that Seung Ah and the family met. 

44
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,550
Fundamentally, the male and the female would also differ in their physicality.

45
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,200
Thus, Gong Su Ji is not missing but has been kidnapped by the Circus Man.

46
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,710
 If we can't find her, she's probably hidden somewhere where we won't be able to find her. First, come to the office and let's talk. 

47
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,520
I got it.

48
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,950
 - Are you saying the culprit has a multiple-personality disorder? 
 - Yes. 

49
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:55,330
To put it differently, a multiple-delusional disorder. It refers to the identity splitting into two or more personalities.

50
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,460
It is a disease that causes a split personality while trying to avoid childhood trauma.

51
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,450
Judging from the pattern of teens pretending to murder their families,

52
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,630
there most likely resides deep-seated anger toward families.

53
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,320
It could be a person who has experienced a disbanded family.

54
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,050
At any rate, you are supposing that a bastard with a personality disorder killed a family posing as a woman. Right?

55
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,630
The person could have gotten on the plane as their original male identity.

56
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,110
If it is the voice I've heard, what you suggest is fully possible.

57
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,580
No wonder we couldn't catch the culprit despite having run through all the female passengers.

58
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,050
If so, wouldn't it work by searching for all the male passengers who got on the plane?

59
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,520
Is there any other clue?

60
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,590
I investigated the parking lot (CCTV) of the hospital, but they said that it was broken only on the day of the murder.

61
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,730
If the man in Gong Su Ji's video is the real Circus Man,

62
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,590
then it would be a passenger who sat at the back of business class or a passenger who used the business class restroom

63
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,010
while seated in the economy section.

64
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,110
 I'm inside a plane going to Vimo Island. Once I land... 

65
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,950
♪  My baby, go to sleep  ♪

66
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,850
 What's wrong with him? 

67
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,530
 Knowing that I spoke on the phone with Gong Su Ji, 

68
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,640
 they kidnapped her in the parking lot. 

69
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,420
Uh, Unni!

70
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,120
If you don't want to get hurt, stay put.

71
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,300
 And staged it as if Gong Su Ji 

72
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,270
 had committed suicide. 

73
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,760
Let's cull it down to a male that fits the description from the passenger list.

74
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,310
Then are you saying this punk here is the one that is closest to the Circus Man Detective Jo saw?

75
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,020
Yes. Physical description is the closest match and is a suspect without a definite alibi.

76
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,100
This other suspect, Jang Soo Cheol, is a stonemason craft distributor.

77
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,200
Although not as much as Hwang Mi Na, he is close in size to Director Kang

78
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,550
and his seat was in the business class.

79
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,680
Who is this person?

80
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,810
He is a witness. At the time of the crime, he was at the Doocheondong Hotel where a party for the film festival was being held.

81
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,760
He ran a special effects studio, so I thought he may have spotted something on the plane.

82
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,540
Then that's the end of the story.

83
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,890
That Circus Man guy would then be one of these two.

84
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,920
Then Detective Jo and I will take Hwang Mi Na, Kwang Soo you take Jang Soo Cheol.

85
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,200
Let's bring them in immediately.

86
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,080
    
 Oh, you know Detective Shim Dae Sik. Right? He is going to join this team

87
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,800
as the special judiciary policeman.

88
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,000
He's arrived, so won't you meet with him?

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,570
That's great. As I saw earlier, Dae Sik's skills are still great.

90
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,260
I'll go with you.

91
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,460
That turned out well.

92
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,290
Hey, Shim Dae Sik. You did well. I'm totally assured now that you're here.

93
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,030
A bit delayed, but let me introduce you. This here is Detective Derek Jo.

94
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,890
And this guy here is Detective Shim Dae Sik.

95
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,500
- You saw him for yourself while running around crazy earlier, right? 
 - Yes.

96
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,400
I'm Detective Derek Jo of the Olympic Police Gang Intelligence Unit in LA.

97
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,490
I'm Shim Dae Sik. I appreciated your help earlier.

98
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,910
They say your ID card will be ready tomorrow, so take these for now.

99
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,820
Take them, punk!

100
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,030
I'm with Detective Jo and you're with Kwang Soo to do some legwork.

101
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,030
You've got to work now that you've returned.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,620
Welcome. I thank you.

103
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,830
Oh, I see Mr. Jang went to get stonemason craft supplies.

104
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,050
No, no, no. There's no need for another phone call.

105
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,100
I'll order it personally. 
    

106
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,360
Okay.

107
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,600
Apparently, Jang Soo Cheol went to Hyojindong to pick up merchandise 10 minutes ago.

108
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,760
If he left from Galdong, we can beat him there.

109
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,060
This is mine, but I'm not sure if it'll fit you.

110
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,820
Take it, punk.

111
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,530
   

112
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,870
You suffered a lot of mental anguish, eh? It'll all pass.

113
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,100
You know that the pine caterpillar has to eat pine leaves. 
  (T/N: One has to do what they're best at) 

114
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:01,320
Please don't get ahead of yourself. That bastard who mimics Director Kang, I'll leave right after I catch him.

115
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,170
What the...

116
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,230
Hey, let's go together!

117
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,660
- Are you telling me to take myself off of Gong Su Ji's case? 
 - That's right.

118
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,630
I heard from Chief Yang.

119
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,990
He said Gong Su Ji was cleared of being a suspect!

120
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,030
Anyone can see that case points to a suicide, so let's not get into a rivalry with the District Attorney candidate.

121
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,970
Commissioner, Gong Su Ji may have witnessed the culprit.

122
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,760
That could be the reason for her kidnapping.

123
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,800
I told you! This island has its own customs.

124
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,280
Because all the long-timers here being blood kin, they are much more stoic than you think.

125
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,460
There are plenty of outsiders who have spent their entire lives here.

126
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,670
Let's investigate after having given time for those people to come to terms with Gong Su Ji being missing.

127
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,520
If they find fault with your having visited Gong Su Ji's hospital room,

128
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,170
you won't even be able to continue on with the current investigation.

129
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,960
We are done here. You may leave.

130
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,590
   

131
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,180
What is this place?

132
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,990
And who are those people dressed like that?

133
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,650
Oh, that's the traditional clothing of Vimo Island.

134
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,420
This is Sonang Village. The villagers depend on stonemasonry to earn a living.

135
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,300
It's a tourist spot.

136
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,150
Sonang Village.

137
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,630
They say that the richest guy on Vimo Island

138
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,280
created this village for the people who have nowhere to go.

139
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,900
I'm thinking of learning some stonemasonry and just start living here myself.

140
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,440
I'm slowly getting tired of diving anyway.

141
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,560
Dae Sik, you should do what you're best at!

142
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,400
A detective should do what detectives do. How many times have I told you that?

143
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,100
What?

144
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,730
   

145
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,640
So what you are saying is my Su Ji might have killed herself?

146
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,870
- That's not what I meant. 
 - She would never do something like that!

147
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,170
Who the hell are you to come all the way here and tell me that nonsense?

148
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:23,810
It's not just that. The American detective and that director from Seoul insist that this is a kidnapping case.

149
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,140
It's been a headache!

150
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,360
And he says the murderer that killed an entire family and his sister is on this island.

151
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,550
I heard you.

152
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:42,000
Those mainlanders visited Soo Ji in her hospital room and treated her like a suspect.

153
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,840
The child was already stressed as it was because of that and they added on more so she must have run away.

154
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,390
"Because of that?"

155
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,830
The truth is... Su Ji got caught at an American university

156
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,440
cheating, so she took a break for a while.

157
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,310
She was hospitalized because her appendix burst from the stress that I might scold her.

158
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,830
Right now, she's probably hiding somewhere.

159
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,690
Even during high school, she always caused trouble and worried me.

160
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,000
Anyhow, when the Village Elder finds out where Su Ji is then

161
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,320
you should bring her back without anyone else knowing.

162
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,180
And...

163
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,620
if you'd take this I'll be grateful.

164
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,990
Once I'm back at the district attorney's office,

165
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,460
I'll return your favor.

166
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,720
Gosh, you don't have to do that between us.

167
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,480
Let's go.

168
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,600
Elder, we're here! Elder!

169
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,400
Thank you for agreeing to do this on such short notice.

170
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,130
She was my child as well.

171
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:31,230
That young child committed no crime to deserve such misfortune.

172
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,450
My Su Ji didn't die.

173
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,810
Please help me find her.

174
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,560
All right. Don't worry.

175
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,610
Yeon Hee will find her.

176
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,940
Oh yes!  In a while, Su Cheol will

177
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,950
come to collect some stone masonry supplies.

178
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:56,090
You should then join us for a meal.

179
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,280
Thank you for taking care of my son-in-law.

180
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,650
Yeon Hee, you should get started now.

181
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,440
We need to find Su Ji quickly.

182
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,630
Did you bring the soul-covered clothes?

183
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,460
Yes.

184
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,300
They were found on the scene.

185
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:44,080
I beg of you. I beg of you.

186
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,840
Please, lead us to the place where

187
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,620
our poor Su Ji's soul is now.

188
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,920
She goes by the last name Gong, she's from Vimo, 24 years old.

189
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,900
Soul of Gong Su Ji!

190
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,200
Come back!

191
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,420
Come back!

192
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:46,810
Come back, come back, come back, come bac...

193
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,550
The sea. Isn't that in the direction of the sea?

194
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,380
Save me.

195
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,960
Hey, hey, Yeon Hee.

196
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:08,230
What's wrong? Can you feel the spirit? What is it saying, that this is happening to you?

197
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,870
"Father. Father, I'm so cold."

198
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,360
"I fell into the sea because it looked warm,

199
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,680
but a hand suddenly came out of the water."

200
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,230
"It grasped me and it's pulling me down."

201
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,380
"Father! Father!"

202
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,230
"Save me, Father!"

203
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,930
"Father. The water ghost... The water ghost..."

204
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,220
"The water ghost is behind me."

205
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,450
- "I can't breathe..." 
 - Su Ji!

206
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,410
- Father! 
 - This isn't true, is it?

207
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,520
Is it?

208
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,390
Tell me. Tell me!

209
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,330
Su Ji! Su Ji!

210
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:01,170
Calm down. Calm Down.

211
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,100
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Elder.

212
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,530
But...

213
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,540
Why are you doing this?

214
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,800
Please. Save my daughter.

215
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,460
The spirit says that

216
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,720
the wind coming from outside set a fire that

217
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,350
the young child was not able to endure.

218
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,520
What... What does that mean?

219
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,150
A great misfortune

220
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,060
has come in from the outside.

221
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,710
This island...

222
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,500
will see a greater,

223
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,980
much greater misfortune.

224
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,660
Much greater!

225
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,050
    
 - I was at an interview at Seoul Gender Bar, from 700 p.m. 
    

226
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,990
House Of Queen was hiring, so I went,

227
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,480
but the manager wasn't there.

228
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,960
I waited there for two hours. Eventually, I got pissed and just left.

229
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,390
Do you still have that manager's contact information?

230
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,030
Here.

231
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,870
I'll try contacting him.

232
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,620
If you don't mind, would you try on the black coat hanging over there?

233
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,430
That one?

234
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,530
Can I take it off now?

235
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,590
When did you have that calf surgery?

236
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,140
How did you know?

237
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,060
- It's been about 5-6 months. Why do you ask? 
 - It's nothing.

238
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,020
I called and the manager said she did go for the interview and she waited, too.

239
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,470
Why don't we just question the manager in person?

240
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,500
No, it's fine.

241
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,560
Thank you for your cooperation.

242
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,350
Detective Jo, that's our main suspect. How can we just leave like this?

243
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,750
She has scars from a calf surgery but the culprit ran away really fast.

244
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,750
After such surgery, there's no way she could have run that fast.

245
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,890
What the hell? Did he go to medical college or something?

246
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,030
Hey, wait up!

247
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,500
Oh? Isn't that Jang Soo Cheol's car?

248
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,800
9251. Yeah, it's his car, all right.

249
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,790
Aren't those burn marks on his arm?

250
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,160
When the culprit set up the LPG explosive in the car, he'd used hydrochloric acid.

251
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,490
Let's get him right away.

252
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,790
Mr. Jang Soo Cheol?

253
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,620
I'm Detective Gu Kwang Soo of the Golden Time Team, Vimo Station.

254
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,500
What were you doing on the evening of March 25th, in Sanggae neighborhood, Seoul—

255
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,550
Who the hell are you guys? Can you do this to an innocent citizen?

256
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,440
You shouldn't have run away then.

257
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,790
Mr. Jang Soo Cheol, you are under arrest for obstruction of justice.

258
00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:01,090
- You have the right to an attorney and the right to speak for yourself. 
 - Ouch, that hurts!

259
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,420
- Get up! 
 - It's not me! It's not me!

260
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,550
- Get up! 
 - I told you it's not me!

261
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,210
- I didn't do it! 
 - Stay still!

262
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,460
What do you mean? What did they do to Soo Cheol?

263
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,720
The detectives said  Soo Cheol was a suspect and dragged him away.

264
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,460
Soo Cheol kept insisting it wasn't him.

265
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,110
Those punks!

266
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,070
Hwang Mina seriously...

267
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,290
I swear she was the most suspicious.

268
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,640
But you say it wasn't her.

269
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,910
   

270
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,390
 - Hello?   
 - Hey, Kwang Soo.

271
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,680
 We arrested Jang Soo Cheol and we're coming to the station. 

272
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,130
 He ran as soon as we asked if he was in the Sanggae neighborhood on the 25th. 

273
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,720
 We asked why he ran, but he won't say. 

274
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,130
 Also, he has a burn mark on his arm. 

275
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:42,990
A burn?

276
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,730
 I can't say anything. I won't! 

277
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,700
Let's hurry.

278
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,430
Yes, Sir.

279
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,200
You really won't say why you fled?

280
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,850
I never fled. 
    

281
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,800
Regardless, I won't talk until my lawyer gets here. 
    

282
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,280
Give me a break.

283
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,540
He's watched too many movies.

284
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,050
This will increase your sentence if you turn out to be the culprit.

285
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,280
Jang Soo Cheol,

286
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,690
we've confirmed that you were in the Sanggae neighborhood on March 25th.

287
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,970
Why were you there?

288
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,860
Why did you kill the family and Jo Seung Ah

289
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,070
in the Sanggae neighborhood?

290
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,330
K-Kill?

291
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,040
Wh-Why would I k-kill people?

292
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,570
P-Plus, I don't even know them.

293
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,060
I won't put up with your oppressive investigation.

294
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,420
Jang Soo Cheol!

295
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,100
Look at this burn mark. It's from that night, isn't it?

296
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,400
Tell us the truth.

297
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,550
I work with rocks!

298
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,930
Hydrochloric acid splashed on me when I was washing rocks.

299
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,630
If we use a lie detector,

300
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,100
it'll only make it worse for you.

301
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,080
 He told the truth when he said he doesn't know about the murders. 

302
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,620
 Besides, his voiceprint is different from the one I heard. 

303
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,180
Listen. If you don't cooperate with us--

304
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,400
What do you think you're doing?

305
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,480
 We're getting the suspect's testimony. 

306
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,260
Why are you suddenly so upset?

307
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,970
Did you even know that he's my son-in-law?

308
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,470
You should've told me ahead if you were going to arrest an officer's family member!

309
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,780
We brought him because he's the prime suspect in the Sanggae neighborhood case.

310
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,970
I'm as flustered as you are, but let's talk after we get his statement.

311
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,440
What statement are you talking about?

312
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,440
If he needs to be questioned, I'll do it. Stay out of this.

313
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,940
Soo Cheol, get up.

314
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,470
Get up now!

315
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,970
Are you interfering with our investigation?

316
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,800
Don't you know that it's obstruction of justice?

317
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,070
This is exactly why I didn't want any Americans here.

318
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,520
They abuse their authority however they want!

319
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,430
Compared to the Korean police who care about other opinions without exemption clauses,

320
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,270
I'd say we're way better.

321
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,560
What? Is that all you can say?

322
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,980
Do you think I wouldn't be able to tell if my son-in-law is a murderer?

323
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,860
Team Leader Park! Remove the handcuffs

324
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,920
from his hands right now!

325
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,760
Because a senior officer investigates like this,

326
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,230
that crazy psycho is on the loose on this island.

327
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,710
How dare you!

328
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,560
- Chief Yang, let him go! 
 - Move.

329
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,720
Do you take us for a joke just because you live in the States?

330
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,420
But I've caught way more criminals than you!

331
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,730
I heard you also spoke nonsense to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

332
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,920
Even though your sister died,

333
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:01,080
you can't investigate the case when they've already specified the suspects.

334
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,120
You're still a jerk.

335
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,360
What?

336
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,790
- How dare yo-- 
 - Father-in-Law!

337
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,570
Please forgive me.

338
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,340
What are you doing?

339
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,530
I'll tell you the truth.

340
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:22,370
Actually, on that day, I went to a massage parlor with my friend in the Sanggae neighborhood.

341
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,960
Here. I even have the receipt.

342
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,700
It looks like it's from somewhere else, but you'll find out once you call them.

343
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,820
 Hi, this is Vimo Provincial Police Agency. 

344
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,960
Yes, could you confirm a customer you had on the 25th?

345
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:49,120
Father-in-Law, the thing is, nothing happened there. I swear.

346
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,480
Please believe me.

347
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,800
Mr. Jang's alibi has been confirmed.

348
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,900
And Detective Gu confirmed that hydrochloric acid in his car is for stonemasonry.

349
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,300
People get their hands burned from time to time while diluting the hydrochloric acid.

350
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,670
You can go home now.

351
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,690
We'll let him go.

352
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,360
Father-in-Law! Father-in-Law!

353
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,080
You piece of trash. How dare you do such a thing

354
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,500
when you have a wife!

355
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,980
I'm horribly ashamed.

356
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,570
Shut it. It's your turn to punch me.

357
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:38,160
A son-in-law is also your child, so this is all my fault for not bringing up my son well.

358
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,240
Hold your fist tight.

359
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,690
Like this!

360
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,970
Punch me like this!

361
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:47,060
I'm so sorry, Father-in-Law! I'm really sorry.

362
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,440
Actually, Mi Yeon and I...

363
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,450
are practically separated.

364
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,350
Ever since our kid got sick, I practically live in Sonang Village.

365
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:04,200
It's been over a year since we started sleeping separately, in case I bring any bad luck.

366
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,420
Why didn't you tell me any of that?

367
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:13,360
You know how I raised Mi Yeon after my wife died.

368
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,610
Just get lost.

369
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,740
 You're still a jerk. 

370
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,220
 It sounded like he knew me. 

371
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,570
 Where did I see him? 

372
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,950
Please be understanding. When it comes to family, Koreans always protect their own.

373
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,850
It must be different from what you're used to.

374
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,610
 Even though your sister died, 

375
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,420
 you can't investigate the case when they've already specified the suspects. 

376
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,870
 You're still a jerk. 

377
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,320
 My mom would never kill herself! 

378
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,150
 A whirlpool ghost dragged my mom into the water! 

379
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,580
 It drowned her to death! 

380
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,080
 Your mother won't come back alive even if you cause a scene! 

381
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,040
 No! That's not true! 

382
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,810
 Leave! 

383
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,100
   

384
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,550
   

385
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,140
Are you all right?

386
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,850
I have no excuse to make. Soo Cheol isn't really a bad guy.

387
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,950
He hasn't been in his right mind since his daughter got sick.

388
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,100
Please be understanding about what happened today.

389
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,380
You don't have to say that. Detective Jo went too far today.

390
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,210
By the way, about Detective Jo,

391
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,690
I heard he was adopted.

392
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,400
Has he ever lived here?

393
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,850
All I saw in his file was that he was adopted from Vimo Island.

394
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,330
Oh, is that so?

395
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,810
Thanks. You must be busy, so you should get back to work.

396
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,050
Yes.

397
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,500
Oh, Gwi Nam. Look into the thing I told you about.

398
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,550
I heard that before boarding the Min Air flight on 25th of March,

399
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,420
you were at the party in the Doocheondong Hotel.

400
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,620
That's right.

401
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,750
I met my colleagues for a long time and wanted to stay longer, but I had matters to take care of, so  I took the night flight.

402
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,950
What?

403
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,790
I really liked your watch.

404
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,650
Oh, right. Thank you.

405
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,340
As I told you on the phone,

406
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,980
the suspect in the Sanggae Neighborhood Murder Case is a master of disguise.

407
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,660
Was there anything on the plane that night that caught your eye?

408
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,250
I kept thinking about it after I got your call.

409
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,060
But I  slept through the entire flight.

410
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,330
I'm sorry.

411
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:48,060
It was an after-party for the film festival, so I had drunk a lot.

412
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,840
I'm an LW when it comes to alcohol. Lightweight, I mean.

413
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,820
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. Instead, I'll try my best if you have any other questions.

414
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,870
Well then...

415
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,560
Do you know of ways one might be used to be disguised as this person?

416
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,870
I see, the culprit was disguised as this lady.

417
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,470
Yes.

418
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,170
There are three ways you can do this.

419
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:22,460
One is to stick foam latex or silicone prosthetics on the face or by putting on a mask.

420
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,370
One can use special effects makeup. If a man were to be disguised as a woman,

421
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,820
then he would have used all three methods.

422
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,800
So is this actually possible?

423
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,880
Of course, Detective. These days you can turn into an alien with some special effects makeup.

424
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,080
So, the days when you could catch a criminal with a composite sketch are over.

425
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,440
Then can one become shorter as well?

426
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Become shorter?

427
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:54,960
It's easy to increase height but to decrease it...

428
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,300
That should be impossible.

429
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,410
What a shame. If only I hadn't sold my equipment, I could have given it a try.

430
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,860
Why did you stop doing special effects makeup?

431
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,550
Oh, that's because...

432
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:12,750
My grandfather runs a small museum here.

433
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:18,000
He has always had somewhat of a cold personality, so all the curators ran away.

434
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,550
That's why he ended up calling me. I'll be doing the job for now.

435
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,630
Please hold on.

436
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,780
Yes, Grandpa?

437
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,030
I told you I was going to be late because I had to stop by the Vimo station.

438
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:38,090
My goodness, all right. I'll be there soon.  Bye.

439
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:43,560
I have plans with my grandfather.

440
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,170
I need to go now.

441
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,270
Yes. Thank you for your cooperation.

442
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,970
Have a good day.

443
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,630
Can I give you a tip?

444
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:03,670
Special makeup is about knowing the structure of the bones and anatomy, so you can do the delicate details.

445
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:08,790
So the culprit might have studied medicine.

446
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:12,750
If you run into the culprit in disguise, then you must definitely

447
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,630
compare the eyes.

448
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:19,080
However perfect the disguise may be, the culprit cannot copy someone's eyes.

449
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,810
Just like how no one can copy yours.

450
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:39,120
   

451
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,730
Oh, I'm sorry.

452
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,620
Detective, was that Dong Bang Min that just left?

453
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,000
Were you able to catch something?

454
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,400
His alibi is airtight and is cooperative, but...

455
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,990
something just doesn't sit right.

456
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,380
Detective, you know you're a little sensitive today. Right?

457
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,210
I think you should rest a bit.

458
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:23,250
Also, Chief Yang asked me something.

459
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,030
He asked whether you lived on Vimo Island prior to your adoption.

460
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,430
Did you perhaps meet Chief Yang back then for the first time?

461
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,930
Did you do a background check on me?

462
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,270
- That's not the case. 
 - Let me warn you not to cross the line.

463
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,480
I'm sorry.

464
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,720
I had to explore in order to protect a teammate.

465
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,480
Look here, Director. Let's not hide behind the excuse of teammate protection.

466
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,130
You must think all the adoptees have some fantastic traumas,

467
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,040
how about being a bit more honest instead?

468
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,450
You are the one who's shaking under trauma because you are worried I will become like your dead partner.

469
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,490
Detective Jo, you are being too harsh.

470
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,360
Remember this one thing.

471
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,860
All we have to do is catch this Circus Man.

472
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:16,460
So mind your business about how I lived and how I will live in the future!

473
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,090
Once I catch him and depart this country, I will never return.

474
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,430
Telenote refused to share their files with us?

475
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,720
Yes.

476
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,540
They said there can be no further cooperation.

477
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,370
How about HSI?

478
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:48,020
They are the same.

479
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,690
Bureau Chief called a little while ago

480
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,840
and he said that the Korea Bureau protested.

481
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,480
While they're investigating the suspect profile, you are carrying on another investigation with the Golden Time Team.

482
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,910
As it can transition into a diplomatic incident if you cannot catch the culprit within the collaboration investigation time,

483
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,700
you need to report back

484
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,010
after transferring the case to the Koreans.

485
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,000
Of the promised 10 days, you have one week.

486
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,830
Just waiting for the culprit to approach Director Kang is...

487
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,940
This is the additional report on Dong Bang.

488
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,300
Leave it there.

489
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,220
 How about we become a bit more honest? 

490
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:46,560
 Aren't you the one that's shaking with trauma that I may become like your dead partner? 

491
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,580
 Detective Jo, your words are too harsh. 

492
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,590
Uncle!

493
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,690
I'm telling you that I met with Detective Gu.

494
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,340
Stay put, I'm doing you a favor.

495
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,850
Don't just go around touching everything.

496
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,820
What's going on?

497
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,350
Since Chief Yang approved Agent Han's transfer to Golden Time Team,

498
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,370
he asked me to make a spot for him.

499
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,990
Oh, right. This guy here is about my nephew's age,

500
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:32,230
so that's why I'm helping him. So don't mind me.

501
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,370
I was going to do it, but...

502
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:39,230
At any rate, it's my honor to work with you.

503
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:42,020
Welcome to GT Team. Let's get along.

504
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,090
Don't worry.

505
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:48,270
By the way, I don't have to answer the phones, do I?

506
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,560
What?

507
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,630
While in the back office, I've answered so many customer service calls...

508
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:55,720
Of course, the core of our police work is violent crime, isn't it?

509
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,920
Director, there's a call informing us that someone's being held against their will in Sonang Village.

510
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,750
Geez, they were quiet for a few days.

511
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,550
There are patients who have nowhere to go.

512
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,850
Maybe they're medicated and seeing things, but they keep on calling.

513
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,760
Since they are folks in a tough position, it's hard to chastise them.

514
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,950
I'll take the call.

515
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,040
Give it over. Give it.

516
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,830
Oh yes, informant!

517
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,190
If you have a mother or father, please put them on the phone.

518
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,300
Hello? Yes, this is the police station.

519
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,030
I was right, wasn't I? I knew it.

520
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:34,230
Yes, I know you are busy and all, but can you please keep these types of calls down?

521
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,350
All right.

522
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,730
I handled it.

523
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:46,810
If the GT Team had a local person around, it'd be ever so helpful, no?

524
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:52,600
Thank you, Uncle.

525
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,010
Director Kang! It's a Code Zero report call.

526
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:58,020
The caller is 50-year-old Kang Man Ho. He says someone is threatening him with a knife.

527
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,510
Transfer the call to me. Trace the call and find the location.

528
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,490
I'm on it.

529
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,560
Sir, you say you are being threatened with a knife?

530
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,690
 Please come quickly. 

531
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,610
 That punk is trying to stab me to death. 

532
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,120
 That punk?  Is the perpetrator known to you?

533
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,790
Oh my god, oh my god. Kim Eok Man... That bad jerk.

534
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,920
 Kang Man Ho! 

535
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,690
 Listen you punk. I'm going to kill you and kill myself today. 

536
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:29,440
Director, I checked the informant Mr. Kang Man Ho's cell phone which is with a carrier in New Zealand,

537
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,980
he is a permanent resident who went to New Zealand 4 years ago.

538
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,460
He came to Vimo Island 2 days ago and his current location is the intersection of coastal road 110 by a nearby hill.

539
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,890
Mr. Kang Man Ho, are you hurt anywhere?

540
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:43,660
My hand... I was cut while blocking the knife.

541
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,340
 We have a Code Zero alert. The caller is 50-year-old Kang Man Ho  
    

542
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:53,100
 The caller informs us that he is currently being threatened by Kim Eok Man at the intersection on coastal road 110 by a nearby hill. 

543
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,640
 It appears that the perpetrator, Kim Eok Man, possesses a knife. 

544
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,960
 Since the perpetrator, Kim Eok Man, is extremely agitated,  

545
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,160
 every agent dispatched must keep safety as the utmost importance 

546
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,590
I'm sure it's difficult, but can you describe what is going on in a bit more detail?

547
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:11,730
So what happened was, I came from Auckland the day before yesterday,

548
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,220
in order to take care of a big contract, for a short stay.

549
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,920
I was on my way to the hotel after meeting with a buyer.

550
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:40,030
Kang Man Ho, did you think I'd never find you?

551
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,450
H-Hyungnim.

552
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,870
How did you know I was here?

553
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,750
I'm going to kill you and also kill myself.

554
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,670
N-No! Wait, Hyungnim.

555
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,770
How much longer do I have to put up with this?

556
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,960
I compensated you and took care of your living expenses!

557
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,900
So you want me to just get lost now?

558
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,790
- Do you think I'm a beggar? 
 - Stop!

559
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,370
It's all thanks to me that you hit the jackpot!

560
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,930
Stop right there, jerk!

561
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,920
You punk.

562
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,850
Agent Park, anything else?

563
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:39,720
It's a foreign wireless carrier, so it'll take some time.

564
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,650
 You little rat. You were hiding here. 

565
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,850
H-Hyungnim, please calm down. Please...

566
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,980
 No! Hyungnim... 

567
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,750
Agent Park, call the rescue squad now. Agent Han, look into Kim Eok Man.

568
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,510
Yes, Ma'am.

569
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,350
He stabbed me...

570
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,880
 Mr. Kang Man Ho, are you all right? 

571
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,980
 Mr. Kang Man Ho? Mr. Kang Man Ho? 

572
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,480
Hello?

573
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,440
Mr. Kang Man Ho? Are you all right?

574
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,800
Yes... Luckily...

575
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,080
the knife just grazed me.

576
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,530
 I'm using my hand to stop the bleeding. 

577
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,350
 That rat Kim Eok Man ran away. 

578
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,140
We'll be there as soon as we can, so please hang on.

579
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,160
Director Kang, I've found him.

580
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,580
Assailant Kim Eok Man. He has a prior for a crime against Kang Man Ho.

581
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:51,550
I've found Kang Man Ho's information from that record. Here it is.

582
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,510
This is the center. We've confirmed the assailant's identity.

583
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:56,270
Kim Eok Man. Age 55. He was Kang Man Ho's business partner.

584
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,650
Kang Man Ho reported him for embezzlement.

585
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:02,270
Kang Man Ho immigrated to New Zealand thereafter. When his jade mat business was successful,

586
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:06,030
Kim Eok Man sued him for stealing his business idea.

587
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:10,390
He dropped the case in exchange for Kang Man Ho providing for his living expenses.

588
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:14,500
But he kept demanding money and continuously threatened him.

589
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,700
Mr. Kang Man Ho, can you talk?

590
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,000
Yes... I can.

591
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,470
Did you see which way Kim Eok Man fled?

592
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,130
I don't know. We're on a mountain.

593
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,970
Did you see the car type or license plate number?

594
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:34,550
I don't know the license plate number. It was an old blue truck.

595
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,760
- Where? 
 - Excuse me.

596
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,300
- Yes? 
 - Did you see anything?

597
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,110
That way. He went that way.

598
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:49,310
That way? Let's go.

599
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:59,600
Kim Eok Man has a blue one-ton truck registered in his name.

600
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,290
The license plate number is 59Nu4789.

601
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:06,520
This is the center. Please locate Kim Eok Man's truck. A blue one-ton truck, license 59Nu4789.

602
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,600
Agent Han, keep monitoring the Coastal Road speed camera.

603
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,300
Yes, Ma'am.

604
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,860
- Kang Man Ho! 
 - Kang Man Ho!

605
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,060
-  Over here!  
 - Kang Man Ho!

606
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,140
Over here!

607
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,620
Kang Man Ho!

608
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,240
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes...

609
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,620
Where did Kim Eok Man go?

610
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,250
I don't know. He fled.

611
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,340
- Search the area. 
 - Yes, Sir.

612
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,110
Let me take a look.

613
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,060
Just a minute.

614
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,950
Luckily, it isn't deep. It grazed you.

615
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,670
Let's track Kim Eok Man after the rescue team takes him away.

616
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:40,470
- Yes, Sir. 
 - No.

617
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,200
What?

618
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,750
Over here! This way! Hurry!

619
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,450
Here!

620
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,670
Please take a look.

621
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:56,700
While we track the assailant, please go with Kang Man Ho to the hospital

622
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,500
and notify his family.

623
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,390
Yes, Sir.

624
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,850
Director, a blue one-ton truck was caught on a traffic camera heading toward the wharf.

625
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:10,820
This is by Tamseo Cliff. He's on Saga Mountain road.

626
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:16,780
This is the center. Kim Eok Man's car, license 59Nu4789 is fleeing on Saga Mountain road toward Tamseo Cliff.

627
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:21,310
Over there.

628
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,450
There it is.

629
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:45,400
This is Dispatch 1. We found the truck abandoned at Tamseo Cliff. Kim Eok Man isn't here.

630
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,630
I don't think Kim Eok Man was alone.

631
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:57,540
Someone was in the passenger seat.

632
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,460
Are you saying he has an accomplice?

633
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,470
Wait a second!

634
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,360
Look.

635
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,420
Dae Sik and I will go down.

636
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,410
You two find the person he was with.

637
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,200
He couldn't have gone far.

638
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,640
- Let's go. 
 - Yes, Sir.

639
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,420
It's Kim Eok Man.

640
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,110
It looks like he fell to this death.

641
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:50,860
So why is the back of his head busted open when he's face down?

642
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,880
It wasn't from the fall.

643
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,740
This is Dispatch !. Kim Eok Man fell off Tamseo Cliff and died.

644
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:03,050
We'll have to investigate to see if it was an accident while fleeing.

645
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,710
Look.

646
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,900
It's fresh blood.

647
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,470
He hit Kim Eok Man with a rock here and pushed him off the cliff.

648
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:22,170
The blood splattered on the truck.

649
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,840
Team Leader Park! I think we found the murder weapon!

650
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,410
This is Dispatch 1, Director.

651
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,770
 We found evidence of murder and an accomplice in his truck. 

652
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,510
 We need Forensics down here. 

653
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:37,130
 We must search for the suspect right away, too. 

654
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,410
This is the center. Kim Eok Man, who assaulted Kang Man Ho,

655
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:42,800
was found dead at the bottom of Tamseo Cliff.

656
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,120
 Kim Eok Man's killer is on the run. Forensics and local patrol officers, please head to the crime scene. 

657
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,590
What's going on? Let's hurry.

658
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,920
Yes, Sir.

659
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,390
Agent Park, check all the CCTVs and speed cameras by Tamseo Cliff.

660
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,540
Yes, Ma'am.

661
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:33,470
Hold on.

662
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,530
Pull over.

663
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:45,000
Sir.

664
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:48,490
You're bleeding. Are you hurt?

665
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:51,190
The thing is... I...

666
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,850
What? What was that?

667
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:58,500
I killed my little kid.

668
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:03,500
I killed my little kid on the cliff.

669
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,120
What did you just say?

670
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:09,600
- Radio that we found a man saying he killed someone on the cliff. 
 - It looks like he has dementia.

671
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,610
Grandfather, your legs must hurt. We'll give you a ride.

672
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,330
This is Saga Patrol Four.

673
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:21,430
- We found an old man saying he killed someone on the cliff. 
 - I...

674
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,410
I killed our little kid.

675
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:25,830
 We'll take him to the patrol station and investigate. 

676
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:29,290
 An old man who killed a person? 

677
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:32,800
Team Leader Park, you need to go to Saga Patrol Station.

678
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,430
An old man says he killed someone on the cliff.

679
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:39,290
He may be related somehow to our suspect. Please investigate.

680
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:41,140
Sure. I'll go with Detective Jo.

681
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:44,130
Let's go. You two stay here.

682
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:47,590
Agent Han, check the CCTVs to see where the old man came from.

683
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,430
Yes, Sir.

684
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,260
Where did you come from, old man?

685
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,100
   

686
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:03,310
 Could the old man be the accomplice of Kim Eok Man? 

687
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:07,750
 Then Kang Man Ho could've witnessed it. 

688
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:13,240
Luckily, the wound isn't deep, but you must be hospitalized for tonight.

689
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,960
Please wait until your room is ready.

690
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,040
All right, thank you.

691
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,990
- Where to? 
 - Please follow me.

692
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,360
Please lie down over here.

693
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,450
Thank you.

694
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,330
I'm causing you so much trouble. Thank you.

695
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:36,930
What happened to my car?

696
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:41,710
It's in the parking lot. I'll help you with your admission, too.

697
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:43,810
Thank you so much.

698
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:56,470
Hello?

699
00:51:56,470 --> 00:52:00,410
Mr. Kang, this is Director Kang. We talked earlier.

700
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:04,440
I called you because I have something to tell you and some questions to ask.

701
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,800
Sure. Go ahead.

702
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,330
Mr. Kim Eok Man was found dead by a cliff.

703
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:14,680
And there's an old man who claims that he killed someone by that cliff.

704
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,190
Father...

705
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,730
Oh, I was just too surprised.

706
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:24,460
I was wondering what you were talking about.

707
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:29,670
Things were too hectic that I forgot to tell you this.

708
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:34,600
The t-thing is, in the passenger seat of that truck,

709
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,050
I saw a man in his 30s... No, no.

710
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:39,710
It was a man in his 20s. He was in the passenger seat.

711
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:41,250
A man in his 20s?

712
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:45,110
Yes, I think so. He's in his 20s

713
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:49,840
He had a b-big build.

714
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,510
He had a crew cut and also...

715
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,290
I think he was...

716
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:57,290
wearing glasses.

717
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,760
No, he wasn't.

718
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,480
Thank you for your cooperation. I'll call you again.

719
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,740
Sure.

720
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:16,870
Oh, no. You can't walk around.

721
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:18,960
It's nothing.

722
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,360
I can get myself admitted to the hospital.

723
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,880
You must be busy, so you should get going.

724
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,870
Okay then.

725
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,550
This is Saga Three. Once the man with dementia is brought into the station, Saga Three will need backup.

726
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,420
Yes, Sir.

727
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:45,820
So what you're saying is the person who was found dead under the cliff is your son?

728
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,740
That's right.

729
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,120
Eok Man.

730
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:57,480
He's our baby boy. I killed him.

731
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,400
You bad kid!

732
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,080
Aish, that hurts, Grandpa.

733
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,260
Why did you hit me so suddenly...

734
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,620
What should we do? This elder isn't well.

735
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,560
What smell is this?

736
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,590
I think the elder made a mistake.

737
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,460
 The smell of rot. 

738
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,300
The Rape Flower has bloomed.

739
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,860
Our baby boy likes this.

740
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:45,280
The Rape Flower is fully open.

741
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:51,030
I think he has dementia.

742
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,940
That's right.

743
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,690
I killed him.

744
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:01,710
Eok Man. I did.

745
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,460
You heard it, right, Director?

746
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,930
 This elder most likely is a patient with serious dementia. 

747
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:16,880
This is Center. According to Kang Man Ho's testimony,

748
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,620
he witnessed an accomplice, a man in his 20s with a sports haircut and a healthy body.

749
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:24,420
Requesting immediate investigation in the vicinity of Tamseo Cliff.

750
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:30,150
Agent Han, look at all the CCTVs in the vicinity of Tamseo Cliff and look for a man in his 20s with a sports haircut.

751
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:32,400
I'm on it.

752
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,500
Please keep him until we can ascertain the elder's identity.

753
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,750
Yes, Sir.

754
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,070
Let's investigate the crime scene.

755
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:41,190
We came to find a person.

756
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,490
Mr. Bul Sang Goo!

757
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,410
We searched for a long time unaware that you were here.

758
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,280
Who are you?

759
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:08,300
Ah yes. I'm the Director Choi Gong Pyo of the Vimo Nursing Home.

760
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,840
   

761
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,270
He must have left during the dinner preparation.

762
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:19,830
I was worried since it'll be dark soon...

763
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:22,850
Thank you so much.

764
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,340
I don't want to! No! Not want! No! No! No!

765
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:31,320
They don't like me.

766
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,760
They told me they'd kill me.

767
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:38,700
Since it's safe here,

768
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,420
come out when you feel like it, Mr. Bul Sang Goo. Okay?

769
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:47,860
Oh boy. Since the names of the people without documentation aren't known,

770
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:52,140
we register them under either Bul Sang Ae or Bul Sang Goo. 
  (No ID Female / No ID Male) 

771
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,130
By the way, why are detectives involved...

772
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:03,840
Did Mr. Bul Sang Goo do something wrong?

773
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,100
No.

774
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:09,300
Actually, there was a murder near Tamseo Cliff.

775
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:14,430
But the elder kept mentioning how he had killed a kiddo.

776
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,650
There are many elderly people with dementia

777
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:19,880
who repeat the same words.

778
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,980
Mr. Bul Sang Goo

779
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,890
does that with the words "kiddo".

780
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,380
Let's go. Mr. Bul Sang Goo can follow the director.

781
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,680
Huh?

782
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,400
What's this? Where did he go?

783
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:36,550
I don't think he's inside.

784
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:38,860
We have to find Mr. Bul Sang Goo.

785
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:41,890
Mr. Bul Sang Goo!

786
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:43,400
Mr. Bul Sang Goo!

787
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,260
Agent Han, what's the update on the CCTVs?

788
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:51,460
I can't find anything because all the CCTVs are out of order.

789
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:59,190
Detective Gu, any evidence found at the crime scene?

790
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:00,640
 Not yet. 

791
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,200
 That elderly man disappeared suddenly, so 

792
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,390
 we will look for him for 5 minutes before taking off. 

793
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:07,070
What?

794
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,830
Please hurry.

795
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:14,680
 Something is strange. If there was an accomplice, not having any clues like this is rather difficult. 

796
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,190
 The phone is turned off, so you will be connected to voice mail... 

797
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:25,240
 ...charge for a call will be added... 

798
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,950
 The phone is turned off. Please leave a message... 

799
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,500
Saga Patrol Office, Kang Man Ho's cell phone is turned off.

800
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,060
Requesting you check back.

801
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,950
I was about to report since Mr. Kang Man Ho asked to check himself in, I left my position for a split moment

802
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,300
and he disappeared at that time.

803
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,230
You say he disappeared suddenly?

804
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,010
 As soon as the rescue unit arrives, why don't we pursue Kim Eok Man? 

805
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:46,720
 No... 

806
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,220
 When Detective Jo said to chase Kim Eok Man, he said, "No." 

807
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:54,020
 When I asked about an accomplice, he stuttered severely. 

808
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,800
 Just why? 

809
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,020
 Mr. Kang Man Ho is the victim for sure. 

810
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,660
 Just what is he hiding? 

811
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:01,810
 Please hurry. 

812
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:03,670
 That jerk is trying to kill me... 

813
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:05,880
 I killed him. 

814
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,620
 That bastard is trying to stab me to death. 

815
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:10,030
 I killed him. 

816
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:13,930
 That bastard is trying to kill... 

817
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:16,240
 The timbre and volume of the voices are nearly identical. 

818
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,890
 To be this similar... 

819
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:20,700
Agent Park, find out about Mr. Kang Man Ho's father. Right away!

820
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,630
One moment, please.

821
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,990
   

822
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:29,470
His father, Mr. Kang Seok Chun, comes up as deceased.

823
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:31,690
 Here's the death register. 

824
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:34,000
   

825
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,580
 He passed away? 

826
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:40,240
 There's no way the voices can be this identical unless they are parent and child. 

827
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,040
 Surely, I missed something. 

828
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:48,760
 Ah, right, I was so surprised... 

829
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,350
 I was wondering what you were saying, yes. 

830
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:52,180
 Fa... 

831
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:55,220
 Fath... 

832
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,520
Father?

833
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,060
 He was going to say "father" unintentionally. 

834
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:00,960
 It couldn't be... 

835
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,500
Agent Park, Agent Han, quickly find out if there's any other information

836
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,350
- on Mr. Kang Man Ho's father. 
 - We are on it.

837
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:13,220
Director, there's something that doesn't sit right with me.

838
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,880
Elder!

839
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:26,110
Mr. Bul Sang Goo!

840
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:28,560
Mr. Bul Sang Goo!

841
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,740
Grandpa!

842
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,920
Please answer me, would you?

843
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,200
Gosh, where did you go!

844
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,270
Goodness me!

845
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:40,240
Detective Jo, shouldn't we take off?

846
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:50,000
Look at this.

847
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,940
It's a recent oil leak.

848
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,920
Then are you saying that someone took Mr. Bul Sang Goo away by car?

849
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,820
Why would anyone do that to an old man with dementia?

850
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:01,880
I guess there's a reason unknown to us.

851
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:07,590
Team Leader Park. Detective Jo. I think that Bul Sang Goo is the deceased father of Mr. Kang Man Ho.

852
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:10,800
According to reports, Mr. Kang Man Ho fell asleep at the wheel in 2016

853
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,340
and drove his vehicle into a lake, during which his mother, Mrs. Han Chun Rye, drowned.

854
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:18,980
He was awarded ₩12 million in insurance money, with which he repaid his debts and relocated to New Zealand.

855
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:22,480
At the time of Mr. Kang Man Ho's father's, Mr. Kang Seok Chun, death

856
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,910
he also collected a large sum of insurance money using a similar policy.

857
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:28,300
The speech patterns and habits are very similar between Mr. Kang Man Ho and Mr. Bul Sang Goo.

858
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:32,450
When Mr. Kang Man Ho was explaining about an accomplice, he nearly said "father."

859
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,810
This is no coincidence.

860
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:38,120
Let's go.

861
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,220
This oil stain. Probably belongs to Kang Man Ho's rental car.

862
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,600
Kang Man Ho's engine has been leaking oil since a little while ago.

863
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:59,130
Are we going to meet our kiddo for real?

864
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,150
That's what I said, dang it.

865
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,940
We cannot feed our kiddo a peach.

866
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:08,210
If he eats a peach, a big problem happens.

867
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:11,450
That kiddo! Kiddo! All this bull!

868
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:14,170
Shut your mouth. Making too much noise.

869
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:19,280
That kid, you will be able to meet them shortly. Okay?

870
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,700
When I meet my kiddo,

871
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,190
I'm going to tell on you.

872
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:32,170
   

873
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:33,570
What's over there?

874
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:35,000
That's the hill where the graveyard is.

875
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,640
Entry is prohibited now since the graves were dug under from the heavy rain 10 days ago.

876
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,810
Let's go in that direction first.

877
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:42,710
This is Dispatch 1. Director Kang,

878
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:46,090
 we suspect that Kang Man Ho headed toward the graveyard on the hill. 

879
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,910
 We will head that way. 

880
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:50,080
Graveyard, you say?

881
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,390
   

882
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:03,250
Where is my kiddo?

883
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:08,750
You said I can meet my kiddo.

884
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,660
Your kiddo

885
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,770
will be here momentarily.

886
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:14,770
Soon.

887
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:20,620
Before that, let's play a game.

888
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,660
Come here.

889
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:29,150
You have to close your eyes and count to ten right here

890
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:30,950
for your kiddo to come

891
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:32,100
here.

892
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,480
Really?

893
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,500
Okay.

894
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,600
One...

895
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,360
This kind of bull crap

896
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,230
- is over as of now. 
 - Two.

897
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:54,190
A being who didn't do his job as the head of the house, only to become a burden,

898
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:58,240
has such a long life span.

899
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,360
Why the heck are you making me resort to this kind of deed?

900
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,650
Five.

901
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:05,920
You said you wanted to see Mom, right?

902
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,880
Six.

903
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,410
She's in hell.

904
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:13,410
Seven.

905
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:15,510
So go...

906
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:18,260
Eight.

907
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:20,350
and meet up well. Okay!

908
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:22,810
Nine.

909
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,120
Ten.

910
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:33,280
   

911
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,510
 Two people are somewhat similar. 

912
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:18,540
Maybe you want to rip us apart...

913
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,240
I'll make sure those blades are...

914
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,580
