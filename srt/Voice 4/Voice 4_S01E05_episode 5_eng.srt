1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600


2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,090
   

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,470
   

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,060
   

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,860
   

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,540
   

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,910
    
     

8
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,110
   

9
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,000
    

10
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,990
This is Kang Kwon Joo.

11
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,380
 Please meet me right now. 

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,140
Gong Su Ji?

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,190
The lullaby that I heard when I was running away yesterday, near the emergency staircase,

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,350
I think I heard it on the flight as well.

15
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,010
 It's finally the day I get to go back to my Vimo Island house! 

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,320
Damn it. Why isn't this opening?

17
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,920
Unni?

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,750
Aren't you at the police station?  How could you... so quickly...

19
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,740
Shall we go someplace quiet and talk?

20
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,880
What are you doing without hurrying?

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,400
The murderer might still be in the hospital.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,690
 - As soon as arriving, right away, I'll get in...  
 - ♪  My baby, sleep tight  ♪

23
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,420
 - Huh?  
 ♪  My baby, go to sleep  ♪

24
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,750
 - The Circus Man was a woman...  
  - ♪  My baby, go to sleep  ♪

25
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,620
 - This voice is a man's.  
 - ♪  My baby, go to sleep  ♪

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:55,080
 Gosh!  It's ruined. 

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:03,960
♪ My baby, go to sleep ♪

28
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,390
Is this the lullaby that you heard?

29
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,290
Why are you acting like this?  It's scary.

30
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,540
   

31
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,980
 The 44 year old Coach Jung...  
    

32
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,890
 That is when she stabbed her adoptive father...  
    

33
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,860
 A female corpse in her 60's was found in the apartment...  
    

34
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,580
 She was continuous sexually assaulted by her father.  
    

35
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,000
   
     

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,680
   

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,770
Stop right there! 
    

38
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,540
You bastard!

39
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,050
This way!

40
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,890
Stop right there!

41
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,760
Dispatch Team 1 here! We're chasing a suspected drug dealer gang member.

42
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,540
 He fled into the dockside fish auction place. 

43
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,700
You bastard!

44
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,130
Watch out!

45
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,260
   

46
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,920
Move aside!

47
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,450
Get out!

48
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,200
Stop it!

49
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,920
Get out of my way, damn it!

50
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,710
Detective Jo!

51
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,670
Don't move!

52
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,650
Stay still!

53
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,230
Where is Go Ga Eun? Where is she?

54
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,390
I don't know! I don't know!

55
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,090
Tell me now!

56
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,620
Okay! Okay. Okay.

57
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,020
She's with the boss. That's all I know. I swear.

58
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,880
He said she is with the boss.  He doesn't know the place.

59
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,900
You're under arrest for murder, kidnapping, assault and battery.

60
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,170
You have the right to remain silent and anything you say will be used against you in a court of law.

61
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,830
Get up.

62
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,550
 Dispatch Team 1 here. We arrested a subordinate who we assume belongs to Black Dragon Gang. 

63
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,160
 It's unable to connect... 

64
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,030
Here... She looks like this. Let's spread out and search for her.

65
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,820
- Yes, got it. 
 - Yes, got it.

66
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,820
Wow, amazing!  Can you take pictures with the horse statue in the background?

67
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,320
This place is really beautiful. I'm going to take a picture now.

68
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,880
One, two, three!

69
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,530
- It's really beautiful. 
 - Let's go there, too.

70
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,020
Here, here! Let's have pictures taken here.

71
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,850
- Ready? 
 - Yeah.

72
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,700
- A little bit to the right side. 
 - This way? 
 - Yeah.

73
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,720
Is it good?

74
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,420
The wind is strong.  Hurry up.

75
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,590
What is that?

76
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,350
There is something strange behind you.

77
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,160
Behind us?

78
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,560
That one.

79
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,120
What is this? Doesn't it look like someone went into the sea?

80
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,790
 It's unable to connect... 

81
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,540
Excuse me. Gong Su Ji?

82
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,380
- Pardon? 
 - Oh, I'm sorry.

83
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,460
What... are all these?

84
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,630
Hey! What is this?

85
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,450
Hey, call the police quickly.

86
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,150
- Yes, this is 112 Call Center— 
   - I think someone went into the sea. 

87
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,770
There are clothes, shoes, and a kind of syringe on the seawall at the lighthouse.

88
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,930
Where did you say you are?

89
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,330
 The seawall at the Surok Lighthouse. 

90
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,790
You said there was an ID card. Can you tell me the name?

91
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,900
Gong Su Ji. 981022-277391.

92
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,470
Agent Park, it's a caller reporting that they found a syringe and personal belongings by the Surok seawall.

93
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,760
- The belongings' owner is Gong Su Ji. 
 - Pardon?

94
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,530
This is Command Team Leader Park Eun Soo at 112 Call Center.

95
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,940
You said the belongings' owner is Gong Su Ji, didn't you?

96
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,990
Don't you see Gong Su Ji nearby?

97
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,500
No, this person is not here, I think.

98
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,160
Hey, look at this.

99
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,060
And there is a note in her bag.

100
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,470
What's written is that "Everything is annoying. I can't put up with it anymore. Die, everybody."

101
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,240
 It looks like a suicide note. 

102
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,930
Suicide note?

103
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,860
 Director. 

104
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,620
Gong Su Ji's belongings and an assumed suicide note were found on the seawall

105
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,690
What? I got it. I'll be there right away.

106
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,390
This is Station One. We're on our way to Surok Beach.

107
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,100
Does the bag and stuff at the seawall really belong to Prosecutor Gong Chang Sik's daughter?

108
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,300
Yes, Provincial Police Agency finished checking the ID card and her identity.

109
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,590
Ah, really! Why is Center Director there?

110
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,100
I heard this from a center colleague. Director Kang accused her of being a suspect in a Seoul case

111
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,880
and barged into her hospital room last night and really gave her a hard time.

112
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,190
Damn it.

113
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,560
This way.

114
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,290
   

115
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,500
 What's happening? Even though she was unstable, 

116
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,690
 she was not in the condition where she'd make an extreme decision like this. 

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,080
Detective Jo, Gong Su Ji disappeared after leaving a note at the Surok seawall.

118
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,710
 We can't exclude the possibility that she committed suicide. 

119
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,670
We'll save Go Ga Eun no matter what! So make sure to find Gong Su Ji.  Make sure!

120
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,320
 Watch out! 

121
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,600
   

122
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,940
   

123
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,170
Gong Su Ji injected this medicine into herself?

124
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,990
Yes, it looks like that.

125
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,420
This is a prohibited drug in Korea.

126
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,840
It increases the ability to pay attention when students study and keeps them awake.

127
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,600
So students here inject themselves with this medicine, easily gotten from abroad, using the drug as well.

128
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,510
Then they act impulsively and get into an accident.

129
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,540
Ah, really. Prosecutor Gong was talking about how proud he was of his daughter...

130
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,730
Chief Yang, I met Gong Su Ji yesterday but she wasn't in this unstable condition.

131
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,200
And a little while ago, she said on the phone that she had a video that caught a glimpse of a suspect

132
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,890
and wanted to meet me.

133
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,600
This incident might be connected with the suspect in the Sanggae neighborhood incident.

134
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,300
Video?

135
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,870
She thought that this person was the culprit.

136
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,030
 - Darn it, why is he singing?  
 - ♪  My baby, go to sleep  ♪

137
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,730
Are you kidding me right now?

138
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,610
You told me that the criminal was a woman who looks exactly like you.

139
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,750
Are you telling me this is also evidence?

140
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,480
How much did you do to her to make her say all this stuff!

141
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,610
Nevermind that. Go work on something else, I'll take care of this.

142
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,760
It's not like I believe this video entirely either.

143
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,570
However, there must have been a reason as to why she said that.

144
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,740
I told you, it's fine!

145
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,680
From now on, this is under the jurisdiction of the detectives, so stay out of it.

146
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,790
And Gong Su Ji is the daughter of a prosecutor who helps us greatly on this island.

147
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,460
We are no less, probably more, disappointed with this situation than you are.

148
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,390
Then do it that way!

149
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,990
But we have the right to take part as a special investigation team.

150
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,610
We will use the help of the Patrol Division to look for more clues in the area.

151
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,930
   

152
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,750
You still don't want to say anything? Where's the bag?

153
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,950
Please spare me. I'm begging you.

154
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,050
I really don't know anything.

155
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,580
When I tried to report it, my sister took it away.

156
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,420
- I really don't know! 
 - This stubborn wench!

157
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,950
If you don't tell me where it is,

158
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,790
I'll let you experience exactly what your sister experienced.

159
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,520
 Ga Eun, if anything happens, 

160
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,240
 go drink the water from the Haesim Village Saemmul River. 

161
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,550
 Thanks to the large hole in the cave, the ocean water comes in and becomes spring water. 

162
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,010
 She said there was a hole connecting to the ocean inside that cave. 

163
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,010
 If I'm lucky and get there, I can escape. 

164
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,650
She said she hid it in a cave inside Haesim Village.

165
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,510
Is it here?

166
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,180
So you're saying it's hidden in a village growing opium poppies?

167
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,980
How smart.

168
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,870
That's right. She said if we hid it here, no one would know,

169
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,950
because the village chief told the cops not to patrol here.

170
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:16,750
If you pull any tricks, you and your grandma will both die.

171
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,140
Go.

172
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,890
 Darn it. 

173
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,320
Here!

174
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,520
 Grandpa. Grandpa, please help me. 

175
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,260
- Stop looking. 
  - I got it! 

176
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,320
Here!

177
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,270
 Please look here, please. 

178
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,360
 Here! 

179
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,720
 - So are you going there? 
 - Yes, I'll go have a look. 

180
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,320
 Grandma, please help me. I'm so scared. 

181
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,190
Where is it?

182
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,800
We're here.

183
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,100
This is that cave.

184
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,840
Even the village people don't know this place well.

185
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,260
Oh my, I can't get up.

186
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,340
This little girl is trying to pull tricks again.

187
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,190
Get up. Get up.

188
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,150
Hey!

189
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,280
What happened?

190
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,450
Where are you?

191
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,260
I think she brought us here to get rid of us.

192
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,260
Look here.

193
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,290
I think she's planning on swimming underwater

194
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,320
and escape through the rear of the port.

195
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,930
 I think she brought us here on purpose! 

196
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,820
You fools.

197
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,660
You got tricked by a little girl.

198
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,260
Go find her and bring her head to me!

199
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,290
Over there! Stop the car!

200
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,260
Grab that girl!

201
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,830
She's so clever.

202
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,860
You stay here.

203
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,960
Just you wait, you'll be caught alive. I'll make sure you never see the sun again.

204
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,590
Let's go.

205
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,030
Find her! Quickly!

206
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,420
Damn it.

207
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,430
Damn.

208
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,230
Where'd you go? Come out wherever you are.

209
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,420
Where'd you go?

210
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:53,330
Where are you?

211
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,420
 It was here. 

212
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,560
 I heard her voice around here! 

213
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,700
 I can't reach the bottom. 

214
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:41,200
 That's right. When she gave me this watch, she said something. 

215
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,120
 If something goes wrong when you're in the water, just press this button. 

216
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,250
 It'll send an SOS notification to the people at my diver shop. 

217
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,080
 We connected our GPS signals. 

218
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,360
 All I have is this, 

219
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,650
 but it's a precious item to me. 

220
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,170
 Thanks. 

221
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,570
I think the men didn't know the location of the drugs. That's why they kidnapped Go Ga Eun.

222
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,060
Let's search along the waterside.

223
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,760
There will be some clues where Go Ga Eun and Chae So Yoon met up.

224
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,310
Let's go.

225
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,830
Wait!

226
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,610
I just got an SOS notification from Instructor Chae's watch.

227
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,500
This is a watch that works underwater for divers.

228
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,360
We made it so that we can see the GPS location of the divers at our shop.

229
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,550
Then there's a high likelihood that Go Ga Eun might have it. What's the location?

230
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,860
It says 33*31'41.00" N,

231
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,920
to 26*51"17.00" E.

232
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,240
Seeing that it's not moving, she's either hiding

233
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,720
or...

234
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,320
This is Dispatch Team 1. Just now, Detective Shim Dae Sik's diver smartwatch

235
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,190
showed Chae So Yoon's GPS location coming up.

236
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,810
There is a possibility that this is Go Ga Eun.

237
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,360
33*31'41.00" N

238
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,850
to 26*51"17.00" E.

239
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,800
Please find that location.

240
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,450
   

241
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,310
Team Leader Park, the location says Haesim Village.

242
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,520
It is a small fishing village where divers and fishermen live.

243
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,540
I will request backup from the Haesim Village police branch, so take the Dispatch Team over there right away.

244
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,850
Okay. Let's go.

245
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:30,340
Dae Sik, what do you want to do? We can't force you.

246
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,100
Dae Sik.

247
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,370
Well, I will be more helpful than not.

248
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,170
Of course, it's better to have you around.

249
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,740
Let's go.

250
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,230
Team Leader Cheon, please request the Coast Guard to check

251
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,100
if there are any suspicious boats on the west coast near these GPS locations.

252
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,690
Okay.

253
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,130
 Fishing village. There must be at least a dozen families living there. 

254
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:57,000
 It'll take too long to find Go Ga Eun by simply searching the village. Is there anything else we can do? 

255
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,870
Director, we found new information on Go Ga Eun's location.

256
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,290
 I'll send it to your phone. 

257
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,610
   

258
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,540
Agent Park, contact the Omiri Police Branch and connect my signal with Grandma Go Soon Rye.

259
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,470
 I understand. 

260
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,900
This is Center. Omiri Police Branch, please respond.

261
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,370
There is a possibility that Go Soon Rye's granddaughter, Go Ga Eun, may have experienced an accident in Haesim Village.

262
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,540
I need to speak with Go Soon Rye.

263
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,400
I understand.

264
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,470
 Grandmother, this is 112 Center Director, Kang Kwon Joo. 

265
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,750
Please listen to me as calmly and carefully as possible.

266
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:48,620
There's a possibility your granddaughter, Ga Eun, was kidnapped to Haesim Village, so the police have gone to save her.

267
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,420
What? What do you mean?

268
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,940
It seems that her kidnapping has to do with the deceased Chae So Yoon drug case.

269
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,470
My Ga Eun?

270
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:04,000
And, Grandmother, upon tracking Ga Eun's bank account,

271
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,550
Ga Eun has been continuously transferring money to your account.

272
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:13,520
It seems to be an account that you have not been regularly using.

273
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,240
   

274
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,500
It seems that Ga Eun threatened Go Soo Dong

275
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,110
in order to collect more retirement funds for you.

276
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,400
Did I ever say I needed any of that?

277
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,880
Grandmother,

278
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,940
I know you told Ga Eun to become a diver because you were worried about her being left alone in this world.

279
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:45,180
 Then she would still have the support of other divers, even if you weren't there for her anymore. 

280
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:49,410
Just as Ga Eun didn't understand you,

281
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:54,460
 it seems to be some parts of her that you weren't aware of. 

282
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:00,740
Oh. How frustrated was our Ga Eun because of me?

283
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:08,180
I told her so many times that a diver who breathed water would die,

284
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:15,780
but I was the "water" making her drown.

285
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,020
Oh, but... Haesim Village...

286
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,810
Go Soo Dong has a greenhouse there.

287
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,850
 In the past, Ga Eun said that 

288
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:41,380
the red flowers he was secretly growing were

289
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,050
 opium flowers, 

290
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:48,160
but I thought she just saw them incorrectly.

291
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,670
 She tried to show me a video, 

292
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,550
 but I told her she was spouting nonsense and didn't look at it. 

293
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:58,110
The kidnappers and Go Soo Dong have something suspicious!

294
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,260
Ask her how the flowers that Go Ga Eun saw were being grown.

295
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,120
Grandmother, did you hear how those plants were being grown?

296
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,350
They were mixed in with the lettuce.

297
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,340
They are opium poppies for sure.

298
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:16,150
Drug dealers hide the large leaves of opium poppies by planting them among plants with similar leaves. It's a popular trick.

299
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:20,120
I must go over there.

300
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,040
I know Haesim Village very well.

301
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,500
I was the one that told her about the spring cave in Haesim Village

302
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,520
and I was also the one that told her there was a hole in the back of the cave!

303
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,590
This is Center Director. Currently, there's a high chance that Go Ga Eun went to the spring cave in Haesim Village.

304
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:38,960
Detective Jo, the granny says she knows the village well, so it'll be better if she goes with you.

305
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,720
Are you still looking for that little girl!

306
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,030
 Yes. She's not here. 

307
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,070
What are you guys doing on my boat?

308
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,420
Get rid of this man!

309
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,700
These guys...

310
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,690
You keep quiet.

311
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,710
Do you have a death wish?

312
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,810
It's not like she has gills, so why don't I see her?

313
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,870
Go Ga Eun! Go Ga Eun!

314
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,260
 - Ga Eun! 
 - Ga Eun! 

315
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,150
Go Ga Eun! Go Ga Eun!

316
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,880
Is that the police?

317
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,460
Ga Eun!

318
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,760
Hey, there.

319
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,120
Stay still!

320
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,300
It looks like they're running away from us!

321
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,280
Kwang Soo, take the other patrol officers and follow those men. We'll find Go Ga Eun.

322
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,190
Where's Go Ga Eun? Where is she!

323
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,520
I only saw her swimming to the other side and hiding somewhere.

324
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,560
Get up!

325
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,300
Please watch him for us.

326
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,710
Go Ga Eun! Go Ga Eun!

327
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:20,060
Go Ga Eun! Go Ga Eun!

328
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,570
Go Ga Eun!

329
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,420
How are we supposed to find her?

330
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,990
The GPS location hasn't changed. And it looks like she's about 2 meters underwater.

331
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:37,150
Her oxygen levels aren't good, so I think she might be in trouble.

332
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,430
Looking at what happened to Chae So Yoon, there's a high chance, Go Ga Eun was tortured.

333
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,140
Being in the ocean in such a state puts her in even more danger. We have to find her quickly.

334
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:47,160
I think she was hiding in the shallow waters and got washed out by the tide.

335
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,030
I'll go in to look for her.

336
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,100
I'll request help from the diver shop nearby.

337
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,880
Okay.

338
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,140
Please help me.

339
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,200
She keeps bobbing above and below the surface in the same place. There's no time to waste.

340
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,030
Ga Eun! Ga Eun!

341
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,110
Ga Eun! Is our Ga Eun still in the ocean?

342
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,460
We are looking for her. Please calm down.

343
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,420
No. Move away.

344
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,330
Grandma! Grandma!

345
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,170
You know well that it's dangerous to go in the ocean when the tide is rising.

346
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:58,490
I'll go in, so please stay here.

347
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,990
Ga Eun...

348
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,520
 Something's weird. 

349
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,630
Ga Eun!

350
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:18,530
Director Kang, Go Ga Eun might not be hiding in the sea but somewhere else.

351
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:23,690
Since she was a diver she would have known not to jump into the sea when it's high tide, because of how dangerous it is.

352
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,120
Do you hear any calls for help?

353
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,360
Please hold your radio high up.

354
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,430
 It's getting harder to breathe. 

355
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,480
 Water is the opposite of land. 

356
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,960
 On land one needs to breathe to be alive. 

357
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,390
 But in water, one needs to hold their breath to stay alive. Remember that. 

358
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,990
 Grandma, I'm really scared. 

359
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,500
 Please save me. 

360
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:40,380
 The sound of the wind is loud and harsh. I can't hear properly. 

361
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,150
Do you hear anything?

362
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,380
Not yet. I'll need some more time.

363
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,890
Focus a little bit more.

364
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,150
Go Ga Eun will be in danger if we don't save her right now.

365
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,530
Wait a minute.

366
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,750
 I think I heard something right then.  

367
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,690
Which direction is it in?

368
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,870
Someone is knocking on an iron door.

369
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,210
 The left. Go toward the left. 

370
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,820
- The left? 
 - Yes.

371
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,840
Can you give me any more details?

372
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,950
The sound is coming from the boat next to you.

373
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,240
 Save me! 

374
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,970
 I think Ga Eun is in there. 

375
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,990
Ga Eun!

376
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,530
 - Wait.  
 - Go Ga Eun!

377
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,820
 What is this sound? 

378
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,680
 It's as if someone is creeping up behind Detective Jo. 

379
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,810
 Detective, someone is approaching you from behind! 

380
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,760
Stay still!

381
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,010
Detective!

382
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,450
Calm down a little!

383
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,760
 This is Dispatch 3. 

384
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,260
 We found Go Ga Eun. 

385
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,110
 The name of the fishing boat is Vimo Ferry. She is locked in a fishing tank. 

386
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,170
I-Is she alive?

387
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,670
- Where? Let's go! 
 - My gosh.

388
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,370
Oh my god! Ga Eun!

389
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,970
Go Ga Eun!

390
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,470
I think it's broken.

391
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,750
It won't open!

392
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,140
My Ga Eun... Is my Ga Eun in there?

393
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,840
 My gosh. Ga Eun! 

394
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,020
One, two!

395
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,580
It seems to be stuck.

396
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,710
 Grandma, I can't do this... 

397
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,200
 This might be the end. 

398
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,590
I don't think we'll be able to open this on our own.

399
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,330
Isn't there a lever around here?

400
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,340
A lever!

401
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,710
A lever! Lever!

402
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,930
Here. Give it a try using this.

403
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,000
- With that? 
 - Oh dear!

404
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,190
Let's use this!

405
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,710
Detective Jo, here.

406
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,210
Here we go! One, two, three!

407
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,970
Again.

408
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,460
One, two, three!

409
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:47,390
 When I said I felt suffocated around you, 

410
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,930
 I was lying. 

411
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,170
 It's all my fault. 

412
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,800
We're almost there!

413
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,740
The hatch opened!

414
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:12,000
 Ga Eun! Grandma is here! Grandma! 

415
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,430
 Hold on! 

416
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,260
 Grandma is here! 

417
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,270
 Ga Eun! 

418
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,340
 Grandma... 

419
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,560
Hang on for just a little bit more.

420
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,820
- All right. 
 - One...

421
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,480
Two, three!

422
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,280
Ga Eun!

423
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,830
Ga Eun!

424
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,850
She's alive!

425
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,430
 She's alive! 

426
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,490
My gosh.

427
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,170
Careful, careful.

428
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,330
Oh, dear.

429
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,150
She's alive.

430
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,770
Excuse me. Hand me that towel.

431
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,570
You're alive.

432
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,430
- Ga Eun. 
 - Grandma!

433
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,870
Grandma!

434
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,170
You're alive!

435
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,180
Grandma... I'm sorry.

436
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,070
It was all my fault.

437
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,310
My poor child.

438
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,690
You are my grandma, right?

439
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:55,310
This isn't a dream, right?

440
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,190
I thought I wouldn't be able to see you ever again.

441
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,860
Grandma, I'm sorry.

442
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,890
I'm sorry I only make you worry all the time.

443
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,350
No.

444
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,020
It was all my fault.

445
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,430
I never understood what you really wanted.

446
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,250
My baby!

447
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,660
Thank you for being alive.

448
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,830
Thank you for being alive.

449
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,830
Thank you.

450
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,420
Ga Eun.

451
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,310
It's cold. Put this on her.

452
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,290
There we go.

453
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,970
Yes, please give her the blanket.

454
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:42,160
This is Dispatch 1. We saved Go Ga Eun.  She's safe now.

455
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,870
All of you worked really hard.

456
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,720
 This is Dispatch 2. We arrested a member of the Black Dragon Gang.  

457
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,210
 But we didn't find any bag with drugs in his car. Team Leader Park, please ask Miss Ga Eun about that. 

458
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,590
Ga Eun.

459
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,820
Please tell us honestly everything about that bag with the drugs.

460
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,140
Where is that bag right now?

461
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,890
I really don't know.

462
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:15,490
A few days ago, I picked up a brown bag from under a rock when I was diving.

463
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,540
 I said, I can't! 

464
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,450
 This really contains drugs. It's made from poppies. I saw it on the news.  

465
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,260
 Why are you acting like a fool? 

466
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,280
 Turn a blind eye just this once! 

467
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,330
 We sell just one of these and we'll be rich. 

468
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,680
 You can escape from your poverty! 

469
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,060
 This doesn't seem right. 

470
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,730
 Then I'll take care of it myself. You keep out of this business. 

471
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,970
Yesterday... 
   - Unni! 

472
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:44,050
I went to So Yoon to try and persuade her once more. 
  - Unni! 

473
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,040
But those guys caught us.

474
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,370
 Looks like we've got a strong one here. 

475
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,400
 Where did you hide the bag? 

476
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,040
 If you don't tell me before I'm done counting to three, 

477
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,330
 then I'll pull out these corneas of yours! 

478
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,780
 I told you, 

479
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,800
 I put it in the closet. 

480
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,720
 We went through everything and it wasn't there. 

481
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,220
 Do you know why this is triangular? 

482
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,950
 Because there is no better shape 

483
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,450
 for stabbing a person's body. 

484
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,900
 I think she died. 

485
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,920
 Unni! 

486
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,600
 Unni! 

487
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,330
Someone stole that bag.

488
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:04,250
She really didn't know where it was.

489
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,960
After going through that kind of torture, there was no way she could have stayed quiet about it.

490
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,490
 Someone stole it? 

491
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:16,250
 If that's the case, then it's someone who knows that the bag was hidden in Chae So Yoon's house. 

492
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,500
 Come to think of it, I remember  

493
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,530
 seeing two women last night, carrying something from the sea. 

494
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:25,550
 I think it was the young female diver along with Instructor Chae. 

495
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,120
 They were carrying a brown bag. 

496
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,020
Do you remember when you gave the bag to Chae So Yoon?

497
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:39,600
It was around 6:00 p.m. The sun had already set by then.

498
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,980
This is Dispatch 3. Can you check how much visibility one might have had in this area on 25th March at 6:00 p.m?

499
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,000
It had been raining heavily after 6:00 p.m. on the 25th of March.

500
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,930
 It must have been very dark. 

501
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:54,740
The owner of the dive shop lied earlier.

502
00:41:54,740 --> 00:42:00,110
He couldn't recognize their faces yet he knew exactly what the color of the bag was.

503
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:04,110
Does Mr. Song show any signs of drug addiction?

504
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:10,350
To be honest, he has this habit of clicking his tongue while talking which really annoys me.

505
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:13,110
He didn't have a dry mouth though.

506
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,170
He would sniff a lot, too.

507
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,150
 No. 

508
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:23,080
 Since she was to be an instructor for children, I only got consent to check her for sex crimes. 

509
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,450
 I didn't know she was doing something like that. 

510
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:29,050
It's called lip-smacking. That and sniffing is one of the side effects of doing cocaine. 
    

511
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,490
What is Mr. Song's full name?

512
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,990
Song Soo Gil.

513
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:35,110
 This is Dispatch 1.  The owner of the Dolphin Diver Shop, Song Soo Gil, 

514
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,770
 gave us a false statement and he is likely to be a drug addict. 

515
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,750
He might have stolen the bag from Chae So Yoon.

516
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,520
Track his cellphone's location.

517
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,180
   

518
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,620
Song Soo Gil's cell phone doesn't have a SIM card in it right now.

519
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,320
Team Leader Cheon, can we track Song Soo Gil's car?

520
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,890
One minute.

521
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,970
   

522
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:00,050
I looked up his car in the license plate recognition system and I found out that

523
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:03,890
32 minutes ago, he entered onto the Woomi Village dock.

524
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,610
This is Center. We cannot track his cellphone's location

525
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:10,530
but we found out that, 32 minutes ago, he entered onto the Woomi Village dock. 
    

526
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,390
That's where he keeps his diver boat.

527
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,620
If it's not there then it means he's out at sea.

528
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,790
At sea?

529
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,000
This is Dispatch 3. Is there a Dolphin Diver Shop boat at Woomi Village dock?

530
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,160
 Wait a minute. 

531
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,570
I'm Park Eun Soo, the Team Leader of the Command Team in the Vimo 112 Call Center.

532
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:30,600
Can you please check if there is a Dolphin Diver Shop boat at Woomi dock?

533
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,100
All right, I got it.

534
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,090
This is Center. Vimo Coast Guard checked the surveillance footage.

535
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:42,220
Dolphin Diver Shop's diver boat went out to sea about 27 minutes ago.

536
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,850
Do you know of any hidden hangout Mr. Song had?

537
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:47,440
He would have done drugs there.

538
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,910
Geumdobong.

539
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:51,030
It's probably the military cave under Geumdobong.

540
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:55,530
When we passed by it, he said it's a place no one knows except a few native islanders.

541
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,340
That must be it. Let's head there.

542
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,760
This bastard knows how to hide well.

543
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,440
We're heading there!

544
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,080
This is Center. Song Soo Gil is going through a divorce lawsuit right now.

545
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:10,350
He was doing well enough to be able to open other branches of his shop, but he started running up a large debt starting from last year.

546
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:17,210
 Two different people going through the same circumstances used the euphoria of drugs to escape from reality. 

547
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,810
We have arrived near the military cave.

548
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,810
We're going to start the investigation.

549
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:29,600
This is Center. I looked it up just in case,

550
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,630
but there was an ancestral rite long ago where they put animals in iron cauldrons and left them in the sea.

551
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,560
Go Soo Dong recently reenacted it during the Dragon King ritual.

552
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:43,140
Turns out that the superstition of one never being caught if he kills someone and puts the body in an iron cauldron might be true.

553
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:48,210
 Song Soo Gil might have used it to frame Go Soo Dong. 

554
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,100
He was probably already aware that Go Soo Dong had a bad relationship with Go Ga Eun.

555
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,400
It's possible he also knew that Go Soo Dong was growing poppies.

556
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,190
Team Leader Park, we have less information on the military cave.

557
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:01,070
 And Song Soo Gil has probably taken drugs right now. 

558
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,440
 Please be careful. 

559
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,760
Don't worry. I've come across such guys one too many times.

560
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,990
What's this?

561
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,200
Why are there so many paths?

562
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:29,000
Wait. Isn't that the sound of someone's footsteps?

563
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:40,920
No.

564
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,440
It's the sound of our own footsteps. It's the echo.

565
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,910
- I'll go this way. 
 - Okay.

566
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:51,120
Be careful.

567
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,920
Let's go that way.

568
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:22,970
When we passed by last time,  Mr. Song said that there were a lot of animals like millipedes or snails around here.

569
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,980
But I don't see any.

570
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,990
If Mr. Song had used a flashlight when he came in here,

571
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,720
then they must be in hiding due to the light.

572
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,530
There are traces of someone stepping over them.

573
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,660
Let's go in that direction then.

574
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,090
Watch out!

575
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,500
Drop that.

576
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,610
Dae Sik!

577
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,730
Song Soo Gil, your life will be over if you kill a police officer!

578
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,090
Drop your weapon right now!

579
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,340
You guys first.

580
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:25,860
Drop your guns. If you don't, I'm going to kill him!

581
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,520
Calm down. All right.

582
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:49,450
The only crime I committed was stealing the bag that she brought.

583
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,150
 If you saw a bag without an owner, 

584
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:10,070
 you wouldn't have ignored it either. Finders keepers! 

585
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:12,820
Did you think it didn't occur to me that I should return the bag?

586
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,200
But you know, don't you?

587
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:21,060
How wicked those guys are?

588
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,860
 Bring her here. 

589
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,190
 Mr. Song. 

590
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,070
 No. 

591
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:24,690
 I can use this... 

592
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:26,540
 to start all over again. 

593
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,520
 Again. 

594
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:36,250
Cut the crap. You were the one who put Chae So Yoon in that iron cauldron,

595
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:41,210
so that it would look as if Go Soo Dong had killed Chae So Yoon after she got to know about the poppies.

596
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:43,960
Isn't that when you hurt your nail?

597
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,530
 Save me... Please... 

598
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:11,090
 Save me! 

599
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:14,150
 Help me! 

600
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:21,310
 Help me! 

601
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,710
 Save me! 

602
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,390
 Save me! Let me go! 

603
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,450
 Save me! 

604
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:58,790
I'd be rich by now if it weren't for the lot of you!

605
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:03,130
No. You're just a monster on a high.

606
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:06,730
A drug addict who killed a colleague for money.

607
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,420
Shut your mouth. You don't know anything.

608
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,440
If you were me,

609
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,890
could you survive

610
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,000
this damned life with a clear mind?

611
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:23,110
These drugs are all I need. As long as I have these,

612
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,810
I can do anything.

613
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:29,080
No. At first, you were able to forget everything.

614
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:33,030
But the moment you started doing drugs, your mind started to crumble.

615
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:37,200
That's nonsense. Money solves everything.

616
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,960
If I have money, I don't need to feel guilty

617
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,820
and my family will come back to me!

618
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:49,090
If I sell this drug, I can start over. I'll be...

619
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:51,180
I'll be rich.

620
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,840
Song Soo Gil.

621
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:59,030
If you really care for your family,

622
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:01,180
stop right now.

623
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:17,000
Damn it.

624
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,540
- Soo Gil! 
 - Give it to me!

625
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,150
Give me the drugs!

626
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,120
 No! 

627
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,890
Team Leader Park, are you all right?

628
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,610
Yes, everyone's fine.

629
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,720
- Damn you! Let go! 
 - Stay still!

630
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,490
Song Soo Gil, you're under arrest for the killing and disposal of Chae So Yoon

631
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:34,640
and for violating the drug laws and smuggling.

632
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,340
- You may hire a lawyer... 
 - No!

633
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,750
...and you can remain silent.

634
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,750
No!

635
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,820
We've apprehended Song Soo Gil.

636
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,440
   

637
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,080
Great job, everyone.

638
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,400
- Good Job. 
 - Well done.

639
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,410
 This is Director Kang. Is everyone okay? 

640
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:55,750
Yes. Everything's wrapped up.

641
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,350
Good to hear that.

642
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:01,600
 So, Team Leader Park may I speak to Detective Shim Dae Sik? 

643
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,730
Of course.

644
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,090
Hello?

645
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:15,620
Now may I assume that you're rejoining the team?

646
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:20,070
 I can have you assigned to the Special Judicial Police. 

647
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:24,200
Welcome back, Detective Shim Dae Sik.

648
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,820
Get up!

649
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,080
Stand up!

650
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,920
Stand up!

651
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:32,680
Hello, Detective.

652
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,740
Did you find Gong Su Ji?

653
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,750
We're still looking.

654
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,040
Any new leads? Do you have anything?

655
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,850
Not yet.

656
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:44,360
They found a note, so they're assuming it's suicide.

657
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:48,730
What's strange is, like the other cases, only her phone is missing.

658
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,940
Everything else was left behind.

659
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:55,260
The culprit you saw. Are you sure it was a woman?

660
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:59,350
Yes. She seemed to be female.

661
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:03,460
No... I'm sure of it.

662
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,550
The voicemail I got was from a woman, too.

663
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:10,460
Women have short vocal cords, so our voices are thin and high.

664
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,920
Men's vocal cords aren't like that.

665
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,590
If a man was pretending to be female, I'd have noticed right away.

666
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:20,480
Or Circus Man is more than one person.

667
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,960
 No. That's not right. 

668
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,390
 That makes no sense since there was only one set of footprints. 

669
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:28,930
Director Kang, focus.

670
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:31,800
You're a voice profiler. Trust only your hearing.

671
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,870
Whatever the monster is, I will catch it.

672
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,640
 In men's voices... 

673
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:43,890
 Gong Su Ji's belongings and what seems to be a suicide note were found. 

674
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,000
 Please send more officers. 

675
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,530
 Come and have a look. 

676
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:53,380
 Did you see that? I have a completely different voice now.  

677
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,550
 ₩3  for 1, ₩6 for 2. 

678
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,610
 Take a look. 

679
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:03,410
 What if the culprit changed the gender of their voice by using a drug or a tool  

680
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:06,420
 to deceive me? 

681
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,100
Detective, I'll call you back.

682
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,500
 What on earth are you doing with your superhuman hearing?  

683
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,720
 Is it too far to hear?  

684
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:31,910
 I'll give you one last chance. 

685
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:41,210
 25, Angel's Town, Unit 206. 

686
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:45,920
 I think you won't have enough time, so I'm giving you more hints. 

687
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,560

696
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:32,330

♪  My baby, go to sleep  ♪

698
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:42,180
 The two people have identical voiceprints. 

699
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,450
 I don't know how they controlled their vocal cords, 

700
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:47,820
 but their lungs, larynx, and vocal cords are identical. 

701
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:52,670
 Then are they the same person? 

702
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,270
Like you said, I analyzed their voiceprints. The woman's voice in the message,

703
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,560
and the man's voice in the video are identical.

704
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,280
But it's almost impossible for one person to

705
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,330
make both a perfect male and female voice. That's nearly impossible.

706
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:38,170
What are you talking about?

707
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,400
Please explain so that I can understand.

708
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:47,070
I'm saying, a man and a woman are living

709
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,730
inside Circus Man's body at the same time.

710
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,300
What?

711
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,260
 It did seem odd. 

712
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:57,310
 She couldn't have moved Seung Ah all alone that quickly. 

713
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,720
 She ran really fast, too. 

714
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,670
 Could it be... 

715
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:02,070
Wait a minute.

716
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:09,340
Hold on. If that's the case, the suspect could be suffering from a dissociative identity disorder.

717
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,700
Dissociative identity disorder?

718
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:16,050
Circus Man could have a multiple personality disorder.

719
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:17,700
What?

720
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:40,350
♫  Come, little boys  ♫

721

please look forward to it.

♫  Yeah, this is a nightmare  ♫

726

And soon enough, I'll make the Siamese twins stab each other with a knife.

727
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,320
♫  I  taste blood  ♫

728

♫  Just go away  ♫

732

 If Circus Man is a man, it explains how he was able to kill all the families and Seung Ah. 

733
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,370
 One of these must be Circus Man. 

734
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:35,630
 Don't get ahead of yourself. 

735
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:38,870
 Once I catch the jerk who imitated Director Kang, I'll leave. 

736
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:40,790
 Are you telling me to stop investigating Gong Su Ji's case? 

737
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,710
 I told you! This island has its own customs. 

738
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:46,050
 Please come back!

 Because of your poor investigation, that crazy psycho is on the loose somewhere on this island. 

742
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,890
 Please forgive me! 

743
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,710
 I'll tell you honestly.
