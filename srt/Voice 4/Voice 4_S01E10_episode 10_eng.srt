00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,450
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's fine.

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,660
This...

13
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,520
Agent Han, what's wrong?

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,090
Bl-Blood. Blood.

15
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,700
By any chance...

16
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,960
are you Center Director Kang Kwon Joo?

17
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,340
♪  My baby...  ♪

18
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,480

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,420
we've met before.

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,680
♪  sleep tight  ♪

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,780
 He has the same voiceprint as the Circus Man. 

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,280
In 2008, a male killer was able to make himself more flexible using the relaxin hormone created by his female personality,

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,250
and escaped through a small window. 
  (Relaxin is a hormone that helps "relax" a woman's body during late pregnancy in preparation for childbirth.) 

24
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,850
Also, besides hormones, there are cases in England and Canada where men made their bodies smaller using correctional shapewear

25
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,460
that confused the CCTV analysis.

26
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,900
Don't move.

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,720
Dong Bang Min?

28
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,570
Center Director, the Circus Man we were looking for is Dong Bang Min.

29
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,520
There are cases where men changed their bodies using hormones to a female personality.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,050
On top of that, if he used special effect materials, it would be even harder to discern.

31
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,650
 I didn't know that dissociative identity disorders were this hard to detect. 

32
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,590
 Are you listening to me? 

33
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,390
Did you think you could catch me with something like this?

34
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,450
Now you need to pay for interrupting us.

35
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,900
 Center Director. 

36
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,400
Detective Jo, Center Director went to Doram Shopping Center to meet a person that was suspected to be the Circus Man.

37
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,710
A dead body!

38
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:14,130
Now, how should I rip you to pieces?

39
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,560
No! She's your Siamese twin.

40
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,050
Get out, you stupid bitch!

41
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,070
Dammit!

42
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,240
   

43
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,200
   
    

44
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,110
     

45
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,560
What is this?

46
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,350
Damn it.

47
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,890
I almost had a heart attack. What kind of person carries this kind of stuff in the back of their car?

48
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,010
- Did you hear that? 
 - There was some kind of noise.

49
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,590
- It sounded like a gun. 
 - A gun?

50
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,740
A gunshot in a shopping center?

51
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,530
You bastard!

52
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,730
This time it's a real one.

53
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,550
Detective.

54
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,820
That man is Circus Man.

55
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,020
Get up.

56
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,410
You're smiling? You bastard.

57
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,510
Why did you do it?

58
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,220
Why did you do that to my sister?

59
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,900
Are you that bitch's brother?

60
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,700
That insolent little bitch tried to teach me.

61
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,970
Detective Jo, you can't!

62
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,050
- Let go! 
 - Detective Jo!

63
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,920
- Let go! 
 - Detective Jo!

64
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,420
Let go!

65
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,610
It looks like he fainted.

66
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,120
He's just putting on a show.

67
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,810
- He's putting on a show! 
 - Agent Han, call 119.

68
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,590
Okay.

69
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,040
Detective Jo!

70
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,640
Please send 119 to Doram Shopping Center.

71
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,300
Calm down. Okay?

72
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,960
Is there anyone who is coming with him?

73
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,060
I'll watch Dong Bang Min. Once everything is settled here, you guys can catch up.

74
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,620
All right.

75
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,190
What did you say?

76
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,130
- Dong Bang Min? 
 - Yes.

77
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,690
He attacked me while speaking in different personalities.

78
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,060
 I'm sure that he is the culprit of the family murder case. 

79
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,490
We sent him to the hospital because he fainted while we were restraining him.

80
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,530
Please allow me to request guardianship or an arrest warrant.

81
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,600
Please.

82
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,650
For now, go to the hospital.

83
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,760
I'll send Chief Yang to get a hold of the situation.

84
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,260
I understand.

85
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,920
Ask Team Leader Park to send more officers,

86
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,400
and look for other clues at the crime site.

87
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,190
I'll go to the hospital first.

88
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,750
Okay.

89
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,460
Yes, Commissioner.

90
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,880
What?

91
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,600
Are you saying that Min could be the culprit that killed Detective Jo's little sister?

92
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,940
I understand.

93
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,880
I will go to Vimo Hospital right away.

94
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,280
 The first preparation for the rebirth of our souls is 
   

95
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,590
 respect for the Deity and an obedient mindset. 

96
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,470
 Next is a clean body and mind. 

97
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,000
 This is because a new soul cannot dwell in a tainted body. 

98
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,760
Wonderful.

99
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,950
You must be at your cleanest when you are reborn,

100
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,830
so protect your bodies well until then.

101
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,390
 - Yes, Mother. 
 - Yes, Mother. 

102
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,960
Seeing you all today,

103
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,460
it reminds me of the day that Yeon became a new person.

104
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,890
She was fine and pretty,

105
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,260
so the Deity was very pleased.

106
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,090
I will go on my way. I have to burn the children's clothes and underwear before the ceremony.

107
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,400
All right.

108
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,200
Yes.

109
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,760
You, Child.

110
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,260
I heard that

111
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,860
you're not of age yet,

112
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,010
but you still wanted to take part in the rebirth ceremony?

113
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,500
My mom said that my legs would get better

114
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,720
if I slept for one night in the stone house during the festival.

115
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,590
 Sir! Sir! 

116
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,740
We have a big problem.

117
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,830
Go ahead.

118
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,060
- Why are you being so noisy? 
 - I'm sorry.

119
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,390
But it's not a normal problem.

120
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,640
I got a call from Gwi Nam.

121
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,960
He said that Young Master was sent to the hospital unconscious, but the police are saying he is a killer.

122
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,290
Hurry and call Commission Kam!

123
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,990
I understand.

124
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,710
Yes, all right.

125
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,900
Detective Shim, they said that this is Dong Bang Min's car.

126
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,290
But this isn't real blood, is it?

127
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,540
   

128
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,870
If you look at the back seat, there's evidence that there could have been more makeup props.

129
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,800
Or did he take them into the building?

130
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,450
Oh right, Detective Shim. There's a makeup academy in this building.

131
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,530
I pass by the building on my way to work and I remember seeing it.

132
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,190
I'll check on it. Can you stay here until the team arrives?

133
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,140
Sure.

134
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,070
I found something important, right!

135
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:23,480
Yes! I have quite a sharp eye.

136
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,960
I was born to be a police officer.

137
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,770
 Agent Han! 

138
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,860
- What happened? 
 - You're here?

139
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,570
I received a note from someone named CCMan.

140
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,650
And no matter how I thought about it, it seemed a little suspicious.

141
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,700
So I carefully saved the information and

142
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,680
told the Center Director, and she trusted me.

143
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,190
You did well.

144
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,610
Dong Bang Min, that jerk.

145
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,970
Is he really asleep?

146
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,190
This patient has a sleepwalking disorder.

147
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,520
He's received prescriptions for melatonin for a long time.

148
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,130
One of the symptoms of a sleepwalking disorder is becoming violent.

149
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,360
So maybe that's why he attacked you all.

150
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,610
This person is a patient suffering from a dissociative identity disorder.

151
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,750
I directly saw him speaking while changing between multiple personalities.

152
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,060
He even tried to kill me with a knife, while looking me directly in the eye.

153
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,400
Dissociative identity disorder?

154
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,630
That's a pretty serious mental disorder.

155
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,880
Min! My Min!

156
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,560
What is it?

157
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,820
Please leave. Leave.

158
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,250
Dong Bang Min was caught attacking a police officer and is a suspect in the Sanggae Neighborhood Family murder case.

159
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,650
Please wait outside.

160
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,180
I am Dong Bang Heon Yup from Sonang Village.

161
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,120
I don't know where you are from,

162
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,750
but get out of the way before we have a bigger problem.

163
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,980
I am Inspector Kang Kwon Joo from the Golden Time Team.

164
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,490
This is Inspector Derek Jo.

165
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,900
Dong Bang Min is a current offender who attacked a police officer while performing their official duties.

166
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,170
I see that you all

167
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,500
don't know who I am yet.

168
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,890
On the way here, I had a phone call with Commissioner Kam.

169
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,650
So you should also let go of your misunderstanding.

170
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,790
My grandson here would never do that.

171
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,830
If my grandson attacked the police,

172
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,400
then shouldn't you all be the ones on the bed?

173
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,850
Don't you think so?

174
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,040
"My family member would never do that."

175
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,950
Does that sentence resolve everything?

176
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,400
Stop being mistaken and listen to my words.

177
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,770
No matter who you are, you have no right to order us to let a current offender go.

178
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,840
Please listen to police orders until he is released from his alleged crimes.

179
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,430
What kind of ignorant-- Let go!

180
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,360
A cane still counts as a weapon. Do not use it carelessly.

181
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,310
Let go!

182
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,260
Please stop.

183
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,430
- Grandfather. 
 - Min!

184
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,780
What happened?

185
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,250
What's with these handcuffs?

186
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,330
Dong Bang Min, I am arresting you as a suspect in the murders of Joo Kang Sik, Yang Hyun Sil, and the Sanggae Neighborhood Family murder case,

187
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,140
in addition to attacking Center Director Kang Kwon Joo. Get up.

188
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,460
- What are you doing? 
 - Get up!

189
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,010
What are you saying?

190
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,680
By any chance, was I sleepwalking again?

191
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,470
What?

192
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,760
I remember going to Doram Shopping Center.

193
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,260
But I do that sometimes.

194
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,360
I go to sleep in my bed, but when I wake up, I'm somewhere completely different.

195
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,680
My doctor says I have a sleepwalking disorder.

196
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,630
Stop lying.

197
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,360
You attacked me with different personalities.

198
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,480
You purposely directed us to that parking garage.

199
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,420
I went there to donate some of my instruments

200
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,620
to the special effects school there.

201
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,410
If you don't believe me, you may call them.

202
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,760
I think I fell asleep in the parking garage,

203
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,560
but I don't remember anything from there on.

204
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:24,660
But I will sincerely apologize for bringing confusion into your investigation.

205
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,690
 What is this?  

206
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,950
  Is the original personality completely oblivious to the actions of the other personalities?  

207
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,660
- Stop playing tricks, you bastard. 
  - Let go!

208
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,590
You don't have a sleepwalking disorder. You have a multiple identity disorder.

209
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,160
Don't you remember what you said to me back there?

210
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,530
Which one are you?

211
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,010
Which personality are you right now?

212
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,580
Let go! Let go of him!

213
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,020
Sir!

214
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,230
I think there is a misunderstanding!

215
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,620
Sir! Detective Jo! Come here! I think there is a misunderstanding!

216
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,130
Detective Jo! Come here! Let go!

217
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,820
 Let go! Let go! 

218
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,560
Min... Min!

219
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,250
Stop here for today.

220
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,870
The commissioner said to resolve the situation and go back.

221
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,230
You're telling me to let go of a murderer after catching him?

222
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,690
Are you insane?

223
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,090
I will put him in a mental hospital right away.

224
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,160
We don't have a doctor that would give Min that diagnosis in this hospital.

225
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,670
It will only make the investigation longer.

226
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,770
So you're telling me,

227
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,320
those villagers are going to join forces and bring him out again,

228
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,190
so I should give up in advance?

229
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,190
From what I hear, you don't have any solid evidence.

230
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,120
Don't you know that there will never be an end to this

231
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,820
if they make a problem out of the fact that you are the family of one of the victims?

232
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,590
Chief Yang.

233
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,260
Dong Bang Min is only telling the truth right now.

234
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,200
I don't think he knows about the other personalities.

235
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,130
If you're done talking, please open the handcuffs.

236
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,620
What?

237
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,960
You want to put me in a mental hospital?

238
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,860
Don't cross the line anymore.

239
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,090
Listen carefully, Circus Man.

240
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,850
No matter what nonsense you spout,

241
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,130
since I've found you, I won't ever let you go.

242
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,700
Listen to him.

243
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,490
What an ignorant bastard.

244
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,250
It's fine, Grandfather. I understand where they're coming from.

245
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,960
It's a misunderstanding if they mistook me for a serial killer. Wait, no.

246
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,200
Detective Jo, when we first met, you were quite gentle,

247
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,030
but today, there's a lot of anger in your eyes.

248
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,690
Since I do special effects, I'm good at reading people's expressions.

249
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,460
- This bastard-- 
 - Stop.

250
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,690
Let's stop here for now.

251
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,690
I have something to tell you.

252
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,860
No matter how far you push him, he's in his Dong Bang Min's personality right now.

253
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,620
Also...

254
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,330
    

255
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,940
We can still request an arrest warrant for assault.

256
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,960
We can put him in detention for now, and look for the murder evidence in the meantime.

257
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,930
Dong Bang Min,

258
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,710
I wonder how long you can keep that innocent expression.

259
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll be watching.

260
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,870
Look forward to the future...

261
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,530
...Very painfully.

262
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,330
You can return with Min. I will contact you again later.

263
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,690
This is why I don't like people from the mainland.

264
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:12,730
Go and tell Commissioner Kam.

265
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,460
I won't stay still

266
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,090
if you guys touch my grandson again.

267
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,330
Don't forget the reason you are living well.

268
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,390
I understand.

269
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,230
But, Sir.

270
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,930
Wouldn't it be better to resolve the suspicious things?

271
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,090
Even if it's your family.

272
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,230
That...

273
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,690
   

274
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,790
You foolish boy.

275
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,460
You should have told your grandpa

276
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,190
if you got a rare sickness.

277
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,190
If you suffer by yourself, you'll run into larger problems later on.

278
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,090
I didn't tell you because I knew it would turn out like this.

279
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,190
It's kind of like sleepwalking.

280
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,160
Or talking in your sleep.

281
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,100
I stopped taking the medication because I was fine for the last couple of days, and it hit me right away.

282
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,870
I won't let them get away with this.

283
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,970
Tell Man Taek to come right away!

284
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,930
It's fine, Grandpa.

285
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,600
   

286
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,130
But why didn't Dong Bang Min's wrist have the whirlpool tattoo?

287
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,300
He probably draws it and erases it, like a habit.

288
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,190
Also, Dong Bang Min had something that looked like an earphone in his ear.

289
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,860
Could it be a special hearing aid?

290
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:09,890
I heard that a German company made a Bluetooth hearing aid that can hear up to 100 meters away.

291
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,100
Oh, let me hear the recording.

292
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,460
 Now,  

293
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,670
 you need to pay for interrupting us.  

294
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,230
 Now, how should I rip you to pieces?  

295
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,460
 No! She's your Siamese twin.  

296
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,210
 Get out, you stupid bitch!  

297
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,630
  Dammit...  

298
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,040
This will do it.

299
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,630
I think Dong Bang Min has three personalities.

300
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,080
Three?

301
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,730
Other than the man who sang the lullaby

302
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,600
and the girl acting like you, there's another one?

303
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,150
Yes.

304
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,470
 No! She's your Siamese twin.  

305
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,760
 Get out, you stupid bitch!  

306
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,630
This part. It's a rough and deep male voice.

307
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,610
It seemed to be the most violent personality.

308
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,440
When he spoke, it sounded like he had asthma.

309
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,260
But here, it sounded like the female personality helped you.

310
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,000
You don't have any clue about it?

311
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,660
I can't understand that personality.

312
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,660
Why did she send the emails to me, and why did she save me?

313
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,510
If we can figure out how these personalities look, it will help with the understanding.

314
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,270
The solid evidence will come from there, too.

315
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,040
 Look forward to the future... because I'll kill you soon. 

316
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,460
 Very painfully. 

317
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,400
 He said he's going to kill him. 

318
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,610
You should've gotten the wound on your neck treated earlier.

319
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,010
It's only a slight graze. Anyway, Detective Jo, earlier...

320
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,930
 Director, this is Dispatch 4. 

321
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:58,680
 Dong Bang Min went to the Doram Shopping Center because of the special effects makeup academy. 

322
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,780
According to the director, Dong Bang Min donates special effects makeup products to the academies in the area.

323
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,170
Dong Bang Min, this rascal, has a clear alibi.

324
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,670
But you arrested Dong Bang Min, right?

325
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,780
The story is quite complex. I'll explain it to you at the station.

326
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,590
Further investigation for a while on him won't bring any results

327
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,180
due to his good reputation and his grandfather's background.

328
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,590
On top of that, he doesn't know his other personalities.

329
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,190
Let's start by looking for Joo Beom Tae's gamer friend that Saet Byeol was talking about.

330
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,110
A gamer friend?

331
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,650
His ID is Ranger. Joo Beom Tae was close enough to him to tell him about Circus Man.

332
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,560
Once we meet him, we'll be able to get more information.

333
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,590
I'll tell them to look into it.

334
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:46,080
Detective Park, track the identity of the person with the ID "Ranger" in the Circus Pierrot Community along with Agent Han.

335
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,340
That child knows Joo Beom Tae and Circus Man well.

336
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,940
 Yes, I'll look into it when I get to the station. 

337
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,370
Grandpa! How can I mature when you keep doing this?

338
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,180
Only your body got bigger in my eyes.

339
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:08,140
You're still a kid. I told you to move to Sonang Village. Why are you so stubborn?

340
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,230
Oh, Y-Young Master! Elder.

341
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,490
Young Master, did you get hurt?

342
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,910
I'm fine. I'm really fine.

343
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,380
Grandpa, I'll go up and rest, so stay a bit more and then leave.

344
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,320
I'm all right.

345
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,240
Ah, Man Taek.

346
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,770
Yes, Elder.

347
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,590
You've suffered a lot while looking after Min.

348
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:40,360
No. Not at all, Elder. It isn't difficult.

349
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,790
Young Master is usually well-behaved, so I'm thankful for that.

350
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:51,220
Has Min acted like a different person these days

351
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,460
or gets angry at things?

352
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,420
Why would he be that way?

353
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,440
Well... he recently keeps inviting his friends to come over.

354
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,750
From time to time, I hear a woman's voice.

355
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:15,600
I don't know if he's shy about it, but he tells me there's not.

356
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,470
Ah, recently...

357
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,920
It looks like he's gotten a girlfriend.

358
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,650
He's at the age for that.

359
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,950
If he doesn't say anything,

360
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,040
pretend you don't know anything.

361
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,580
Oh, yes. Of course. How would I dare say something?

362
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:48,160
You should pack up your stuff

363
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,150
and come here to look after Min.

364
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,350
Yes, Elder.

365
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,790
 Dong Bang Min, you are being arrested as a suspect in the Joo Kwang Sik, Yang Hyun Sil, and Sanggae Neighborhood Family murder cases. 

366
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,700
 In addition to being the culprit that attacked Director Kang Kwon Joo. 

367
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,910
 Don't lie. 

368
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,080
 You attacked me earlier with another personality. 

369
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,960
 Look forward to the future... 

370
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,180
 because I'll kill you soon. 

371
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,980
 Very painfully. 

372
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,760
No way.

373
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,600
How could I kill someone?

374
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,520
No way.

375
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,050
 I briefly passed you, but you remember me. 

376
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:04,400
 I missed you to the point I wanted to rip that pretty face of yours. 

377
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,710
 You have to pay for interrupting me. 

378
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,380
No. No.

379
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,940
Surely, this is just...

380
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,530
my i-imagination.

381
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,570
No. No.

382
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,620
I found "Ranger."

383
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,850
His name is Kim Hae Cheol. His address is Gangwon Province, Yangyeong,

384
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,240
Maeyang Road in the Maeyang District.

385
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,130
If only we could've restored Moon Ah Ram's and Joo Beom Tae's notes like this,

386
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,250
we would've caught Circus Man earlier.

387
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,780
Is this the Maeyang District Station? I am Detective Park Eun Soo from the Golden Time Team at the Vimo Station.

388
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,700
I need to investigate a student living in your area.

389
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,460
Wait a minute.

390
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,140
His name is Kim Hae Cheol.

391
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,270
His resident registration number is 051106-301182.

392
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,050
What?

393
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,220
Is there something wrong?

394
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,170
They say Kim Hae Cheol is currently here, on Vimo Island.

395
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,530
Mister.

396
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,590
It's all right. You can go sleep comfortably at your place in Sonang Village.

397
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,570
Young Master, I can't.

398
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,260
Elder told me to take care of you.

399
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,390
Grandpa, seriously...

400
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,250
All right. I'll be back after getting my car.

401
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,490
Give them to me.

402
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,200
I'll bring it for you. Give them to me.

403
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:02,290
Do you know where my car is? It's in Doram Shopping Center, where I often go to the special effects makeup academy.

404
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,380
Never mind. I'll get it tomorrow.

405
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,450
Ah, it's all right. Give them to me.

406
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,330
It's the place where we went last time, right?

407
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,530
It'll take some time, so go rest up first.

408
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,730
Thank you, Mister.

409
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,760
Be careful, it's dark.

410
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,550
Yes.

411
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,410
Why?

412
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,780
Why did you come out and ruin everything?

413
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,790
Kang Kwon Joo is your Siamese twin.

414
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,590
You can't kill her like that!

415
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,840
Shut up!

416
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,980
If it wasn't for you bitch...

417
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:08,050
Please stop fighting, all right?

418
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:12,150
That's why I told you not to go. That place was a trap full of police officers.

419
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,820
Seriously, you don't listen.

420
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,440
It's not the time... to do this.

421
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,270
We need to team up to survive.

422
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,050
If you don't want to disappear altogether...

423
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,300
before the police come here,

424
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,830
let's get rid of the evidence first.

425
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,520
Ah, it's a mess again.

426
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,640
Try to stop me if you can!

427
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,980
I'll rip you to shreds first.

428
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,330
So you're saying these are Dong Bang Min's other personalities?

429
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,480
Yes, that's right.

430
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,400
But still... isn't it too early to conclude anything?

431
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,720
They're saying that it was due to a sleepwalking disorder.

432
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,070
It's not sleepwalking. He attacked me with a completely different personality.

433
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:42,010
- But arrest is... 
 - A patient like that is walking around on this island,

434
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,890
but all the Korean police do is suck up to the elder in charge.

435
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:50,540
I'll prove he's a patient with a dissociative identity disorder who killed a family of three and murdered Jo Seung Ah, in two days.

436
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,160
Arrest Dong Bang Min immediately.

437
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,400
And what if Dong Bang Min isn't guilty? Will you be able to take responsibility for it?

438
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,500
Dong Bang Min's grandfather, Dong Bang Heon Yup,

439
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,110
is the most influential person on this island.

440
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,040
If that elder is as influential as you say he is,

441
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,120
then he can send his grandson out of the country tonight with the lift of a finger.

442
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,850
If we don't request an arrest warrant right now,

443
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,930
I will expose how uncooperative the Korean police are at the upcoming convention,

444
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,790
and make you pay the price.

445
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,960
Look, Detective Jo.

446
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:35,370
Commissioner, we have no way of predicting what kinds of murder the Circus Man will do in the future.

447
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,890
If you do not make an objective decision, the citizens of this island will be in danger.

448
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,450
Commissioner,

449
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,860
I agree with Director Kang on this one.

450
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,700
Tomorrow morning, I will request a direct judgment for a warrant.

451
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,030
So please be understanding, since we need to check for the truth.

452
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:57,730
Then, you take responsibility for it and the request for the warrant.

453
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,270
Chief Yang said he will request a warrant.

454
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,420
It should be ready by tomorrow morning.

455
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,370
Director Kang!

456
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,020
We found the person behind the Ranger ID.

457
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,910
His name is Kim Hae Cheol, he is a 17-year-old middle school dropout who used to live in Yangyeong City.

458
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:25,370
He was detained for robbing a sauna.

459
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,200
Upon reading his statement, it looks like he has been bullied at school for a long time.

460
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,420
Yangyeong City doesn't have a Juvenile Detention Center,

461
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,210
so they sent him to the one here.

462
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,420
Okay. Good job. Request for a special interview.

463
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,990
I will.

464
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,680
Let's go.

465
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,310
Yes, Sir. The Center Director and Detective Jo

466
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,890
met with the commissioner to persuade her,

467
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,750
and Chief Yang is requesting the arrest warrant on their behalf.

468
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,010
I don't understand why Chief keeps getting involved.

469
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,300
Did you see the background information I sent on the Golden Time Team?

470
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,290
I'll look more into that detective from America.

471
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,350
All right. You worked hard.

472
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:32,680
Sir, according to Gwi Nam, Director Kang Kwon Joo and the Golden Time Team

473
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,920
are accredited figures at Police Headquarters.

474
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,830
The American detective's name is Derek Jo.

475
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,990
His mother committed suicide on Vimo Island,

476
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:45,830
so he and his sister were adopted together from an adoption center when he was little.

477
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,620
His mother...

478
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,560
died right here?

479
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,100
Yes.

480
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,960
Look further into him and his mother.

481
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,440
Yes.

482
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,220
Oh! And...

483
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,350
See if there's anybody on the Golden Time Team

484
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,920
we can use

485
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,720
as our chess piece.

486
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,920
   

487
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,470
You're "Ranger" in the Circus Pierrot Community, right?

488
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,520
How did you...

489
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,990
So what? I didn't do anything wrong.

490
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,110
I heard from Saet Byeol.

491
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,750
That you and Beom Tae were the closest within the community.

492
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:38,770
Kill4You? Isn't he ignorant?

493
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,410
I thought you were preparing for your GED, but you came to the Juvenile Detention Center instead.

494
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:44,510
I'm a low rank on the Badge Team, but I should still have some swag.  (Game goodies you can buy.) 

495
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:49,020
It's embarrassing to say that I'm in a juvie center because I got caught stealing a phone at a sauna.

496
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:54,750
If you're trying to get me involved with Beom Tae, I'm good.

497
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,460
We're here to resolve an injustice done to Joo Beom Tae.

498
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,190
You must have had a reason why you were close with Beom Tae. Tell us everything you did with him.

499
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,790
Geez.

500
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:12,780
That bastard was to be a shuttle his entire life until he died, like me.  (Someone bullied into buying things for other students.) 

501
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,120
Maybe something happened to his head because he got hit so much,

502
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:21,020
but suddenly he said that a policewoman by the name of Circus Man was interested in him.

503
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:25,210
He said that the woman sent a note first.

504
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,960
 I know exactly what you're feeling.  

505
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,810
 You're talking bullshit. 

506
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,480
He said that she would help him so he was testing it out.

507
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,180
He said that if she was a real police officer, she could delete their names.

508
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,350
 The names are on the board! 

509
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:51,160
 What? 

510
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,430
But in a few days, the kids that bullied him

511
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,000
were forced to go to a different school or got expelled.

512
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,620
   

513
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,350
But that doesn't make sense. "Would a police officer be insane enough to help you?"

514
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,630
I told him it was suspicious.

515
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:17,130
But all of a sudden, that lady changed her mind and asked him to pay her back.

516
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,860
  Kill all those oldies that make you sick.  

517
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,850
  I don't understand why we're forcing food down their throats to live.  

518
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:29,760
  Get out of there. Stab all the old people there.  

519
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,730
 It's a little salty. 

520
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:44,570
 - Where are you going? Why aren't you eating? 
 - I'm full! 

521
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,690
  That kid barely had any rice.  

522
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,120
 What do you know? Shut up! 

523
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:00,350
  Those bullies want to know who told on to them.  

524
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,650
 Should I tell them it was you? 

525
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:08,420
 You have until Christmas Eve. Tie up your grandparents with Christmas lights 

526
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,030
 and send a picture of you feeding them chicken poop as proof. 

527
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,740
     

528
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,840
 Nothing will change even if you worry, so just eat your food. 

529
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,370
So I told him to change his phone number and stay low.

530
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:34,660
But he kept saying some bullshit that she'd be able to find him no matter what because she has really great hearing.

531
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:39,740
By any chance, did you hear about someone else, besides that policewoman?

532
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,020
I did! That policewoman said that if he didn't listen,

533
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,740
her friends would kill him.

534
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,090
One person was...

535
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,190
a short but super strong kidnapper

536
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:55,260
who carried around a double-sided ax.

537
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,780
A short kidnapper?

538
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,770
Yeah! I thought he had really gone crazy, so I blocked him.

539
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:06,960
But a couple of days later, the news reported how he had killed his grandparents and himself.

540
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,270
But...

541
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,960
he wasn't that bad of a person.

542
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,810
He was a good kid.

543
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,680
Can you repeat this in court later?

544
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,400
Sure!

545
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,150
What? Arrest warrant?

546
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,000
Yes. First, we'll gain some time with the arrest warrant,

547
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,120
and then we have to find some sort of evidence that Dong Bang Min is Circus Man.

548
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,920
Right now, Director Kang and Detective Jo went to go meet Joo Beom Tae's gaming friend in the Juvenile Detention Center.

549
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,120
Oh my. That grandfather

550
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,980
seems to be respected by all sorts of people on this island, 
     

551
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,890
but his offspring is a failure.

552
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,040
This time, we should make the connection clear,

553
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,630
so he can't do these kinds of things using his illness as an excuse.

554
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,490
I heard that

555
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,670
Director Kang was saved thanks to you.

556
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,750
I just did what I was supposed to do.

557
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,670
Yeah, Dae Sik. Thanks for your hard work.

558
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,610
We should prepare ourselves too.

559
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,290
Should we order some jjajangmyeon to cheer ourselves up?

560
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,890
Sure.

561
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:55,150
Did you know that a new detective on the Golden Time Team made a big mistake a couple of years ago?

562
00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:00,120
Oh, Straw Dae Sik? He messed up real bad at the Seokyung Branch.

563
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,530
He rejoined the team with his connections with the Center Director.

564
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,680
Does he have someone backing him up that no one knows about?

565
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,960
Everyone knows about it.

566
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,890
Everyone already hates the Golden Time Team for putting their noses in other people's business.

567
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:14,860
If they find out that they have someone like him, everyone will go crazy!

568
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,460
 Stop talking about other people and focus on yourself.  

569
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:29,440
If my suspicions are correct, one of the two male personalities planned the murder.

570
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,760
Not to mention, multiple personality disorders arise from traumatic experiences of the past.

571
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,200
Wait.

572
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,550
He said the kidnapper was short.

573
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,320
Then, could it be...

574
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,050
Yes, Director?

575
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,690
Agent Han, I need you to look into something for me.

576
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,030
Agent Han?

577
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,270
We're ordering Chinese. What do you want?

578
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,960
Give me a minute, please.

579
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,440
What are you doing?

580
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,070
The Director asked me to do something.

581
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,860
She asked if Dong Bang Min had ever been kidnapped.

582
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,740
Oh, Agent Park.

583
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,360
   

584
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:37,420
Hey, Agent Han.

585
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,270
Director, I found it.

586
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:42,030
Dong Bang Min was kidnapped in 1997.

587
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,020
I'll send you the information and any news on the kidnapper.

588
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,380
His name is Eom Seok Gu. It says he was the owner of a lightbulb retail company.

589
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,140
He was the person who donated the string lightbulbs and decorations

590
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,390
 that were to decorate the shrine at Sonang Village. 

591
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,000
It says he did it out of anger for not receiving payment.

592
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,110
But the problem was, even after he received the money from Dong Bang Heon Yup,

593
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,710
he didn't return the kid.

594
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,600
This person, Eom Seok Gu, also had asthma.

595
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,820
Only when Eom Seok Gu suddenly committed suicide in a motel room,

596
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,850
was Dong Bang Min able to go home.

597
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,740
Eom Seok Gu committed suicide?

598
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:19,350
Yes. The caller who witnessed it had stayed next door, Kwak Man Taek.

599
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:22,260
But there's a weird connection between them.

600
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,350
Eom Seok Gu's only relative was his father,

601
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:30,630
but he petitioned that it was murder and not suicide.

602
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:36,280
There's even an article on Eom Seok Gu's volunteering and donations.

603
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,630
I can't tell how the story goes.

604
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,480
Anyway, I'll send everything your way.

605
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,560
All right, good work.

606
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:48,880
       

607
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,520
Follow the father's petition. It could have been a false suicide.

608
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,160
   

609
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,520
   

610
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,330
Detective Jo, the officer in charge was

611
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,760
the same detective in charge of your mother's case.

612
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,220
Detective Gu Hyung Tae.

613
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,250
   

614
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,350
The crime has existed from that point on.

615
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,990
And the hatchet showed here,

616
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:25,760
is similar to the weapon mentioned in the report. 
    

617
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,760
We just have to find it at Dong Bang Min's residence.

618
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,210
 Young Master, I brought you your car. 

619
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,030
Young Master—

620
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,270
Wh-Why does the place look like this?

621
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,620
What happened?

622
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,730
A robber? Young Master!

623
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,710
Young Master?

624
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,080
Young Master!

625
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:16,520
Young Master, where are you?

626
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,300
Young Master!

627
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,800
Young Master!

628
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,230
Young Master?

629
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,390
Where...

630
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:49,470
I didn't know we had a place like this.

631
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,900
Young Master?

632
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,290
Are you here?

633
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,320
What is this place?

634
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,800
Is this his workshop?

635
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,800
Gosh, why did he just leave these out?

636
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,220
Y-Young Master.

637
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,890
It's not what it looks like, right?

638
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,390
Th-That...

639
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:10,990
This is just a mannequin you're working on?

640
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,810
Right?

641
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,690
You even know how to lie when you're in a rush.

642
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:20,270
Hold on.

643
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,170
Okay, okay.

644
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,840
Mister.

645
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,020
Good luck.

646
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,950
Young Master? What's wrong?

647
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,790
How have you been?

648
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:43,420
It's been 24 years.

649
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,730
Why are you doing this, Young Master?

650
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:52,130
Why did your voice suddenly... Why...

651
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,830
Don't you remember?

652
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,000
I still remember that day perfectly.

653
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,090
When the blood poured out of my slashed-up body under your lashing...

654
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,060
That can't be.

655
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,800
I'm not sure what you're...

656
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,130
Though I plead like a dog to let me live,

657
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:18,930
you bastards choked me with these and laughed like hyenas.

658
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:24,930
H-How did you know about that...

659
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:33,860
All this time, I've only been wondering how I would kill you.

660
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:37,900
How I would kill you in the most painful way possible.

661
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,790
But that idiot just had to come creeping back out at that time.

662
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:44,510
So I had to let you live.

663
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:49,660
Let's finish this wretched fate of ours.

664
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:32,710
 Someone help me! 

665
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:46,100
Stay back.

666
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:53,670
Stay back!

667
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,920
Stay back! Stay back!

668
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,420
Stay back!

669
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,430
Stay back. Stay back.

670
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:30,220
Stay back!

671
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,900
 Leader is here. 

672
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,630
 Hello 

673
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,860
 You've come. 

674
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,950
 Welcome. 

675
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:04,810
 How are you? 

676
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,720
Our Grand Water Deity wishes

677
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,680
our Sonang Village family

678
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,440
to always remain healthy

679
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,270
and spend a pleasant time.

680
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,870
If that is the case,

681
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:44,090
what do you suppose is of the utmost importance?

682
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:48,930
The answer is health. Health, I say.

683
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,490
This is the very thing that our Grand Water Deity

684
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:13,360
specially made for you in order to treat your sufferings and chronic illnesses

685
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:17,830
with the Vimo Plant.

686
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:26,850
Bad chronic illnesses deep within you will be cured.

687
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,410
I wish you to achieve eternal life.

688
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:35,860
I wish you to achieve eternal life.

689
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,040
Achieve eternal life.

690
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,100
Wish you to achieve eternal life.

691
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:52,090
 I'm telling you the truth. That old grandpa found it but didn't give it to you. 

692
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:55,980
 His protestations of loving you are all lies. 

693
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,090
 A thing like you does not need to exist in this world. 

694
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,930
 Why are you alive? 

695
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:07,030
 Die! Die! 

696
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:08,620
 Min! 

697
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,320
 Grandpa! 

698
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,200
 All of this... Who did this? 

699
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,550
Elder!

700
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,700
Man Taek is here but his condition is weird.

701
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:35,170
Grand Water Deity, please forgive me. Grand Water Deity, I ask for your forgiveness. Grand Water Deity, please forgive me.

702
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,160
Grand Water Deity, please forgive me.

703
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,750
Grand Water Deity, please forgive me.

704
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:44,120
Grand Water Deity, please... please.

705
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:53,990
Hey there man, why is your face pallor so off?

706
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,650
What is going on?

707
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:56,890
Elder,

708
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:01,490
the Young Master has never really lost his memory of that event.

709
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:02,900
What?

710
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,320
Look here, man.

711
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,200
What do you mean by that?

712
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,650
What I'm saying is that in Young Master's room,

713
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:13,120
there is Gong Su Ji's corpse.

714
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,480
But that man who died 24 years ago, has entered the Young Master's body,

715
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,350
so that...

716
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:34,360
It's only that...

717
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:40,400
I must have seen wrong, because it can't possibly be a ghost. Right?

718
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,850
Don't you worry, here.

719
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:46,870
Drink this.

720
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:49,420
It'll put you in a better mood.

721
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,390
Your illness will then run away.

722
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,710
Elder...

723
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:17,070
- Do you think that Young Master Min is really like those detectives mentioned? 
 - Silence!

724
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:21,820
Man Taek 's illness is so severe, that man is talking nonsense.

725
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:26,010
Nothing has changed from before 24 years or now.

726
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:27,250
Yes, I understand, Sir.

727
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:32,870
- Still, shouldn't we prevent the arrest warrant for the Young Master... 
 - I'll be sure to take care of it myself.

728
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:37,990
Chief Yang, that wretch.

729
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:40,100
Elder!

730
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,850
I heard that you have given good advice to our Seo Ha.

731
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,960
I truly appreciate it.

732
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,510
Seo Ha is going to be

733
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:51,250
removed from the three selectees for the ceremony,

734
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,160
so be advised.

735
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,470
Gosh, Elder!

736
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:56,090
Then, what about our Seo Ha's legs?

737
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:59,710
You promised that you would heal her legs if she entered on the day of the seance.

738
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:02,740
You can't even convince your father,

739
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,910
yet you still wish for the Grand Water Deity's blessings?

740
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:06,530
What on earth do you mean, Sir?

741
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,160
What did my father do?

742
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,820
Elder!

743
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,450
I'll handle my father.

744
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:18,690
Whether the leader of the village or the other, I'll do whatever is asked of me, so, please!

745
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,530
- Oh, please. 
 - Get up!

746
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,220
I have spoken.

747
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,300
You two pack your things.

748
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,630
Elder.

749
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:29,720
Elder! Elder! Elder!

750
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,220
What to do...

751
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:35,020
Elder. My Seo Ha...

752
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,770
I saw you sleeping comfortably.

753
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,300
Detective Jo.

754
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,130
This...

755
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,790
I looked into it, just in case.

756
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,830
Sure enough, one photo remained at the orphanage.

757
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:11,030
You wasted your time for nothing.

758
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,000
Detective.

759
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:17,850
If you become damaged due to revenge,

760
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,080
both your mother and Ms. Seung Ah

761
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,920
will become sadder.

762
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,590
They absolutely will not want it.

763
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:28,430
Also, I no longer want to

764
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:32,300
lose a great colleague again.

765
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,290
Nothing you're worried about will happen.

766
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:45,440
Also, I'd like to apologize

767
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,830
for all my misunderstandings.

768
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:57,140
Let's check inside.

769
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:25,410
Detective!

770
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,060
Let's go.

771
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,920
- What brings you here? 
 - My destination wasn't this way.

772
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,150
- Can I find it if I go here? 
 - Yes.

773
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:32,190
Yes, if you enter in, someone else will...

774
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:40,150
   

775
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:19,990
What are you about?

776
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:21,940
How did you enter this place?

777
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:48,560
Who are you? What is your identity!

778
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:57,520
This bastard...

779
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,980
Drop what's in your hand.

780
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,170
Drop your weapon!

781
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:13,250
Remove your hood.

782
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,060
Raise your head.

783
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,930
 Come over here, everyone! 

784
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:37,300
What?

785
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:40,090
Woo Joo, you... you stay here.

786
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:45,690
What is it? Isn't that human hair?

787
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:14,000
Center Director.

788
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:30,560


789
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,730
Dong Bang Min...

790
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:45,960
One moment please, Detective.

791
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,290
Dong Bang Min! Dong Bang Min!

792
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,510
He is still conscious.

793
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,600
Dong Bang Min!

794
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,400
Dong Bang Min!

795
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,860
Center Director here. Dong Bang Min has been discovered with a knife wound to his abdomen in his house.

796
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,490
Please call 119  for help.

797
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:11,090
 This is Dispatch 1. Director and Detective Jo! 

798
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:13,900
 That Mr. Kwak Man Taek who works in Dong Bang Min's house 

799
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:17,230
 just turned himself in claiming that he is the Circus Man. 

800
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:23,930
   

801
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:37,930
   

802
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,450
   

803
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:56,380
 Kang Center and Detective Jo, he says he won't submit to questioning without you two present 

804
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:57,190
 and is holding out.  

805
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:59,720
 - Do you remember where you buried Su Ji? 
 - Look here Old Man. 

806
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,850
