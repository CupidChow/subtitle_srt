1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,710
   

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,550
   

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,180
   

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,600
   

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,000
   

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,890
    
    

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,080
   

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,900
    

9
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,030
 Director! Jang Ye Sook might have been dragged by a person and not by a wild animal. 

10
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,150
Are you saying Jang Ye Sook might have been dragged by a person?

11
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,420
Director, I attended a seminar before that explained lycanthropy.

12
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,710
It's a psychological disorder where one believes that he or she is an animal.

13
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:21,070


14
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:28,600
   

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,860
 The 44-year-old Coach Jung...  
    

16
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,800
 That is when she stabbed her adoptive father... 
    

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,720
 A female corpse in her 60's was found in the appartment...  
    

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,380
 She was continuous sexually assaulted by her father.  
    

19
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,130
    
 (In Greek Mythology, Cerberus is a 3-headed dog that guards the gates of Hades to prevent souls from leaving)
    

20
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,380
   

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,630
   

22
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,050
  
  (T/N: In Buddhism, life is born from one of four ways: an egg, a womb, heat, or oozing forth) 

23
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,730
Wait a minute.

24
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,530
Did the National Park Service install this camera?

25
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,780
No. We didn't install it.

26
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,160
Let's take a look.

27
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,190
- It's a photo camera. 
 - What's that over there?

28
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,890
- It's a speaker. 
 - A speaker?

29
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,820
He purposely hid it, but it fell because of the rain.

30
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,370
Then it's a hidden camera.

31
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,100
Dispatch Team 1 to Director.

32
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,730
 At the top of a tree, someone installed a speaker and a hidden camera. 

33
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,940
It doesn't look like a simple disappearance case after getting attacked by wildlife.

34
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,770
 - It looks more serious than that.  
 - About the Underworld's beast...

35
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,010
I think I saw that in a video from Vimo Island.

36
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,860
You know, that Youtuber...

37
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,820
- Ah, Gamtaeng? 
 - Yes, Gamtaeng!

38
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,580
What do you mean by that?

39
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,560
There's a Youtuber called Gamtaeng that did a video on Vimo Island

40
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,560
and I think he talked about the Underworld's beast there.

41
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,210
 It's possible that the Underworld's beast took her. 

42
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:31,750
Apparently, it allows you to meet someone who is deceased. I think it's more like counseling.

43
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:37,620
Director, perhaps did Jang Ye Sook go there to meet her deceased son?

44
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,380
Team Leader Park, could you send me pictures of your location?

45
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,230
Yes, understood.

46
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:57,340
Agents, we have received the picture. Please compare it with the video on YouTube.

47
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,520
   

48
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,840
   
   

49
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,770
I think it's the same one.

50
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,310
 Ha Eun, how do you know Jang Ye Sook? 

51
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,640
 I met her at Gamtaeng Campsite. 

52
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,040
Agent Park, the glamping place Ha Eun talked about earlier is also called Gamtaeng.

53
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,750
Run a check on the Youtuber Gamtaeng right away.

54
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,210
Yes, understood.

55
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,140
   
   

56
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,010
Director, I have it!

57
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,910
His name is Park Jong Beom. He worked in a pet shop that was accused of illegally selling dogs.

58
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,830
And this is a video related to The Underworld that he uploaded on YouTube.

59
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,490
 I really heard my deceased father's voice. 

60
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,220
 It's all thanks to Gamtaeng! 

61
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,560
 Moshim Forest is known to be the boundary 

62
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,930
 between this life and the Underworld. 

63
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,850
 If you want to meet your deceased parents 

64
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,710
 or your loved ones one last time, 

65
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,030
 I, Gamtaeng, will help you! 

66
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,460
Director, just in case, I also looked up his criminal record and any suspicious points.

67
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,610
And he also has many fraud convictions.

68
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,170
If he has that many convictions,

69
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,460
there is a high possibility he purposely approached Jang Ye Sook who lost her son.

70
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,800
On top of that, since he worked as a voice-phishing agent,

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,410
it is possible he disguised his voice.

72
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,670
Center here. From the circumstances, it seems that the owner of the camera is Park Jong Beom.

73
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,730
He is active under the name of Gamtaeng on YouTube.

74
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,960
He has past fraud convictions and it is highly possible he is committing the fraud by telling people they can

75
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,800
 see deceased people on Vimo Island. 

76
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,460
This is Dispatch Team 1. We found Jang Ye Sook's cellphone.

77
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,240
We will check the messages they exchanged.

78
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,090
   

79
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,820
This bastard...

80
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,810
   
  
   

81
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,470
    
 - Dispatch Team 1 to Director.

82
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,780
Gamtaeng, that bastard, said that he could show Jang Ye Sook her deceased son

83
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,670
and got a million won from her.

84
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,450
I'll send you the messages.

85
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,040
Agent Park, locate Park Jong Beom's cellphone right now.

86
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,760
Yes, understood!

87
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,200
It comes out to 30 Moshim-ro at the Gamtaeng Glamping site.

88
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,610
Director, the geolocalization of Kwak Kyu Min's cellphone turned on.

89
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,100
It is at Moshim-ro close to Gamtaeng Glamping site.

90
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,860
 This is Center. As it is presumed that the suspect has Jang Ye Sook's son Kwak Kyu Min's cellphone; 

91
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,570
therefore, the suspect has been localized at the Glamping site.

92
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,030
I'm requesting the Dispatch Team to go to Park Jong Beom's current location

93
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,960
at 30 Moshim-ro at Gamtaeng Glamping site.

94
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,730
Detective Jo, I and the local officers

95
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,430
will go to Gamtaeng Glamping site. Kwang Soo, you search here with the others.

96
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,540
- Yes, understood. 
 - Detective Jo, let's go.

97
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,740
Let's go this way.

98
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,060
   
   

99
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,020
What is wrong with this?

100
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,810
   

101
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,900
Ah, this is driving me crazy.

102
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,580
What happened to that lady?

103
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,670
She's not coming.

104
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,180
And the camera is goners.

105
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,460
Should I report this?

106
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,050
The speaker should work.

107
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,860
Mom!

108
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,810
Mom! It's me, Kyu Min!

109
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:42,560
Mom, I miss you!

110
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,320
As if she'll know who's voice this actually is!

111
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,050
It's quite obvious, you're Gamtaeng.

112
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,280
Oh, you scared me. My goodness.

113
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,980
You are working hard.

114
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,350
Where is Jang Ye Sook?

115
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,340
Excuse me?

116
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,670
Jang... Who?

117
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,160
- This bastard! 
 - Get away!

118
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,980
Get away!

119
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,750
Where is Jang Ye Sook?

120
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,670
Jang... Who?

121
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,500
Can you do this to an innocent citizen?

122
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,010
This rascal, who are you trying to fool... the police?

123
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,030
You exchanged messages with Jang Ye Sook and set up the camera!

124
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,770
Once we investigate your murders on Vimo Island, everything will found!

125
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,810
Murder case?

126
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,010
I thought that lady reported me, so I fled!

127
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,950
This rascal is still not coming to his senses!

128
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,470
I really don't know!

129
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,610
- ...yo. 
  (T/N: Formal term ending added to words he spoke.) 

130
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,790
She said she wanted to see her deceased son, so I wanted to help her!

131
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,250
Her son died because of school abuse!

132
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,000
Those crazy bastards even fed her son dirty mop water...

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,200
-  My goodness.  
 -  Dammit! 

134
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,700
 - Pour it. 
 - Dirty.  

135
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,520
 Oh, you're so fucking dirty! 

136
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,380
 You're so dirty! 

137
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,140
 Hey, only I have the video! 

138
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,000
 Kyu Min! 

139
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,280
 Kyu Min. 

140
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,480
 Kyu Min! 

141
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,290
 Son! Wake up! Wake up! 

142
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,890
But because those kids' parents were extremely wealthy,

143
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,540
she spent months going back and forth

144
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,080
and won by making them all guilty.

145
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,060
Here, this!

146
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,170
She absolutely wanted to show this to her son.

147
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,090
Is there anything else I could've done?

148
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,790
 "My dear son, Kyu Min, whom I loved so much, those kids finally 

149
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,920
 admitted that they bullied you. 

150
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,340
 This is only the first trial and there are many other days to come. 

151
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,680
 I will not rest and continue to fight. 

152
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,070
 I hope you meet me today and will be able to rest peacefully. 

153
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,460
 I'm sorry. 

154
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,720
 Please forgive me." 

155
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,010
I really just wanted to put her heart at peace.

156
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,830
I did this with an innocent heart.

157
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,360
This rascal is still continuing to spit nonsense!

158
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Calm down and let's start by gathering evidence.

159
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,560
Ah, my arm!

160
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,820
I can't show it to you anymore.  The cameras have broken!

161
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,910
Or maybe the cameras are totally fine and you're lying to us?

162
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,530
Gosh, it looks like you've been deceived by too many people.

163
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,430
That's the highest my volume can go!

164
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,530
Director Kang, we were unable to get the video. See what you can hear.

165
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,460
   

166
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,560
 Wait a minute. There is some sound mixed in along with Jang Ye Sook's cries and the dogs. 

167
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,870
 Like someone is beating something with their hands. 

168
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,180
 After which there's a clenching sound. 

169
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,870
 Could it be... someone grabbing the dog's snout? 

170
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,190
There is someone else there besides Jang Ye Sook.

171
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,870
And I hear sounds that indicate someone might be hitting the dogs and grabbing their snouts.

172
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,310
It's called "Muzzle Control."

173
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,100
A method used by the mother dog to scold her pups.

174
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,250
- I think this person seems to be thinking he's the leader of those dogs. 
 - What do you mean—

175
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,740
Oh... did you just say "dogs"?

176
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:43,540
Maybe that wild dog man did this.

177
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,870
Last week, I went to the shrine to change the camera's batteries.

178
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,590
And then I was surrounded by a bunch of these wild dogs!

179
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:08,260
But some guy in the forest suddenly blew a whistle and all the dogs went to him in the blink of an eye.

180
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,950
- If I catch you trying to get smart with us, your punishment will be heavier. 
 - Wait.

181
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,820
Where did you see that guy?

182
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,970
It was near Tongshim-Sumgol.

183
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,010
Tongshim-Sumgol.

184
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,290
It's highly likely that he was the suspect.

185
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,150
The culprit has probably been living in the forest along with the wild animals for a really long time.

186
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,050
- This is why he's good at handling dogs. Request backup immediately. 
 - Wait... What?

187
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,800
Take him away.

188
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:37,280
This is Dispatch 1. The suspect has been living in the forest and is someone who can control dogs as he wishes.

189
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,100
 A witness spotted him at Tongshim-Sumgol. We're all heading there. 

190
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,510
Team Leader Cheon, is there a way to see what is happening at Sumgol from the call center?

191
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,580
Give me a minute.

192
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,560
It's a forest so there won't be any CCTV's installed.

193
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,070
This is Center. It looks like it's going to be difficult for us to help you from here.

194
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,890
Looks like the detectives on the scene will have to increase their efforts now.

195
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,330
 Don't worry about it. We'll find him on our own. 

196
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,510
    
    

197
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,470
    

198
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,760
   

199
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,390
Director Kang, we have received a call from Kwak  Kyu Min's phone.

200
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,450
Connect it to me.

201
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,480
I am the Director of the 112 Emergency Call Center, Kang Kwon Joo.

202
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,430
This is Jang Ye Sook, right?

203
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,580
Yes.

204
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,440
Officers are currently searching for you in the Moshim Forest.

205
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,320
Do you know where you are?

206
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,790
No, I don't.

207
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,900
I wanted to meet Kyu Min.

208
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,230
He probably came out to meet me.

209
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,420
I left him alone.

210
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,140
I don't have the right to be a mom.

211
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,130
Don't try to save someone like me.

212
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,180
Jang Ye Sook, I can understand how you feel right now.

213
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,080
I know how hard it must have been for you to be alone all this time.

214
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,640
 But you are very strong. 

215
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,860
It must have been a hard fight, but you fought alone till the very end and won.

216
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,920
 And even now, you have come this far to meet Kyu Min. 

217
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,350
 For all this time that the both of you suffered wrongly, you must lead a happy life from here on. 

218
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,710
 And the one who wants that the most, is Kyu Min. 

219
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,120
You should be a mother he can be proud of, to the end.

220
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,180
Yes. I'll try.

221
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:08,340
Jang Ye Sook, can you explain your surroundings to me as you see them?

222
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,570
It seems to be some sort of warehouse.

223
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,130
 I'm locked up in a cage. 

224
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,160
I see a freezer over there.

225
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,860
Are there any dogs around you?

226
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:29,510
Yes. They're big and fierce dogs. They're locked in cages as well.

227
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,360
I think they're the dogs that attacked me.

228
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,120
The dogs listen to that man really well.

229
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,760
 This is the Center. We received a call from Jang Ye Sook. She was using Kwak Kyu Min's phone. 

230
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,740
 She's not sure where she is but she says she's locked in a cage. 

231
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,990
 There are dogs in the other cages. 

232
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,540
Ask her if the dogs have a particularly long, slender snout.

233
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,850
Jang Ye Sook, do the dogs have a long and slender snout?

234
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,610
- Yes, that's right. 
 - She said yes.

235
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,560
If the dogs are trained that much, it's likely that the culprit worked at a horse ranch.

236
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,260
Do you remember the man's face or any of his special features?

237
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,910
 He has a shaggy mustache. 

238
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,830
 His cap covered his eyes. 

239
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,940
And it wasn't just the dogs that bit me.

240
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,810
 He bit her? Then he's really under the delusion that he's an animal. 

241
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:04,070
 Besides if he used dogs to kill a woman then he might have other plans. 

242
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,600
 He came back. 

243
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,630
Jang Ye Sook, you can not provoke him under any circumstances and you need to react calmly.

244
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,650
 - Make sure the call doesn't get cut.   
 - Yes.

245
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,310
   

246
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,670
Agents, look for a middle-aged man who has worked on the Moshim road development or a horse ranch

247
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,500
and is good at handling dogs.

248
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,660
 - Yes, Ma'am. 
 - Yes, Ma'am 

249
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,480
You've woken up.

250
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,200
Please let me live.

251
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,560
I won't talk about this to anyone. Please?

252
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,320
You're polite and pretty.

253
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,770
You smell good.

254
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,820
 Please let me go. 

255
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:25,290
Seeing how you can handle dogs, you seem to be a nice person. Isn't that right?

256
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,780
They told me I could live with my bride if I just did as I was told.

257
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,130
 He's talking as if he's getting orders from someone. 

258
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,660
 Just wait. Let me feed my dogs. 

259
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,820
You guys are hungry, aren't you? Which one of you brought my wife home? Who should I give the large treat to?

260
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,190
Be quiet!

261
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,050
Cho Rong...

262
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,600
you aren't listening to what I say.

263
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,990
You ungrateful dog.

264
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,960
Don't you recognize your owner?

265
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,420
 Shut up! 

266
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,000
Damn it, she died.

267
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,630
If you forget your manners as well,

268
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,690
then you will end up like Cho Rong.

269
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,920
Eat.

270
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,030
 Now that you've had your fill, you should get to work. 

271
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,560
 When he opened and closed the door, there was a distinctive ringing of an iron plate. 

272
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,230
 Could it be a storage container? 

273
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:13,290
He went out and took the dogs along with him.

274
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,220
He's going to kill me, too.

275
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,330
Jang Ye Sook, you have to be calm at times like this.

276
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,630
Jang Ye Sook? Jang Ye Sook?

277
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,150
There's...

278
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,950
There's blood on a highlighter-colored shoe.

279
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,340
There's blood.

280
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,970
Jang Ye Sook,  please take deep breaths.

281
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:50,590
This is Center. Jang Ye Sook is presumed locked in a container.  Seeing that a blood-covered woman's sneaker was also found,

282
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,390
it looks like there is another victim.

283
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,930
   

284
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,370
   

285
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,930
This is Dispatch 3. Radio 1, There is something I need to check with Park Jong Beom.

286
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,720
- This is Radio 1, please go ahead. 
  - Park Jong Beom, 

287
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,250
do you remember the girl in the polaroid picture at the office?

288
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,720
She had florescent sneakers, her name was Lee Seul.

289
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,930
Oh! Park Lee Seul, that punk!

290
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,540
She was a high-schooler from Daejon who dropped out and came down here because her grandmother died.

291
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,260
 She was one rude brat who didn't even pay money and ran off to the woods. 

292
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,950
This is Dispatch 3. Director Kang,

293
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,150
One of the victims of Park Jong Beom's scam was a high school girl wearing fluorescent sneakers.

294
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:38,640
Her name is Park Lee Seul. He says she's from Daejon, so check if she's been reported missing.

295
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,610
   
   

296
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,050
Her uncle has reported that she ran away from home.

297
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:50,740
This is Center. Park Lee Seul, a dropout from Sungan Girls' High, has run away from home.

298
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,580
We were able to get in contact with Jang Ye Sook who is currently missing but

299
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,150
we're unsure when the suspect might harm her.

300
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,220
And there's a possibility that there might be yet another victim, Park Lee Seul.

301
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,530
This suspect kidnaps women using his dogs.

302
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,950
So the container in Sumgol is likely to have somebody in it.

303
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,110
Where is it located?

304
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,810
It's that way.

305
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,510
Let's all head there then.

306
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,590
Jang Ye Sook, the police will arrive in a short while.

307
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:30,210
Please save me. I'm scared.

308
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,780
I see a key there.

309
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,600
- Jang Ye Sook, but... 
  - I'm going to try. 

310
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,130
I'm out.

311
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,520
I think I can walk out.

312
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,050
By any chance do you see another high-school girl in there?

313
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,440
No, there's no one.

314
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,790
Jang Ye Sook!

315
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,600
That man is back.

316
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,180
Are you okay? A man returned?

317
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,730
 That man... 

318
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,870
is skinning an animal.

319
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,990
I think he's back from a hunt.

320
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,960
There are other animal skins, too.

321
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,340
He got a phone call.

322
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,610
He went outside.

323
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,270
Right now is your opportunity. Hurry and go out in the forest and hide.

324
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,960
 I was on a hunt. 

325
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,100
 Well, that... 

326
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,920
Stop right there!

327
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,000
- Team Leader Park. 
 - Wait. 
 - Jang Ye Sook is going to get caught soon.

328
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,800
Hurry as fast as possible.

329
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,060
All right!

330
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,410
Let's hurry up. She's in trouble!

331
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,670
Let's keep pursuing.

332
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:38,260
 He found Jang Ye Sook as soon as he got on that call. Could it be... 

333
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:27,030
You bastard. You're trying to kill me like you did that girl.

334
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:31,900
You're a murderer!

335
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,100
They told me a nice bride would come.

336
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,940
But turns out it wasn't my bride that came...

337
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,260
it was a dog instead.

338
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,530
I was told that a dog that bites...

339
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,140
its snout should be beaten to death.

340
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,390
So that it cannot bite again!

341
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,280
Jang Ye Sook! Jang Ye Sook!

342
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,260
   

343
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,360
The base station signal disappeared. Her cell phone seems to be broken.

344
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,830
This is Center. We have lost contact with Jang Ye Sook. We cannot give you location updates anymore.

345
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,890
All right, we'll look thoroughly!

346
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,240
All right.

347
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,100
Director Kang, we found a suspect matching the requirements!

348
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,180
He used to work on a horse ranch. His name is Koo Up Jin.

349
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,500
He was kicked off the ranch for constantly pretending to be a dog.

350
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,850
He is 43 years old. I have his resident registration number as well.

351
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,610
Agent Park, look into his personal information.

352
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,600
Director Kang, here it is.

353
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,760
This is Center. We have found out the suspect's identity.

354
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,560
His name is  Koo Up Jin, age 43. He grew up with his foster father who used to have a dog farm.

355
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,310
When he was young he lived in a dog cage and was a victim of terrible abuse.

356
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,340
This seems to be the cause of his delusion.

357
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,210
If he suffered such abuse at a young age then...

358
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,990
It's next to impossible that he's doing this on his own.

359
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,800
There's a high possibility that Koo Up Jin has an accomplice that is controlling him.

360
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,050
That's right. They might be trying to get rid of any witnesses

361
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,170
that found out there was illegal poaching going on.

362
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,800
Earlier you said Koo Up Jin was skinning an animal, right?

363
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,840
The first step in stuffing animals is skinning them.

364
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,920
People don't come into this forest because of the scary stories going around.

365
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,220
The poachers have probably been able to hunt very rare animals.

366
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,940
Agents, please find out all the rare animals that are found near the Moshim Forest road.

367
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,500
 Yes, Ma'am. 

368
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,910
    
    

369
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:50,230
"Eight species that are designated as national treasures and 15 endangered species such as badgers live in the forest."

370
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:54,180
There's an article that says musk deer are traded for prices as high as ₩50 million.  (50,000 USD) 

371
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,430
You were right, Detective Jo.

372
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,870
Eight species designated as national treasures and 15 endangered species live in the forest.

373
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,660
One of them is a musk deer and they're sold for high prices.

374
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:12,320
 If that's the case, Ms. Jang has even less time to hold out. 

375
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,140
 I need to focus. 

376
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,580
 There must be a clue among the sounds I heard. 

377
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,700
 I thought they sent me a nice bride. 

378
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,350
 But you're not my bride, you're just a dog. 

379
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,450
 It was faint, but I heard the sound of water. 

380
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,090
 It's not the sound of flowing water. 

381
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,780
 It sounds more like the water is falling. 

382
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,680
 Could it be... 

383
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,520
Captain Park, I think there's a waterfall near the container.

384
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,620
A waterfall?

385
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,850
 Yes. It was faint, but I definitely heard a waterfall. 

386
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,920
 I think it's a small waterfall. 

387
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,860
There's a small waterfall on the north side of the forest.

388
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,110
- Follow me. 
 - Let's go.

389
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,710
Hang on!

390
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,560
I know a shortcut to the waterfall.

391
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,620
Captain Park.

392
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,640
Are you sure we're heading north?

393
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,080
Normally, there is less moss as we go south, just like here.

394
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,260
Why aren't you following us?

395
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,460
Sir, are you sure we're heading north?

396
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,950
Moshim Forest is my turf.

397
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,320
We are heading north, so just follow us.

398
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,750
 We found the container. 

399
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:28,370
Section Chief Go, please be ready with your team in case the dogs attack us.

400
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,400
Officers from Moshim Patrol Station, please block the escape route behind the container.

401
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,350
All right.

402
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,670
You should all be careful.

403
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,820
Hey.

404
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,380
I think he ran away already.

405
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,390
Gosh, a musk deer? It's been so long since they've gone extinct on Vimo Island.

406
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:24,070
This is Dispatch 1, Koo Up Jin has fled the container and is on the run.

407
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:29,370
The freezer and the warehouse are full of rare and endangered animal carcasses.

408
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:34,570
But Director Kang,  if the person who called Koo Up Jin when Ms. Jang escaped from the container is

409
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,150
his accomplice, isn't it still a bit strange?

410
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:43,870
He called as if he knew where the Dispatch Team was.

411
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,010
This is Director Kang.

412
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:52,850
I have something to say only to the Dispatch Team.

413
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,390
What about the clues concerning the accomplice?

414
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,080
You think you'll get them soon?

415
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,830
Okay, let me know as soon as you find any.

416
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,250
This jerk...

417
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,410
Stop!

418
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,230
- Stop! 
 - Get him!

419
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,110
Senior!

420
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,090
Stay still!  Stay still!

421
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,690
Find out about Section Chief Go Deok Hwan from Mountain Recreation Division.

422
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,740
Yes, Ma'am.

423
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,240
   

424
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,990
   

425
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,280
   

426
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,490
He has a firearms license for protection against wildlife. There is a record of him purchasing a rifle.

427
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:07,450
Where is Jang Ye Sook? You told Koo Up Jin what to do, right?

428
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,400
It was Koo Up Jin's doing. It's all of his doing!

429
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:46,830
 He suddenly called me saying he got discovered by a woman. 

430
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,490
 Hey, there's someone here. 

431
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,020
  Idiot! Handle it yourself!  

432
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,940
 So I told him to handle it himself! 

433
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,010
 When it rains, there won't be any traces left anyway. 

434
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:01,580
He was kicked out of the horse ranch, so I got him to run some errands.

435
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,050
 And he went overboard and become as loyal to me as if he were a dog! 

436
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,980
 That girl from a few months ago was an accident, too. 

437
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,540
 Go get it! 

438
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,080
 Are you okay? 

439
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,300
 - Don't come any closer! 
 - Are you okay? 

440
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,350
 Take my hand. 

441
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,430
 Get lost! 

442
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,650
 I asked... 

443
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,090
 I asked if you were okay! 

444
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:04,380
When Koo Up Jin ran after her, she slipped and fell on a rock while running away!

445
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,090
You groomed and used him that way!

446
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:10,830
Go Deok Hwan, you're under arrest for kidnapping, false imprisonment, conspiring to commit murder

447
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:13,580
and the violation of the Wildlife Protection and Management Act.

448
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,030
You have the right to a lawyer. You have the right to remain silent and you will have a chance to defend yourself.

449
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,870
Get up, you jerk!

450
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,190
Come here!

451
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,290
This is Dispatch 1.

452
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,330
We caught the accomplice, Go Deok Hwan, of the National Park Division

453
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,400
and will continue to chase after Koo Up Jin.

454
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,970
Stay here with Go Deok Hwan.

455
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,760
Please secure the evidence.

456
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,590
- Yes, Sir. 
 - Yes, Sir.

457
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,190
Let's go.

458
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,450
Wait. He probably didn't run off to some random place.

459
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,810
There must be a hideout where he can bring his dogs.

460
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,840
Hold on.

461
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:54,020
Right, he must've headed to the fertilizer warehouse just now.

462
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:59,980
You need to apply preservatives after you skin an animal. That's why there were formaldehyde bottles.

463
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,750
Wait a minute.

464
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,590
Speaking of which, the clothes just now...

465
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,450
They were Park Lee Seul's!

466
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,650
Let's go there right now!

467
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:16,720
 This is Dispatch 1!  It's likely that the fertilizer warehouse, where the dogs frequent, 

468
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,730
 is Koo Up Jin's actual hideout. 

469
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,380
This is the Call Center. After arresting Go Deok Hwan,

470
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,870
the patrol officers and the Dispatch Team are heading to the fertilizer warehouse to catch Koo Up Jin, who abducted Jang Ye Sook.

471
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:30,840
119 Rescue Team, Wild Animal Rescue Team, please send backup.

472
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,780
Excuse me, Mister,

473
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,030
I'm sorry.

474
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:00,390
It all happened so suddenly that I was terribly shocked.

475
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,480
It was my mistake.

476
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,120
It was my mistake, okay?

477
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:22,710
It was my mistake.

478
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,620
Let us...

479
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,330
lonely people...

480
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:30,040
live well together.

481
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:35,180
I'll be a good wife.

482
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,740
Yes?

483
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:40,590
I'll be a good wife.

484
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,370
I'm here!

485
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,640
Save me!

486
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,040
Save me!

487
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,120
Save me!

488
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,700
I think it came from there.

489
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,280
Over there!

490
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,200
Let's go.

491
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,580
Kwang Soo, you look around here along with the patrol unit. Okay?

492
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,680
All right!

493
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,880
That way!

494
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,890
Jang Ye Sook!

495
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:27,040
Jang Ye Sook!

496
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,170
Jang Ye Sook!

497
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,820
Kyu Min.

498
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,260
I'm sorry.

499
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:22,370
I tried not to give up.

500
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:29,830
But I'm so tired.

501
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,700
I'm sorry, Kyu Min.

502
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:43,850
Kyu Min, I'm sorry.

503
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:56,220
Jang Ye Sook! Where are you? This is the police!

504
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,070
Jang Ye Sook!

505
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,410
 Where are you? This is the police! 

506
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,710
Jang Ye Sook!

507
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,560
Jang Ye Sook!

508
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,050
Jang Ye Sook.

509
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:58,990
Jang Ye Sook!

510
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:01,340
 Over here! 

511
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,480
 Jang Ye Sook! 

512
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,230
 Over here. 

513
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,720
Are you okay?

514
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,770
We're the police.

515
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,800
This is Dispatch 2. We found Jang Ye Sook near a waterfall in Sumgol.

516
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,770
 She has a severe leg injury. We will be needing a stretcher! 

517
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,790
This is the Center. The victim was found near a waterfall in Sumgol. She is injured.

518
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,900
 Requesting an ambulance.  

519
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,080
 Yes. 

520
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,020
Let's go.

521
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,860
What?

522
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,700
What's that?

523
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,140
Be careful.

524
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,440
So he's using his dogs which are like his family, as a shield?

525
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,580
They're not my sheild.

526
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,800
We protect each other.  Not betray each other, like you guys!

527
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,790
We're different from guys!

528
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:10,960
You're wrong. They've just become docile because of their master's violence. Like what you went through.

529
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,810
Don't be mistaken.

530
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:15,050
You're not their family.

531
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:20,340
You're just trash that leeched off of the poachers so that you could cruelly control their poor lives!

532
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,010
No! I'm not trash!

533
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,290
These freaking dogs!

534
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,060
Watch out!

535
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,530
Get up.

536
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,400
Hey!

537
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,810
Look at what you've become.

538
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:22,800
You go around biting humans because of your inferiority complex! These dogs are much better than you!

539
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,480
What the hell do you know!

540
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,740
You psycho! Stop biting him!

541
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:41,990
No, no, I'm fine. Don't shoot him. I'm fine.

542
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:47,030
You stay right there.

543
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,420
I know...

544
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:57,110
The pain and the abuse you had to go through when you were young.

545
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:01,680
And that you had to eat dog food to survive.

546
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,970
 I told you to do it properly! 

547
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:06,170
 -Come here! 
 - I'm sorry, Dad! 

548
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,210
 Just come with me, you brat! 

549
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:09,150
 I'm sorry. 

550
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,430
 Get in. 

551
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:15,400
 I'm sorry, Dad. 

552
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,310
 Dad! I'm sorry. 

553
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:21,200
 I'm sorry. 

554
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,450
Even if someone had, just once,

555
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:47,030
held out their hand and reached out to you, then you wouldn't have turned out like this.

556
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:52,140
 But is that a valid excuse for you to live like a dog? 

557
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:58,970
If at least for now,  you want to live like a human then you will have to man up and pay the price.

558
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:07,010
You bastard, really!

559
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:14,060
Right.  You just miss people.

560
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:16,140
Don't you?

561
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,690
 Are you all right?  Hold my hand. 

562
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:40,980
Therefore, you just need to get out by yourself.

563
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:46,170
After that, you can just live as a human.

564
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,360
 It's still not too late. 

565
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,150
Stay still!

566
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,810
Stay still!

567
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:40,760
Get up!

568
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:46,390
Dispatch Team 1.  The suspect has been arrested.

569
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:50,390
 The Missing Hiker Jang Ye Sook incident  at Moshim Forest is closed! 

570
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,370
   

571
00:57:55,370 --> 00:58:00,340
   

572
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:03,990
Detective Jo is good at doing his job.

573
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:16,370
Detective Gu, is it possible to speak with Jang Ye Sook for a minute?

574
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,000
Yes.

575
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,460
I got it.

576
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:34,910
Excuse me... Can you speak to her for a moment?

577
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,730
 Ms. Jang Ye Sook, thank you. 

578
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:49,700
Thanks to you, we could prevent more victims and save animals as well.

579
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:56,530
If Kyu Min watched this, he would be really proud of you.

580
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:58,770
Thank you.

581
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:03,000
This is all thanks to you, Center Director, and the detectives.

582
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:05,430
 Oh! 

583
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:11,630
The sneaker earlier... the woman...

584
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,790
 Jang Ye Sook, 

585
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:28,410
don't forget today and live happily.

586
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,180
Okay, I'll...

587
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,620
I'll try.

588
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,480
 Oh, Center Director. 

589
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:45,060
The dog that saved me earlier...  I need to find it.

590
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,160
Hold on a moment!

591
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,120
- Give it to me. 
 - Ah, yes.

592
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,640
Here.

593
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:07,930
It seems like it was bullied and attacked by other dogs for a long time.

594
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,980
Thank you...

595
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:22,070
for saving me.

596
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:27,650
I'll come back for it for sure, so please take care of it for a few days.

597
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:30,730
Don't send it anywhere else.

598
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,230
Yes, I understand.

599
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:41,330
Excuse me!  Wait a minute.

600
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,460
I'm Detective Derek Jo from LAPD.

601
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,460
I have something to ask her regarding another murder case.

602
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,820
I'm sorry to say this, but we have to get to the hospital in a hurry.

603
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,520
Wait a moment.

604
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,820
It looks like it's an important matter.  Please ask me.

605
01:00:54,790 --> 01:01:01,570
By any chance, did you see this woman on the airplane to Vimo Island?

606
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:12,740
Actually, I fell asleep right after I took my depression medicine.

607
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:14,550
Think a little harder, please.

608
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:18,110
- Even during boarding— 
 - It's fine.

609
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:29,070
Your son must know now

610
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:32,370
how hard you've tried.

611
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,720
Therefore, don't blame yourself too much.

612
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:19,870
   

613
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,000
 Mom! Mom! 

614
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,610
 Mom! 

615
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,910
 Mom! Mom! 

616
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:26,880
 No! 

617
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,600
 This is not real! 

618
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,830
 Mom!  

619
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:32,080
 Mom!  

620
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:46,410
Cap! I finished investigating by questioning 6 people out of 7.

621
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:48,160
All of them have solid alibis.

622
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:53,070
But we can only visit and question Gong Soo Ji tomorrow, because of her acute appendectomy.

623
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:58,100
What? As soon as she arrived, did she have surgery done?

624
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,430
I feel odd so I'm keeping an eye on her at the hospital.

625
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:06,820
Her father is a chief prosecutor and divorced.  So a caregiver is taking care of her.

626
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,160
Yes. What's up?

627
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,380
I think everything went well, because of you, Detective Jo.

628
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,470
Although you must've been having a hard time.

629
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:22,880
It was done for each other's needs, so no need for flattery.

630
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,640
I understand.

631
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,110
Is the investigation by questioning going well?

632
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:32,460
Yes, everybody has their own alibi.  Only one person is left and we'll question her tomorrow.

633
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,870
She was admitted to the hospital due to acute appendicitis.

634
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:36,860
Admitted to the hospital?

635
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,140
- The LA police officer that you mentioned earlier? 
 - Yeah.

636
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:44,480
He's been staying there like that because he has something to ask the patient in Room 507 tomorrow morning.

637
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,740
The patient in Room 507?

638
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,880
Well...  Did she get into trouble in the States then flee or something like that?

639
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,250
That's what I'm saying.

640
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:54,450
I'm going to go home right after changing the IV.

641
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,520
Nurse Sim, hurry and come!

642
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,370
What happened?

643
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,790
We need to find her.

644
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,810
Chad!  She's gone.

645
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:33,530
I don't know.  I just stepped out for a minute, now she's gone.

646
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,190
I'm going to look for her now.

647
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:41,010
Just keep calm and I'll call you back.

648
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,800
Cap!

649
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,160
Cap! Gong Soo Ji has gone missing!

650
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,310
What?

651
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:47,230
What do you mean?

652
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:49,430
Nick says it happened when he was in the bathroom.

653
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:52,430
- Let's move to the hospital. Secure the CCTV. 
 - All right.

654
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,590
I'll call you back later.

655
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:56,820
Hold on a minute.  I'll come there, too.

656
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,530
 My baby, sleep tight. 

657
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:10,160
 Go to sleep. 

658
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,530
 My baby, go to sleep. 

659
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:17,790
 My baby won't go to sleep. 

660
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:24,750
 My baby, go to sleep. 

661
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:28,330
 My baby, go to sleep. 

662
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:34,270
 My baby, go to sleep. 

663
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:43,760
♫  Come little boys, Come little girls, Here this is for you, Come up here  ♫

664
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:49,470
♫  Don’t run away, Don’t cross the line, Yeah, this is a nightmare  ♫

665
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:55,440
♫  Now, I lay me down to sleep, I'm in my bed  ♫

666
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,680
♫  I've tasted blood, Yeah, it's so sweet  ♫

667
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,040
   
   

668
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:14,090
    

669
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:19,270
   

670
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:25,680


671
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:29,160
   

672
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:33,230
 Seung Ah, I'll make them pay thousands more than all the pain they caused you. 

673
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:37,820
 Did you know that Detective Shim Dae Sik lives on Vimo Island? 

674
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:39,810
 Please return to the Golden Time Team. 

675
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:41,730
 Don't they have other good detectives? 

676
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,840
 Why did you come and see a corrupt cop like me? 

677
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,670
 I'm the administrator of the Golden Time Team Fan Forum. 

678
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:48,410
 I want to do something as awesome and meaningful as your team. 

679
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:52,390
 The more I look for Circus Man, the more horrified I am. 

680
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:54,740
 That's why we must catch her... 

681
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:57,700
 with your ability, Director Kang. 

682
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:01,000
♫  Can I reach your voice?  ♫
