1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,450


2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,910
   

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,450
   

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,190
   

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,820
   

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,660
   

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:33,830
   
   

8
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,040
   

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,230
    

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,480
Hey, you, Mr. Garbage.

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,270
 Once I say "action," hit the fraudster's face with that bat. 

12
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,000
 Let all your anger out. 

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,620
If this isn't on a legendary level, then I'll put that fraud's private photos on the live broadcast.

14
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,810
Director Jang, we're connected to the live broadcast now.
    

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,880
 Today is a legendary broadcast. 

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,000
 Let's sit back and watch how this asshole and bitch learn their lesson. 

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,310
 Let's film something legendary. 

18
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,390
 Let's go. 

19
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,850
   

20
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,770
Agent Han, play that last part once again.

21
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,150
Yes, understood.

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,280
   

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,900
 Doing this won't change a thing. 

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,020
 "Doing this won't change a thing." 

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,000
 That's what he just said. 

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,880
Turn off your phone and take out your SIM card.

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,420
Or else, as I told you, I'll release Kwon Saet Byeol's private photos.

28
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,530
Do you think I wouldn't know who is ordering me?

29
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,680
You also know how severe this crime is.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,520
Stop blaming others.

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,930
It's your fault for meeting that crazy bitch.

32
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,150
If you want to torment someone, do it to me.

33
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,720
 What sin did Saet Byeol commit? 

34
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,910
 She's an innocent high schooler. I'll give you the money. 

35
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,470
 I'll give you the money. 

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,790
I want to do that too, but...

37
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,130
 That bitch is part of the option. 

38
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,890
My pockets are quite empty, so I'm in the middle of a special broadcast.

39
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:24,570
Oh? I told you not to do useless things. That door will never open.

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,430
   

41
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,660
   

42
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,150
It's over there!

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,460
This is Dispatch 3. Detective Shim, Detective Park, and I are going in.

44
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,460
Detective Jo, please turn up your radio volume, so that I can keep hearing the sounds at the scene.

45
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,820
With as many subscribers as I have, burying someone is no big deal.

46
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:05,650
You know it too, Mr. Jang. Once this goes viral, the truth won't matter anymore.

47
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,150
I'm sorry, Saet Byeol.

48
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,820
 I'll do what you ask. 

49
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,320
 So, delete Saet Byeol's pictures. 

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,520
Finally, you understand my words!

51
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,900
 Then, the broadcast is starting. 

52
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,970
   

53
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,190
   
   

54
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:19,350
   

55
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,380
What are you doing? Hurry up and finish it up! The sun will rise again!

56
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,460
 Hurry up and do it! Everyone is waiting for you! 

57
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,470
What is it?

58
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,490
   

59
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,010
   

60
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,890
 What happened? 

61
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,980
It's been disconnected. He probably figured out the police were there and fled.

62
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,790
This is Center. Pigdiss seemed to have figured out we were tracking him and stopped broadcasting.

63
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,630
There is a chance he will fleeâ€”

64
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,490
 Detective Jo, I heard footsteps behind you. 

65
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,140
Stop!

66
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,350
We are the police.

67
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,920
You scared, right? It's all right now.

68
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,610
Student, where did Jang Hyo Joon go?

69
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,760
That jerk Pigdiss dragged him away.

70
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,060
Mr. Jang seemed to know why that jerk was doing all of this!

71
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,690
Please save my teacher! Please!

72
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,660
Please look after the student. We'll go out and find him.

73
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,480
The culprit seems to have kidnapped Jang Hyo Joon. They shouldn't have gone too far.

74
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,750
Detective Shim and I will look outside, so you two look inside.

75
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,770
- Yes. Let's start from the top. 
 - Yes.

76
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,120
- Let's go. 
 - Yes.

77
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,620
- Hyungnim! 
 - What?

78
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,590
What is it?

79
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,610
It's still warm.

80
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,420
Director, it looks like Pigdiss was broadcasting right up to now.

81
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,690
 It's a chloroform anesthetic. 

82
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,230
 This is Dispatch 3. It looks like the culprit ran away through the underground parking with Jang Hyo Joon. 

83
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,430
Agent Han, please check if they've left the underground parking or not.

84
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,930
- Hurry and check the CCTV. 
 - Yes.

85
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,720
Director, I just checked and it's not by car. It's by motorcycle.

86
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,690
 The plate is Vimo Vimo Ga 5038. 

87
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,970
 A man wearing a black suit is riding alone. 

88
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,120
Team Leader Cheon, please look up the owner of the motorcycle.

89
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,030
- Agent Han, look through case files to see if Pigdiss has ever been sued and find his name and his personal information.  
 - Yes, give me a minute.

90
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,820
This is Center. Two minutes ago, the man who is assumed to be Pigdiss escaped from Beach Queen Motel

91
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,090
on a black motorcycle with the plate: Vimo Vimo Ga 5038.

92
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,980
The culprit is also wearing a black shirt.

93
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,630
As of now, there is no trace of Jang Hyo Joon.

94
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,600
I'll request the nearby station to track down the motorcycle with that number plate.

95
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,380
Continue to search. We need to catch him to know where Jang Hyo Joon is.

96
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,850
Agents, we must find him quickly!

97
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,650
Team Leader Park, is Jang Hyo Joon not in the motel?

98
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,260
 We looked all the way to the rooftop. He doesn't seem to be in here. 

99
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,000
Director, I found the motorcycle!

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,360
Move it, you bastard!

101
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,020
This is Center. The motorcycle went in the direction of the alley on 20th Road in Sangyeon's 4th district.

102
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,260
 Please chase after him. 

103
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,460
If it's Road 20, then this is a shortcut.

104
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,070
- Ah!  
 - Are you okay?

105
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,290
- Shit!  Dammit. 
 - Catch him!

106
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,650
- Move it! 
 - Hey, you bastard!

107
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,290
- Stop there! 
 - Never!

108
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,740
Director, the motorcycle was just discarded in front of the alley.

109
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,430
This is Center. It seems that the culprit is running on foot after discarding the motorcycle.

110
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,000
He shouldn't have made it very far. It's around 1-38 of Sangyeon Alley 5.

111
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,790
There!

112
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,240
- Damn it! 
 - Shit!

113
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,380
Crap!

114
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,770
   

115
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,810
- Detective Shim! 
 - Get that bastard!

116
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,510
- Don't come closer! Stay away. 
 - Stop there!

117
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,310
Get down.

118
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,680
- Damn it! Don't come close. 
 - Don't waste your strength and get down.

119
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,130
I'm going to jump. I'm really going to jump!

120
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,910
- Get down! 
 - Shit!

121
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,670
Stop right there!

122
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,280
Did you think you'd be fine after acting like trash?

123
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,190
You're under arrest for kidnapping, imprisonment, blackmail,

124
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,910
defamation, and breaching the Communications Act.

125
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,940
You have the right to an attorney and the right to remain silent.

126
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,750
It wasn't me.

127
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,300
I'm not Pigdiss or whatever!

128
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,950
This bastard. Get up!

129
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,260
   

130
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,730
Director Kang, I found out Pigdiss's identity.

131
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,380
I found his name under the plaintiffs in one of the cases he talked about.

132
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,130
   

133
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,510
Director Kang, I have sent you the motorbike owner's details.

134
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,710
This is Center. We have Pigdiss's identity.

135
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,310
His name is Bum Tae Soo. His Identification number is

136
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,510
950317-185923.

137
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,390
He has been sued multiple times for defamation so he is under a lot of debt.

138
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,780
 His HotTV channel is on the verge of being shut down. 

139
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,280
And he is the owner of the motorcycle. I'll send you the pictures.

140
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,820
Damn.

141
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,750
You scumbag!

142
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,300
Look. It's obviously you, so cut the bullshit. Tell me now.

143
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,700
Tell me now. Where did you hide Jang Hyo Joon?

144
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,660
I really don't know.

145
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,330
I only did the accusation broadcast!

146
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,930
Then I heard the police were coming.

147
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:01,250
I am an independent journalist that works for the public interest. You can't treat me like this!

148
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,650
Journalist?

149
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,970
A piece of trash like you?

150
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,530
Okay, fine. I'm going to quit the police force soon.

151
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,660
It doesn't matter if I lose my badge over you.

152
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,040
- Bite down! 
 - A woman!

153
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,630
What?

154
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,350
Some woman made me do it.

155
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,190
She said some scumbag of a school teacher

156
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,640
toyed with her.

157
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,380
 She said if I just screw up his life, 

158
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,120
 she'll pay me as much as I want. 

159
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,220
You bastard, you call that an excuse?

160
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,540
- Shut up! 
  - That's enough. Calm down, calm down.

161
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,150
- Gosh. 
 - Hold on.

162
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,380
- Where is the anesthetic? 
 - What anesthetic?

163
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,060
- The anesthetic! 
 - What do you mean?

164
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,960
What is that?

165
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,970
It might not be this guy.

166
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,820
Whoever took Mr. Jang Hyo Joon would have had the smell of anesthetic on their hands. It's not him.

167
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,690
   

168
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,350
You know more about this woman, don't you? Tell us now!

169
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,090
Now!

170
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,380
If you don't, you could be arrested right here for a false accusation.

171
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,880
Well...

172
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,800
When I was completely in the dumps after being sued,

173
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,950
someone with the ID of "QueenzCrown" sent me an email.

174
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,490
 I needed money fast, 

175
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,250
 and she said she would give me a big donation. 

176
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,890
   

177
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,230
   

178
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,170
 I mean, talking about rich people or affairs always goes viral. 

179
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,850
Director! The culprit is someone with the ID "QueenzCrown."

180
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,420
Tell Agent Han to go through Jang Hyo Joon's email list.

181
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,590
All right.

182
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,260
What else?

183
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,960
Well, I saw her once.

184
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,020
When she came to give me the money, she came in a heavily tinted car.

185
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,250
When she was paying me through a small crack in the window,

186
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,420
she told me to make sure I did the broadcast in an unmanned motel.

187
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,580
She even told me how to lure Kwon Saet Byeol by using Telenote.

188
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,720
Did you see her face?

189
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,090
She barely pulled the window down. How could I have seen anything?

190
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,150
Oh, I did smell something weird.

191
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,290
Like a dentist's smell.

192
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,440
Like disinfectant.

193
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,430
Director Kang, I restored Mr. Jang Hyo Joon's emails. All of them seem to be from QueenzCrown.

194
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,420
There are 5,000 emails in just the last three months.

195
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,360
She sure has a crazy obsession.

196
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,790
Because of the malicious comments from this user, he had to close his blog which he used to communicate with his students.

197
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,520
- Who does this ID belong to? 
 - They left this site a month ago so it will take me some time to find out.

198
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,400
- Make it quick. 
 - Yes.

199
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,500
This is Center. Agent Han restored Mr. Jang Hyo Joon's emails.

200
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,280
He says in the last three months, there have been more than 5,000 emails from the ID: QueenzCrown.

201
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,520
QueenzCrown has deleted their account. Agent Han is trying to identify the person behind the account.

202
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,900
I have heard 40% of murderers stalk their victims before killing them.

203
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,560
People don't know just how serious it is.

204
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,120
If she was able to warn Bum Tae Soo, then she must have been watching from somewhere.

205
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,170
If she ran away us,ing a car or a taxi

206
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,900
then she must have been caught on a CCTV somewhere.

207
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,980
Team Leader Park and Detective Gu, look around here. Detective Shim and I will go back to the motel.

208
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,770
Yes.

209
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,050
Take him to the station.

210
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,620
- Kwang Soo, let's go this way. 
 - Okay.

211
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,290
Hey.

212
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,290
Why...

213
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,200
I warned you.

214
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,290
That if you ignored me once more,

215
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,990
I would do something about it.

216
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,090
What are you doing? Don't do it. Don't do it.

217
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,730
However much I love you,

218
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,220
I have my limits.

219
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,280
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

220
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,410
I got rid of that bothersome teacher for you.

221
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,450
How dare she hit on you when she was already married?

222
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,120
I said I'd kill her if she smiled at you again.

223
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,600
I sent that kind of message to her social media account every night.

224
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,380
She still didn't get the message

225
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,990
and called the police.

226
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,820
Eventually, I had to send her dog over the "rainbow bridge."

227
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,720
I did all that for you! And you?

228
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,690
You hung out with that brat, Saet Byeol.

229
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,220
So...

230
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,730
I must punish you this time.

231
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,200
Don't worry.

232
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,680
I will grind your food very fine

233
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,770
and feed you every spoonful.

234
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,260
Detective Park, Bum Tae Soo is Pigdiss, but not the real culprit.

235
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,490
Ask Saet Byeol if she remembers anything else.

236
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,420
Okay.

237
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,260
What about my teacher, did you find him?

238
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,060
Not yet.

239
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,400
Don't worry too much. We will find him.

240
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,390
Earlier, when your teacher was taken away,

241
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,780
did you hear anything?

242
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,460
My eyes were covered, so I'm not sure.

243
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,700
Wait. I did hear something strange.

244
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,070
When Mr. Jang came to find me, the door just opened with a creak.

245
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,640
When Mr. Jang was taken away by that bastard,

246
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,580
I heard a rolling sound.

247
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,390
A different door sound?

248
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,750
You know like a door that's pushed sideways.

249
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,030
Director Kang, when Jang Hyo Joon came in and was taken out, the door sounded different.

250
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,160
The door sounded different?

251
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,950
Hang on.

252
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,230
Agent Ko, can we find the floor plans of the motel?

253
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,140
Yes. The District Office should have a copy on hand for fire safety reasons.

254
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:47,590
Architecture Department of Sangyeon District Office, right? I need the floor plans for Vimo Beach Motel on 62 Sangyeon Coastal Road.

255
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,860
Yes. I have them. Thanks a lot.

256
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,810
Director, I sent you the floor plans.

257
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,140
Agent Ko, Room 106 looks much larger here than the room we saw in the video.

258
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,770
Oh, the thing is...

259
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,060
Our island is a popular tourist destination,

260
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:09,230
so some motels divide their rooms and turn some into sound-proofed illegal entertainment rooms.

261
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,680
 They split the room in half and make a hidden room. 

262
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,260
Detective Park, the culprit might have taken Jang Hyo Joon to a hidden room in the motel.

263
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,510
There's a hidden room... in here?

264
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,420
Can you help me with this?

265
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,780
Wait here.

266
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,020
   

267
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,390
Director Kang, there are stairs to the basement inside the hidden room.

268
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,010
I'll go check it first.

269
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,700
Hold on.

270
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,230
 This is Center. There was a hidden room in Room 106 with a passage that leads to the basement. 

271
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,830
Detective Park is there.

272
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,060
 Please hurry over to Room 106. 

273
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,290
 Detective Park! Detective Park! 

274
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,620
- Over here. 
 - This is the center. Detective Park is in danger.

275
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,680
 Sangyeon Patrol Station, block every entrance to the parking lot. 

276
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,200
Detective Park!

277
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,220
Detective Park, are you okay?

278
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,440
I'm okay. She went inside that room.

279
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,160
Mr. Jang Hyo Joon.

280
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,580
Are you okay?

281
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,620
Th-That woman is Min Hye Rin.

282
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,100
She is... She's a stalker.

283
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,570
She's the dentist at the Min Dental Clinic in Deokgeun District, where I used to live.

284
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,750
She's the director there. Even when I reported her,

285
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,610
all they could do was charge her with defamation and issue a restraining order.

286
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,710
There was no way to stop her.

287
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,670
You're safe now, so don't worry.

288
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:54,030
This Dispatch Three. We identified the suspect.

289
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,750
Her name is Min Hye Rin. She's the director and a dentist at Min Dental Clinic in Deokgeun District where Mr. Jang used to live.

290
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,660
She's been stalking him for a long time.

291
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,890
She dropped the gauze somewhere else to confuse us.

292
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,310
Please send us an ambulance immediately!

293
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:08,270
Agent Han, look up Min Hye Rin who runs the Min Dental Clinic in Deokgeun District.

294
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,760
Yes, Ma'am.

295
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,790
    
    

296
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,310
I found her.

297
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,660
   
 Team Leader Cheon, can you look up the owner of Vimo Beach Queen Motel?

298
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,320
Yes, Ma'am.

299
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,540
It's owned by Min Kyeong Seob, Min Hye Rin's father.

300
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:36,730
This is the center. Just as Detective Jo said, Min Hye Rin runs a dental clinic in the building where Mr. Jang lived.

301
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,840
Also, her father is the owner of Vimo Beach Queen Unmanned Motel.

302
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,750
That must be why she told Pigdiss to use that place.

303
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,260
At first,

304
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,120
she seemed like a nice person,

305
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,790
so I asked her out to dinner.

306
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,250
But later, she seemed unstable,

307
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,830
so I kept my distance from her.

308
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,780
 - Goodbye. 
 - Bye, guys. 

309
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,650
 Why won't you come to the clinic? 

310
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,080
 I can only see you when your teeth ache? 

311
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,690
 Should I make that happen? 

312
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,780
She kept contacting me,

313
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,110
so I snapped at her.

314
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,870
I kept blocking her number, but she'd get a burner phone

315
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:25,180
to contact and harass me. She just wouldn't stop.

316
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,280
 You're home. 

317
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,570
She was in my apartment in her nightgown.

318
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,630
Please help me, Detective.

319
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,790
I want to escape from this nightmare.

320
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,250
It's all right now.

321
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,240
Director Kang, this is Dispatch Three.

322
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,980
It seems like Mr. Jang's anxiety was due to excessive stalking.

323
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,520
Team Leader Park. Detective Gu. Find the exit from the basement and block it off. We'll look for her in here.

324
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,750
 This is Dispatch Two. Roger that. 

325
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,350
 Be careful. 

326
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,500
All right.

327
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,400
Please wait right here. Let's go.

328
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,290
Detective Shim, go that way. I'll search the back.

329
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,170
- Yes, sir. 
 - All right.

330
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,530
Do you hear anything?

331
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:57,770
Everything sounds far. Maybe it's because it's the basement.

332
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,890
 The ambulance just got there. 

333
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,770
Freeze!

334
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,260
You need to pay for it since you got in the way of my romance.

335
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,880
Min Hye Rin.

336
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,250
Detective Jo!

337
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,130
It usually takes a gram of that

338
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,520
to kill a dog.

339
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,390
So I calculated to see how much it'd take to kill a human.

340
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,710
 Detective Jo's breathing is getting too heavy. 

341
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,760
 It usually takes a gram of that 

342
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,520
 to kill a dog. 

343
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,550
 So I calculated to see how much it'd take to kill a human. 

344
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,990
Detective Shim, Detective Jo is in danger.

345
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:13,690
 Min Hye Rin must've injected an anesthetic in him. Can you find water around you? 

346
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,420
Detective Jo needs to drink water.

347
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,750
This is Dispatch 1. We just got here and we're going in.

348
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,690
Director Kang, you need to see this.

349
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,560
I looked up Min Hye Rin.

350
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,590
She lived with her mom, a director of a big hospital, after her parents' divorce. 
    

351
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,630
It looks like her family has serious issues.

352
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:50,480
My gosh. If she's like this now, how harsh it must have been when she was young? 
    

353
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,800
   

354
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,870
   

355
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,640
   

356
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,300
Detective Shim, Min Hye Rin was psychologically abused by her mom when she was young.

357
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,430
She seems to be suffering from paranoia.

358
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,960
She believed her mother's abuse was love,

359
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,050
so she obsessed over Mr. Jang when he kept pushing her away.

360
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:18,540
 Maybe... It will be hard, but we may be able to persuade her.  

361
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,600
Yes, Ma'am.

362
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,370
Should I pull out your teeth

363
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,020
or your eyes?

364
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,640
- Die! 
 - Stop!

365
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,740
Freeze.

366
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,800
Move and I'll shoot.

367
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,500
Min Hye Rin.

368
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,430
If he doesn't get to the hospital right now, he may die.

369
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,080
Are you a doctor or a murderer right now?

370
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,710
Get it together!

371
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,990
Do you know how good I was to that jerk?

372
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,930
I'd rather kill him than lose him.

373
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,830
- I'll kill him! 
 - I hear you!

374
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:11,550
You're obsessive about men because of your mom.

375
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,370
What do you know?

376
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:22,740
What? Am I wrong?

377
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,280
You searched for a man to match your self-worth, but you were rejected.

378
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,260
So you destroyed his life.

379
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,260
Stop.

380
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,680
No. That's not true.

381
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,240
I loved him. I loved him!

382
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,780
- Detective Jo.
 - Let go of me.

383
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,520
- Give Detective Jo water first! 
 - Water.

384
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,890
Let go! Let go of me!

385
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,860
Detective Jo, wake up.

386
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,150
- Min Hye Rin. 
 - Drink some water.

387
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,070
You're under arrest for charges including kidnapping, intimidation,

388
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,660
false imprisonment, and violating the Punishment of Minor Offenses Act.

389
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,130
You have the right to an attorney, the right to remain silent,

390
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,880
and the right to defend yourself.

391
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,200
No. No.

392
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,180
I want to see Jang Hyo Joon.

393
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,260
Call him!

394
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,420
He'll understand me. He'll understand!

395
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,840
- Are you awake? 
 - Yes.

396
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,770
Wake up.

397
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,930
This is Dispatch Team 2. Min Hye Rin has been arrested.

398
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,250
The kidnapping cases of Kwon Saet Byeol and Jang Hyo Joon are closed.

399
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,210
   

400
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,630
- Get in there. 
 - Let go!

401
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,810
Let go of me!

402
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:40,570
Min Hye Rin. What you think is love is a crime.

403
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,480
Let go. Let go of me!

404
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,300
Let go!

405
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:50,320
Team Leader Jo, are you all right?

406
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,050
Yes.

407
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,790
Luckily, he avoided it

408
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,760
so the needle didn't go all the way in.

409
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,070
Thank goodness.

410
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,330
You acted like you lost your touch, but you still got it.

411
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,640
You saved Detective Jo's life.

412
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,650
He right. You did great.

413
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,880
Shouldn't you see a doctor, too?

414
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,680
I'm fine.

415
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,970
I'll go see Saet Byeol.

416
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
Just a minute.

417
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,680
Are you okay?

418
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,850
Detective Park, would you give your radio to Jang Hyo Joon for a minute?

419
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,970
Yes, Ma'am.

420
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,160
Mr. Jang, our director needs to talk to you.

421
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:39,500
 Hello? You needed to talk to me? 

422
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,520
I know that you've suffered

423
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,540
for a very long time

424
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,220
because you were being stalked.

425
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,230
 I apologize for not helping you sooner. 

426
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,390
I'm sorry.

427
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,100
And... for suspecting you.

428
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,980
We'll try our best to make sure...

429
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,020
things like this don't happen again.

430
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,590
It's okay.

431
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,750
Everyone is safe thanks to all of you.

432
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,100
Thank you.

433
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,330
Thankfully, a law against the act of stalking has been implemented as punishment.

434
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,500
 This law will punish Min Hye Rin harshly. 

435
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,100
Stalking will no longer be a light offense.

436
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:22,580
So please work with us on the investigation.

437
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,800
â™«  Falling down  â™«

438
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,060
Thank you.

439
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,020
â™«  Can't deal with it  â™«

440
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,110
Agent Han, let's find all the texts, emails,

441
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,080
everything Jang Hyo Joon received and submit a report.

442
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,660
Yes, Ma'am.

443
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,970
Director Kang.

444
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:41,560
â™«  Everything I say  â™«

445
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,410
â™«  Is all for you  â™«

446
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,320
Here.

447
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,340
Would you...

448
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,480
give me a minute?

449
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,810
Saet Byeol,

450
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,810
You must've been terrified

451
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,270
today because of me.

452
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,790
I'm sorry.

453
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,480
Wait. The pictures of you...

454
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,850
I may scam people, but I never took such photos.

455
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,840
How could you be so stupid and believe that?

456
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,510
That's how I am.

457
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,120
But, Saet Byeol,

458
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,460
I feel like you were trying to flee from your parents...

459
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,230
I mean, from those people

460
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,600
and ended up getting dragged into this.

461
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,610
I wish you'd stop doing it

462
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:40,550
and cut yourself loose now.

463
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,800
Can you do it?

464
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,220
Okay.

465
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,270
I'll try.

466
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,040
Okay.

467
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,960
Don't worry about her.

468
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,830
Now go get treated first.

469
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:57,070
You too.

470
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,670
Saet Byeol!

471
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,340
Is my daughter okay?

472
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,990
I always say to be careful.

473
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,880
Don't touch me.

474
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,160
What?

475
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,320
Get your dirty hands off me!

476
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,690
You make me sick! You're disgusting!

477
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,450
Why you!

478
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,940
Did Mr. Jang say something weird again?

479
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,380
I told you.

480
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,120
I told you not to believe what that psycho says.

481
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,080
You're just in shock.

482
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,150
Please don't touch me!

483
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,870
Our daughter must be in shock.

484
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,600
Still, you shouldn't lie in front of adults.

485
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,980
Don't get the wrong idea.

486
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,460
- Let's go home. 
 - No!

487
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,180
- Let's go. 
 - No!

488
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,190
Does someone tremble like that if nothing happened to her?

489
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,760
Listen, Officer. You don't have kids, do you?

490
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,530
She constantly runs away from home and does all sorts of things.

491
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,150
She is a big headache.

492
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,650
That's an act.

493
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,850
What's wrong with you!

494
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:34,170
How could a parent say that?

495
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,440
You're breaking my arm.

496
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,640
You're breaking my arm.

497
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,280
I'm a lawyer!

498
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,640
Scum like you isn't qualified to be a lawyer.

499
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,750
If you lay a hand on her again,

500
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,250
I won't be this easy on you.

501
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,920
Let's go. Take her now.

502
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,340
- Let's go to the hospital. 
 - Detective Jo. Let's go.

503
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,520
Let's go.

504
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:10,430
Honey. How dare you do this?

505
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,270
You people!

506
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,270
- Are you okay? 
 - We'll press charges!

507
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,610
I'm okay.

508
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,360
I'm going to fight now.

509
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,360
Let's go.

510
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,100
 "Kids, Mommy's home." 

511
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,930
 "Let me in." 

512
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:51,060
 "That's strange. Our mommy has a pretty voice." 

513
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,340
 "Hearing his sister, the boy peeked through the gap in the door." 

514
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,530
 "But on the other side of the door, it wasn't their mom," 

515
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,790
 "but a scary tiger." 

516
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:05,160
 "Kids, let me in." 

517
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,310
 "The tigerâ€”" 

518
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,950
 You need to hide. 

519
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,130
 Don't come out. 

520
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:23,100
 He said he'd kick us both out then. 

521
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,720
 Dispatch Team 1 here. Director, we've just arrived at the Vimo Provincial Police Agency. 

522
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,430
Detective Jo took Saet Byeol to the Women and Children Care Team.

523
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,270
 Detective Gu, Detective Park, Detective Shim, and I 

524
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,680
 are going to work on reports while standing by for dispatch. 

525
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,140
Wrap things up for me.

526
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,170
   

527
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,420
Yes, Senior.

528
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,100
 Yes, Director Kang, regarding the LA court record that you requested yesterday, 

529
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:28,360
 I just emailed it to you. That case ended without any charges. 

530
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,380
Thank you, Senior. I'll check.

531
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:46,010
   

532
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:52,430
   

533
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,010
   

534
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,030
 Detective. 

535
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:10,040
 I want to know about Detective Jo's childhood. 

536
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,850
 I heard he took his adoptive father to court. 

537
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,690
 Do I need to know more? 

538
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:18,640
 I refuse to answer anything about my captain's private matters. 

539
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,190
 I'm afraid I may make a mistake 

540
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,300
 because I don't know about his correct situation. That's why I'm asking you. 

541
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,440
 So please don't misunderstand me. 

542
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,240
 I'm your captain's partner. 

543
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:50,740
 Videos his dad took while he abused the captain and his sister 

544
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:54,170
 were handed over as evidence. 

545
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:58,020
 One of them shows the captain taking Seung Ah to their dad's room 

546
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,360
 and gave people the wrong idea. 

547
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,250
 The captain... 

548
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:06,200
 was beaten dreadfully by his dad and his whole body is scarred. 

549
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,160
 That situation... 

550
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,380
 must've obviously been forced on him. 

551
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:24,490
Director Kang, Detective Jo's photo from the orphanage you asked for.

552
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:28,180
I looked around on my way here and found just one.

553
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,210
The adoptive parents didn't allow any photos when they were adopted,

554
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:35,660
so the director of the orphanage slipped one into the adoption file.

555
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,340
Thank you.

556
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,760
I'll send the backup data to Cyber Team's Detective Ko.

557
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,230
Okay. Good job.

558
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,140
Is there something else?

559
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:58,780
Well, the thing is...

560
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,070
Don't let it get to you.

561
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:31,020
On my first day out, Jin Hyeok...

562
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,400
He scolded me real bad.

563
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,980
You know he was called "Mad Dog," right?

564
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:43,770
Compared to me back then, you did much better.

565
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,400
   
   

566
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,810
I can't say it'll be easy to sue for domestic abuse.

567
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:03,410
Even so, you're not alone. Therefore, don't be so scared.

568
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,000
   

569
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,830
   

570
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,590
What should I do now?

571
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:19,310
Go back to school and live an ordinary life.

572
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:25,060
I'll find a shelter for you to stay at while the lawsuit goes through. Don't worry.

573
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,770
Excuse me for a minute.

574
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,040
What if my dad comes to the shelter?

575
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,670
I'm really very scared.

576
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:46,180
There's something called a restraining order. You can just call the police right away.

577
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,850
I heard you were adopted to America. I'm jealous.

578
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,400
My adoptive mom said that

579
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,370
I was cursed from the start.

580
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:03,910
Even my birth parents abandoned me.

581
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:06,190
What should I expect?

582
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,190
No one chooses their parents.

583
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:18,740
And not all adoptive parents are abusive.

584
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,010
So you must make your own choices in your life.

585
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:24,760
Do not abuse yourself, ever.

586
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:28,110
Can you promise that?

587
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:35,440
How did you manage to get through it?

588
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,730
I really... wanted to kill them.

589
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,340
When I was your age,

590
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,800
I took my adoptive dad's gun from his drawer and went to his door...

591
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,540
to shoot him.

592
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,670
My little sister cried and stopped me.

593
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:02,960
She said she couldn't live if something were to happen to me. She begged me to shoot her instead.

594
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,800
If it hadn't been for her,

595
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,320
I'd be in prison right now.

596
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,620
I wouldn't even be a cop.

597
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,650
What a grateful sister.

598
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:18,740
Is that kind sister of yours doing okay?

599
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,880
She did okay.

600
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,460
But something bad happened.

601
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:41,020
Actually, I almost remembered something yesterday.

602
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,060
It came to me earlier.

603
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,880
There's someone called Ranger I talked to a lot on the network.

604
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,460
He was close to JooJoo.

605
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,800
On Christmas last year, he killed his grandparents and then killed himself.

606
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,140
It was on the news.

607
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,120
"JooJoo"?

608
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:02,780
Was that kid's name Joo Beom Tae?

609
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:06,830
That's right. Lots of the kids who play the game are losers in real life,

610
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:10,390
and JooJoo was bullied at school, too.

611
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:13,260
 Keep it straight. You need the energy. 

612
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:20,080
 Not like that. Look. 

613
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,900
 - Let's see. 
 - No way. 

614
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,480
 What did you buy? 

615
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,700
 Is this it? 

616
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,280
 - Is this it? 
 - Be nice. 

617
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,790
 - Hey. 
 - You'll hurt him. 

618
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:34,160
 Stay still so we can aim. 

619
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,230
 Hey. What are you doing? 

620
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:40,680
 Go and stand guard. 

621
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,150
 Go stand outside! 

622
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:47,800
 Police! 

623
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,430
 What's that? 

624
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,200
 Stop! 

625
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,650
 Come here. 

626
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,530
 - It wasn't me. 
 - Get them! 

627
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:00,020
He was really into the community.

628
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:05,580
Then he got really excited when a female cop called "Circus Man" contacted him.

629
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:09,790
When Ranger heard that, he cut contact, calling him crazy.

630
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:15,110
To be honest, why would a cop hang out with a loser like him?

631
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,190
Are you still in touch with that Ranger?

632
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:20,550
No. I lost touch after he said he'd study for his GED.

633
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:25,810
Chatroom records and messages all disappear automatically after 24 hours.

634
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:32,610
Is what I just said any kind of help to you at all?

635
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:36,230
Yes, thanks.

636
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,270
I think I have to go now.

637
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,500
Hang on.

638
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:49,890
I found the dissociative identity disorder cases from the FBI's rare disease report.

639
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:52,170
I  think you need to see this.

640
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,560
You find the ID, "CCman" suspicious?

641
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,850
Yes.

642
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:02,760
He started an auction for a smile badge, so I sent a message to ask about the price, and he just replied.

643
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,350
But the proxy server he uses is super high-tech.

644
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,730
It's like what professionals use.

645
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,610
How far is this from Doram Shopping Center?

646
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:14,470
It's close. Less than five minutes. The building is really old,

647
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:18,540
so you don't get reception. That bothers me, though.

648
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:23,250
Director Kang, this may be a simple badge transaction.

649
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,520
- Let's go together. 
 - Together?

650
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,100
But I can handle it...

651
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,360
No. It's too dangerous to go alone.

652
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,830
Detective Shim, we're meeting a user who contacted Agent Han online

653
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:35,090
in 30 minutes at Doram Shopping Center. Please come with us.

654
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,740
 Yes, Ma'am. 

655
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,010
Put on a vest underneath and get your radio and earphones.

656
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:41,380
Yes, Ma'am.

657
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,240
Murders like that actually happened?

658
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,140
Yes. In 2008, a male murderer in Australia

659
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,770
became flexible due to the female hormones his female identity released

660
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:57,020
and escaped through a small window.

661
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,470
On top of that, there were cases in the UK and Canada

662
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,360
in which the killers will reduce the size of their bodies

663
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,290
with hormones and shapewear to confuse the cops.

664
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,470
But...

665
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:13,690
this only appears in severe cases of dissociative identity disorders.

666
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:17,680
Here's the list of special effects supplies you requested.

667
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:20,950
    
    

668
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:23,200
   

669
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,920
   

670
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:31,330
   

671
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,790
 The hormones were released when the female identity was in control. 

672
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:16,420
 He changed his body using the flexibility they provided. 

673
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,560
 What if he used this equipment 

674
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,730
 to create a similar body shape to Director Kang? 

675
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,940
Chad, check Dong Bang Min's alibi at the hotel for March 25th.

676
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,370
I think Nick made a mistake.

677
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,500
Yes, Captain.

678
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,300
Hold on, Mister! I just thought of something else.

679
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,940
I think JooJoo said he was going to go live in that cop lady's hometown.

680
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:22,170
He said it was paradise there with no bullies and that everyone was like family.

681
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,480
Oh, really? Thank you.

682
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,640
   

683
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,720
You can see me well, right?

684
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,230
You can't leave without me, okay?

685
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,760
Agent Han, you need to focus well from now on.

686
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:23,230
If something happens, we'll be sure to save you, so don't worry too much.

687
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,670
All right.

688
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,300
I think it's that black car.

689
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,420
It's one of the car models from earlier.

690
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:52,940
But it doesn't look like anyone is inside...

691
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:57,310
They wouldn't be hiding and come out of nowhere, right?

692
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:13,760
I'll go over there and be on standby.

693
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,440
Center Kang, you should wait here.

694
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,540
If it really is Circus Man, he's obsessed with you.

695
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,810
So, it might be dangerous for you.

696
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,290
 Director... There? 

697
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:40,030
- Yes, Detective Jo.
  -  Dong Bang Min was the... 

698
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,380
 I'm... 

699
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,090
Detective...

700
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,340
Detective.

701
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,970
What is this?

702
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:19,690
 Where are you? I'll head over to you. 

703
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:23,420
 Detective, is it something urgent? 

704
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,490
 Detective? 

705
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,260
This isâ€”

706
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,750
Agent Han, what's wrong?

707
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,570
L-Look...

708
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,600
Bl-Blood...

709
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:20,630
 I'm sorry. 

710
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,800
 It's okay. 

711
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:28,600
By any chance, aren't you Director Kang Kwon Joo?

712
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:36,770
We've met before.

713
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,250
 It's the same voiceprint as Circus Man's. 

714
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:51,010
Look!

715
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:03,010
Get it together!

716
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:08,150
1, 2, 3!

717
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:19,530
Don't move!

718
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,800
Dong Bang Min?

719
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,580
You remember me even though we just passed each other by.

720
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,960
 I'm sorry. 

721
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,620
 Did you miss me? 

722
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:12,830
I missed you, too.

723
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:15,650
That pretty face.

724
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:19,390
Pretty enough to rip to pieces.

725
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:23,430
Don't come close! Take one step closer and I'll shoot!

726
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,550
 Director. 

727
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:28,860
The Circus Man we've been looking for is Dong Bang Min.

728
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:31,380
There are cases where men changed their bodies using hormones to a female personality.

729
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,940
On top of that, if he used special effect materials, it would be even harder to discern.

730
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:37,780
I didn't know that dissociative identity disorders were this hard to detect.

731
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,710
We thought about things too simply.

732
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,770
 Are you listening? 

733
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,020
Did you think you could catch me with something like this?

734
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:53,240
Now...

735
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:58,750
you need to pay for interrupting us.

736
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:03,240
Now, how should I rip you to pieces?

737
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:09,810


738
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:13,410
No, she's your Siamese twin!

739
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,110
Get out, you stupid bitch!

740
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,880
Dammit!

741
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:28,670
   

742
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:33,050
â™«   It's killing me, take my breath away   â™«

743
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:37,600
â™«   Follow the tangled memories   â™«

744
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:42,100
â™«   There's nothing to lean on, fade away   â™«

745
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,700
â™«   Iâ€™ll find you by following the trail   â™«

746
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:49,190
   

747
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:53,950
 You are gorgeous. He will meet you first. 

748
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:56,870
 Sir! I'll do anything, so please- 

749
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:58,750
 It looks like Dong Bang Min has three identities. 

750
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,300
 We don't have time for this. 

751
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,070
 We need to work together to survive! 

752
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:03,180
 Director Kang, I found him. 

753
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:06,800
 He used to sell light bulbs and decorations for shrines. 

754
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,610
 I'm going to tear you apart before that. 

755
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:11,980
 Stop me if you can. 

756
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,630
 You killed that many people on your own? 

757
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,990
â™«  Follow the tangled memories  â™«

758
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:21,530
â™«  There's nothing to lean on, fade away  â™«
