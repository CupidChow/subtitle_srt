1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,590


2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,540
   

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,450
   

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,160
   

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,860
   

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,940
   

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:33,630
    
   

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,060
   

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,300
    

10
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,890
Who are you? How did you enter this place?

11
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,660
   

12
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,090
Who are you? What is your identity?

13
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,640
Remove your hood. Raise your head.

14
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,360
 Come over here, everyone! Circus Man turned himself in! 

15
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,890
Woo Joo, you... you stay here.

16
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,920
What is it? Isn't that human hair?

17
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,320
- It's this bastard? 
 - Yes.

18
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,250
It says on the note that he is Circus Man and that he will receive an appropriate sentence.

19
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,620
Uncle, it's Mr. Man Taek!

20
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,390
He works for Min.

21
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,250
- Man Taek? Sonang Village's Kwak Man Taek? 
 - Yes.

22
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,270
It's not Dong Bang Min, but the person who works at his house is the suspect?

23
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,060
Man Taek! Did you really...

24
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,510
- kill people? 
 - Chief Yang.

25
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,850
It's dangerous like this. Detective Park! Kwang Soo!

26
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,890
Take him away for now.

27
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,400
Director.

28
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,110
Dong Bang Min...

29
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,320
One moment please, Detective.

30
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,710
Dong Bang Min! Dong Bang Min!

31
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,380
Center Director here. Dong Bang Min was discovered with a knife wound to his abdomen in his house.

32
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,850
Please call for 119 help.

33
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,610
 This is Dispatch 1. Director and Detective Jo! 

34
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,430
 That Mr. Kwak Man Taek who works in Dong Bang Min's house 

35
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,690
 just turned himself in, claiming that he is the Circus Man. 

36
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,840
 He came here to receive his punishment and brought a woman's hair strand. 

37
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,650
 He says it's Gong Su Ji's. 

38
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,560
   

39
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,760
Did you really do it?

40
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,380
Did you really kill all those people by yourself?

41
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,620
What is this?

42
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,950
You know what happens if you lie, right?

43
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,350
     

44
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,900
 I hurt my throat, so I can't talk. 

45
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,930
 I killed all those people. 

46
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:13,090
 And I stabbed Young Master 

47
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,260
 after he found out about my crimes. 

48
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,190
You stabbed Dong Bang Min! Huh?

49
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,920
Director, Kwak Man Taek is claiming he stabbed Dong Bang Min.

50
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,720
- What are you? What are you doing right now? 
 - Detective.

51
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,180
Detective. Detective.

52
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,720
Stop faking this bullshit and get up!

53
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,960
Get up, you bastard!

54
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,560
   

55
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,150
   

56
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:15,890
     

57
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,710
   

58
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,620
I need to contact his guardian. Can I get his identity?

59
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,850
The patient is Dong Bang Min and his guardian is Sonang Village's Dong Bang Heon Yup.

60
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,560
His guardian is the Village Head of Sonang Village?

61
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,460
Give me a minute.

62
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,660
How is the patient?

63
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,410
Fortunately, the knife missed the organs, so it is not life-threatening.

64
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,390
Please wait here.

65
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,610
 The first witness to report the case was his neighbor, Kwak Man Taek. 

66
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:08,930
Detective Jo, Kwak Man Taek, the man who claims he is Circus Man, is the first witness who found the body of Eom Seok Gu.

67
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,720
What did you say?

68
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,470
Min!

69
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,400
Did you stab my Min?

70
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,980
Aren't you the ones who made Kwak Man Taek turn himself in?

71
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,610
Kwak Man Taek turned himself in?

72
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,830
Is it true?

73
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,790
Then, this is the bright side of an unfortunate event.

74
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,430
If Kwak Man Taek turned himself in, you should investigate him.

75
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,210
Don't ever...

76
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,580
appear in front of my Min.

77
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,520
You are calmer than I thought.

78
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,270
If that is true, then a horrifying murderer was taking care of your grandson up until now.

79
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,150
That's enough!

80
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,830
If you hang around my Min again,

81
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,640
then I will not stay still.

82
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,060
It seems that your grandson used his wits a little, but

83
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,950
he won't ever get away, even if you pull these tricks.

84
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,690
 Kang Center. Detective Jo. Hurry and come here now. 

85
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,830
Kwak Man Taek is refusing to get interrogated without you two.

86
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,580
Let's go to the station for now. I'll tell the other officers to stay here.

87
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,560
 Detective Gu, Dong Bang Min is currently undergoing emergency surgery at the Vimo Hospital. 

88
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,600
 Please look after Dong Bang Min with Detective Shim. 

89
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,010
Yes, understood! Dae Sik, let's go.

90
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,620
 Agent Park, hurry and investigate Kwak Man Taek with Agent Han. 

91
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,130
- Find everything. 
 - Yes. Understood.

92
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,080
Agent Han, prepare Kwak Man Taek's profile and criminal record files. All of them.

93
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,600
My goodness.

94
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:19,700
 Elder, Young Master remembers that event! 

95
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,690
 That bastard who died 24 years ago entered Young Master's body. 

96
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,090
 If Kwak Man Taek was dragged by Min... 

97
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,670
 Is Eom Seok Gu really inside Min's body, 

98
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,430
 like that bastard said? 

99
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,460
So, you're saying that you really can't talk?

100
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,890
   

101
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,120
Dong Bang Min anticipated this and got it written for him.

102
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,430
He even checked that he boarded the plane on that day.

103
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,430
Fine. Let me ask you again.

104
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,050
Moon Ah Ram and her father on 25 September 2020.

105
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,120
Joo Beom Tae and his grandparents in December.

106
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,650
And in March of 2021, Lee Hyun Min, his entire family, and even the American witness,

107
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,350
Jo Seung Ah.

108
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,950
Did you kill all these people?

109
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,270
 His pupils are slightly dilated and his hands are trembling as well. 

110
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,380
 Besides, the way fingernails are stubbed indicate he has clubbed fingers. 

111
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,610
 It's highly likely that it's fibrosis caused by drug addiction. 

112
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,290
Gong Su Ji, who has gone missing is also your doing?

113
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,760
Yes.

114
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,320
Mr. Kwak Man Taek, you are not Circus Man.

115
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,040
What kind of threat did you get?

116
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,620
Then write that again, exactly as you did the first time.

117
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,960
Victims' names, times, locations, murder weapons, all of it.

118
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,120
You killed them yourself so you should remember. Write it down.

119
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,080
   

120
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,340
   

121
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,430
What a joke. Do you know why you don't know the details?

122
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,400
It's because you didn't do any of it!

123
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,540
You scumbag, this case already has 10 victims. An entire family was killed!

124
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,700
Did you think we would be fooled if you just followed what that asshole Dong Bang Min wrote?

125
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,950
Tell me honestly. Who is it!

126
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:15,570
Detective Jo, if you threaten a suspect in Korea, you will be charged with assault. Get your hand off!

127
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,300
Man Taek,

128
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,490
let's say you are the culprit.

129
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,640
Then, do you know where Su Ji is buried?

130
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,090
   

131
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,480
If her body is actually found there, then you, Mr. Kwak Man Taek, will become a murderer.

132
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,770
You might even have to spend the rest of your life in prison.

133
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:12,010
Why in the world would you... just why would you go this far for Dong Bang Min?

134
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,820
Director Kang, a word with you please.

135
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,420
- Keep an eye on him. 
 - Yes, sir.

136
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,910
Kwak Man Taek is a drug addict. It's highly likely he has fibrosis, a rare disease.

137
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:39,720
Pressing him for answers when he is in this state will be useless. Let's find Gong Su Ji first.

138
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,830
Agent Han, check inside Kwak Man Taek's medical records to see if he has a drug addiction or psychiatric fibrosis.

139
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,950
Yes, Sir.

140
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:52,380
Detective Park, we're going to the alleyway near Doram Shopping Center to find Gong Su Ji's body. Come to the lobby.

141
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,960
 Yes, Director Kang. 

142
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,660
Team Leader Park, please continue to keep an eye on Kwak Man Taek.

143
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,580
Yes, Ma'am.

144
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,360
We believe Dong Bang Min is the real culprit.

145
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,470
We have many reasons to believe so.

146
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,520
Covering up for somebody else's crimes

147
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,350
is never an easy task.

148
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,820
   

149
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,990
Wait here.

150
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,930
- Get him some water. 
 - Yes, Sir.

151
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,640
Grand Deity,

152
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,180
please forgive me.

153
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,710
 Did you think I wouldn't find you if you ran away? 

154
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,770
 The great Deity told me to tell you this: 

155
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,630
 Instead of eternal life, you will suffer forever in hell. 

156
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,780
 Much more than what you are suffering now. 

157
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,610
 I just did what the elder told me to. 

158
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,740
 After becoming terminally ill, I prayed every day in the Sonang village (shrine). 

159
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,870
 Please forgive me. Please. 

160
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,760
 He says a little prayer every day isn't going to be enough. 

161
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,850
 Too bad for you. 

162
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,170
 Oh, yes!  He said one more thing.  

163
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,930
 Your mother, too, will fall into hellfire 

164
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:42,690
 for raising her child wrongly. She will live in pain that feels like her limbs are being ripped apart and melting. 

165
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:47,820
 Oh great Deity, I came here to receive eternal life. 

166
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,560
 Grand Deity, please save  

167
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,850
  my poor mother. 

168
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,180
 Please, Deity. 

169
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:21,150
 Forgive me. 

170
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,550
What? Kwak Man Taek is terminally ill?

171
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:15,600
Yes. Just as Detective Jo said, he was diagnosed with fibrosis thirty years ago.

172
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,420
It's a rare disease caused by gene abnormalities.

173
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,790
The treatment for this disease is crazy expensive.

174
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,440
There's nothing recent in his medical records so it seems he has given up on treatment.

175
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,660
And there is nothing about either a mental illness or a drug addiction in his records.

176
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,220
So he doesn't have much time and he turned himself in?

177
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,810
Here it is.

178
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,970
Kwak Man Taek, what are you doing?

179
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,330
What's wrong?

180
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,690
Kwak Man Taek!

181
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,320
What's happening to you?

182
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,220
Kwak Man Taek!

183
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,360
We'll look around here. Golden Time Team should take that area.

184
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,380
Let's meet up later.

185
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:09,210
 This is Unit 1. We found a female corpse in a large trash can at the end of the alley to the right of the mall. 

186
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,660
Grand Deity...

187
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,360
Have you come?

188
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,770
Have you come?

189
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,400
Kwak Man Taek, snap out of it!

190
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,560
What are you doing?

191
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,660
Save me.

192
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,600
Please give me eternal life.

193
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,450
Dear Deity...

194
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,470
Call someone from the infirmary!

195
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,510
Yes, Sir.

196
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,100
What's that?

197
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,260
Kwak Man Taek!

198
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,490
Open your mouth!

199
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,870
Are you trying to die!

200
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,080
Open your mouth!

201
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,170
This is Dispatch 1. Agent Cheon,

202
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,700
please call 119 immediately.

203
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,050
I think it would be better for you to not see this.

204
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,620
Based on the livor mortis she has probably been here for a day.

205
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,540
- Call the forensics team. 
 - Okay.

206
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,380
Kwak Man Taek, that punk,

207
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,680
actually killed Su Ji.

208
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,110
 This is Dispatch 1. Kwak Man Taek bit his tongue all of a sudden and started having a seizure. 

209
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,950
 Due to which he's become unconscious. 

210
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,200
Make it quick!

211
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,800
Prepare the AED. 
  (Automated External Defibrillator) 

212
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,560
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

213
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,480
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

214
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,930
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,

215
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,130
nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two...

216
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,770
It's charged.

217
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,050
One, two, three!

218
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,410
One, two, three.

219
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,550
Eternal life...

220
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,980
What did you say?

221
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,770
Eternal...

222
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,570
Speak. Speak.

223
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,910
To where there is no pain.

224
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,110
Kwak Man Taek!

225
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:16,950
 This is Dispatch 1. Director Kang, I think Kwak Man Taek just died. 

226
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,230
What is the cause of death?

227
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,070
 According to Agent Han, he had terminal fibrosis. 

228
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,840
 He bit his tongue hard enough to get stress-induced hyperventilation and arrhythmia. 

229
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,720
Was there some kind of drug near him?

230
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,860
 There wasn't. 

231
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,970
 He said he was thirsty and asked me for water 

232
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,370
 and before I had time to stop him, he just bit his tongue off. 

233
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,580
We're heading up there so we will check him then.

234
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,490
Wait a minute.

235
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,340
 What's this green coloured paste? 

236
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,690
Let's go.

237
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,270
Let's check the security footage.

238
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,870
Okay.

239
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,130
Look at that.

240
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,090
It's as if he was talking to someone. He kept saying something about eternal life and whatnot.

241
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,130
He seemed possessed.

242
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,450
Hold on.

243
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,770
He put something in his mouth while pretending to pray.

244
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,730
After which he bit his tongue.

245
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,380
If he went into shock suddenly, then it's highly likely that it was a drug that causes hallucinations and paralysis.

246
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,050
Make sure the medical examiner runs a blood test while doing the autopsy.

247
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,980
Okay.

248
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,420
I'm going to meet Dong Bang Min.

249
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,660
He committed suicide?

250
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:03,970
No, that's not possible.

251
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,430
That's not...

252
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,050
Grandfather.

253
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,520
You're awake?

254
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,300
What happened to me this time?

255
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:27,480
I remember searching for Man Taek because he wasn't home.

256
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,290
I don't remember what happened after that.

257
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:37,010
Man Taek stabbed you and then he turned himself in.

258
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:42,250
The murder of the entire family that you were wrongly accused of...

259
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,080
it was all his doing.

260
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,100
What?

261
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,420
He wouldn't...

262
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,850
- do that. 
 - I was told that a while ago that Man Taek

263
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,080
bit his own tongue and

264
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,260
commit suicide.

265
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,490
What an awful fellow!

266
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:10,160
And I heard something strange from him.

267
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,010
He said that he saw

268
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,340
Prosecutor Gong's daughter's body at your house.

269
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,010
I think he was trying to put all the blame on you.

270
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,680
Oh God, what's wrong?

271
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,850
Do-Don't mind me.

272
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,370
You should rest. Rest well.

273
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,230
That's right.

274
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,460
I almost ripped his jaws apart.

275
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,300
What else did he tell you?

276
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,700
Besides telling you about Gong Su Ji's corpse, what else did he say?

277
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,530
Didn't you ask about me?

278
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,240
Ouch, that hurts.

279
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,160
Hey, gramps. Stop acting like a sly old fox and just tell me everything honestly.

280
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,840
What else did you hear?

281
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:25,810
Kwak Man Taek is probably dead by now.

282
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,040
If you die, old man, then all of this ends.

283
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,000
No.

284
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,400
Not now. There are too many people around here. We're in a hospital!

285
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,890
Grandpa, what's wrong?

286
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:22,390
Did I do... something strange again?

287
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,140
Grandfather.

288
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,420
Later...

289
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,210
Let's talk later.

290
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,600
Grandfather.

291
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,640
Here, Dae Sik.

292
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,570
What's this?

293
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,900
I saw it in the office so I brought it with me. Have some.

294
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,190
Man Taek...

295
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,540
What Man Taek—

296
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,290
Elder?

297
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,940
What Man Taek said was right.

298
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,490
There is someone else... inside Min.

299
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,200
Listen. Call some people from Sonang Village

300
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,260
and have them protect Min, right away.

301
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,450
Looks like the IV needle fell out.

302
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:26,640
  This will all end when that old man dies.  

303
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,130
Byeong Cheol.

304
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,680
Tell all the families to gather.

305
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,510
It looks like we'll have to set a special doctrine.

306
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,830
Prosecutor Gong.

307
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:55,010
You shouldn't see her like this, okay? Go back, okay?

308
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,360
Sir.

309
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,960
Hold on! Hold on!

310
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,870
Su Ji.

311
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,490
Hey!  Oh, Su Ji.

312
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,980
Su Ji! Su Ji!

313
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,860
My daughter.

314
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,460
How scared were you?

315
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,450
How much did it hurt?

316
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:37,590
Dad... Dad is the one to blame.

317
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,060
Su Ji!

318
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,250
Su Ji!

319
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,040
Center Director.

320
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,970
- He's inside, right? 
 - Yes.

321
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,310
Please block off this room for a minute.

322
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,910
Kwak Man Taek commit suicide.

323
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,980
Get up. Get up, you bastard.

324
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,370
The two of you should stop.

325
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,340
Stop spouting nonsense.

326
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,380
After sending in a false offender. What's next?

327
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,310
What are you saying? I'm a victim.

328
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,060
If you keep doing this, I'll call for a lawyer.

329
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,310
Did you think we wouldn't know if Kwak Man Taek died while being high?

330
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,170
Did you think we would believe that kind of nonsense?

331
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,350
The person who was stabbed with a knife is me.

332
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,460
- What? 
 - Detective.

333
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,190
If you are that innocent, please come to

334
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,850
the Vimo Police Department tomorrow for your statement.

335
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,740
You should be confident, whether it's to be a lie detector or a psychological test.

336
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,700
    

337
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,340
Of course.

338
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,760
So please leave.

339
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,470
Eom Seok Gu.

340
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,270
Found dead at Dongwonsi Keumdoeum.

341
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,810
Date of death, 1997 June 18.

342
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,390
You killed him, right?

343
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,880
One identity cons people using the same special trait as Center Director. Another plans the moves. A total of 3 personalities!

344
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:48,560
You three go around killing families, right?

345
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,800
What?

346
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,030
Don't you feel crazy and want to come out?

347
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:02,930
Yeah, come on out. Come out! I'll take care of you whenever you'd like, so come out.

348
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,860
Come out. Come out! Come out, you bastard!

349
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,970
Come out!

350
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,830
Yes?

351
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,040
I guess nowadays

352
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,240
police investigate with their imaginations.

353
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,390
I guess that's true.

354
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,360
If you got caught this easily, that wouldn't be any fun.

355
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,870
All right.

356
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,170
Tell that bastard inside your head that I have a present waiting for him.

357
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:04,140
One so strong that you'll regret not dying from that stab wound today.

358
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,950
So remember one thing.

359
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,140
No matter what is inside of you,

360
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,490
that is you, Dong Bang Min.

361
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,650
Stop acting oblivious.

362
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,580
The children left clues while in pain

363
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,870
in order to protect their families.

364
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:39,930
The desperation of the victims brought us all the way here.

365
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,060
We're going all the way to the end.

366
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,300
Tomorrow, we'll be receiving Dong Bang Min's victim statement.

367
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,450
Please watch him closely until then.

368
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,570
I understand.

369
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:05,010
You egged him on, on purpose just now. Right?

370
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,100
Saying Eom Seok Gu's name and saying you have a present.

371
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,170
The more the personalities fight amongst themselves, the easier our investigation will go tomorrow.

372
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,180
But we're lacking direct evidence.

373
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,040
If we can't trigger him tomorrow for sure,

374
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,480
our investigation might go astray.

375
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,810
     

376
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,760
    

377
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,240
 Yeah, Chad. How'd it go?  

378
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,830
Yeah, I've got it, Cap.

379
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:32,960
I'm checking the CCTV here at Black Hill Hotel that Dong Bang Min partied at.

380
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,070
At 18:48, a woman in a black raincoat and short boots is coming out of the back door.

381
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:42,560
I don't have the whole face, but the suspect has a physique like Kang Center,

382
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,770
and she also has a size of a bag that can carry a double-headed ax.

383
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,970
I'm sending it right now.

384
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,330
That was Chad. We were reinvestigating Dong Bang Min's alibi on the day of the Sanggedong case,

385
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,750
but the director that said he was drunk with Dong Bang Min that day,

386
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,490
changed his statement, saying that he may have seen incorrectly.

387
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,370
This is an important clue that can debunk Dong Bang Min's alibi.

388
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,540
Let's head back to the office.

389
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,190
How dare he wake me up?

390
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,320
There's been a big incident today,

391
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,610
so I  urgently gathered everyone.

392
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,670
Kwak Man Taek, our family with whom we shared blood,

393
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:40,210
was the murderer who ruthlessly killed

394
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:45,340
- three families and a witness on the mainland. 
   -My goodness! I can't believe it. 

395
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,440
Not only did he try to frame my innocent grandson,

396
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,530
but he also tried to murder him!

397
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,330
My goodness, dear Deity! Have mercy on us!

398
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,310
 - Have mercy on us! 
 - Have mercy on us! 

399
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,260
 - Have mercy on us! 
 - Have mercy on us! 

400
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,370
 - Have mercy on us! 
 - Have mercy on us! 

401
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:10,490
 - Have mercy on us! 
 - Dear Deity! 

402
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,830
 - Have mercy on us! 
 - Have mercy on us! 

403
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:20,430
Despite the clear truth, the outsiders

404
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:25,830
are still chasing after my grandson, accusing him of being a murderer.

405
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,860
 - My gosh. 
 - That's nonsense. 

406
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,500
The Deity said...

407
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:37,880
that outsiders will tear apart the family of Sonang Village.

408
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,570
The bloodbath has begun.

409
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:49,480
We have become poor souls that have been betrayed by our own family!

410
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:53,930
If we don't stick together and stop them,

411
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,040
we'll end up losing everything.

412
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,830
Everything that we have!

413
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,300
We'll protect you and your grandson,

414
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,790
as well as our village!

415
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,300
 - Yes, let's protect our village. 
 - We'll protect you. 

416
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,440
Everyone, listen up! Don't let them set foot on our soil!

417
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,780
Let's begin the cleansing ceremony!

418
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,090
 - Let's protect our village! 
 - Protect Sonang Village! 

419
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,730
What was that about?

420
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:38,790
Young Master is being accused of murder?

421
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:41,170
Are you sure it's just an accusation?

422
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,120
So he did do it!

423
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,060
Do we just sit back and do nothing?

424
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:48,980
What about our money?

425
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,980
Stop causing so much fuss.

426
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,140
Kwan Man Taek is the murderer. That's all we need to know.

427
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,300
I'm sorry about what happened to Su Ji.

428
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,620
I should've been more careful.

429
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,160
 Gosh, I know. 

430
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,320
But those outsiders

431
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,140
are using my grandson's sleepwalking

432
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,960
to accuse him of being a murderer!

433
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,020
 I thought it was weird that they were still after Min even after Kwan Man Taek turned himself in. 

434
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,980
 It turns out, the mother of that detective from America 

435
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,500
killed herself on this island 28 years ago.

436
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:34,000
 And his sister died too, so he must be dying to blame it on someone. 

437
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,750
Send him back to the States.

438
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,660
 If you sort this out for me, 

439
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,350
 I'll make sure you'll never be in need of money 

440
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,710
when you go into politics on the mainland.

441
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:53,740
It is my duty to protect Vimo Island. Don't worry, Sir.

442
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:10,910
Dae Sik, I'm going to get some fresh air.

443
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,700
Okay.

444
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,830
   

445
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,740
Hello?

446
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:33,580
Who are you?

447
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,460
 We met in front of Young Master's ward. 

448
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,280
 This is Yeom Byeong Cheol. 

449
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,710
Why is Sonang Village calling the police so late at night?

450
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,620
It's uncomfortable for both of us.

451
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:51,550
 I wanted to give you an offer, as you didn't look like someone who'd been on the police force for a long time. 

452
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,740
Are you done talking?

453
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:58,670
 You're a loner without family and you're even labeled as a corrupt cop. 

454
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:03,050
 It must be really uncomfortable to be on the Golden Time Team.  

455
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:07,880
 You must know very well that your career has no future. 

456
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,430
What is this?

457
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,560
You know me better than I know myself.

458
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:28,790
And so? Get to the point. I hate talking in circles.

459
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:32,160
 As you know, I need information on Young Master's investigation. 

460
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,890
 If you help me this time, we'll make sure 

461
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:37,880
 you live comfortably for the rest of your life. 

462
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,330
 If you're going to use this call record as evidence, forget it. 

463
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,760
 It can't even be used as legitimate evidence, 

464
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,260
 and I always get my revenge.  

465
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,490
 I hope you'll make a wise decision. 

466
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:56,640
Well, there's no need to be coy when you know everything about me.

467
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,990
But you should know that it'll cost you a lot.

468
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:07,580
Decide on a time and place and let me know.

469
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,640
What's with the beverages?

470
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,340
The Criminal Affairs Unit is giving them out to everyone.

471
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,810
Tell them I said thank you.

472
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,560
Take a look at this.

473
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,300
This is a screenshot of the CCTV footage

474
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,510
that was taken on the day of the Sanggae neighborhood incident where Dong Bang Min disguised himself as Director Kang.

475
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,620
We'll shake him up with this first

476
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:38,310
and we'll use a lie detector to prove that he has multiple personalities.

477
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,160
Also, there's one unidentified personality.

478
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,510
It's a man in his 30s with a calm and low voice.

479
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,560
Why don't we all do our own searches about Dong Bang Min?

480
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,310
- Got it. 
 - Sure, you got it.

481
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:57,680
Director Kang, this female personality is you.

482
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,830
Dong Bang Min and you

483
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:02,010
must've met somewhere before.

484
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:04,150
Try to remember.

485
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,820
All right.

486
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,150
 - Dad.  
 - Yes?

487
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:20,820
What is it? Why are you calling so late at night?

488
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,810
What are you up to these days?

489
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:26,710
Because of you, Seon Ha will never be able to walk.

490
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:27,910
What are you talking about?

491
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:32,180
The village elder excluded Seo Ha from the New Person Ceremony.

492
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,920
It's all because you're accusing Young Master of being the murderer.

493
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,500
Kids of Seo Ha's age were framed for killing their parents

494
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,470
and murdered horrendously.

495
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:45,220
It wasn't just one kid!

496
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,490
If Min is the culprit, I can't let this go as a father of a child let alone as a cop!

497
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,720
So that's that.

498
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:54,090
Of course. You've been like that your whole life.

499
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,650
Mi Yeon, what are you talking—

500
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,730
 You don't care that you're hurting your own family. 

501
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,450
Don't be silly.

502
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:05,590
I will grind myself to the bone to gain the village elder's favor.

503
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:08,130
So I will fix Seo Ha's leg

504
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:11,040
and live happily at Sonang Village!

505
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,200
Mi Yeon. Mi Yeon!

506
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:32,810
How do we find a man who was in his 30s when he caused Dong Bang Min to experience trauma? We've been up all night.

507
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:35,810
It's like finding a needle in a haystack.

508
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:40,100
I'm only saying this because I'm a little worried, but...

509
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,510
People call our team the Work and Die Team.

510
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:47,370
That we're going to end up dead from working this hard.

511
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:50,150
Aren't you being too harsh?

512
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:53,780
Not me, but it's what people are saying.

513
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,620
If it's too difficult, why don't we take a break?

514
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:59,710
No, it's not like that.

515
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,050
I'll do my best.

516
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:11,310
I think he was his middle school teacher. Look him up.

517
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:21,360
His senior year homeroom teacher. He transferred to another school in Seoul the very next year.

518
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,750
Nothing really happened that you might consider a trauma.

519
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:29,730
I must've left the Sonang Village files in the dorm.

520
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,020
I'll be right back.

521
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,490
Dae Sik, what's wrong?

522
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,530
It's nothing.

523
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:32,150
I had a nightmare.

524
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,850
What? Where'd he go?

525
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,740
Dong Bang Min!

526
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:51,600
Let's hurry and find him!

527
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,190
 Why am I so dizzy? 

528
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:27,620
Yes.

529
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,590
 Detective Jo, someone came into my room and left a dead bird. 

530
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,410
What?

531
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,120
Are you okay?

532
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,470
Stay in the dispatch team office.

533
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:52,300
It's fine. I just checked the cameras and nothing was filmed.

534
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,200
And there aren't any employees that saw anything.

535
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,030
It's definitely got to be somebody who knows where the cameras are located.

536
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,410
Why don't we check the other rooms first?

537
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,120
Sure.

538
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,170
It's probably Dong Bang Min and Dong Bang Heon Yup's doing.

539
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:26,690
I can't believe they thought they could avoid their punishment with something like this.

540
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:28,810
It looks like some sort of hawk.

541
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:31,080
It's probably a goshawk.

542
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,990
I saw in a book that it's a bird that chases away the devil.

543
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:37,180
So they're saying we're the devil?

544
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,230
I always felt that Sonang Village

545
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:44,150
was always closed off.

546
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:46,640
The scariest thing about Familexit 
  (The term “familexit” has been coined from Brexit, which refers to the UK leaving the European Union.  Family members shouldn't be involved with government matters.) 

547
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,950
is that it's based on the idea that

548
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,400
"It's our familial matter, outsiders shouldn't get involved."

549
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,370
Yes, Detective Gu.

550
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:58,380
Director Kang, Dong Bang Min has disappeared from his hospital room.

551
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,340
Dong Bang Min is gone?

552
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,480
Yes! We're looking for him now.

553
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,200
Detective! Someone was watching us from outside.

554
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,100
 Detective Park, tell Chief Yang and come to the training center.  

555
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,750
 There seems to be a trespasser and I think it's Dong Bang Min. 

556
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:27,490
We'll be on our way immediately.

557
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,960
Can you hear anything?

558
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,810
That way!

559
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,220
What is that? Stop right there!

560
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:52,820
Detective Jo!

561
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,640
Detective Jo!

562
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:13,100
Director Kang, are you following me?

563
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,200
Director Kang, where are you?

564
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:31,110
Dae Sik, what happened?

565
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:33,910
I looked in the restrooms, the waiting room, everywhere! But I can't find him.

566
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:35,500
Where did he go?

567
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,580
This is Dispatch 4.

568
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,510
I think that bastard Dong Bang Min must have left the building.

569
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:40,840
We'll look on the outskirts of the hospital as well.

570
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,370
Let's go.

571
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,860
This is Dispatch 5.

572
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,200
Director Kang, can you hear me?

573
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,000
Detective Jo, where are you?

574
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,380
 We're in the woods. 

575
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,420
In the woods?

576
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,210
Aren't you with Director Kang?

577
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:02,410
 No. I thought she was right behind me, but I don't see her anymore. 

578
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,510
Detective Jo!

579
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,270
Detective Jo!

580
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,200
 You said we were family. 

581
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:50,380
 Since I'm your Siamese twin.  

582
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,530
Who are you?

583
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:54,990
 You said no one will be able to split us up from each other. 

584
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:58,510
 Noona, help me! 

585
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,760
 Noona, I'm so scared. 

586
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,900
Who are you? Who are you?!

587
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,520
 Is it that...  

588
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,340
 You don't remember me? 

589
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:12,610
 Noona, you used to take care of me. 

590
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,190
 Brother. 

591
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,760
 Brother. 

592
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,190
 Why didn't you come to save me that day? 

593
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:47,610
 I was waiting for you for a long time. 

594
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,940
Seung Ah.

595
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:55,770
 Brother, it's so scary here. 

596
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:06,870
Seung Ah.

597
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,220
Seung Ah.

598
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:23,210
Seung Ah?

599
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,860
Director Kang!

600
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:04,260
Director Kang. Stop right there!

601
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,140
Stop right there!

602
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:21,170
    

603
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:25,890
    

604
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:35,800


605
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:41,440
   

606
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,440
 Our Vimo Police Department is taking its hands off the case. 

607
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,970
 If you turn a blind eye to the actions of Sonang Village, 

608
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:46,550
 a scarier monster will appear. 

609
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:47,880
 I'll figure it out by myself. 

610
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,920
 This should be enough. 

611
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,950
 In return, you must protect my personal life. 

612
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,040
 Dong Bang Min bought an airplane ticket headed to Fiji tomorrow. 

613
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,570
 There's a high likelihood that he'll kill someone before going to Fiji. 

614
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,880
 We have to lure him in and catch him today. 

615
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,830
 That single mother that wanted to join our village, 

616
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:03,120
 her son is that American detective! 

617
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,840
 Son? 

618
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,450
 How nice... a family.
