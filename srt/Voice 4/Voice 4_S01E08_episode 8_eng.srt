They say snitches should have their mouths ripped apart.

17
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,220
Please.

18
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,600
Please, don't kill me!

19
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,060
I wanted to play more with you, but I can't help it. We have a rule, you see.

20
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,950
Someone who finds out about us...

21
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,930
can never live to tell the story.

22
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,920
So, Circus Man

23
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,620
approached the fake character made by Agent Han?

24
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,580
Please.

25
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,700
You must have risked your life to escape from us.

26
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,400
I'll give you...

27
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,870
an extra painful death.

28
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,620
 Young Master, it's me! 

29
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,990
- Young Master! 
 - Why? Why? Why!

30
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,060
This bastard.

31
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,530
Don't let Dong Bang Min come out. I said, don't let Dong Bang Min come out!

32
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,140
What's happening to me?

33
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,130
Not again.

34
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,840
 Young Master, it's me. 

35
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,720
Yes, I'm coming!

36
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,450
Yes, Mister?

37
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,950
What's the matter? Is there some problem?

38
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,420
The stone figure we were going to use for our festival is broken.

39
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,270
Looks like the kids were playing with it and knocked it over.

40
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,460
If the elder gets to know about this, I'll be in trouble.

41
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,730
- What should I do? 
 - Let's hurry. I'll get my car keys.

42
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,200
Let's take my car.

43
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,740
Were you with someone in there?

44
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,120
I thought I heard someone talking.

45
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,300
No. I was alone.

46
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,650
Oh, I must have misheard.

47
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,830
You must be tired from all the festival celebrations.

48
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,390
You should take it easy.

49
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:50,010
   

50
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:55,080
   
   

51
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,150
   

52
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,140
   

53
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,240
I think you got a message.

54
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,960
What? Oh.

55
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,300
   

56
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,790
What's he even talking about?

57
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,360
Why do you say so?

58
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,300
It's a spam message.

59
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,650
Oh no. Young Master.

60
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,120
Are you all right?

61
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,930
Yes, I get random headaches these days.

62
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,480
It'll go away after some time.

63
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,390
So you think Circus Man approached your fake character?

64
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,800
Yes.

65
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,890
It's all in there.

66
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,130
His ID is Kill4U. His personal information is private.

67
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,760
He's online now, so I'm tracking him in real-time. 
   

68
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,230
As of now, I have only seen his messages. I haven't responded yet. What should I do?

69
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,660
Send him a reply. I'm sure he's trying to groom you.

70
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,140
Okay.

71
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,850
  : Aren't you sick of using the ax in this game? 
  : Weren't you considering pretending to be a robber and stealing money from your mother? 

72
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,850
  : It won't be easy because of the CCTVs. I'm a police officer. I might be able to help you out... 
  : Why the hell are you impersonating a cop? If you're actually a cop why would you help me? 

73
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,830
  : Former cop. Quit for personal reasons. I figured I'd help you because we're gaming friends. If you don't like it then quit.
 : Okay! Send me a picture as proof. 

74
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,090
  : Satisfied? I hate my mom too. I know just how you feel. 

75
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,100
He uses teenage slang quite well.

76
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,920
He probably checks in every day so that he can catch prey.

77
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,600
It's definitely similar to Circus Man's MO. 
  (MO - modus operandi - a criminal's personal pattern) 

78
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,060
Yes!

79
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,350
I found the IP address.

80
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,330
What's the location?

81
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,250
Some kind of nerve he had to not reroute it.

82
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,360
It's the Style Internet Cafe at 40-Wonsang Road, Wonsang District, Vimo Town.

83
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,100
It's in the same area as Darae Internet Cafe, from which you received the threat mails.

84
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,020
Here's the IP address.

85
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,120
It's strange how easy it was to find it.

86
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,100
We'll know once we reach there. Buy us some time by talking to him until we arrive.

87
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,660
Yes, sir.

88
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,330
Hey, Chad. We have a location on the Circus Man suspect. Go to Style Internet Cafe, 40 Wonsang Road, Wonsang District, Vimo Town.

89
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,800
We're heading there now.

90
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,800
Let's go.

91
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,890
Dae Sik, we have to move out!

92
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,060
  :  I'd rather die than live like this.  
  : Yeah, you aren't any lesser than your brother. 

93
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,190
Act like you're really angry with your mother.

94
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,880
Yes, Ma'am.

95
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,400
  : We should show her that she can't play favorites with her kids. Don't you agree? 

96
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,770
We need to ask him what weapon to use.

97
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,340
For now, talk to him about something else,

98
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,700
then bring up that you have string lights.

99
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,440
Yes, Ma'am.

100
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,890
  : I'll need something to tie her up with. I want to do it soon. When?  
   : Quite enthusiastic, huh? Fine, what do you have? 

101
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:56,060
  : I have string and green tape. Oh, I also have string lights that we use at Christmas.  
   : String lights? That'll be good. 

102
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,730
 It might actually be him. 

103
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,440
 Who the hell are you? 

104
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,940
 Why are you using kids so cruelly? 

105
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,730
 This is Dispatch 3. Do you have the info on Style Internet Cafe?  
    

106
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:15,900
It's on the second floor of the Dongmyeong Building in the shopping district. There are only 2 entrances:  front and back.

107
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,360
Cap.

108
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,660
   

109
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,670
Team Leader Park, Detective Shim, and I will go through the front entrance.  Detective Gu and Chad will take the back.

110
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,130
   

111
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,360
  : Where do you live, Noona? Which department were you in? 

112
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,990
   

113
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,870
   

114
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,380
Wh-What do you want?

115
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,320
I'm a cop.

116
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,900
I'm looking for someone. Where is this computer?

117
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,280
Give me a minute.

118
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,280
There it is, Number 27.

119
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,690
   

120
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,910
Don't move. Put your hands up!

121
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,580
- Is this the right one? 
 -  Yes, it is! 

122
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,100
- What's the matter? 
 - Were you sitting here the whole time?

123
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,790
  : Where do you live, Noona? Which department were you in?  
   : You've got to show me your sincerity before I can tell you that. 

124
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,000
  : Is it true I won't be caught, with all the forensic investigation and whatnot?  
   : I'm a former cop, wouldn't I know? 

125
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,880
She is KILL4U,

126
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,770
but her build is completely different from the Circus Man I saw.

127
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,580
She's not who we're looking for.

128
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,620
Damn it.

129
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,910
Gosh.

130
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,320
You're a really scary, kid! What kind of things do you have in your head that makes you say such nasty stuff?

131
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,750
Look at all this.

132
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,540
What were you going to do after you lured in that kid?

133
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,030
What's wrong with what I did?

134
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,030
Don't you know the student culture these days?

135
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,980
How old-fashioned. So annoying.

136
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,560
Old-fashioned?

137
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,380
Fine then, I'll show you just what I can do!

138
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,230
Do you know what happens when you con people

139
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,090
in cyberspace? You're committing fraud.

140
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,060
What you are doing right now

141
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,750
is a crime! A crime!

142
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,730
What's your name? What's your resident registration number?

143
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,450
- What are you talking about? 
 - Tell me right now!

144
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,960
If you refuse to ID yourself when the police ask,

145
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,290
you could get a penalty.

146
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,480
- Kwon Saet Byeol. 
 - What?

147
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,990
- It's Kwon Saet Byeol. 
 -  Your resident registration number?

148
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,260
It's 040725...

149
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,840
439567.

150
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,060
This is Dispatch 1.

151
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,810
 Her name is Kwon Saet Byeol and her resident registration number is 

152
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,630
 040725 439567. Please look it up. 

153
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,160
Okay.

154
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,270
Team Leader Park, I've looked into her personal details and criminal record.

155
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,210
She's 18 years old and was adopted at age 4.

156
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:03,090
She was put on probation three months ago.

157
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,500
She usually approaches users in the community who are in their teens or 20s,

158
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,800
and impersonates a cop to extort money from them.

159
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,660
Also, in her testimony, she said that she had no option but to run away from home

160
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,030
because of her adoptive parents' constant abuse.

161
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,060
But the abuse reports say that they've been cleared of all charges.

162
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:23,710
 Her adoptive parents cooperated with the investigation and provided explanations for all suspicious incidents. 

163
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,520
This little kid is already...

164
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,350
Why did you do all this? Huh?

165
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,160
Stop it! You don't know anything about me!

166
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,150
Unless you are going to give me money just shut up!

167
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,230
This is driving me crazy.

168
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,730
Gosh, things aren't going to turn out well for—

169
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,050
What's your parents' contact information?

170
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,300
- What? 
 - I asked you what your parents' contact information is.

171
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,180
No. Please don't!

172
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,850
I'll go to jail instead.

173
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,030
If I go back to my house then he will...

174
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,350
- What's wrong? 
 - Agent Park,

175
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,860
give us the phone number of Kwon Saet Byeol's parents.

176
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,400
I said no!

177
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,720
If you send me back to him then I'll kill myself!

178
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,580
She refuses to go so let's not force her.

179
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,510
Isn't there a place where she can stay for some time?

180
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,190
But according to the rules...

181
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,050
She said she doesn't want to go!

182
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,120
Contact the juvenile care team. I'm sure you have something like that here.

183
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,360
Yes, I'll go there.

184
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,390
Just don't send me back to my house.

185
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,500
Okay.

186
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,340
Now that we have agreed, you should calm down.

187
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,120
Wasn't there another user in the community who said she was a female cop?

188
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,700
It should be similar to Circus Man.

189
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,820
There wasn't.

190
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,590
I think we're done here. We should go.

191
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,330
Yes.

192
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,990
I'm sorry. I should have been more careful before reporting it to you.

193
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,460
Damn it. How embarrassing.

194
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,190
No. Going forward, there will be more days like this.

195
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,700
But now that you are a part of our team, you cannot give up. You need to keep searching.

196
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,920
Yes.

197
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,830
Oh, yes. Did you figure out who runs the community site?

198
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,620
Not yet.

199
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,090
Since it's a game on the dark web, they have tight security for the communities.

200
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,820
The care team will be here soon. Take care of her until they arrive.

201
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
Okay.

202
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,870
Once you're at the facility, you need to do as they tell you.

203
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,720
Tell the care team everything that you went through.

204
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,220
Wait in the car for a while.

205
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,430
   

206
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,070
   
   

207
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,720
   
   

208
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,500
   

209
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,130
You had to come all the way here because of us.

210
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,220
You must be very busy. I'm so sorry.

211
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,090
It's no problem at all.

212
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,340
You have completely broken the figure's hand, huh?

213
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,900
How did this happen?

214
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,000
Well, actually, it fell while the

215
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,220
- kids were playing hide-and-seek. 
 - Oh, I see.

216
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,730
If the village elder finds out, he'll be furious.

217
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,890
It's all right. Don't worry. I'll fix it before he gets to know.

218
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,000
Since I made this,

219
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,730
I have some secret know-how.

220
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,790
All right.

221
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,550
You haven't seen this before, have you?

222
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,200
I'll put it back together in no time.

223
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:36,720
There you go. It's fixed. You can't tell, right?

224
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,730
Wow!

225
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,880
I have fixed it with a strong wire.

226
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,310
So the kids can play with it as much as they want to.

227
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,530
I'll never forget this favor.

228
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,220
Don't say it like that. Here you go.

229
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,700
Are you trying to play tricks after having broken the offering to the spirits?

230
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,260
I'm sorry, Elder. It was my mistake!

231
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,020
Punish me!

232
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,590
Punish me, Elder!

233
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,090
Grandpa, you'll make the kids cry.

234
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,060
Mistakes happen sometimes. Don't bring the whip out when we're all family here.

235
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,100
I've fixed it now, so please let this go.

236
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,600
You cannot do that, Elder.

237
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,270
- Once you make an exception... 
 - Isn't the festival...

238
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,730
for Sonang Village?

239
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,560
On a day everyone should be enjoying, we can't let someone cry.

240
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,730
They're just kids.

241
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,230
Min, what you said isn't wrong.

242
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,530
Let tomorrow be a happy day.

243
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,360
I'll... forget this happened.

244
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,900
Yes.

245
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,790
Children...

246
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,440
this stone

247
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,070
is the spirit of Sonang Village.

248
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,580
So you need to be careful with it.

249
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,310
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

250
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,480
The both of you

251
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,320
should head back in.

252
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,200
Thank you, Elder.

253
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,560
Thank you, Elder.

254
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,690
Let's go.

255
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,000
Byeong Cheol.

256
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,750
You should head back as well.

257
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,610
I want to

258
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,300
talk to him.

259
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,770
Yes, Elder.

260
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,050
I'm sorry for being so stubborn despite breaking the rules.

261
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,660
No one can beat you when it comes to being stubborn. It's allright.

262
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,920
I heard you went to the police station yesterday.

263
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,610
Oh, yes. Some murderer has fled to our island.

264
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,020
He was disguised as a woman so they asked me a few questions.

265
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,820
So I just told them what I knew.

266
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,900
For the time being,

267
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,760
you shouldn't

268
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,390
speak with any outsiders.

269
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:11,520
Apparently,  what happened to Prosecutor Gong's daughter was also because she got involved with outsiders.

270
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,170
We are the only ones who can

271
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,790
protect this island...

272
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,890
and Sonang Village.

273
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,760
Anyway...

274
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,670
Seo Ha's father is the real problem.

275
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,910
Tell him I'll divorce him if he does this again.

276
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,640
Mi Yeon,

277
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,720
I know what he did was wrong,

278
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,770
- but you should consider moving back to your house and living togeth-- 
 - Dad!

279
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,090
What are you saying?

280
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,160
Just look at Seo Ha's condition.

281
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,690
The doctors said...

282
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,540
she will have to amputate her leg.

283
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,000
But look at her.

284
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,340
She's using crutches to walk.

285
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,590
At this festival,

286
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,440
they're doing a ritual in which girls sleep in a stone house

287
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,250
and are reborn.

288
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,850
Seo Ha might still be young,

289
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,380
but I asked them to include her despite that.

290
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,510
You never know.

291
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,530
She might walk out of there on her own two legs,

292
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,070
completely healed.

293
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,110
Dad,

294
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,620
what is with your expression?

295
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,820
Mi Yeon,

296
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,870
if it was a disability that would get healed by just praying then all hospitals would shut down.

297
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,710
When I told you to come back to Sonang Village,

298
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,560
I meant you had to pull yourself together, not hope for a miracle!

299
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,780
Although it may be a tradition, if you trust these superstitions too much—

300
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,260
Superstition?

301
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,220
Why would you say that now?

302
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,200
I mean,

303
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,370
so what if it's a superstition?

304
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,130
I'll...

305
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:02,380
do anything if it means my child can walk on her own two legs.

306
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,180
If you say something like that one more time,

307
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,520
then I'll never speak to you again.

308
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,530
Seo Ha,

309
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,190
let's go.

310
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,060
   

311
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,080
 What's important is that my mother's death was a murder. 

312
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,070
 And someone in a raincoat put a whirlpool tattoo on her wrist. 

313
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:55,620
   

314
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,400
Who's there?

315
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,250
It's me.

316
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,370
You gave me a scare.

317
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,180
What are you doing here?

318
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,990
I was just passing by

319
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,790
and I saw the light on.

320
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,630
Wow, it looks good.

321
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,340
I'll get going.

322
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,230
Have a good day.

323
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,890
 You want to be transferred to the Dispatch Team? 

324
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,160
I've been thinking about it for a while now.

325
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,810
If I can personally save victims on the scene,

326
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,660
I think it will be useful

327
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,200
even if I end up working at the center again.

328
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,220
Agent Park,

329
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,890
if you're transferred to the Dispatch Team,

330
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,190
then you'll face a lot more difficulties. Are you sure about this?

331
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,070
I'll have to overcome those difficulties.

332
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:57,060
I really want to do this.

333
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,160
All right.

334
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,250
I'll send in a transfer request to the Commissioner right away.

335
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,970
Instead, promise me one thing.

336
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,860
However difficult the job may be,

337
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,470
you'll never give up.

338
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,650
Yes, I will remember that.

339
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,590
You'll find this uncomfortable.  Why don't you stay at the hotel? Why come here?

340
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,030
We don't have much time.

341
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,560
Circus Man

342
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,420
will definitely approach Director Kang.

343
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,330
Staying close will be for the best.

344
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,330
Yes, Cap.

345
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,410
You can call me anytime.

346
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,850
Okay.

347
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,750
I'll be here just for a week so please bear with me.

348
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,090
Do you always speak as if you are notifying people?

349
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,400
It's important to set ground rules.

350
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,790
That way no one crosses any lines.

351
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,440
You don't keep eye contact during a conversation.

352
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,770
Is it a habit or—

353
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:56,880
Everyone has their own problems.

354
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,530
I heard...

355
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,580
about your sister.

356
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,390
These...

357
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,800
are the sleeping pills that I take.

358
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,570
You can take some if you need to.

359
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,080
In case I do need them, I'll get my own.

360
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,950
 Sorry. Sorry. 

361
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,520
 I am sorry. 

362
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,510
 Sorry, Dad. 

363
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,690
 Dad, it's all my fault. 

364
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,520
 Yeah, now if you had been like that from the beginning,  

365
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,850
 I wouldn't have had to hit you like this. 

366
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,490
 I'm just trying to raise you as a good American. 

367
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,460
 Not a weak little Asian 

368
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,970
 who people will kick around! 

369
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,810
 Now, 

370
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:17,620
 bring your sister, Lisa, here right now. 

371
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,230
 That little girl doesn't listen 

372
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:24,090
 to a word I say. 

373
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,840
 If you do that 

374
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,560
 I will let you go to have a nice dinner. 

375
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,450
 Do you understand? 

376
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,640
 Do you understand! 

377
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,190
 Then, go. 

378
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,810
 Go! 

379
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,040
 A long, long time ago, a mother and 

380
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,240
her 500 children were living happily.

381
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,580
Then one day, the village had a lean year,

382
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,100
so there was nothing to eat.

383
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,110
Mother gathered even the last grain of rice

384
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,590
and put it in a big cauldron. My goodness.

385
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,490
She made porridge in the big cauldron, waiting for her children to come home.

386
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:24,440
But then accidentally, she fell into the cauldron.

387
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,280
Splash!

388
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:33,700
"It's so hot!" "Help me!"

389
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,030
Her children then came home

390
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,830
and looked around for their mother.

391
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,150
But they were starving,

392
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:47,590
so they ate the porridge inside the cauldron with gusto.

393
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,910
Then, the youngest one found

394
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,340
a hairpin inside the cauldron.

395
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,180
"Wait. This is Mom's hairpin!"

396
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,250
"Mommy, I'm so sorry."

397
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:03,230
"We ate you without knowing that it was you."

398
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,760
Please don't kill me.

399
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:11,810
Please... I'll d-do anything for you

400
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,950
if you let me go.

401
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,330
You don't know how sweet

402
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,680
your terrified face is, do you?

403
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,190
All right.

404
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,920
So, what's the moral of the story? If you guess correctly, I'll let you go.

405
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,700
What a-are you talking about all of a sudden?

406
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,050
Do y-you... If you need money, let me know.

407
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,950
My dad is really rich. He'll pay as much as you ask for my ransom.

408
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,360
We're pretty well-off too.

409
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,270
I'll let you go home if you guess the answer correctly. Here.

410
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:00,330
What is the moral

411
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,120
of this story?

412
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,760
What?

413
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,660
You think you'll be able to get away with this! My dad is a prosecutor!

414
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,920
He'll find you and kill you!

415
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,860
The answer is "lies."

416
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,770
If needed, humans even kill their own kids for personal gain.

417
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,510
The same goes for your father.

418
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,510
You live together when you don't even mean that much to each other.

419
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,410
Don't you think it's sickening?

420
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:35,340
I pray that you take pity on me. Please forgive me.

421
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,210
I pray... Please help me.

422
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:46,030
Please help me foresee the future again. I pray...

423
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,620
The delicate ember...

424
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,180
lost its light...

425
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:20,130
It's coming.

426
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,160
It'll swallow up Sonang Village.

427
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,100
It's coming.

428
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,830
 Noona! Noona, where are you? 

429
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,420
 Don't go, Noona! Don't go! 

430
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,850
   

431
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,910
Angry...

432
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,760
That's the prey from earlier.

433
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,370
I thought I lost him because of that fool, Dong Bang Min.

434
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,280
Hold on.

435
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,860
It doesn't feel right.

436
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,850
Let me look into this more. Just a second.

437
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,870
   

438
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:36,960
   
   

439
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,450
He must be a cop. "Angry."

440
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:49,890
They must think I'm an idiot. String lights, out of nowhere?

441
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,870
This is a trap.

442
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,700
Cops...

443
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,060
How dare they set up a trap?

444
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:20,540
As the manager of the team's fan forum, this is embarrassing.

445
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,190
How could I mess up my first assignment?

446
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:30,370
I really need to get my act together. I'll get fired at this rate.

447
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,480
What is this?

448
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,890
   

449
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,670
"CCman"?

450
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,710
That kind of sounds like Circus Man.

451
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,870
No, that can't be.

452
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,310
This person just wants to buy the badge.

453
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,370
Should I report this?

454
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,090
Gosh, no.

455
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:08,860
I may actually get fired if I'm wrong again.

456
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:21,060
First, I need to make sure whether or not it's really him.

457
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,790
   

458
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,140
   

459
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,390
   

460
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,000
I looked into it and he's covered up many cases related to his acquaintances.

461
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,270
But I've only heard good things about Sonang Village and Dong Bang Heon Yup.

462
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:44,760
Everyone says the village reformed the criminals who settled there.

463
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,400
I do not believe that humans are inherently that kind.

464
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,630
And that Dong Bang Min too. Something's off about him.

465
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,430
I'll meet with him later today.

466
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:59,220
As soon as I hear his voice, I'll know whether he's Circus Man.

467
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,290
There it is.

468
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,680
You are here to meet Koo Hyung Tae? 
    

469
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,380
May I ask why you are looking for him?

470
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,660
It's simply a witness interview.

471
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,160
Oh, I see. I can't help you though.

472
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,420
His chronic illness was so aggravated that

473
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,250
we sent him to a hospital on the mainland for treatment.

474
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,300
Can we take a look around then?

475
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,440
Yes, Sonang Village is open to everybody.

476
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,700
Let me show you around.

477
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,690
Here we'll have a museum that is opening shortly.

478
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,580
Let's go on ahead.

479
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:13,610
This is our community residence.

480
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,810
Please come this way.

481
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:26,620
What you see here is something we've worked very hard on for decades.

482
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,610
Do you all remember?

483
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,510
Our village's...

484
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,300
- That's... 
 - ...first...

485
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,290
Every morning we listen to the elder's wise words.

486
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:45,120
What is first?

487
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,930
 All families will be free of restraint 

488
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,610
 and become happy! 

489
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,610
That's right.

490
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,130
He must be Dong Bang Heon Yup.

491
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,670
Escape from the restraints of blood ties,

492
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,990
so that everyone can become a part of one big family.

493
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,830
That is the spirit of the Sonang Village.

494
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,120
- Do you think 
   - When you are in pain... 

495
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,430
he actually means all that nonsense?

496
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,560
 ...you share it. 

497
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,150
   

498
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,490
You have reached the 112 Emergency Call Center.

499
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,790
What? Your student was kidnapped?

500
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,900
From an unmanned motel?

501
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,310
Team Leader Cheon,  the caller is 35 years old, his name is Jang Hyo Joon.

502
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,030
According to the GPS tracking, the location is at the Vimo Beach Unmanned Motel on

503
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,680
25-Sangyeon Road, Sangyeon Neighborhood.

504
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,530
Team Leader Cheon.

505
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:40,030
Director Kang, a high school teacher just reported that his student might have been kidnapped.

506
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:45,150
The location is an unmanned motel in the Sangyeon neighborhood. He even received a photo of his student being threatened by someone in a clown disguise.

507
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,820
I'll head to the center right away.

508
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,920
There was a kidnapping case in the Sangyeon neighborhood.

509
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,150
You should go there now.

510
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,160
Sangyeon neighborhood? Wait a minute.

511
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,910
Sangyeon neighborhood is in the opposite direction from here.

512
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:58,820
You should go first. I'll join you later.

513
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,400
 At this time, we should cheer up. 

514
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,310
Chad.

515
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:10,790
This is Director Kang. Team Leader Cheon, explain the situation to me again.

516
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,920
The caller is 35 years old. His name is Jang Hyo Joon. He is a teacher at Suan High School.

517
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,430
The victim is a sophomore at Suan High School, Kwon Saet Byeol.

518
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,480
 She's the girl from yesterday's internet cafe case. 

519
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,920
 On the way to the shelter, she lied to the care team about having a stomach ache and ran away. 

520
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,990
 Saet Byeol!  
    

521
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,310
Saet Byeol! It's Mr. Jang!

522
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,770
Please reply if you're in there!

523
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,600
Saet Byeol!

524
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,190
Who the hell are you? Have you gone mad?

525
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,790
What are you doing?

526
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,550
Saet Byeol.

527
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,090
Saet Byeol!

528
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,340
What are you doing?

529
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,100
We don't let students come in here!

530
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,520
Let go of me!

531
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,280
A student was kidnapped and is locked somewhere in here.

532
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,590
I got a text from her!

533
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,760
I don't know anything about that!

534
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,990
Look here. I beg you!

535
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,670
Please open the door!

536
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,130
Put me through to Mr. Jang Hyo Joon.

537
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,170
Yes, Ma'am.

538
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,640
I am the Director of the Vimo 112 Call Center, Kang Kwon Joo.

539
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,650
 Please, tell me what is happening so that we can help you.  
    

540
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,200
Yes. I'm an English teacher at Suan High School. I'm Saet Byeol's homeroom teacher.

541
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,410
Do you know why your student went there?

542
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:24,570
I had been keeping an eye on Saet Byeol because she was being abused by her adoptive parents.

543
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,330
But a few days ago she ran away from home again.

544
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,000
 What are you up to? 

545
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,830
 Why do you ask? 

546
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,670
 What's with that surprised look? 

547
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:38,210
 You didn't come to school for three days. I looked around for you everywhere, you punk. 

548
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,740
 Do you... have some money? 

549
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,340
 Money? 

550
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,910
 Nevermind. Forget it. 

551
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,790
 Did your adoptive father hit you again? 

552
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:53,030
 Mind your own business. Why do you care?  

553
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,400
 This won't do. I need to report this. 

554
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,200
 Please just leave me alone! 

555
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,450
 If you call the cops again then you won't see me ever again. 

556
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,070
    
    

557
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,190
   

558
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,350
    
    

559
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,750
 What's all this? 

560
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,790
 Don't interfere. 

561
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,180
 Saet Byeol. Kwon Saet Byeol! 

562
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,460
I thought she was being blackmailed by some bullies.

563
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,200
Kids who are abused by their parents

564
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,040
usually fall for such things,

565
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,420
because they crave affection.

566
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:31,200
 Where are you right now? You told me you were going to class.  Why aren't you in your classroom? 

567
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,350
 Mr. Jang. Another anonymous complaint came in. 

568
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,530
 I've told you already. 

569
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:42,460
 You can't keep favoring certain students. 

570
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,820
 There are already some unsavory rumors. 

571
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,290
 Mr. Jang, listen to me carefully. 

572
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,600
 Please don't report this to the police. 

573
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,570
 Come the the Vimo Beach... 

574
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,360
 Unmanned Motel right away. 

575
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,190
 After running away from home, I had no more money, 

576
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:11,100
 so I pretended to be a cop and conned somebody. But he turned out to be a gangster. 

577
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,620
 He'll let me go if you come and pay the money, but if not, he'll sell me off! 

578
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,250
 Please come and save me! 

579
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,260
   

580
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,090
 The call cannot be connected. 

581
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,230
 I'll tell you later. 

582
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,990
 Wait! 

583
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:31,050
Saet Byeol might be put in danger if I report it to the police,

584
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:35,290
so I came alone, but no one is here so I'm reporting it.

585
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:37,630
I'm certain something has happened to Saet Byeol!

586
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,850
 Why did she ask for her homeroom teacher to come? 

587
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:43,110
 If money is really what he wanted, he would have asked for her parents. 

588
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:46,310
Are Saet Byeol's parents aware of the situation?

589
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,350
Please, you can't!

590
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:51,560
Those people have been abusing Saet Byeol for a very long time.

591
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:54,210
Please just come quickly.

592
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,130
I understand.

593
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,130
Then first, the photo and the voice recording you received from Saet Byeol,

594
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,900
please text them to me.

595
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,920
I just sent them.

596
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,430
Officer Han, send me the voice recording and the photo the caller just sent to me.

597
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:13,750
Check whether there have been any recent reports of abuse on Saet Byeol. Wait for me at the center.

598
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,360
 All right. 

599
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:21,390
Agent Ko, please get the personal information on the adoptive parents of Saet Byeol and see if there are any reports of child abuse.

600
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,560
 I will. 

601
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,480
   

602
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,990
   

603
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,110
Kwon Saet Byeol's Telenote ID and password 
    

604
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:49,090
should be the same as the ones in the Circus Pierrot Community.

605
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,680
It worked!

606
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:07,020
Director Kang, I have confirmed that Kwon Saet Byeol was being blackmailed.

607
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:12,130
Three days ago, a guy named "Pigdiss" realized that she was conning him.

608
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,470
I'll send you Kwon Saet Byeol's Telenote file.

609
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:16,640
All right. Figure out Pigdiss's identity

610
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,270
and look into whether there is any relation to Circus Man.

611
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,920
 All right. 

612
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,000
   

613
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,810
Pigdiss?

614
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,510
Director Kang, I have sent you the personal details of Kwon Saet Byeol's foster parents.

615
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:43,640
Her father is a lawyer and her mother is a  professor of child welfare.

616
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,500
They were cleared of all child abuse charges. They haven't even gotten so much as a speeding ticket.

617
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,820
- I'll take a look. 
 - Sure.

618
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,890
     

619
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:53,640
      
    

620
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,760
   

621
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,320
 Just by looking at the files, I can tell Kwon Saet Byeol is a trouble maker. Yesterday's incident is proof.  

622
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,280
Agent Ko, find all the files related to Mr. Jang Hyo Joon.

623
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,450
All right.

624
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,170
   

625
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,580
We have a Code Zero case.
    

626
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,090
 The caller is Jang Hyo Joon, 35 years old. He is an English teacher at Suan High School.  
      

627
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,710
The caller reported that he received a voice message

628
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:13,890
from his student, Kwon Saet Byeol, who is being held at

629
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,310
Vimo Beach Unmanned Motel, 25-Sangyeon Road, Sangyeon Neighborhood.

630
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,400
 He even received a photo of the victim. 

631
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,200
We don't know the kidnapper's identity yet.

632
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,490
It's highly likely that he's assaulting and threatening the victim.

633
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:27,100
Requesting all officers to wear their safety vests before heading out.  Be mindful of your safety.

634
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,710
 All Dispatch teams heading out. 

635
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,740
   

636
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,330
 Detective Jo, the Dispatch Teams are on the move now. 

637
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:41,610
I'll get going right away.

638
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:43,340
Let's go.

639
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,110
Open the door! 
    

640
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,150
Open the door, sir!

641
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:51,090
Open up!

642
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:52,350
Sir!

643
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:54,930
Go back and find out everything you can about Dong Bang Min and the Sonang Village.

644
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:57,290
Yes, Cap.

645
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:58,350
 Saet Byeol! 

646
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,120
Mr. Jang?

647
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:02,840
I'm Detective Derek Jo of the Golden Time Team.

648
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,720
Are you sure Kwon Saet Byeol is being kept here?

649
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,390
Yes, there's no time.

650
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:08,000
Please save Saet Byeol.

651
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,490
   

652
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,840
Detective Jo.

653
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,300
There you are.

654
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,780
Why would there be a student at a motel?

655
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,080
I'm sure she came here!

656
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,710
Just ignore him and go in.

657
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,880
We're going in.

658
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,300
Detective Jo, I heard the victim is Kwon Saet Byeol from yesterday's case.

659
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,860
Yes.

660
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,990
Ah, really.

661
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,410
Did you check them all?

662
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:37,070
There's nothing missing?

663
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,060
I'm telling the truth.

664
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,760
This couple was the last people to come in.

665
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,740
You see here, right? There are only five occupied rooms.

666
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:48,980
The kid you're talking about never came here.

667
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,540
I think it will be best if we look into this ourselves.

668
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:57,620
Team Leader Park, Detective Gu, and Sergeant Park take the second floor.  I'll search the third floor along with Detective Shim.

669
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,560
- Guard the entrance well. 
 - Got it.

670
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,630
Leave it to us.

671
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,550
Open the door!

672
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:18,720
Yes?

673
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,080
Police.

674
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,520
Have you seen this student?

675
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,420
 No, we haven't. 

676
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,900
There's no one here.

677
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,450
Is anyone there? This is the police.

678
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,070
Can you please open the door?

679
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:30,890
We're in the midst of a search.

680
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,080
What's going on here today!

681
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,130
 This is the police. Can we please have a quick look? 

682
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,890
 I'm sorry. Thank you for cooperating. 

683
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:40,180
Sorry.

684
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,160
Agent Han, did you find Pigdiss's identity?

685
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,090
As of now, I have his Telenote ID.

686
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,110
But it was registered with a fake email address.

687
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,880
The IP is really suspicious as well.

688
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,780
Anyway, I'll continue to look into it.

689
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,400
I've definitely heard it before.

690
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,860
Detective Kang! Regarding what you asked for earlier,

691
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,290
Jang Hyo Joon received disciplinary action for improper conduct and violence at his previous school.

692
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:05,290
But it was canceled several times.

693
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,940
- Send me the files. 
 - Okay.

694
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,140
   

695
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:20,790
Yes.

696
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:24,040
Mr. Jang Hyo Joon, I'm Director Kang. We talked earlier.

697
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,310
I have something to ask.

698
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:29,930
Weren't you disciplined several times for charges like

699
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,390
accepting bribes at your previous school?

700
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:34,710
What does that have to do with this?

701
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:36,870
But Kwon Saet Byeol's parents

702
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:40,660
were cleared of all abuse charges, based on what we found.

703
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:44,610
Are you going to ask about me accepting bribes and having an affair with a colleague?

704
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,860
 The truth was already revealed! 

705
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:50,440
Use this time to save Saet Byeol instead.

706
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,080
 Hello? 

707
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,660
Are you Saet Byeol's mother? I'm Director Kang Kwon Joo from the Vimo Sation.

708
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,830
Your daughter sent a message that she was being assaulted by somebody to her homeroom teacher.

709
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,480
The police are currently investigating.

710
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,670
 Was it Mr. Jang Hyo Joon? Gosh. 

711
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,730
 That man, again. 

712
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:20,180
Did something like this happen previously?

713
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:23,710
 Yes! I'm sure he's saying that we hit Saet Byeol and she's all covered in bruises. 

714
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,490
 That's from her eczema! 

715
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,740
 She constantly runs away and deceives people. 

716
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,710
 He's pushing her to go astray. 

717
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:34,570
 That man really should not be teaching any kids! 

718
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:37,070
 Saet Byeol will come back on her own. 

719
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,960
Ma'am!

720
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,240
Director Kang, Kwon Saet Byeol's cell phone just switched on.

721
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:51,120
This is Center. Kwon Saet Byeol's phone was just switched on so we got its location.

722
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,620
 It's on a road which is about five minutes away from the motel. 

723
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:57,100
Sir! Saet Byeol's cell phone was turned back on.

724
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,720
It's on the coastal road in Sangyeon.

725
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,990
Apparently, Saet Byeol's bruises are from her eczema. Is this true?

726
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:07,160
Did you contact her parents?

727
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,600
I told you not to contact them!

728
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,830
Why are you ignoring my words!

729
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,950
Let's talk after we find Saet Byeol.

730
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:18,680
And if they were actually abusing her then we will do a proper investigation and make sure they are punished.

731
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:31,360
You guys are all talk.

732
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,350
You don't care about saving people's lives!

733
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,600
Forget it.

734
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,390
Why is he acting like that!

735
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,440
Let's go.

736
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,380
I'm going to continue investigating here a bit more.

737
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,810
I'll stay behind and continue investigating with him.

738
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,790
Sure, then we'll head toward the beach area.

739
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,370
- The three of you can search around here. 
 - Yes.

740
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:55,750
Let's go.

741
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,470
 Please don't call the police. 

742
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:00,960
 Come to the Vimo Beach... 

743
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,320
 Unmanned Motel right away. 

744
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,620
 Jang Hyo Joon was right. 

745
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:07,070
 Her eyes and voice are filled with pure fright. 

746
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:10,180
 Then, why was the name of the motel incorrect? 

747
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,980
Have you seen this student here?

748
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,190
I have never seen this person.

749
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,620
 This is Dispatch 1. Director Kang, 

750
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:41,260
 it looks like someone threw away Kwon Saet Byeol's cell phone in the trash. 

751
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:44,160
 Some kids turned it back on to help the owner find the cell phone. 

752
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,820
Go back to Motel Town in the meantime.

753
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,410
 If someone there threw away the cell phone on purpose, 

754
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:52,470
 then this is a sign that Saet Byeol is in real danger. 

755
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,580
 Teacher, listen to me carefully. 

756
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,040
 Please don't call the police. 

757
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,220
 Come the the Vimo Beach... 

758
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,770
 Unmanned Motel right away. 

759
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:05,990
 What was that? 

760
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:10,310
 When she said the word "Beach" her voice became much tenser.  

761
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,710
 Listen to me carefully. 

762
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,230
 Please don't call the police. 

763
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:17,030
 Come the the Vimo Beach... 

764
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:19,160
 Queen... 

765
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,060
 The place Saet Byul was talking about was the Vimo Beach Queen Unmanned Motel. 

766
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,680
 She purposely said "Queen"  more quietly 

767
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,470
 so that we wouldn't catch on properly. 

768
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,500
 She has been kidnapped. 

769
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,280
 So then why did she do that? 

770
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,920
 Vimo Beach Queen...? 

771
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,980
 The logo is a queen. And even though it's faint I can see "Queen" written there. 

772
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,460
 If the name wasn't Vimo Beach, 

773
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,930
 but it was Vimo Beach Queen instead... 

774
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,860
   

775
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:00,650
 Detective, I think I found Saet Byeol's location. 

776
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:04,220
It wasn't the Vimo Beach Unmanned Motel but the Vimo Beach Queen Unmanned Motel instead.

777
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:07,460
I'm not sure why but I think the culprit was targeting Mr. Jang Hyo Joon.

778
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:12,130
Saet Byeol must have said the word "Queen" quietly so that he wouldn't go there.

779
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:14,880
 I was on my way there anyway. 

780
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,460
   

781
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:40,710
   

782
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:50,480
 Vimo Beach Queen... 

783
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,400
 The name is similar. 

784
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,220
 No way. 

785
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:01,490
   

786
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,880
Saet Byeol.

787
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,410
Saet Byeol!

788
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,270
Saet Byeol!

789
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:53,640
Saet Byeol!

790
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,540
Saet Byeol!

791
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:59,740
Saet Byeol!

792
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:10,560
It's okay. Saet Byeol, it's all right.

793
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,630
You're okay now. I'm here.

794
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,720
Director Kang, I kept thinking about how Pigdiss sounded like something I had heard before.

795
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,900
Turns out he was the guy who does manipulated broadcasts, every time there is a hot issue while wearing a pig mask.

796
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,160
In his last broadcast, he accused an innocent person

797
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,220
of being a suspect in a parking lot murder case. He almost got kicked out of Hot TV for doing that.

798
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:43,420
But today he uploaded a video in which he said he was going to teach a lesson to a police impersonator and a corrupt teacher.

799
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,860
- What? 
 - Let me share.

800
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:50,780
 Because of his homeroom teacher, JHJ,  

801
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:53,660
 our informant's school days were no different from hell. 

802
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,560
 Because of JHJ, 

803
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:00,500
 he not only became a loner but was also assaulted by his homeroom teacher. 

804
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,800
 What's worse is, when the school violence hearing started,  
    

805
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,620
 he took money and all sorts of other bribes from the perpetrator  

806
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,280
 and then actually took the perp's side.  

807
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,260
- Turn on the broadcast. 
 - Is this a true story?

808
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,690
Hey, you, Mr. Garbage.

809
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:29,310
Once I say "action," hit the fraudster's face with that bat.

810
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,660
 Let all your anger out. 

811
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:41,110
If this isn't on a legendary level then I'll put that fraud's private photos on the live broadcast.

812
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:53,670
   

813
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:56,650
Director Jang, we're connected to the live broadcast now.

814
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:58,880
 You go, Pigdiss! 

815
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,000
 Once Pigdiss bites on something, he never lets go. 

816
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,210
 Oh, right! Donations. 

817
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:06,540
 Thanks Vimo_D, I'll send you my bank account number right away. 

818
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,040
 This is a legendary broadcast. 

819
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,550
 Let's sit back and watch how this asshole and bitch learn their lesson. 

820
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,380
 Let's film something legendary. 

821
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:17,810
 Let's film something legendary, really. 

822
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:20,050
 Let's go. 

823
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:27,830
This is Center. The culprit is a popular broadcaster under the name of "Pigdiss"

824
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:30,780
and he's currently trying to get Jang Hyo Joon

825
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,880
to assault Kwon Saet Byeol on camera.

826
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,760
We need to have them stop immediately.

827
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,820
 He is taking it too far with this broadcast. 

828
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,620
 Even if he's a wicked broadcaster... 

829
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:44,940
 And on top of that, Mr. Jang Hyo Joon was trying to say something earlier. 

830
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,740
Agent Han, play the last part once again.

831
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,680
All right.

832
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:06,700
 Doing this won't change a thing. 

833
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:07,690
 Hold on. 

834
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:09,960
 Doing this won't change a thing. 

835
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,030
 He just said, "Doing this won't change a thing." 

836
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:16,420
  What does that mean? 

837
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:22,910
Detective Jo, increase the radio volume so that I can hear everything happening on the scene.

838
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:52,520
   

839
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,540
   

840
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:09,300


841
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,830
   

842
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:18,150
 Burying someone is no big deal. 

843
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:24,780
 You know it too, Mr. Jang. Once this goes viral, the truth won't matter anymore. 

844
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:30,180
 I warned you didn't I? If you ignored me one more time then I wouldn't stand for it. 

845
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,740
 There's a limit to how patient I can be. 

846
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,100
 I put in so much effort for you. But what did you do instead? 

847
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:37,160
 What you think you are doing for love, is actually a crime. 

848
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,410
 Can you hear me? Detective Jo! 

849
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:43,810
 That's why I'm going to punish you this time.
