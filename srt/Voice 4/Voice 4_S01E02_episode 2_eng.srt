1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600


2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,020
   

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,390
   

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,250
   

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,820
   
   

6
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,980
   

7
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,390
    

8
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,640
What is this wind leaking sound?

9
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,530
 Don't tell me... 

10
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,980
Jo Seung Ah! Jo Seung Ah!

11
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,870
 It's LPG gas! 

12
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,620
Detective Jo!

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,810
 It's a trap! There's gas leaking from there. 

14
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,340
Get away from there right now!

15
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,480
 This is Regional Unit 1. At 54 Sanggae-3-ro, Seoam neighborhood area 

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,130
 in a junk shop near Sanggae Transport Parking Lot, 

17
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,750
 a female corpse has been found. 

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,580
 A young female with long straight hair wearing a dress. 

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,120
 Seeing how she is tied with Christmas lights, 

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,630
 there is a high possibility it is Jo Seung Ah, the one  

21
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,000
 who reported the family murder in Soowan Apartments, Sanggae District. Requesting an ambulance and backup from local stations. 

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,140
Detective, are you okay?

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,750
- Detective! It's a trap set by the sus— 
 - Stop it!

24
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,700
Say one more word and I won't leave you alone.

25
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,910
 The suspect already killed Seung Ah. 

26
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,180
 She was luring us in. 

27
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,830
Chad.

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,590
Are you sure?

29
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,840
Don't look, Team Leader Jo.

30
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,850
Lisa.

31
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,180
Lisa, open your eyes.

32
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,420
Lisa, I'm here.

33
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,960
Lisa.

34
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,860
Seung Ah.

35
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,320
Seung Ah.

36
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,890
No.

37
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,160
It can't be.

38
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,220
Seung Ah.

39
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,030
The bastard should be close by.

40
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,300
Request help from the local stations and search thoroughly.

41
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,880
- Start by interrogating the neighbors of Unit 206. 
- Yes.

42
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,960
♫  Come little boys, come  ♫

43
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,730
 Similarly to how I could predict that bastard's moves, 

44
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,470
 she also knew me. 

45
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,550
 She added sounds only I could hear to trap me. 

46
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,350
-  Detective, a car is driving by.  
 -  What? 

47
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,080
 The street on your right. 

48
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,510
 Sure, no matter what kind of fate we share, 

49
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,360
 I will make sure to catch you. For sure. 

50
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,220
   

51
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,720
-  Mr. Kim, 44 years old...  
   -  A hit-and-run murder has occurred...  
    

52
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,250
- The 77-year-old adoptive father... 
    

53
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,080
    
    

54
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,800
-  He constantly sexually assaulted his elementary school daughter.  
    

55
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,480
   
    
  (T/N: Cerberus: Underworld's guard dog in Greek mythology) 

56
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,690
   

57
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,120
I told you! It was a 170cm tall woman with a bob cut wearing a black raincoat! 
    

58
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,790
If you locate her right now, I can catch up to her.

59
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,270
I'm certain she is around here somewhere.

60
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,590
I get it, Team Leader Jo. Please calm down.

61
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,210
- There's no time to lose! 
 - Take him.

62
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,260
Let me go! Let me go!

63
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,790
- Let me go! 
 - Team Leader!

64
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,300
I have to go right now!

65
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,970
   

66
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,750
- Kang Center. 
  - I gotta go! 

67
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,860
Is there... anything I can do to help?

68
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,660
I understand you're trying to help, but it's our job now, so don't worry about it.

69
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,360
 Our full team is in the field. 

70
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,660
- How is Detective Jo? 
 - No, we don't have time!

71
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,990
- I got to go! 
 - Okay, okay. Listen to me! Listen to me!

72
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,990
We need Korean authorities to work with us if we ever have to find that killer.

73
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,200
His sister died in front of his eyes, do you think he'd stay sane?

74
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,600
 Kang Center, no matter how I think about it, that e-mail is a bit strange. 

75
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,330
Four people died. It doesn't make sense that a woman killed all of them by herself.

76
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,830
She is the killer. I'm certain!

77
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,920
 This is Regional Unit 2. Team Leader! 

78
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,400
 An eyewitness reported in seeing a woman with a raincoat in Changgu District earlier. 

79
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,920
This is Regional Unit 1. Understood, I'll head over there.

80
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,690
   

81
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,960
A crazy bitch did that.

82
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:54,370
 I'm saying she left in the taxi that I grabbed. 

83
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,130
The CCTV at the intersection should have caught the plate number, hurry up and verify it.

84
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,210
- Focus! 
 - Yes, yes.

85
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,420
This is the investigation team. I need to check the CCTV at the intersection on Sanggae-3-ro, the side leaving Seoul at around 8:40 p.m.

86
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,220
No, no. Only taxis.

87
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,830
Center Director, the result of what you asked Agent Jin yesterday came out.

88
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,960
There is a possibility that the IP address is not in China, but rather on Vimo Island.

89
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,690
What?

90
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,990
At first, they thought it was through the use of a VPN.

91
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,830
However, she used the onion routing technique to hide her location and fooled the Cybersecurity team as well.

92
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,270
They need to check further, but there is a high possibility it's on Vimo Island.

93
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,260
Senior, more information about the suspect was found.

94
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,300
Well, the suspect is on the Gimpo Airport Expressway, so we are chasing after her.

95
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,270
Gimpo Airport?

96
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,730
Team Leader, I just got done speaking with the taxi driver

97
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,290
and she got off at Gate 1 of Domestic Departures.

98
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,790
It is a woman and her description is similar.

99
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,230
 He said her face was hidden behind her raincoat, however, she didn't look suspicious. 

100
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,440
Where do the domestic flights departing from Gimpo Airport fly to at this time?

101
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,300
Give me a minute.

102
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,830
There are only flights to Vimo Island.

103
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,700
Senior, the suspect is planning to flee to Vimo Island.

104
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,670
- What do you mean? 
  - Remember the e-mail I told you about earlier? 

105
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:11,960
It was a foreshadowing of today's murder. Before that, I also received similar e-mails and the sending locations for them

106
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,560
were all probably from Vimo Island. The results just came out.

107
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,400
I got it for now.

108
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,690
Find the earliest flight going to Vimo Island.

109
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,620
One at 9:10 p.m. with Air Korea, one at 9:15 p.m. with Min Air.

110
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,360
There are only two flights for Vimo Island left.

111
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,260
Call Kyeong Soo. We need to get a warrant to stop the plane from departing.

112
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,760
 I'll call you again once I get everything. 

113
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:45,790
 We will start boarding for Flight 23 of Air Korea going to Vimo Island. 

114
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,340
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I apologize.

115
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,430
What seems to be the problem?

116
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,770
I'm from the Seoul Metropolitan Police Regional Investigation Unit. We are looking for a murder suspect.

117
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,000
Besides the passengers waiting here, is there anyone who boarded first?

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,560
No. There are no boarded passengers.

119
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,770
You don't have a search warrant, right?

120
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:13,140
- Then we have to start boarding. I'm sorry. 
 - Damn it.

121
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,670
Yes, we will start boarding.

122
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,600
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,220
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,140
   

125
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,390
So, did everyone board?

126
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,930
Yes. That person was the last passenger.

127
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,050
This is Regional Unit 1 at Gate 8. We didn't find the suspect.

128
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,720
 This is Regional Unit 1. The suspect was not found at Min Air either. 

129
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,530
What is this? Center Kang was wrong.

130
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,290
Yes, what?

131
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,530
 Team Leader, it seems the suspect was at the apartment complex until recently. 

132
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:10,820
- What? 
 - According to the neighbor, there is a friend who wrote a guarantee to Lee Hyun Min's father. 
    

133
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,750
Every time the news talked about the redevelopment compensation,

134
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,790
she would come down and throw a fit.

135
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,360
Don't get me started. You know the ones who lose their shit with that death stare.

136
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,730
Detective, you know right? You must've seen a lot of them.

137
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,130
Yes. Give me a minute. Her face was captured by the CCTV of the real estate office in front of the apartment.

138
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,950
I've verified it with the lady.

139
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,440
All right, we'll come to you. Continue to search.

140
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,910
The suspect appeared.

141
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,910
The airport police will do the searching here, so we'll—

142
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,670
You can s-stay—

143
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,500
Y-You stay. W-We go.

144
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,460
- I stay. 
 - Okay.

145
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,000
Let's go. Let's go for now.

146
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,740
Yeah, Center Kang?

147
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,650
Senior, what happened?

148
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,640
I think your profiling was wrong this time.

149
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,980
 There's a guy who stole money from Lee Hyun Min's father and tried to kill him. 

150
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,480
You worked hard, but leave the rest to us and get some rest.

151
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,490
 I'll call you back later. 

152
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,120
- Senior! Senior! 
  - What are you waiting for? Get the car ready. 

153
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,350
She got on an airplane heading for Vimo Island for sure.

154
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,980
Have Team Leader Park and Detective Gu arrived?

155
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,660
I was told that they arrived at the Dispatch Team office.

156
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,330
Let's go.

157
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,910
Excuse me.

158
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,760
Just a second.

159
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,730
Wait! So you're saying that Circus Man punk

160
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,540
killed a whole family and the younger sister of an American cop in Sanggae District

161
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,850
and just disappeared? All that?

162
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,780
It was a thoroughly planned crime, but there was an unexpected victim tonight.

163
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,250
I believe the culprit to be a woman with the same enhanced hearing as myself.

164
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,080
The IP address of the emails came out as a PC room on Vimo Island twice, so the culprit probably lives near there.

165
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,360
We should give up our holiday and request a business trip.

166
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,240
But, Director, the thing is,

167
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,890
the previous two culprits were revealed to be kids.

168
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,110
And in order to override that, we'll have to re-investigate,

169
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,780
but the Sanggae District case is being investigated by the Seoul Investigation team

170
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,480
and they probably won't let us take over without any evidence.

171
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,160
Yes. Like he said, I think we should be more careful about our moves before we get any solid evidence.

172
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,510
You are correct. I was being too impulsive.

173
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,340
It would be impractical for a whole team to move based on uncertain evidence.

174
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,390
As planned, everyone should take a 10-day break, and we'll make a decision after that.

175
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,120
Director!

176
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,700
Chief, it's Kang Center.

177
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,570
I would like to give up my holiday and go on a secret business trip.

178
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,920
Coincidentally, the center position was empty.

179
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,940
    

180
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,040
The other victims died from an arterial rupture resulting from the fatal wound,

181
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,950
but Miss Jo Seung Ah was found to have been serious overkill. 
   (Overkill: inflicting violence on the victim to a level past fatality)  

182
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:59,020
Plus, the majority of her injuries were inflicted while she was still alive.

183
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,780
It would have been extremely excruciating painful for her.

184
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:30,070
   

185
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,990
   

186
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,500
Captain.

187
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,140
This is the raincoat that I told you about.

188
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,870
Found it in the trashcan at the airport.

189
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,710
 This is a stain made from something like hydrochloric acid. 

190
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,840
Team Leader Jo, the suspect has been found.

191
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,460
Don't worry. We'll investigate as fast as possible.

192
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,720
This isn't her. The suspect was at the airport.

193
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,390
Team Leader Jo, I also went to the airport and searched like a search dog because of you.

194
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,030
It's not like I don't understand your feelings.

195
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,690
You were wasting time shoveling in the wrong place and could not save your sister...

196
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,720
I know how distressed you must feel.

197
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,470
Still, your dead sister won't come back just because you act like this.

198
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,240
You know that well.

199
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,090
Do you think I'm doing this to feel better?

200
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,930
You guys are the ones who are going in the wrong direction.

201
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,810
I saw the woman wearing this raincoat fleeing with my two eyes.

202
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,330
Look, Team Leader Jo. Your authority ended after you caught Ricky.

203
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:16,950
Also, victims cannot participate in the investigation. Isn't it the same way in America?

204
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,410
Anyway, at the time of the incident, the apartment entry CCTV did not catch a woman wearing a raincoat.

205
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,170
But this suspect was caught on the CCTV near the apartment

206
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,100
and they even have a strong motive.

207
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,950
You want me to go after an anonymous woman when I have such a strong suspect?

208
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,250
In the text my sister sent, it was clearly stated. The culprit is a woman!

209
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,810
I'll show you.

210
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,290
Your sister has a language disorder

211
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,650
and Korean is her second language, so she might have gotten mixed up!

212
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,890
So you're saying.

213
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,130
My sister is disabled, so her words can't be trusted?

214
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,010
Before, you said she was a Korean, just like you.

215
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,970
But now, you're saying my sister is unfamiliar with Korean, so what she said is nonsense?

216
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,110
- That's not what I meant— 
 - Listen carefully.

217
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,610
The culprit who killed Seung Ah...

218
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,850
I'm going to catch them myself.

219
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,670
Check the passengers at the boarding area near the trash can.

220
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,440
Secure all personnel information that matches the suspect.

221
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,610
- Don't miss anyone. 
 - Yes, sir.

222
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,500
Yes, Cap.

223
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,930
It's Derek.

224
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,920
I'm so sorry about Lisa.

225
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,840
I'll have the suspect in a week, so please extend my permit.

226
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,340
I'll do my best.

227
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:13,000
But even if the Koreans do approve, it'll be days before the extension is actually granted.

228
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,970
So, remember, this is not just about your case.

229
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,430
You're there to assist in their investigation, too.

230
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,680
So, don't cause any trouble or they're going to put you on the next flight home.

231
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,740
I'm aware of that. Thank you, sir.

232
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,940
   

233
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,120
Good work.

234
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,000
Grandma, what if...

235
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,440
I work on an island? What do you think about that?

236
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,470
What do you mean, how would I feel?

237
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,740
If my granddaughter says she wants to work hard,

238
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,440
what kind of grandma would have something to say about it?

239
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,820
If they call you, you should say "thank you" and go.

240
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,480
That's because I want to eat your food before going to work.

241
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,310
Don't worry about grandma and focus on your work.

242
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,020
  Excuse me! Please give us a bottle of soju.  

243
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,070
Okay. Got it.

244
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,940
Here. One bottle of soju.

245
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,250
 Grandma, we ate a lot because of you. 

246
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,540
Cap.

247
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,960
Here's a list of all female passengers with our suspect's body type departing from Hanguk (Airline).

248
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,820
and Min Airlines gates.

249
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,240
   

250
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,810
   

251
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,890
   

252
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,540
And with the help from the Korean police department, I've sent the security footage to LA TID,

253
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,820
and they'll send us the results by 12:00 tomorrow.

254
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,070
Book the first flight to Vimo Island and call the embassy for support.

255
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,810
Yes, Cap.

256
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,820
   

257
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,590
The Director of the Golden Time Team is always welcome here.

258
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,300
But are you sure about this?

259
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,830
It's probably been a while since you've been on vacation.

260
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,970
Not at all. I have managed centers only in cities so far, I've always wanted to come here.

261
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,660
Besides, this position isn't going to be vacant forever.

262
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,670
Indeed. The tourist season just ended so there haven't been many cases around here.

263
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,320
Just consider it as a ten-day vacation.

264
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,200
Thank you.

265
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,180
Oh, right.

266
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,890
Here we have our oldest member, Chief Yang Bok Man.

267
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,460
I'm Yang Bok Man.

268
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,130
I've heard a lot about you. It's nice to meet you.

269
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,910
I'm Kang Kwon Joo.

270
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,540
How about we take a look around the station now?

271
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,100
Shall we?

272
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,030
   

273
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,510
Cap.

274
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,890
TID just found a possible suspect from the CCTV and

275
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,690
they'll send us an image once they clarify the resolution.

276
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,380
Okay.

277
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,830
That's is the busiest unit in our station, the Traffic Division.

278
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,060
Here we have the Financial Crime Team.

279
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,350
You must find this quite slow-paced, right?

280
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:27,830
Oh, yes. That's the Call Center. You should take a look at it since you're here.

281
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,170
   
    

282
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:34,130
I will introduce myself officially when I come to work tomorrow.

283
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,070
Let's go, then.

284
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,940
What is it? Is she someone you know?

285
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,510
I had worked under her for a while.

286
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,800
Open the windows for god's sake!

287
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,800
Attention, everyone.

288
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,330
She is the new Head of the Call Center,

289
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,220
Inspector Kang Kwon Joo.

290
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,290
Hello.

291
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,160
Do a good job and you will learn a lot from her.

292
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,850
Hello.

293
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,110
Did you find the guy who stole the abalones from the granny in Hallyeo?

294
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,310
Do you expect the thief to come walking in on his own so you're just sitting here?

295
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,510
No, well, I'm going to go and investigate it now.

296
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,660
Come on.

297
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,020
Hey, Bu Gwi Nam!

298
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,600
- Yes, Sir! 
 - Why are you sleeping there?

299
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,400
We have an important guest here.

300
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,130
Come here!

301
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,280
He's the youngest in the Violent Crimes Unit.

302
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,460
You can send him on errands whenever you need to.

303
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,520
He may not be good at many things but he's got resilience.

304
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,880
Hello.

305
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,480
I am Bu Gwi Nam.

306
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,100
Where can I find the Head Detective of the Cyber Team?

307
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,320
That's Detective Go.

308
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,660
This way.

309
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,160
He is in the conference room.

310
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,370
Thank you.

311
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,130
Director Kang.

312
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,570
You see, it's a tradition of ours to drink all night whenever we have someone new come in.

313
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:16,780
Also, I've heard the granny in Haeng got a great catch of perch today.

314
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,820
I actually have something I need to ask the detective in the Cyber Division.

315
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,460
Well then.

316
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,950
But you can't just leave like that!

317
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,120
She's from the big city so she isn't that easy-going.

318
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,100
Let's go have some of that perch.

319
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,540
That American LAPD guy from a while ago,

320
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,730
Inspector Derek. He's in the chief's office.

321
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,150
He's got some special agreement with which he can work here as if he's a part of the Korean Police.

322
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,170
   

323
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:50,900
So what you are saying is that the suspect that killed your sister

324
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,030
was among the women that got off the 10:20 p.m. flight yesterday?

325
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,460
Yes.

326
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,010
If the Vimo station is to actively participate in this investigation then we will cooperate as well.

327
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,170
Well, firstly,

328
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,410
I'm very sorry about what happened to your sister.

329
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,770
Since the Seoul Agency is also investigating this,

330
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,750
it is indeed a sensitive matter.

331
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,470
But seeing as they've already reached an agreement with the main office in the United States,

332
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,160
we will cooperate.

333
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,370
Anything else you need?

334
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,670
Please guarantee we will have the right to summon a suspect and the ability to access information, once the killer is caught.

335
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,110
As for the summons, we'll follow (standard) procedure.

336
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,470
I will give you access to as much information as I can within my authority.

337
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:34,900
Vimo Island is a tourist destination, so if there's a security problem,

338
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,630
it will take a big toll on our tourism industry.

339
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,560
So you must keep this investigation under wraps.

340
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,860
I will try my best to do so but I can not give you my word.

341
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,980
When can I have the CCTV analysis?

342
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,350
They're saying in a minute, Cap.

343
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,740
You're Captain Derek Jo, right?

344
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:20,200
I am Inspector Kang Kwon Joo of the Golden Time Team.

345
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,570
You spoke with me yesterday.

346
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,580
I am really sorry

347
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,980
about what happened to your sister.

348
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,460
Even so, seeing as you have come here,

349
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,230
you must have found a lead.

350
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,390
Let's talk for a bit.

351
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,380
You should mind your own business

352
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,740
instead of meddling when you aren't even capable.

353
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,320
I know you are having a tough time right now.

354
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,400
However, yesterday the killer already knew

355
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,990
that you and I were talking at the scene.

356
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,360
I know it's hard to understand what I'm saying but I can give you an explanation for it.

357
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,180
Look here...

358
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,430
Don't bring up what happened yesterday anymore.

359
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,600
You say one more word and I'm not sure what I might end up doing to you.

360
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,600
Cap.

361
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,400
They got the picture of the suspect. You need to take a look at this.

362
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,830
No...

363
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,320
This isn't possible—

364
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,750
This can not be true. There must be some misunderstanding.

365
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,980
I can prove it to you.

366
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,410
No! Don't you dare!

367
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,330
Get your hands out of your pocket now!

368
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,440
- Stay where you are! 
 - Get down!

369
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,360
- This is a trap. 
 - Under the U.S. Criminal Procedure Act,

370
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,590
you are under arrest for the murder of an entire family in the Sanggae neighborhood and an American citizen, on March 25th.

371
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,420
If you do not comply it may result in an immediate firing according to

372
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,520
our Federal criminal procedure rules. Get down!

373
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,680
Get down now!

374
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,350
What's going on?

375
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,240
Director Kang! What are you doing!

376
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,040
Lower your guns!

377
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,640
- Lower your guns. 
 - Are you guys crazy?

378
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,920
How dare you point a gun at her!

379
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,450
- This is Korea. What do you think you're doing in this police station? Lower your guns! 
 - Lower your guns!

380
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,020
Wait a minute. The killer is impersonating me. Please put down your guns first.

381
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,340
You can confirm where I was at the time of the Sanggae neighborhood case just by checking the CCTV at the Pungsan station.

382
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,560
If it turns out to be a lie then I'll be extradited and interrogated right away.

383
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,050
Don't try to get smart with me.

384
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,610
I'll listen to when and where you talked to me after you are arrested.

385
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:48,530
What the hell are you talking about?  If you are going to arrest her then,

386
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:53,840
you'll have to shoot us first.  Why are American cops acting up in someone else's country!

387
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,710
- Sorry, I'll call you— 
 - Captain.

388
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,810
We've identified a slight crack on the suspect's face from the footage.

389
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,930
What do you mean?

390
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,690
The suspect may have been disguised using a silicone mask. 
    

391
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:10,740
There is a slight crack on it.

392
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,010
 It's actually a common technique. It's used in special effects make-up. 

393
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,360
Looking at this footage in slow motion...

394
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,690
   

395
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:21,270
Yeah, there's clearly unnatural movement with her nose and cheek.

396
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,280
Team, drop your weapons.

397
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,360
- What? 
 - Cap?

398
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,220
Now.

399
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,700
We really need to talk now.

400
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,560
It might be hard for you to trust me, but

401
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,610
the killer has special hearing abilities.

402
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,080
The reason I'm so sure of it is

403
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,310
because I too...

404
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,870
can hear sounds that others can't hear.

405
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,280
You have been giving me that same foolish excuse since yesterday.

406
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,680
Don't think you can get out of this so easily.

407
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,970
Even after receiving a call about the skin crack on the killer's face,

408
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,800
you still suspect me?

409
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,080
The killer is aware of my hearing ability.

410
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,360
This is why she claims that we are Siamese twins,

411
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,430
and that's why she's sending me forewarning emails of her murders.

412
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,970
She heard me talking to you at the crime scene.

413
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,630
After which she lured me in with the sound of that alarm.

414
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,720
The LPG car explosion was a trap set up

415
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,330
to put you off her trail.

416
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,660
 Wait a second. This woman did ask me if... 

417
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,520
 Detective, does Seung Ah usually carry around some sort of alarm with her? 

418
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,890
 ...Seung Ah carried around an alarm with her.
Yes, I gave it to her. 

419
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,220
 It's the road to your right. 

420
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,260
 She also gave me directions as if she could hear the alarm. 

421
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,770
 Detective, it's a trap! 

422
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,960
 The gas is leaking. Run away immediately! 

423
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,420
 She warned me right before the LPG exploded. 

424
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,990
 Could she really hear the sounds at the scene? 

425
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,920
It doesn't matter if you believe me or not.

426
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,720
The important thing is that she's a horrible monster we've never faced before.

427
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,090
And she kills people by abusing her special hearing ability.

428
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,470
I am going to catch that bastard no matter what and I will punish her!

429
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,790
Others might not believe me, but...

430
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,670
I thought that at least you, who lost your sister because of her,

431
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,580
would believe me.

432
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,030
Looks like I was wrong.

433
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,250
Oh, yes.

434
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,270
About the agent who cleared up the misunderstanding earlier.

435
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,840
Even after he stopped coughing, I could still hear the sounds of stridor while he was breathing.

436
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,850
Please tell him that if he continues to overdo it, he will have difficulty breathing.

437
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,470
Wait a minute.

438
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,530
Listen to what I have to say before you leave.

439
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:05,090
As you said, it is a waste of time trying to extradite you. I have a condition instead.

440
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,800
From today onward, you have to work with me.

441
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,260
I might not know the reason why but it looks like the killer wants to play a game with you.

442
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,580
So I am going to stick close to you.

443
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:36,360
If that woman is able to hear so well then we need to have a similar weapon, too. Don't you agree?

444
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,580
This is the first time I've received an offer to work with someone.

445
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,800
Are you okay?

446
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,490
I told you to rest. What are you all doing here?

447
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,950
If the needle goes, shouldn't the thread follow?

448
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,700
That's true! This happened because you came by yourself without us.

449
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,660
From what I heard, those guys came for some special Korean-American co-op.

450
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:09,300
Even so. Why are they treating you like the culprit?

451
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,830
When they analyzed the CCTV footage from Gimpo Airport,

452
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,750
the culprit had the same face as me.

453
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:17,220
It looks like they impersonated me.

454
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,380
Wow. They're a real psycho.

455
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,510
Fortunately, their analyst found evidence of the makeup, so the misunderstanding was solved.

456
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,220
Oh and, also, during this cooperation,

457
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,250
I agreed to add Captain Derek Jo to our team.

458
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,220
- What? 
 - Pardon?

459
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,100
I'm sure it must have been tiring to come all the way here. For now, please get a good rest.

460
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,640
Starting tomorrow, the real investigation will begin.

461
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,870
I understand.

462
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,290
Oh, and, also...

463
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,480
Thank you for coming all the way here.

464
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:54,120
It hurts our feelings if you act this way.

465
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,950
Director, what do you see us as?

466
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,530
Once a team, always a team!

467
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,900
Let's go eat.

468
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,580
Let's go.

469
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,590
Are you sure you mean cooperation with Golden Time Team?

470
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,060
Yeah.

471
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,460
Don't think too much.

472
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,050
Think of her as the bait.

473
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,050
The suspect is obsessed with her.

474
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,750
You're going to investigate every single suspect based on the passenger's list.

475
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,040
I'm going to stand by with the Golden Time Team.

476
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,760
Cap.

477
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,330
Here you go. This is Center Kang's alibi.

478
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,450
This woman made a team that works with the Call Center and the Serious Crime team

479
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:03,490
to lower crime rates and they've caught three serial killers.

480
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:09,100
But there... is a rumor that she is a "partner"-killer.

481
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,110
Partner killer?

482
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,360
Anyway... I don't have a good feeling about her.

483
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,230
Please be careful.

484
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:32,230
   

485
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,320
   

486
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,580
This is the information I received from the embassy.

487
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:58,470
When he was 12, he and his sister were adopted by a European-American police family.

488
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,940
Maybe it's because of his upbringing, but he has a very strong understanding of crime scenes.

489
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,490
He is also a Black Belt in martial arts, practical defense arts like Krav Maga, and wrestling.

490
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,130
  
 

491
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,800
 Vimo Island? Right. 

492
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,220
 There was something he was hiding. 

493
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:24,350
But doesn't that mountain look a little creepy, since it's dense with trees?

494
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,150
    

495
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,120
- It's raining. 
 - It is.

496
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,880
It'll probably stop by tomorrow morning, right?

497
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,460
Here. Drink this.

498
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,720
Thanks for letting me be here with you.

499
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,610
No problem.

500
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,980
Ma'am, should I tell you a story about this forest?

501
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,170
It might be kind of scary.

502
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,120
Yeah. Go ahead.

503
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,140
A couple of years ago, near this forest,

504
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,880
there was a couple who came here on vacation to celebrate their 100-day anniversary.

505
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,280
But while they were eating at a sushi restaurant,

506
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,280
the guy started staring at a girl at a different table.

507
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,200
So they had a huge fight.

508
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,460
So the girlfriend was completely livid.

509
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,390
 Hey. 

510
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,850
 Let's talk. 

511
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,230
 Moon Ye Eun, let's talk. 

512
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,990
 Hey. Hold on. 

513
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:53,390
 Hey. I said I was sorry. 

514
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,590
 Stop being angry. 

515
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,230
 I told you I wanted to be alone. 

516
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,640
 If you keep following me, I won't see you ever again. 

517
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,100
 All right. 

518
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,810
 I'll wait for you at the bottom, so come down when you've calmed down. 

519
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,540
 Ridiculous. 

520
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,640
 All right? 

521
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,770
 I don't know! 

522
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,970
 Oppa? 

523
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,650
 Is that you? 

524
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,980
 Stop playing around and come out already. 

525
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,230
 I'm scared. 

526
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,180
Why did you do that? You scared me.

527
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,580
Anyway, that night, since the girlfriend wasn't coming back,

528
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,950
the boyfriend went off to find her.

529
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,040
But he only found her neck.

530
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,730
No matter how long they searched, they couldn't find the rest of her body.

531
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:22,050
The Underworld's beast had eaten her all up.

532
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,230
Come on. Really?

533
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,960
Ma'am, this is real. A true story.

534
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,270
Anyway, tomorrow morning, we're not going toward the Gates of Hell.

535
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:35,420
We're going to go straight to the left road and leave. Okay?

536
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,260
Okay.

537
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,980
I understand. In order to wake up early tomorrow, we should go to bed.

538
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,710
Sure.

539
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,220
Goodnight.

540
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,350
Wow. Goosebumps.

541
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,000
Ma'am, did you hear that?

542
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,630
Where did she go in the middle of the night?

543
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,640
This is a bit over the top.

544
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,060
Ma'am?

545
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,750
Ma'am!

546
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,290
Where did she go?

547
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,770
Ma'am!

548
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,490
This is hers.

549
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,850
Blood!

550
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,470
Hello, this is the 112 Call Center.

551
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,100
 This is 112, right? 

552
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:12,620
- I think the beast took her away. 
 - What?

553
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,770
What do you mean by that?

554
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:18,730
 I said the beast... took... her away! 

555
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:19,770
Hello?

556
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:20,700
Are you there?

557
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,010
Hello?

558
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,820
 Hello? 

559
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,790
No!

560
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:29,850
Hello? 
    

561
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:33,450
I am nearby the Moshim camping grounds.

562
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:37,160
She disappeared. Please come quickly. Hurry.

563
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,510
So what you're saying is the person you were camping with went missing?

564
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:45,310
 Yes. I heard an animal cry, so I went into the woods to see what it was and she disappeared. 

565
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:48,250
There was a lot of blood on the ground.

566
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,830
 I'm sure she was dragged away. 

567
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,980
Maybe this is a prank call?

568
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:57,140
Seeing how serious her tone is that seems less likely.

569
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,750
Please track her location.

570
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,820
Yes.

571
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:04,240
You should calm down. What is your name?

572
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,230
My name is Lee Ha Eun.

573
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,340
I'm 22 years old and I'm a college student.

574
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,740
I got her location!

575
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,700
   

576
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:36,270
   

577
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,500
Director Kang, I'm Cheon Sang Pil. You remember me, right?

578
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,980
- Team Leader Cheon? 
  - Yes. 

579
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,700
 I am currently working at the 112 Call Center on Vimo Island. 

580
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,830
I will say hello later. For now, a strange call report has come in.

581
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,460
A strange call, you say?

582
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,930
Her name is Lee Ha Eun, age 22, and she said she's a college student.

583
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:54,340
She says a wild animal on the mountain took the lady she was camping with.

584
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,170
I'll head to the center right away.  Make sure that the caller stays on the line.

585
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,350
Let's go now.

586
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:04,810
Hello.

587
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,400
I'm Kang Kwon Joo, the Center Director who was supposed to start tomorrow.

588
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,070
But we have an emergency caller now.

589
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:12,400
I expect everyone to follow my instructions.

590
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:16,360
- Connect me to the call. 
 - Yes.

591
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:22,730
Hello, I am the Director of the Call Center, Kang Kwon Joo.  I know this might be startling but could you calmly repeat your situation?

592
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:26,060
How many times do I have to say this?

593
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,380
Something like a dog or a wolf,

594
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,130
or a wild dog dragged the lady away!

595
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:35,560
Your name is Ha Eun, right? You need to calm down first.

596
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,950
Do you know the missing person's name or phone number?

597
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,580
Wait a minute. Wait, don't cut the call.

598
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:50,900
She left her phone behind! What should I do?

599
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,340
Oh, I... I have her ID.

600
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,120
This is definitely her photo.

601
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,650
Her name is Jang Ye Sook.

602
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,100
 - And her resident registration number is...   
 - Look up her personal details.

603
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,780
- Yes, Ma'am. 
  - ...740505. 

604
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,490
 2738201. 

605
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,020
Ha Eun, how did you get to know Ms. Jang Ye Sook?

606
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,430
We met at Gamtaeng Glamping earlier.

607
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:18,310
Cheers! 
    
   

608
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,790
We're still young at heart.

609
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:25,040
I'll head back first.

610
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,270
I need to set up a tent before it's nighttime.

611
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,300
You're going to camp alone? I told you, didn't I? Moshim Oreum isn't easy for a woman on her own.

612
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,850
Student!

613
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,450
How about I go with you?

614
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:41,730
I'm sorry, but I prefer being alone.

615
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,500
Gosh, don't you know she wants to camp alone?

616
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,810
Your slot is for 10:00 p.m.

617
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:53,600
It's of no use if you go earlier than that.

618
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,580
I'll get restless if I wait here.

619
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,890
Hey... Please.

620
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,830
Instead, I'll pay the tent rental fee for you.

621
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:07,100
Really? You can't turn back on your words later.

622
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:11,710
But then I just heard an animal cry and I went into the forest to check.

623
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,320
I really think some dog

624
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,680
 or wolf took her away. 

625
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,170
Are you sure it was a dog or a wolf?

626
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,070
Yes, that's right.

627
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:25,300
Agents, check if there are any dog-like wild animals that attack people in Moshim Forest.

628
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,680
Also, look for any special features of the forest topography. 
    

629
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:34,290
We have a Code Zero situation. The caller is Lee Ha Eun. Her location is Moshim Street, Moshim Town, 160 Moshim Forest. 
    

630
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:37,770
While camping, Ms.Jang Ye Sook was attacked by a mountain animal after which

631
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:39,370
she seems to have disappeared.

632
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:43,560
According to the caller, blood was found at the site. The animal that dragged Jang Ye Sook away

633
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,980
 appears to be a dog or a wolf. 

634
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,710
 Dispatch Team, local officers, and Forest Rescue Team, please head out. 

635
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,840
This is Team 1. Team 1 is leaving now.

636
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,790
Director Kang, I found her.

637
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,150
Her name is Jang Ye Sook, age 48 years. She is a caretaker by profession and

638
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:02,720
she divorced her husband, Kwak Choon Su, who has a history of violence, 15 years ago.

639
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,360
While her son Kwak Hyun Min was still attending Seong Ah High School,

640
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,260
he died a year ago.

641
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,970
   

642
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:23,460
Director Kang.

643
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:30,210
Jang Ye Sook also flew to Vimo Island by Min Air flight MD036 from Gimpo Airport on March 25th.

644
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:34,610
 If it's flight MD036 then it may be the flight that Circus Man might have gotten on 

645
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:38,300
 Even though it's still unclear why the missing Jang Ye Sook went into the forest, 

646
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,780
 she was one of the passengers on Min Air's flight MD036. 

647
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,380
You should head there as well, as you promised.

648
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,040
I'll check the passenger list and then join you.

649
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,440
Are you sure you want to do this alone?

650
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,500
I'm okay.

651
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,870
- Just keep me posted. 
 - Yes, Cap.

652
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:56,340
Team Leader Park, Inspector Derek Jo will be accompanying you.

653
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,270
 Yes, got it. 

654
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:02,740
- Agent Park, ask Forest Recreation for their cooperation and call the Wildlife Rescue Team. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

655
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,840
We don't have time, get in quick!

656
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,380
It's a rough road.

657
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,110
I was told the missing person had boarded the Min Air flight.

658
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:30,320
Are there any connections to the Sanggae neighborhood case?

659
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,480
Not any that we know of yet.

660
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,210
Hold on tight.

661
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:36,660
Goodness.

662
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,380
   

663
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,020
I'm head of the Golden Time Dispatch Team, Park Joong Ki.

664
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,510
This is Detective Derek Jo, he's working with us. And this is Gu Kwang Soo, also of the Dispatch Team.

665
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,470
I'm from the Moshim Patrol Unit.

666
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:58,820
That's the caller and this is the missing person's cellphone.

667
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,610
I'm Chief Go Dok Han of Forest Recreation.

668
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:07,170
I know the location of the missing person that the caller told us about.

669
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,640
- Follow me. 
 - Okay.

670
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,730
- Let's go. 
 - It's this way.

671
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,710
Here! There are some animal footprints here.

672
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:25,470
Wait, let me see.

673
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:32,990
This is strange. According to its size, this animal must be smaller than a wolf but bigger than most dogs.

674
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,340
Here!

675
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,320
Take a look at this.

676
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,850
A mountain animal has bitten it.

677
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:01,900
We need to find her quickly.

678
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,810
There are footprints here, too.

679
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,950
Let's follow the footprints for now.

680
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:08,670
Here. Please be careful.

681
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:12,040
This used to be a fertilizer warehouse.

682
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,790
Detective Jo.

683
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:43,450
 This is Team 1, Director Kang. 

684
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:45,950
There are traces of the animal having bitten something off.

685
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:47,720
 But this... 

686
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,580
seems too big to be an animal bone.

687
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,440
 I think we need to look a bit more into this. 

688
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,860
These look like carcasses of abandoned dogs.

689
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:29,350
And these bones look like wild boar.

690
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:34,360
The dogs became more violent due to their time in the wild

691
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,350
and they started working together to hunt prey,

692
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,830
thus being able to hunt prey larger than themselves.

693
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:45,060
Occasionally, they store their food the way you see here.

694
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,970
You know a lot about dogs.

695
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,400
I worked a long time with detection dogs.

696
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:58,980
There used to be a horse ranch town back there,

697
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,790
but the city got rid of it so they could build a road, and all the people left.

698
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:09,980
It looks like the lucky dogs that avoided getting put down went in and out of this storage space.

699
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,860
This is Team 1.

700
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:14,230
 At the horse ranch, we have dog carcasses, 

701
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:17,930
and fortunately, there were no human corpses in the dogs' food.

702
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:56,370
- Hyungnim. 
 - What is that?

703
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,350
 Please save me. 

704
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,590
 Please save me. 

705
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,970
   

706
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,530
This is the 112 Call Center.

707
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,920
Hello?

708
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:47,230
Is it a prank call?

709
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:52,400
Please check the caller information on that number just now.

710
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:07,360
   

711
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,370
Director, the caller information has been found.

712
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:15,410
It is Kwak Kyu Min, Jang Ye Sook's dead son.

713
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,020
It looks like a beast bit it.

714
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,400
It looks like something's up with this case.

715
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,510
 Excuse me! 

716
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:55,940
 Excuse me! 

717
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,550
 Please help me. 

718
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:04,400
 W-Wild d-dogs... h-have been ch-chasing me. 

719
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,900
 Please help me. 

720
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,410
 Go inside. 

721
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,580
 Yes. 

722
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:19,080
 Excuse me? Hello? 

723
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:58,740
 I thought you lost her, but you did a good job. 

724
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,440
 Since you did a good job, what treat do you want? 

725
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,670
The victim was not dragged by an animal.

726
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:34,610
Looking at the teeth marks, you can tell it was a primate, like a gorilla.

727
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:36,570
Primate?

728
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:38,010
A human.

729
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:42,370
 Director, Jang Ye Sook may have been taken by a person, not an animal. 

730
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:46,500
Hold on. So are you saying a human being may have taken Jang Ye Sook?

731
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,940
Animal? Person?

732
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:53,980
Director, a long time ago, at a seminar,

733
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:58,350
I heard of lycanthropy, a delusional disorder where the person believes they are a wolf.

734
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:01,810
Lycanthropy?

735
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:04,470
 Please. 

736
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,950
 Please spare me. 

737
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:14,920
 I came all the way here because I was told I could see my son. 

738
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,250
 If I could see my son's face, 

739
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:29,110
 then I can die. So please spare me. 

740
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,310
 Why are you being like this? 

741
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,810
 I'm scared. 

742
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:56,210
    

743
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:01,550
     

744
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:10,740


745
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:16,640
   
   

746
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,710
 My lovely son, Kyu Min.  

747
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:20,910
  Mom is sorry. Please forgive me.  

748
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:22,620
 This is the 112 Call Center, I'm Kang Kwon Joo. 

749
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:26,040
 I don't have the right to be a mom. Please don't try to save me. 

750
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,140
 Director, I think I found a similar suspect. 

751
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,040
 It sounds like she's talking under someone's orders. 
   

752
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,510
 Miss Jang Ye Sook, don't hang up. 

753
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,610
 Team Leader Park, please hurry. 

754
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,340
 I have to focus. There must be a clue in the sounds I heard.
