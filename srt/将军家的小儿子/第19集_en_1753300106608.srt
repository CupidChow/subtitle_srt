1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I will stay by your side,

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and wait for your smile to dry.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We will travel around the world together,

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and we will travel around the world together.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The mountains are vast, the rivers are vast,

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and the waves are vast.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The earth is full of laughter.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The snow is soft and the north is full of snow.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You are suffering and suffering alone.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is the end of life.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full and the south is hard to get.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The snow is soft and the north is full of snow.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat the heart and drink the cold water and run again.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Love by Hypnotic

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 16

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let go of me!

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Young Master!

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Get lost!

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't want to see you again!

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't want to see you again!

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Young Master!

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Get lost!

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Chen Xiaoqi!

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You traitor!

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What are you doing again?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It hurts!

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It hurts!

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Young Master!

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It hurts!

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It hurts!

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Jianwei, what happened?

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Little Crane, take care of your brother.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Brother, I'll help you to rest.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's go.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Jianwei, you...

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Xiaoqi is getting more and more confused.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What happened between you and Xiaoqi?

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Since you don't want to say, I won't force you.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You and Xiaoqi are like brothers.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You should take care of each other more.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There will be many things in the Ghost Valley.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You need to worry more.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It hurts!

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It hurts!

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Young Master.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Princess, did you find anything?

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This book is from Yongning.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Li Pu was ordered to reach Jianwei Mountain at noon on the first day of the lunar month.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He is helping the Zhongyong Army.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Siyu, help me find someone.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
His name is Li Qingshan, a Yuzhou person.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Qingyi, there is one more thing.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Do you know the old story between Wan Qianhong and my father?

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Wan Qianhong and Li Pu?

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Siyu, it seems that we need to go to the White Flower Manor.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Be careful.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Please take the zither.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The thing the other day was exposed that there was insufficient equipment in the ancient palace.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It was not enough.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It was damaged a lot.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I asked someone to prepare some firewood and fire medicine.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
They will be placed in each police station.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We will patrol every month.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It should be like this.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Jianwei is thoughtful.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Come on.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
There is more.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Coming.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Jianwei, have you really thought it over?

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Or you can go.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't want to go.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Little walrus, you don't have to persuade me.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I have made up my mind.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But my brother will really kill you.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't want anything to happen to you.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Kill him if you want to.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Anyway, it's not the first time.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What are you doing?

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's winter now.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The weather is dry.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We will use fire sooner or later.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You don't want to die.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Young Master, this is the material prepared by Jianwei for the workshop.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's not easy to get the material.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You don't believe me?

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's not what you think.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Get out.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Young Master, why are you so angry?

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Jianwei's brother is working hard for the Ghost Valley.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What about you?

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes, Young Master is getting more and more unreasonable.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes, of course.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Brother.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If you have the ability, kill me now.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't think I dare not.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There are two days.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Once the time is up,

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I will kill you.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm waiting.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Li Jianwei.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Father, I will make them die.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I will make them pay with my blood.

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We have been hiding in the Ghost Valley for twenty years.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Although we have been enemies,

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
we haven't been killed by the rebels.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I have been in a bad shape for years.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
For the future of the Ghost Valley,

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I should have made an early plan.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You mean

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
you want to make a master in the Young Prince's family?

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What do you think of the play?

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Young Master.

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Young Master is kind.

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But he is just a little naughty.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Jianwei, what do you think?

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This young man is old and strong.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He is kind and has a great talent.

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I think he will be a great master in the future.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Young Master is the general's orphan.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Although he is naughty, he is good at listening.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And we watched him grow up.

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Although the general's blood is not good,

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
as the leader,

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I think the Zhongyong Army values ability,

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
not blood.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I think Li Jianwei is a good choice.

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Young Master, what do you think?

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If the two of them can look forward to helping each other,

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
it's best to support each other.

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But Li Jianwei is not our Zhongyong Army.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Jianwei is old and strong.

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But he is not famous.

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I have to find a way to give him a name.

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Young Master, I have an idea.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Young Master.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You are here, brother.

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why are you so mysterious?

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Where is he?

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Jianwei, you are here.

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Sit down.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Brother, you too.

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Brother.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Little Walnut.

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What the hell are you doing here?

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't want to see him.

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Brother, don't worry.

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Today is my birthday.

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I want you to spend it with me.

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If you have any conflict,

151
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
let it go today, okay?

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You were raised by wolves.

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Where did you get this birthday?

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But today, 18 years ago,

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
brother picked me up.

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Brother.

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Little Walnut, happy birthday.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Together?

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Come on.

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Come on, let's have another drink.

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's boring to drink like this.

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Ning Xiaowei.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We play rock-paper-scissors.

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The loser drinks.

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Boring.

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay, okay.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This is a good idea.

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Ready.

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Go.

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Come on.

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Come on.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Come on.

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Come on.

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Come on.

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Come on.

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Again.

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Brother, come on.

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Come on.

180
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Come on, Brother.

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Come on.

182
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Come on.

183
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Come on.

184
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No more wine.

185
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Wait for me.

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'll get it.

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Come on.

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Once I tell them your identity,

189
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
you will die.

190
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't want to see you die here.

191
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
As long as you go down the mountain,

192
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can pretend that nothing has happened.

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I've never known you.

194
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I remember you said

195
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
the previous dynasty's court

196
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
has nothing to do with the next dynasty.

197
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You'd better leave with Little Walnut.

198
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
From now on, you are a secret agent.

199
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You and I

200
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
are separated.

201
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Secret agent?

202
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Separated?

203
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Why?

204
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Why?

205
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We've been living in this place

206
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
for more than 20 years.

207
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Do we have to live like this for the rest of our lives?

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I didn't expect

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
you are also

210
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
a person who is neither right nor wrong.

211
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
After tonight,

212
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
you still have one day.

213
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Today I want to announce a big thing.

214
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
When did it happen?

215
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't know.

216
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What's the big thing?

217
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't know.

218
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Do you know what it is?

219
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Jian Wei, come here.

220
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Everyone,

221
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
tomorrow is the day of the royal court.

222
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I want to hold a ceremony

223
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
to announce the spirit

224
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
to officially appoint Li Jianwei

225
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
as the adopted son of our King.

226
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The adopted son?

227
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What's this?

228
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Little boy, what are you still doing?

229
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Why don't you pay respects to your adoptive father?

230
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
My adoptive father?

231
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Why?

232
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You don't want to?

233
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Li Jianwei pays respects to her adoptive father.

234
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't agree.

235
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Young Master,

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Jianwei has a good reputation,

237
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
is a talented man,

238
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and is a talented general.

239
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If you do this,

240
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
are you out of your mind?

241
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You said he was a talented general.

242
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Then you mean

243
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm a good man?

244
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I...

245
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Young Master, I didn't mean that.

246
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You and Jianwei are like brothers.

247
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What's wrong with this arrangement?

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We're not brothers.

249
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We don't need such an outsider in the Ghost Valley.

250
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Let alone letting the King take her as his wife.

251
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Brother.

252
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000

I'm sorry.

306
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000

I'm sorry.

317
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
