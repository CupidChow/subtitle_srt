1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How ridiculous the world is

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This blood-red sadness is full of blood

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You are suffering from heartache and suffering alone

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This scene is a life of taste

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full of difficulties and there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This blood-red sadness is full of blood

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat heart and move to the cold and break through the cold and break through the cold

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A life of love and hate is full of blood

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Abyss of Love

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How can the young master's gun skills be the same as that of Old Cai?

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
His gun skills are unique and the changes are indistinguishable.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I sent it to the ice book to learn from Jian Wei.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What's wrong?

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Come on, burn that grassman.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes, Young Master.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What are you doing?

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Nothing.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you want to bury this thing?

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You said that a person's grudge after death should be stolen.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You said that a person's grudge after death should be stolen.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You said that a person's grudge after death should be stolen.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Since you have avenged him,

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
why do you have to humiliate him?

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Burn to death.

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Why do you still want to kill him?

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
To help them get justice back.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
They?

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Justice?

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Qian Wei Shen.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Li Qian Wei.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're a bad guy.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How could it be Li Jiaqiang?

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
How could you kill Li Yan?

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
How could you know Gao Shan Mo Ce's identity?

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We can get out of here soon.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm dead.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Li Yan.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Are you here to kill me?

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Isn't this the martial arts master who protected Li Yan?

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Why is he here?

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Princess.

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What did you get from this trip?

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is the map of Ghost Valley that Lord Chen gave us.

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's ready for use.

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Siyu.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We don't have much time left.

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But what's going on with Young Master?

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The Li family's case is simple.

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's related to the case of Qian Wei Shen 20 years ago.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You mean the Zhongyong Army's case 20 years ago?

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
My father was framed.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't know yet.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's just a lot of doubts.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This case is really complicated.

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Siyu was also suspicious.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I fought with them in Rong City.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I found that their martial arts skills were similar to that of the military.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But, Princess.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We're here to help Young Master.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Rong City's community is helping him to avenge.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Who's there?

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The Emperor is in a bad mood.

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The General of the State of Wu State

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
is being spread all over the world.

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
20 years ago,

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Bai Lan was defeated.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's right.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He's already dead.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're still here, pretending to be a loyal man.

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm not that loyal.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm just a part of the family.

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What are you doing?

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're still pretending to be a loyal man.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If we stay here,

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and can't go out for a day,

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll be your friend for a day.

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I want to be your friend for a lifetime.

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The snow falls on the mountain.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The wind blows the ice.

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The lonely world is full of hatred.

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The mountains keep falling.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Lin Xiao Wei.

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Do you dare to swear to God that you have nothing to hide from me?

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I...

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I...

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Who is it?

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Drink some.

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why are we here?

93
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Qiangwei.

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What's wrong?

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Qiangwei.

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What's wrong?

97
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Nothing.

98
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I just didn't know that you've gone so far.

99
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I remember you were drunk once.

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
In the middle of the hall,

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
a thief ran away.

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We buried him together.

103
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I think he's around here.

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I was too drunk that day.

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It seems that your drinking capacity is still not good enough.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You have to practice.

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Come on.

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Cheers.

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Qiangwei.

110
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Come on.

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I remember that thief was buried around here.

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
How about we dig him out and have a look?

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Boring.

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Qiangwei.

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I think you've changed a little.

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't think so.

117
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Maybe

118
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I didn't really know you from the beginning.

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And you

120
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
never really understood me.

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I just didn't know you.

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I just didn't know you.

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I just didn't know you.

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And you never really understood me.

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I do.

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What do you know?

127
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Qiangwei.

128
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's snowing.

129
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How can you say that

130
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
it's not as good as him?

131
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You're so ugly.

132
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Li Qiangwei.

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Good brother.

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Who are you?

135
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You still don't want to tell me?

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Who are you?

137
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I...

138
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I was the son of

139
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
the commander of the Zhou Yong Army

140
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
who died in the battle of Jianwei Mountain

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
twenty years ago.

142
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And you?

143
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Who are you?

144
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm Li Jianwei.

145
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You still don't want to tell me?

146
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What brother?

147
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You're lying to me all the time.

148
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You're lying to me all the time.

149
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
From now on,

150
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll be done with you.

151
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'll be done with you.

152
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Brother Jing'er.

153
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't want it.

154
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Sha Sha.

155
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Are you drunk?

156
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You two are so close

157
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
like brothers.

158
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Why are you fighting again?

159
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll give it back to you.

160
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We'll stop here.

161
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll give you three days

162
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
to get out of the ghost valley.

163
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Otherwise,

164
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
don't blame Wu Qing.

165
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If I don't go,

166
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'll kill you now.

167
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Brother, I don't want it.

168
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Why don't you retreat?

169
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The world is not quiet.

170
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The grudge is long.

171
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There is no way to retreat.

172
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You.

173
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Stop.

174
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No.

175
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
My brother is crazy.

176
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What's wrong with you two?

177
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You.

178
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Tell me.

179
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Brother.

180
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Don't talk to him.

181
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Let's go.

182
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Go.

183
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Little boy.

184
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Brother Jianwei.

185
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Father, mother.

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I have no way out.

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I will take the blood of my enemies

188
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and tell you the truth.

189
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I will take the blood of my enemies
