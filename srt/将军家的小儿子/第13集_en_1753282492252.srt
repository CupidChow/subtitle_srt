Episode 16

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's just a doll of Madam Ban!

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How dare you lie to Madam Ban!

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
How dare you poison Madam Ban!

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
My head!

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
My head!

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
My head!

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It hurts!

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Madam.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Madam, are you alright?

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't be mad.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They are all good people.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What did you say?

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They are good people?

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You mean,

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm a bad person?

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Mother.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What are you laughing at?

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Mother.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Mother.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Little Walnut.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Little Walnut.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Are you alright?

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mother.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I didn't mean to do that.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I didn't mean to do that.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's all my fault.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No!

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's all their fault.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's all their fault!

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I must kill them.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I must kill them!

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Mother.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't be mad.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You are drunk.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's alright.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You are very drunk.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let me help you to rest.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
的

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Qin Wei!

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,920
It's me.

43
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,760
You scared me.

44
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,480
I almost died in your hands

45
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,800
instead of that crazy woman.

46
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
Who told you to get so close?

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I just wanted to...

48
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,800
Forget it.

49
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,880
I don't want to fight with you.

50
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,520
You scared me.

51
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,360
I've never been to such a place.

52
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,720
I said this place is not suitable for me.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,840
Who are you?

54
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
You scared me.

55
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,320
I can become the master of this place.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,440
I'm the one you love the most.

57
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,920
We all have to die.

58
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,920
I'm going to steal the Queen for you.

59
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,440
If you want it, go get it.

60
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,040
Here you go.

61
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,920
Help.

62
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,640
Help.

63
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,400
Help.

64
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,920
Brother.

65
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Help.

66
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,640
I want you to die.

67
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Help.

68
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Help.

69
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Help.

70
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Help.

71
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Brother.

72
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Help.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Help.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Brother.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let go.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,560
Little boy.

77
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Let go.

78
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
Let go.

79
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,960
Brother Jingfei, how are you?

80
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,200
Are you okay?

81
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
I'm fine.

82
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Little boy.

83
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,160
Be clear.

84
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,000
If you're late, you won't see me.

85
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Forget it.

86
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,400
Why are you here?

87
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,880
Did she do anything to you?

88
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Brother, I'm fine.

89
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,680
Madam Wan thinks I'm her daughter.

90
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
She's nice to me.

91
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Her daughter?

92
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,160
You?

93
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,120
We can't stay here for long.

94
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,160
Let's talk on the way.

95
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,520
Let's get out of here.

96
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,760
Let's go. Hurry.

97
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,920
Stop.

98
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Come back.

99
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,120
I'm going to kill you.

100
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Queen.

101
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,560
I want to be the queen.

102
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,560
You wanna be the queen?

103
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,560
You want to be the queen?

104
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
No.

105
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
I still wanna try.

106
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,120
I'm still can't take it any more.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,320
You'reJust being stubborn.

108
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,520
我赢定了.

109
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,720
I won't let you fall again,

110
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,920
Where are we going?

111
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,120
Mother, don't hurt them.

112
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,240
Madam, we didn't mean to offend you.

113
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,080
We were afraid that Xiao He would disappear.

114
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,360
We were so worried.

115
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,400
Please forgive us and let us go.

116
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,240
That means

117
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,240
you planned the meeting

118
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,680
in the Ninth Building.

119
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,120
A'xi,

120
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,680
is that right?

121
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,080
Yes.

122
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,440
We can't find

123
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,600
your mother's silver nest.

124
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,080
That's why we did it.

125
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,000
What did you say?

126
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,680
Say it again!

127
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,760
I'll say it.

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,760
Mother!

129
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,840
Mother,

130
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,800
please don't hurt them.

131
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,040
Xiao He, get up.

132
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,000
I want to stay with you.

133
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,560
Xiao He.

134
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,760
Mother, please forgive them.

135
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,440
Please.

136
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,760
Mother.

137
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,480
Fine.

138
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,160
I can let them go.

139
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,400
Really?

140
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Don't worry.

141
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,240
I haven't finished yet.

142
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,200
You bitch!

143
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,480
Why are you talking nonsense?

144
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,800
You want to settle the score?

145
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,600
You're so good at driving.

146
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
I haven't settled the score yet.

147
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,760
Let her finish first.

148
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,920
As long as you kill someone for me,

149
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,960
bring his body back

150
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,560
and make him a bandit for me,

151
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,840
I'll let Xiao He go with you.

152
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,600
Kill someone?

153
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,760
Who?

154
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,800
Li Pu.

155
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,200
Li Pu?

156
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,920
General of the Guardian, Li Pu?

157
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,480
Isn't he dead?

158
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,320
What did you say?

159
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,120
He's dead?

160
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,520
When?

161
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,720
You don't know?

162
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,080
He's already dead.

163
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,760
Last year, on the New Year's Eve,

164
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,560
General Li was killed.

165
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
No one survived.

166
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,480
Impossible.

167
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,480
Impossible.

168
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,880
Impossible.

169
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,880
Impossible.

170
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,640
Impossible.

171
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,920
Impossible.

172
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,680
Impossible.

173
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,520
You're lying to me.

174
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,920
He promised me

175
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,840
he would come back to me.

176
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,280
You must be lying to me.

177
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,480
Without my consent,

178
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,440
how could he die?

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,760
How could he die?

180
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,600
You must be lying to me.

181
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,920
Without my consent,

182
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,600
he can't die.

183
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,360
How could he die?

184
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,640
Humph.

185
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,120
After a long time,

186
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,400
you're the old friend of that bastard.

187
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,560
What a pity.

188
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,560
He didn't come to you.

189
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,120
Nonsense.

190
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,040
He promised to come back to me.

191
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,160
He promised to come back to me.

192
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,520
I've been against him for so many years.

193
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,280
He's been poisoned.

194
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,120
For so many years.

195
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,320
Why are you trying to provoke him?

196
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,120
Who told him to be with that bastard?

197
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,920
Liar.

198
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,480
You...

199
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,640
Identify his body.

200
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,880
Identify his next life.

201
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,960
Out of copulation.

202
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,760
Gorgeous dresses.

203
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,560
Where will it go?

204
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,120
Your sleeve has been knitted.

205
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,920
Your sleeve has been knitted.

206
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
Zihua Grass.

207
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
How could this happen?

208
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,680
Back to the palace.

209
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
The half-moon is here.

210
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,040
The half-moon is here.

211
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,160
How could this happen?

212
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,680
Take Zihua Grass.

213
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
Back to the palace.

214
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,200
The half-moon is here.

215
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
The half-moon is here.

216
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
Mother.

217
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
What are you doing?

218
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,680
Mother, are you okay?

219
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Xiao He Tao.

220
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,680
I am. I am.

221
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Mother, don't scare me.

222
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I am scared.

223
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Xiao He Tao.

224
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Xiao He Tao.

225
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
My daughter.

226
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
No.

227
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
You are not.

228
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
You are not.

229
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
You are not.

230
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
My daughter.

231
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
My daughter.

232
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
What are you doing?

233
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
You are Shi Xin Feng.

234
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Shi Xin Feng?

235
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
My daughter.

236
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Why don't we kill her?

237
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
My daughter.

238
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Xiao Ye, I will kill her now.

239
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
My daughter.

240
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
My daughter.

241
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
My daughter.

242
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Mother.

243
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Mother.

244
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Mother.

245
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
My daughter.

246
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Listen to me.

247
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,600
I don't want you to end up like me.

248
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
So you can't fall in love with anyone.

249
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Otherwise, you will be hurt.

250
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Do you know?

251
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
I really hope

252
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,600
you can grow up healthy

253
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
and happy.

254
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Do you hear me?

255
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Do you hear me?

256
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Do you hear me?

257
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Calm down, mother.

258
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
I will kill her.

259
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Come on.

260
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
My poor wife.

261
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Where is my little sister?

262
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
If you don't tell me now,

263
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
I will burn your house.

264
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Take the flowers and put them back.

265
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
I will be a nun.

266
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
I will be a king.

267
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Where is my sister?

268
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
You crazy woman.

269
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
I am not crazy.

270
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
In this world,

271
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,600
everyone is pursuing fame and fortune.

272
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Everyone is pursuing their own ambitions.

273
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Which one of you is not crazy?

274
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Cut the crap.

275
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Where did you hide her?

276
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
You want her?

277
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Fine.

278
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
If you want to know where she is,

279
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,600
kill her.

280
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Jiawei.

281
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Are you really going to listen to her?

282
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
I am not going to listen to her.

283
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Xianfang.

284
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Do it.

285
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
But

286
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
after I die,

287
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
you must take her back safely.

288
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
So touching.

289
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Then let's die together.

290
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
No.

291
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
