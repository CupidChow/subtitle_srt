1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How ridiculous the world is

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,500
This bloody and sad blood is full of justice

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
You are suffering in your heart and suffering alone

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,500
This scene is a life of taste

5
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full of difficulties and there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This bloody and sad blood is full of justice

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat heart and make a mess

8
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,500
A life full of difficulties and there is nowhere to escape

9
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,000
The Abyss of Love

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 3

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Little Walnut!

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Little Walnut!

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Brother...

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Little Walnut, don't be like this, Little Walnut!

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Brother Jian Wei...

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Brother Jian Wei...

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I was not able to help him...

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Forgive him...

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay...

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
As long as you are fine...

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I will listen to everything you say...

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I will return this to you...

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I know...

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You still...

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
care about me...

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I...

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Little Walnut, don't say anymore...

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I care about you the most...

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's a pity...

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I will never...

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
be able to...

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
help you...

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and my father...

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Little Walnut!

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Little Walnut!

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Little Walnut!

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't touch her!

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Get lost!

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Princess, they are here...

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is my daughter's jade pendant...

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Where is my daughter?

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If you dare to hurt her...

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I will die with you!

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Good temper...

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You are really a good father...

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't know what you are talking about...

47
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If you want to know where your daughter is...

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Answer me first...

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know anything...

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Then why did you give up the future of Jingxiu...

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and let your daughter leave you today?

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You love your daughter so much...

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
but you are drinking all day...

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is this what a good father does?

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You hide the truth...

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and let your daughter die...

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Is this what a good general does?

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let go of me, Princess!

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What are you doing?

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Father!

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What are you doing?

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Ruan'er!

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Ruan'er!

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Princess, are you okay?

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Ruan'er!

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm fine.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
My Ruan'er!

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I have been looking for you for so long!

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Thanks to you...

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
for saving me from the Jade Pendant...

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
She is our savior!

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I am Li Qingshan...

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
the father of Li Pujun...

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Thank you for your kindness, Princess!

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You should have asked me...

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
if you were to bury me in the ground.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I would have done anything for you...

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and be your disciple!

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
General Li, please get up.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This is not how it should be.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But it's important.

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We need to have evidence.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Jianwei,

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
what have you done?

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What have I done?

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's too late to ask.

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't you think it's too late?

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Who are you?

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Did you just kill Li Jiaqiang?

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Who am I?

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I am Li Jiaqiang.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Who am I?

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I am a ghost...

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
who escaped from the hell.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I am Li Jia'er,

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
who was killed...

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
by your whole family...

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
in the first half of last year.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Tonight,

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I came to you...

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
to make a wish.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's you.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You have been...

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
pretending to be Li Jiaqiang...

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
all these years.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You have been waiting for this day.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I didn't expect...

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Li Jiaqiang...

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
to be alive.

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You tried so hard to kill Li Yan.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Now he is right in front of you.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I worked so hard to get into the Ghost Valley...

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
to avenge my family...

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
by holding the blood sea.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You are a man...

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
to get into the Ghost Valley.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But it's a pity...

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
that you are a traitor.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You are a traitor...

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
who betrayed the army...

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and escaped from the hell.

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Do you know what happened...

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
20 years ago in Mount Jianwei?

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's all in the history books.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No one knows.

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
In the 7th year of Yongning,

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
the commander of the Central Yongjun Army...

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
led the army to rebel.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He was killed in the battle.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's all in the history books.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The words are all wrong.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
How can you...

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
change our life so?

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Did your father, Li Pu...

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
tell you in person...

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
that he was proud...

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
of the battle in Qingyun?

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So what?

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Li Pu didn't tell you.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Today I will tell you.

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Back then,

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
the Central Yongjun Army and the Bai Lan Tribe...

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
fought for three months.

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Li Pu was ordered...

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
to lead the army to rebel.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But he was dragged out for no reason.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He was killed in the battle.

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He was killed in the battle.

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The Central Yongjun Army fought to the death...

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
to fight against the Bai Lan Tribe.

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He was severely injured.

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Li Pu was wronged.

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He should be punished.

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He was too kind...

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
to the General.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He was just a child.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's why he spared Li Pu's life.

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But he didn't expect...

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
that Li Pu was killed...

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
in the battle...

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
while the Central Yongjun Army was fighting.

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We were left with many people...

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
who fought to the death to kill the General...

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and escaped to the mountain.

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
From then on,

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
we became the bandits...

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
you mentioned.

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The bandits fled to the mountain to escape.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But your father, Li Pu,

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
became a good-looking man...

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and a general.

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's ridiculous.

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's ridiculous!

174
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Stop talking nonsense!

175
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Do you think you can defeat the Black and White Army...

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
with just one mouth?

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Tonight,

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I want you to kill the Li family!

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Lord Cheng!

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yan'er, stop!

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Qingyu!

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yan'er!

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You still want to stop me?

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You forgot how you promised me?

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yan'er, it's not what you think.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yan'er?

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You're Yan'er?

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You're so old now.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Kid,

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
let it go.

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We were wronged.

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You are...

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
When I was young,

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I followed your father to the south and fought in the north.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I fought for him for more than ten years.

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
After we met the bandits,

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I went to Yang Biao with him.

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Because of your father's mistake,

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
he killed the Zhongyong Army.

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It caused a lot of people.

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Even your mother was killed in the valley.

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You don't know the truth.

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's normal.

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Don't do it again, Yan'er.

205
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Why should I believe you?

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why should I believe you?

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The Ministry of War records that

208
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Li Pu led the army to the Mount Jianwei on the fifth day of the lunar month.

209
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He supported the Zhongyong Army and retreated to Bailan.

210
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You must have seen this painting.

211
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I remember you asked me

212
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
about the relationship between Wan Qianghong and Li Pu.

213
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Now look at this painting.

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
When did you paint it?

215
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
In the seven years of Yongning,

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
the winter was cold.

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I was so cold.

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I was so cold.

219
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was so cold.

220
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I was so cold.

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I was so cold.

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I was so cold.

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I was so cold.

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I was so cold.

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I was so cold.

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I was so cold.

227
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I was so cold.

228
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I was so cold.

229
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I was so cold.

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I was so cold.

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I was so cold.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I was so cold.

233
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I was so cold.

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I was so cold.

235
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I was so cold.

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I was so cold.

237
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I was so cold.

238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I was so cold.

239
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I was so cold.

240
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I was so cold.

241
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I was so cold.

242
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I was so cold.

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I was so cold.

244
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I was so cold.

245
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I was so cold.

246
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's just a game.

247
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I was so cold.

248
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I was so cold.

249
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You were so cold and cold.

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I was so cold.

251
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I was so cold.

252
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,800
The blue scabbard

253
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
was soSomeone

254
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So Now

255
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What?

256
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What?

257
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Zeng Wu.

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Young Master Han and the Young Master.</1

259
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
How about my Lord?

260
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Go.

261
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,760
Shut up!

262
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,240
I don't believe it.

263
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,760
I don't believe it!

264
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,160
What are you doing here?

265
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,480
This letter has been hidden

266
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,320
in the wooden box that Wan Qianhong gave to Xiao He.

267
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,080
I guess it's destiny.

268
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,760
You should know this handwriting.

269
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,600
The Buddha stayed in Qingchu for a few days

270
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
and was ill-informed.

271
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,120
At that time, Zhong Yongjun was seriously injured.

272
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,920
He might be punished.

273
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,920
Before and after death,

274
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,840
only if you are brave enough to cover up the truth,

275
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,920
you can make up for the past.

276
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,960
If you fail,

277
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,200
you'll be separated from Qing with this letter.

278
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,080
Zhong Yongjun fought hard and died countless times.

279
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,240
He even slept with Wan Qianhong in the warm incense.

280
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,840
So he had this plan in the early morning.

281
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,280
I hate it.

282
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,840
I hate it!

283
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,360
Yan!

284
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,080
No!

285
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,080
How could you do this?

286
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,280
Yan!

287
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,240
I'm sorry.

288
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,920
No, I didn't mean it.

289
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:05,720
I cut my hand from the

290
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,920
Pressure을

291
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,280
by missing you!

292
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,680
I can't see you again.

293
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,400
Actually,

294
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,920
I'll give you my life.

295
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,000
It's not your fault.

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,520
Don't do anything stupid.
