1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I will stay by your side,

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and wait for your smile to dry.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We will travel around the world together,

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and travel around the world together.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The mountains are vast, the rivers are vast,

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and the waves are vast.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The earth is full of laughter,

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and the waves are full of laughter.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The snow is soft, the north is deep, and the snow is full of bow and arrow.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You are suffering in your heart, and you are suffering alone.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is the taste of life.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full of darkness, and there is nowhere to escape.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The snow is soft, the north is deep, and the snow is full of bow and arrow.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat the heart, move the seat, and run through the cold and stormy winds.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The journey is long, but it is hard to reach.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The Long Ballad

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 14

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Xiao Xi, look.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is the place where we practiced martial arts.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is the backyard.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
My brother and I often play chess there.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is the study.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:13,580
But the

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
description is wonderful.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's amazing.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,560
Aha and Yu stalled the enemy's chariot,

27
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,240
suffering letter,

28
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,480
then the ladies

29
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,240
trampled on

30
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,800
Crown Prince and monkeys.

31
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,280
In the time potato另外

32
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,240
held her,

33
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,920
the wardrobe started hoying in affairs of us,

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,480
and besides,

35
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,400
it caused lovesickness,

36
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,280
and even divided into demonetization.

37
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,600
Today,

38
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,920
the royal family

39
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
we won't get rid of

40
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:24,740
Li's banks

41
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,000
at the end of the day.

42
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,200
Not getting rid of what?

43
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,440
But Li's depuis

44
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,640
brushes away all.

45
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,260
Isn't they?

46
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Pourquoi ?

47
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,560
I might steal that,

48
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,980
but playing good is a good thing.

49
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,160
Isn't it good ?

50
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,400
Are you throwing me out of the game ?

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,640
Shut up.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,380
I can't, I am Belle Immer.

53
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Don't age me until I am once again.

54
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,060
You can't take me with you.

55
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,480
My dear,

56
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,160
don't leave me alone.

57
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,220
And let's stay together.

58
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,260
Fang Ni,

59
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,820
don't ever leave me alone, okay?

60
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,840
Let's be good friends.

61
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,460
Then let's stay together.

62
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,840
Does it still hurt?

63
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,140
I'll return to the valley and go home.

64
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,820
I don't want to go back to Gui Valley anymore.

65
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,100
Chen Hao.

66
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,740
What did you say?

67
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,460
Nothing.

68
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,420
I just want to go back to Gui Valley.

69
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,700
I don't want to go back.

70
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,340
Jian Wei.

71
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,100
Do you think

72
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,820
we can go back to the past?

73
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,140
Yes.

74
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,820
You're still the Young Master.

75
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,460
What about you?

76
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,820
I'm your brother.

77
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,620
Okay.

78
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,020
Then you have to listen to me in everything.

79
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,220
As your brother,

80
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,540
you have to let me go.

81
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,020
Of course.

82
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,300
I will take good care of you.

83
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,620
But

84
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,820
you have to learn to take care of yourself.

85
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
And Chen Dawang.

86
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,740
Hua Shu.

87
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:33,940
Old Chai.

88
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,900
Shi Tou.

89
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,180
You have to take good care of everyone in Gui Valley.

90
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,620
If Xiao He is still here...

91
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,100
Forget it.

92
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,180
Although that girl

93
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,700
has been in love with you for a long time...

94
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,460
I know.

95
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,740
That's good.

96
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,820
You have to remember every word I said.

97
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,460
Otherwise, when Xiao Yan comes back,

98
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,540
you will be the one who will be happy.

99
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,620
Why are you laughing?

100
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,820
Don't laugh.

101
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,780
You've said so much.

102
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,420
What about you?

103
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,860
I...

104
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
From now on,

105
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,020
everything will be over.

106
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,740
If you come back,

107
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,620
then you come back.

108
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,820
Who is afraid of who?

109
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,380
Do you have any plans?

110
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,220
The world is big.

111
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,420
The four seas are the best.

112
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,100
Xiao Yan, I

113
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,820
will go to Jiangnan to listen to the little dog.

114
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,740
I will climb the rat's den, eat the pot,

115
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,940
worship Mount Tai,

116
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,020
watch the sunrise,

117
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,500
and taste the beautiful wine of the world.

118
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,740
Perfect.

119
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,860
All right.

120
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,340
Qian Wei.

121
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,220
Any wine?

122
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,740
Let me get it.

123
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,940
Qian Wei,

124
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,740
our brothers are forever.

125
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,940
You have done

126
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,940
Qin LOL

127
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,940
Qianwei,

128
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,820
Xia Xiao,

129
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,860
how can you say

130
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,180
that human heart is not as good as his?

131
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,300
Let's go to the doctor first, okay?

132
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,460
Then you ask him.

133
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,580
If the seed is broken,

134
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,500
can it be cured?

135
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,620
It can be cured.

136
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,260
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,740
We'll buy a new one when we go down the mountain.

138
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,540
Qiangwei,

139
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,580
go.

140
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,540
Go!

141
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,820
We can't decide our own birth.

142
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,700
But we can dominate our own life.

143
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,380
But the sky doesn't follow the people's wishes.

144
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,700
Then let's fight with the sky.

145
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:31,980
Come on.

146
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,100
Li Qiangwei,

147
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,260
do you know your mistake?

148
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,180
Qiangwei knows his mistake.

149
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,820
I'll give you this life.

150
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,500
From now on,

151
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,900
we'll be cut off.

152
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,020
I mean, if

153
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,420
I die,

154
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,700
you must take me back to Mount Jianwei

155
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,900
and hide me under the roof.

156
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,300
확실히.

157
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,260
Crown Prince.

158
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,820
The Zhongyong Army was Porky on the East River for seven years,

159
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,820
to tell everyone

160
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,500
theЙ&Ĺ.

161
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,580
That Yan K Blai

162
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,940
would be buried in a store on the same ground

163
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,740
in the Return of State.

164
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,460
Come on.

165
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,220
Jingwei.

166
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:07,900
Jingwei.

167
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,020
This is the Drunken Marquis

168
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,140
I stole from Chen Dawao.

169
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,340
Let's drink it up.

170
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,860
Xiao Xi.

171
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,660
Xiao Xi.

172
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,260
After we finish drinking,

173
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,660
we'll go to the back hill to catch fish.

174
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,180
I haven't had grilled fish for a long time.

175
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,060
Don't you try to steal it from me this time.

176
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,700
Young Master.

177
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,620
Siyu, you're back.

178
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,900
Have you found out where he is?

179
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,660
Maybe he has...

180
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,140
No.

181
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,860
Young Master,

182
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,820
there's another bad news.

183
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
The White Wolf's Army

184
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,300
Everyone.

185
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,460
The White Wolf led the army to invade the northern border a few months ago.

186
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,300
We can't just sit around and do nothing.

187
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,220
Uncle.

188
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,300
Back then, our Zhongyong Army

189
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,420
followed General Chen

190
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,540
to break through the White Wolf.

191
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,340
Today,

192
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,020
we'll fight back

193
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,380
and return to the battlefield.

194
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,420
Good.

195
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,060
I'll follow the old man's will

196
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,220
and restore the reputation of the Zhongyong Army.

197
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,740
I won't give it back until I fight back.

198
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,180
I won't give it back until I fight back.

199
00:13:59,180 --> 00:13:59,820
Go.

200
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,340
This grass

201
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,740
is so young and long.

202
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,180
I don't know how many times it's been.

203
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,260
Now that I think about it,

204
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,860
it's just like what you said back then.

205
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,540
Qiangwei,

206
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,780
look at this grass.

207
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,940
It's red and hard to get a wind.

208
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,580
But it's still alive.

209
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,620
Even if it's blown into the mountains,

210
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,380
it can still be in the spring wind next year.

211
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,860
The grass grows in the winter.

212
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,100
They're still like this.

213
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,700
What about you?

214
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,060
I don't know where you're going to get married.

215
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,100
But don't worry.

216
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,660
I'll take good care of everyone.

217
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,020
By the way,

218
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,860
Bai Lan Bu came to the Qing Dynasty a few months ago.

219
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,980
I have to kill the enemy

220
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,780
and restore the reputation of the Zhongyong Army.

221
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,500
If you can hear me,

222
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,740
bless us to win

223
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,780
and return with a bright future.

224
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,020
Qiangwei.

225
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,100
Come here.

226
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,060
I'll call you two.

227
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,700
Come here.

228
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,540
Okay, thank you.

229
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,780
Where are we going?

230
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,780
I'll tell you when we're back.

231
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,700
I need to give you a ride with me

232
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,940
and the uniform too.

233
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,620
Qing Dynasty

234
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,460
support the révians.

235
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,640
The

236
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,640
The

237
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,640
The

238
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,640
The

239
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,640
The

240
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,640
The

241
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,640
The

242
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,640
The

243
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,640
The

244
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,640
The

245
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,640
The

246
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,640
The

247
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,640
The
