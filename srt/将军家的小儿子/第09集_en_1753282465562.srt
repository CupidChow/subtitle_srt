00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How ridiculous the world is

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This blood-red sadness is full of blood

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You are struggling and suffering alone

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This scene is a life of taste

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Deep abyss is full of hard to get

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This blood-red sadness is full of blood

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat the heart and move the waves to break through the grass

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,500
Spiriting for a lifetime but the End

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000

Once more

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,060
How is it?

16
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,760
Give me a bite

17
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,720
Come on.

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,240
Four, three, two, one.

19
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,720
See?

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,520
You lost, right?

21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,720
Drink more.

22
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:03,880
Come on.

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,640
Come on.

24
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,840
There's more.

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,640
You guys eat.

26
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,560
Drink.

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,280
Drink.

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,440
Brother Qian Wei,

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
the wine is very strong.

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,240
Drink less.

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,640
More?

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
Your clothes are torn.

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll sew it up for you when you take it off.

34
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,200
No need.

35
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,320
Sew the walnuts.

36
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,760
Brother Qian Wei,

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,000
are you unhappy?

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,000
Sew the walnuts.

39
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,480
You don't have to be so nice to me.

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,120
Do you understand?

41
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,000
No.

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,000
Forget it.

43
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,160
It's useless to tell you.

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,520
Anyway,

45
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,200
it's not necessary.

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,000
Brother Qian Wei,

47
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,440
are you like a stone?

48
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,400
You think I'm annoying.

49
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,960
Little guy,

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,840
ignore him.

51
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,280
Come on, let's go have a drink.

52
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,280
Come on.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,600
Log.

54
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,400
Master.

55
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,200
Master.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,680
Master.

57
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,880
What forever?

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,240
Today isaska.

59
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,000
I want to

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,000
wish good luck to everyone.

61
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,320
Nousult.

62
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,040
You're fashionable.

63
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,640
Who's that saying?

64
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,360
Master, look.

65
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,960
Hu Li.

66
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,760
Who are you two saying?

67
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,040
How can it be that thief?

68
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,160
What are you going to do?

69
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,800
This is good.

70
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,600
This is a good idea.

71
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Use Li Pu as a target.

72
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,880
Yes.

73
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,960
Use Li Pu as a target.

74
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,600
Okay.

75
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,680
I'll go with you two.

76
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,840
You two compete, okay?

77
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,640
I'm not going.

78
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,280
You two go.

79
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,840
Chief,

80
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,040
do you want to try?

81
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,720
No.

82
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,840
You guys play to your heart's content.

83
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,600
Okay.

84
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,240
Come on.

85
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,200
Let's all try.

86
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,640
You go.

87
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,200
I'm not going.

88
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,640
Come on.

89
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,120
Go.

90
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,080
Then I'll go all out.

91
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,160
The first one is here.

92
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,440
Hurry up.

93
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,120
Hurry up.

94
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,040
Go.

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,680
Good.

96
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,200
Good.

97
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,320
Go.

98
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,600
Come on.

99
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,200
Good.

100
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,800
Good.

101
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,560
Shoot the head.

102
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,360
Shoot the head.

103
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,800
Good.

104
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,360
Good.

105
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,040
Come on.

106
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,800
Come on.

107
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,680
Tian Wei.

108
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,840
Tian Wei.

109
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,760
You're drunk.

110
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't move.

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,720
Tian.

112
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,440
Your hand is hurt.

113
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,800
Do you know?

114
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,560
I'm going to cut them into pieces.

115
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,080
Tian Wei.

116
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,880
Give me a cup.

117
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,520
Tian Wei.

118
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,800
Lao Chen.

119
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,520
Good.

120
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,160
It's time to compete.

121
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,920
Watch out.

122
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,640
Kill him.

123
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,560
Kill him.

124
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,400
Kill him.

125
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,520
Kill him.

126
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,040
Good.

127
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,200
Come on.

128
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,440
It's time.

129
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,760
Let's compete today.

130
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,360
Although rat fighting is bad,

131
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,520
you have a lot of natural skills.

132
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,120
Lao Chen.

133
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,000
You educate me.

134
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,640
Tian Wei.

135
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,720
Just a result.

136
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,120
Why should you teach me?

137
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,160
Here.

138
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,560
Don't say I market you for a girl.

139
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,080
Who...

140
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,640
Weiwei, I didn't expect you to be a knife master.

141
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,640
I'll teach you how to use the knife when I have a chance.

142
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,640
No.

143
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,480
Guards.

144
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,400
Burn that man who stole the knife.

145
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,440
Yes, Young Master.

146
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,840
Action!

147
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,360
Xiaowei.

148
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,880
Dad.

149
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,360
Dad.

150
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,160
Come.

151
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,280
Li Qiangwei!

152
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,360
Li Qiangwei!

153
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,680
Where are you?

154
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,120
Qiangwei!

155
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,880
Qiangwei!

156
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,840
Qiangwei!

157
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,600
You take it today.

158
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:33,640
Spare my brother's life at the husband's

159
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,040
Nany weird way

160
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,160
I was being 4 times remember

161
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,080
Brother F durians

162
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,760
And still remember

163
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,120
During all the hard times

164
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,400
I remember

165
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Dad felt

166
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Father, I'm sorry.

167
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm useless.

168
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,320
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,840
Father.

170
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,960
I'm sorry.

171
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,840
Father.

172
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,760
I'm useless.

173
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,400
Qiangwei.

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,080
What are you doing here?

175
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Are you drunk?

176
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,920
Qiangwei.

177
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
What are you doing here?

178
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,960
I'm worried that you're drunk.

179
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,760
I've been looking for you for a long time.

180
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,600
Why are you here?

181
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,320
What are you doing?

182
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,680
Nothing.

183
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,240
Are you going to bury this thing?

184
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,840
Fine.

185
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,800
Just bury it.

186
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,240
The world is so beautiful.

187
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,880
Life is so beautiful.

188
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,240
The hobby of being drunk

189
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
is really extraordinary.

190
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,680
The world is so beautiful.

191
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,800
But why are you

192
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,000
burying it?

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,440
I remember that in Rong City,

194
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
you said

195
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,200
the court of justice after death

196
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,960
should end here.

197
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,520
The court of justice after death

198
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,840
Since you've done it,

199
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,360
why do you have to humiliate her?

200
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,120
The court of justice after death

201
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,360
She still remembers my words?

202
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,840
Qiangwei.

203
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
You're right.

204
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
The dust is dust.

205
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
The earth is earth.

206
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,320
Let's end

207
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
all of this.

208
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,520
The police are also found on the way,

209
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,080
what about the dead ah back?

210
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,640
Wait,

211
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,280
women cannot be killed.

212
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,320
This is living woman's power.

213
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,520
They cannot build a new home.

214
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,320
Charge her with environmental conservation.

215
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,120
tabs.

216
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,040
Hey.

217
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,960
nitmpy.

218
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,080
fine.

219
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,120
I don't know why I always have a heart of death.

220
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,160
Father,

221
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,640
is the world

222
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,640
so complicated?

223
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,720
What are you looking at?

224
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,720
Why?

225
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,120
Wait.

226
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,520
Wait.

227
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,840
Don't move.

228
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,360
You look much more sleepy now.

229
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,240
Yue first,

230
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,720
now we are divided into four groups.

231
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,600
Tianming must be unhappy with everything.

232
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,080
Maybe I can make soup as alists and relief brain.

233
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,920
Not enough for her.

234
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,360
Help!

235
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,720
Help!

236
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,280
Help!

237
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
No.

238
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
No.

239
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
No.

240
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
No.

241
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
No.

242
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
If I die,

243
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,120
you Yan's rebels will always be...

244
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
Father.

245
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Father.

246
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
Father.

247
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Father, how are you?

248
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Father.

249
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Yan,

250
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
go.

251
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
I beg you.

252
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Let my father go.

253
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Let us go.

254
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Yan,

255
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
don't beg him.

256
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Father.

257
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Father.

258
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
These rebels,

259
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
don't have any other choice.

260
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
No.

261
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
If you have the guts, kill me.

262
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,120
Otherwise, I won't let you go.

263
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
I beg you.

264
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Let me go.

265
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,120
Xiaowei.

266
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
No.

267
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
Xiaowei.

268
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
No.

269
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Xiaowei.

270
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Father.

271
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Open the door, Xiaowei.

272
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
No.

273
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Xiaowei.

274
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Father.

275
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Father.

276
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Father.

277
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Father.

278
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
Father.

279
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Father.

280
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Xiaowei.

281
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
Xiaowei.

282
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
I beg you.

283
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
Let me go.

284
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
No.

285
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
What are you talking about?

286
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
No.

287
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
You scared me.

288
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
What are you doing here?

289
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
What else can I do?

290
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
I didn't have time to give it to you yesterday.

291
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
See if you like it.

292
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
What?

293
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
I didn't have any good clothes

294
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
after I entered your mountain.

295
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,120
Yesterday's one was broken.

296
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,120
So I bought one for you before I went back.

297
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Stop talking.

298
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Try it and see if you like it.

299
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,120
The sword pierces the light of the old city

300
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,120
The young man's face

301
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,120
is so fast that he falls in love with the light

302
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,120
The snow falls on the mountain

303
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,120
The life is so long

304
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
that it's hard to tell

305
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,120
The snow falls on the mountain

306
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,120
The wind blows past the ice

307
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,120
The lonely heaven and earth

308
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
are all cold

309
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,120
The people hate and hate the world

310
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,120
The mountain is not broken, the moon is not broken
