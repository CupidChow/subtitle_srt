1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The earth is full of laughter

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This blood-red sadness is full of blood

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The old heart is in pain, alone in the cocoon

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This scene is a taste of life

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full of difficulties, there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This blood-red sadness is full of blood

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat the heart, move the waves, break through the dark grass

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The love of our life is so hard to forget, but today

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Send him to the Supervision Department immediately.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes, Princess.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Besides, the young master has successfully ambushed the Ghost Valley,

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
but there is no next step.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I think Yan'er is not sure about the relationship between the man in black and them.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I have to think of a way to help him.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm tired.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Have some tea and take a break.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What would you like to drink?

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Dragon.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What dragon?

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you have the right to speak?

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Boss, listen to him.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Not bad.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You know the rules.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You can teach him.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What do you think?

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I understand.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll be right there.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Wait a minute.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Wait a minute.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Li Jiangwei, I told you to leave, but you didn't.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I didn't say anything, and even paid a sum.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll pay you back sooner or later.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What?

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm not a good person.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you regret it now?

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Joke.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I never regret it.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Here comes the West Lake Dragon.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Come on.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The man in black is...

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Please enjoy.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The world is...

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The world is...

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Unusual.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The city is...

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The city is...

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The city is...

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The city is...

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What a big wolf.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Where is the wolf?

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,300
The

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
wooden qi bull

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
sang the moon

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
played the zither

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and suddenly shut its mouth.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That Tong Yao

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
actually intentionally spread the rumour.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He must have wanted to test them for me.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But Chen Xiaoxi's reaction

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
was so different.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Could it be

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,440
I was wrong.

65
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,200
Wait.

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,000
Come here.

67
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,480
Young Master.

68
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,720
I saw it.

69
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,720
What are you hiding?

70
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,560
It's so sneaky.

71
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,240
What's in your hand?

72
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,800
A lantern.

73
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,320
Hurry up, it's×¨

74
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,840
Come on.

75
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,120
Let's go.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,160
Who is boring to

77
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,040
leave this out every day?

78
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,680
In terms of land,

79
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,720
Water is not too sticky.

80
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,440
In terms of calibers,

81
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,200
you also like

82
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,960
You're lying.

83
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,680
Liar.

84
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,160
I'm warning you.

85
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,720
Don't think you're the only one

86
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
who's come down the mountain with me.

87
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,720
If you're not a good person,

88
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,800
I'll make you suffer.

89
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,160
You're a good man,

90
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,440
but you always look like a murderer.

91
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,280
I'm not hostile to others.

92
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,040
I'm just hostile to you.

93
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,880
Why?

94
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,160
You're just like that fish.

95
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,640
I don't know where it came from.

96
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,320
So,

97
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,960
I'm the fish,

98
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,400
and you're the knife.

99
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,800
Even if it's killing the whole family,

100
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,880
it's still the right thing to do.

101
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,880
You...

102
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,640
Stop talking nonsense.

103
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,480
It's just a talk.

104
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Why are you so serious?

105
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,880
Did she know

106
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,080
what happened a year ago?

107
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,520
No.

108
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,000
Impossible.

109
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
I must have thought too much.

110
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,880
She really doesn't understand what Tong Yao means.

111
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,000
Did I feel wrong?

112
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,400
Don't take my idea.

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,480
I'm not a fish.

114
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,240
A person who's not attracted to a fish is not attracted to a fish.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,480
A man who's not attracted to a fish is not attracted to a fish.

116
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,680
Eat it.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,640
I'll send a kind heart today.

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,480
Look.

119
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,440
There's a shooting star.

120
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,960
Why are you standing there?

121
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,760
Make a wish.

122
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,580
girl Sakurazaki

123
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,760
I should not ferment my grudge

124
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,080
and take revenge on blood My second son

125
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,560
I must keep the country

126
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
and protect yourthat will live in heaven.

127
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,640
I didn't notice.

128
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,960
You think you scold me for nothing,

129
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,200
but I know you have no respect for me at all.

130
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,600
I'll show you

131
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,400
as stupid as the old unscrupulous.

132
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,800
Don't be so chivalrous.

133
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm so worried about everyone right now.

134
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,000
Why don't you go and check on everyone here?

135
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,760
Why did you hide all the time in the Valley?

136
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,280
You're acting like a great man.

137
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,360
Your Highness,

138
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,680
I did that out ofTC is kind.

139
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,640
carriers,

140
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,080
You don't need to talk for this creature,

141
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,120
He has been

142
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,880
a stubborn man since he was a child.

143
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,480
He is not honest enough and is a loser.

144
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,880
If he really has something urgent,

145
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,120
how can I tell him to do it?

146
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,880
If you are a man of good character,

147
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,200
you are a good man.

148
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,200
Jianwei,

149
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,000
you don't have to talk to him.

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,760
It's not like him.

151
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,320
You traitor,

152
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,320
get up.

153
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,400
I think he is more important than you.

154
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,720
Why don't you let him do it?

155
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,320
I don't know what you are doing.

156
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,280
It's not difficult.

157
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,480
Just kill someone.

158
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,440
Kill someone?

159
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,440
Master, I...

160
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,880
Chen Teng'an, who do you look down on?

161
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,200
Just kill someone.

162
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,400
I will go now.

163
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,200
Stop.

164
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,440
You are a disloyal man.

165
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,000
Stay here.

166
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,320
Don't go anywhere.

167
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,680
Jianwei,

168
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,080
what did you want to say?

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,440
I don't know who you want to kill.

170
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,800
He is a little horse thief.

171
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,200
Three years ago,

172
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,880
he killed my brother in the valley.

173
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,680
He usually has a secret.

174
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,880
I heard he appeared in Rong City recently.

175
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,760
Rong City?

176
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,560
Jianwei,

177
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,320
you have been in the Ghost Valley for a while.

178
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,600
How do I treat you?

179
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,840
Thank you for your kindness.

180
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,120
You are very kind to me.

181
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,040
Good.

182
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,680
Don't let me down.

183
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,680
Please enjoy.

184
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,960
Baozi, bring me the bowl.

185
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,400
Did you get anything?

186
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,600
Take a few more.

187
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,320
They are really strange.

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,320
They are so quiet,

189
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,760
but they are so familiar with the past.

190
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,880
What did Tong Yao and the others say?

191
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,280
As usual.

192
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,880
But

193
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,560
they asked me to kill someone in Rong City.

194
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,520
Who?

195
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,600
Did they like to kill others or not?

196
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,000
I never Michigan a name.

197
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,760

You're following me?

I'm just here to see how capable you are.

203
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,880
In case you get caught

204
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,280
by the whole Ghost Valley.

205
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,800
You don't believe me, do you?

206
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,280
Ghosts are the most dangerous creatures in the world.

207
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,840
