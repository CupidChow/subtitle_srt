1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How ridiculous the world is

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This blood-red sadness is full of blood

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You say your heart is in pain and you are suffering alone

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This sentence is not over yet

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full of difficulties and there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This blood-red sadness is full of blood

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat the heart and move the waves to break through the grass

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A life of wandering and looking forward to this morning

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Abyss of Love

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I tried so hard, but you are so shameless

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I can't save you, how can I do a great job in the future

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm willing to

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Say less

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And you, you are not standing on my side

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You are here to bully me

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm ashamed to treat you as my brother

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Shuzi, how do I deal with you today

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't be so petty

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What happened

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You were attacked by the foxes when you went down the mountain

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How did it happen

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I can't see it

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
People are back

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Shouldn't you be happy

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Help, the princess is missing

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Where is the princess, what happened

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Last night the princess was in a bad mood

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't let me eat

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I just didn't change it this morning

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is the situation I came to

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What's going on in the hospital

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It seems

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You brought me here, what do you want

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You are a woman with a ulterior motive

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm not a person outside

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I tied you up and asked you clearly

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Does Lord Chen know

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You are not afraid of him arguing with you

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If he knew, he would be fine

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Who asked who

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You be honest with me, I ask you

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You ask

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Since you found the key

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Why didn't you take it out early

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The need to get close to us

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What is the purpose

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Don't play tricks

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Make it clear one by one

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I won't make it hard for you

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I only asked you to find the little walnuts

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Save you two

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And carefully take care of the wounds

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In the end, I have a different ulterior motive

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You did these things are not fake

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But you are suitable for the heart

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Who can know

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Your little trick

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If you dream about them, you can't dream about me

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hurry up and explain

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I want to see Lord Chen

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Otherwise, I can't tell

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Do you say

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're so annoying

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You really pissed me off

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Lord, don't be angry

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
There is no grudge between the father and the son

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The young master is young

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
When he thinks it through

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I will come to apologize to you

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If he has half of your wisdom

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will be at ease

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What are you doing

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't you want to be a great man

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,680
I...

76
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Something urgent?

77
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
I have something urgent.

78
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,920
How do you know her?

79
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,520
She's just a friend

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,640
from the capital when I was young.

81
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,800
I don't want to meet her again.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,640
I...

83
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,840
Yuan Heqing said they were people from the underworld.

84
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,200
But His Majesty said they were friends from the capital.

85
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,840
Ghost Valley is no better than other places.

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,040
If we get too close to the government,

87
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,560
I'm afraid we'll get into unnecessary trouble.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,400
I'm here with a purpose.

89
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,880
You're right.

90
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,840
She's from the Guan family.

91
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,240
She's not my friend anymore.

92
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,600
I'll leave now.

93
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,880
Jianwei.

94
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,600
What can I do for you, Master?

95
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,840
You just mentioned Her Grace.

96
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,640
Do you know her real identity?

97
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,600
Master.

98
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,800
I've counted the whereabouts of an old man

99
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,080
for you.

100
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,760
What old man?

101
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Who is he?

102
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,120
You didn't tell me.

103
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,360
Qingyi?

104
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,360
Oh, no.

105
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,160
Chen Xiaoxi, what are you doing?

106
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,000
What are you doing?

107
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,240
What's wrong?

108
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,440
I just took the woman who lied

109
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,520
and brought her here to ask.

110
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,880
You don't believe me.

111
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,160
What's Qingyi's identity?

112
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,480
How can she be so rude to you?

113
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,680
If Master knows,

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,920
he'll be angry again.

115
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,280
She's here anyway.

116
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,600
I'll tell her myself.

117
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,240
Chen Xiaoxi.

118
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,960
Jianwei.

119
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,240
It's my fault.

120
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
I made you suffer.

121
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,320
It's okay.

122
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,640
Xiaoxi didn't do anything to me.

123
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,080
She's worried.

124
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,960
I can't blame her.

125
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,560
But there are some things

126
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,560
that need to be done.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,680
Done?

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,600
Jianwei.

129
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,160
Take me to see Lord Chen.

130
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,760
Hurry.

131
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,160
You bastard.

132
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,400
How could you do such a ridiculous thing?

133
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,080
Get out of here.

134
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,480
Get out.

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,120
I'll go in myself.

136
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
I need to ask him

137
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,000
about something.

138
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,840
Eunuch Yang.

139
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,720
My lady.

140
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,640
You've ananza for Quanzi.

141
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,800
Are you calling me

142
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,020
as the Gui-gu Despite-the-hews

143
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,560
or asoured

144
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,360
as shade of Chen?

145
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,560
Asplay zone, shade of Chen...

146
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,520
What's the difference?

147
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,880
If you're the vice general of the Zhongyong Army,

148
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,960
you're the husband of the man who married me.

149
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,200
Then it's a small matter.

150
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,080
I won't mind if it's a small matter.

151
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,920
But if you're the old master of Gui Valley,

152
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,280
you'll be punished for kidnapping the royal family.

153
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,200
Then I can only choose the vice general of the Zhongyong Army.

154
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,320
acceleration

155
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,480
General.

156
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,640
Tell me.

157
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,820
What happened

158
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,160
twenty years ago?

159
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,400
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,320
This hairpin

161
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,080
was given to me before you passed away.

162
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,160
I've worn it for 20 years.

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,880
20 years.

164
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,440
The past is gone.

165
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,120
We can't go back.

166
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,360
Chen Meng,

167
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,320
if you don't tell me the truth today,

168
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,920
I'll die in front of you.

169
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,880
Put it down.

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,960
20 years.

171
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,640
I can make the husband of the Tao Ling Alliance

172
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,920
to abandon me.

173
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,920
I can tear it off day and night

174
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,680
and hate it and hate it.

175
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,920
I can make him not dare to

176
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,600
meet me on the day of reunion.

177
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,920
Your Highness.

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,600
Your Highness.

179
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,680
Your Highness, an urgent report.

180
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,560
What's the situation?

181
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,400
Your Highness,

182
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,840
there are soldiers in the mountain.

183
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,560
Let's set the princess free

184
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,960
in one incense.

185
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,960
Otherwise, we'll set the mountain on fire.

186
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,640
What?

187
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,200
Go to arrange all the places in the valley

188
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,480
and prepare to fight.

189
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,480
Don't let it go easily.

190
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,080
Yes, I'll arrange it now.

191
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,600
Chamber Lobby

192
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,480
Are you from the Bureau of peace checks?

193
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,320
You're experienced줘

194
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,660
I know.

195
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,280
But you're so method.

196
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,200
Aren't the people in the Valley

197
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,440
a troublemaker?

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,520
I am a

199
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,800
and the soldiers.

200
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,160
Why did you become a coward today

201
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,400
and commit a theft for twenty years?

202
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
Twenty years ago,

203
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,560
my accomplice died in the battle.

204
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,400
The general was released.

205
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,880
I took my brother who had died for nine times

206
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,840
to escape to the Mount Jinwei

207
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,000
and killed the evil bandits in the Ghost Valley.

208
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,800
That's how I survived.

209
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,400
For twenty years,

210
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,640
we didn't want to leave the Ghost Valley

211
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,520
for a single day.

212
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,680
We were united with our families.

213
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,840
But we rebels

214
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,680
went out to deliver orders

215
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,880
and didn't go anywhere.

216
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,040
Since you want to know

217
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,240
what happened twenty years ago,

218
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,200
I won't tell you.

219
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
What happened

220
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,480
twenty years ago?

221
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,760
In the seven years of Yongning,

222
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,480
the commander of the Central Use Army, Chen Weishan,

223
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,280
under the order of the late emperor,

224
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,520
led the army to pacify the Bai Lan Tribe

225
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,360
and fought for months.

226
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,280
They fought all the way to the north of the mountain.

227
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,440
Both sides were badly injured

228
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,360
and couldn't hold on.

229
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,600
The army was out of provisions

230
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,600
and the reinforcements were not there.

231
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,720
We knew that during the Dragon East Festival,

232
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,520
there were only grass and trees in the mountains.

233
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,200
We had to sacrifice our lives

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,600
and worked hard for days.

235
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
But we couldn't wait for the reinforcements.

236
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,640
Only twenty days later,

237
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,040
the reinforcements were released.

238
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,360
Why were they released at this time?

239
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,360
I read the war report.

240
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,440
It said the Japanese were traitors.

241
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,680
They led the reinforcements to pacify the Bai Lan Tribe.

242
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,360
They were under the protection of the general.

243
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,200
General?

244
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,520
How could I not know that?

245
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,360
But that was the biggest change

246
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,280
in the mind of the people of Mount Jianwei.

247
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,000
The biggest fraud!

248
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,320
