1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How ridiculous the world is

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,500
This bloody and sad college is full of justice

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
You are suffering from heartache and suffering alone

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,500
This sentence is a life of taste

5
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full of difficulties and there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This bloody and sad college is full of justice

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's the heart that breaks the cold and the wind and the grass

8
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:32,760
The temporarily softened Manual of Robert

9
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,000
empire

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 14

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We are not brothers

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,500
We wish that no one would see you as the nightentry

13
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's not say he will take His Majesty's life

14
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,000
Uncle, let me help you get up

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I am a village girl

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A girl it is also General's France

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,060
they are felt.

18
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,020
Yes, Young Master.

19
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,060
True.

20
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,040
When two people are no Co-options,

21
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:05,560
one is fake.

22
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,960
My father is mining.

23
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,140
Ifsmoc APPLAUSEGULLились.

24
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,900
I wouldn't choose such people.

25
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,320
trouble-making.

26
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,460
I have always been judging這裡

27
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,700
is not at all.

28
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,920
Nonsense!

29
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,420
Even true regret

30
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,660
isn't even Published evil?

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What's wrong with you two?

32
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,800
If you have any hidden reasons,

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
the Valley Master will help you.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Ask him yourself.

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,000
Jian Wei.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you want to marry him?

37
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm the Young Master.

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
I'm doing this

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,400
for my own reason.

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Chen Xiaoxi, I'm the son of a Valley Master.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,200
Do I need your approval?

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
I need your approval.

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
You're a stubborn man.

44
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
How can I entrust the Ghost Valley to you?

45
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,000
How can I be at ease?

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,600
Jian Wei is a wise man.

47
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,600
You should treat him as your teacher.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,200
You should be considerate and considerate.

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,200
Instead of being narrow-minded and being self-righteous.

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
I envy him?

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Are you afraid that he'll take your title

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
for being a man of his word?

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,000
What a joke!

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm afraid he'll take my title.

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,000
You're right.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Shi Tou.

57
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,000
Tell me.

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Do you think so?

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,600
Young... Young Master.

60
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,600
Jian Wei is really good.

61
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Say that again!

62
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,800
If not,

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
we'll be wasting our time.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,800
All right.

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,800
I've made up my mind.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No need to discuss it.

67
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
All right.

68
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
All right.

69
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,800
You all...

70
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,800
You all are blind and blind.

71
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
You're all confused.

72
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Wait for me.

73
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
One day,

74
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I'll prove it to you all.

75
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,400
Li Jian Wei.

76
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,600
Wait for me.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Tomorrow,

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
it'll be your death day.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What?

80
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
Why is he so good?

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Young Master.

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
What's wrong with him?

83
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
He's amazing.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
He's really good.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,800
?

86
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,400
?

87
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
?

88
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,200
Little walrus?

89
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,600
Why are you here?

90
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,400
Brother,

91
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600
I sewed new clothes for you.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
I'd like to give it to you.

93
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,800
Why would you make new clothes for me?

94
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
You're my brother.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,400
Isn't it a fair job to sew clothes for you?

96
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
I just don't know

97
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,400
if there's a chance in the future.

98
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Silly girl, what are you talking about?

99
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
What's wrong?

100
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,880
What's the matter?

101
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,040
Once the little wolf grows up,

102
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,160
he won't live with the mother wolf.

103
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,440
He will have his own mission.

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,200
I understand.

105
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,480
Little Monkey,

106
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,160
do you have someone you like?

107
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Tell me who it is.

108
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:34,200
끝

109
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,260
Here it is.

110
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,500
Little Monkey, what are you looking for?

111
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,080
Brother, what are you looking for?

112
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,240
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,000
Let's wait

114
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,360
for a few years.

115
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,400
Who is it?

116
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,880
Jian Wei, it's me.

117
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
Open the door.

118
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,040
Jian Wei.

119
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,160
Little walnuts.

120
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,400
What's up?

121
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,840
I'm busy now.

122
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,480
Jian Wei,

123
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,400
I sewed new clothes for you.

124
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,360
It happens to be on the ceremony tomorrow.

125
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,640
I know you're suffering.

126
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,160
But people have to look ahead

127
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
and live in the light.

128
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,840
I have no parents since I was a child.

129
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,480
It's the people of Ghost Valley who raised me.

130
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,880
They have kindness,

131
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,720
affection and friendship to me.

132
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,360
I have to repay them.

133
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,880
Little walnuts,

134
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,800
I heard that you like to eat roast duck from Zuixian Restaurant.

135
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,200
Can you come down the mountain for me tomorrow?

136
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,120
Roast duck from Zuixian Restaurant?

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,680
Okay.

138
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,480
Jian Wei, go to bed early.

139
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,800
I'll put the clothes at the door.

140
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,920
Tengizhai clicks has.

141
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:39,360
In the past,

142
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,000
manab viewing is hard.

143
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,160
W儒 knowledge dis毒不適.

144
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Goer advice roams a trick,

145
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,440
A letter from the Investigation Department.

146
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,080
Li Pu was ordered

147
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,160
to join the army with the seven-year-old Zhong Yongjun

148
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,480
in the fifth base of the Eastern Courtyard.

149
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,120
But he arrived at the twenty-fifth.

150
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,560
Twenty days later.

151
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,640
It's a serious crime to slander the military.

152
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,960
Could it be...

153
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,760
By the way, Princess,

154
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,360
you've found the person you're looking for.

155
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,480
Where is he?

156
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,360
Heaven and earth are the witness to raises the soul.

157
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,000
And the respectable member is Lord Chen.

158
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,560
His fanciful and excellent spirit is still at his back.

159
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,320
splash young people like Li Jianwei.

160
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,760
Permenematch their life.

161
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,160
He has a land of great talent.

162
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,960
You met in this day

163
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,560
the mother-son strength.

164
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
In this life,

165
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,560
father, son, and filial piety

166
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,560
will be together forever.

167
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
Everyone hopes for that.

168
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Good!

169
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Good!

170
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Li Qianwei, my respects to you, Father.

171
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,560
Good. Get up.

172
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Kill the blood and return to the Alliance.

173
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
The ceremony is done.

174
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,560

178
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
we will be a family from now on.

179
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
The road ahead is long,

180
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
and the road is long.

181
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Don't let me down.

192
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
can you discuss it with me first?

193
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
No matter what, I am still the Young Master.

194
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,560
How can I tolerate a second son?

195
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Go after him, Cao Shu!

196
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Go after him!

197
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
Your Highness,

198
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,560
there must be poison in the wine.

199
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
The wine is in the wine.

200
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
Do you think you can stop me?

201
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
I want to see

202
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
how many times you can kill me.

203
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
I don't want to kill you,

204
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
but you have your hatred.

205
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
I have my hatred.

206
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,560
So, let's end it together today!

207
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,840
let's end this together.

208
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,480
Stop it!

209
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,800
You're indeed not dead.

210
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,600
I underestimated you.

211
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,440
You're strong.

212
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:34,620
Now

213
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,640
What is that sound?

214
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,140
Dawon!

215
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:11,420
Seize the opportunity to try

216
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:18,040
How the net does not stop εδώ
