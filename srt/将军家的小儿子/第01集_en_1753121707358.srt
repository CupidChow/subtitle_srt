1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The earth is full of laughter

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,500
This bloody and sad blood is full of bow and arrow

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
The old and new heartache is suffering alone in the old

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This sentence is a life of a knife

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full of hard to embroider, nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This bloody and sad blood is full of bow and arrow

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat the heart and make a mess, break through the ten thousand and ten thousand

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A lifetime of love will never forget this morning

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 1

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Father

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I am going to die

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You are also rebels, always

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Father

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Father

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Father, father, how are you, father

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yan, you go quickly

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I beg you, let my father go, let us go

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yan, don't beg him

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Father, father

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
These rebels, what's the use of them

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No, no

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Father

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Father, father

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Father, mother

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Don't worry, I will not let them go

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
General Li has been a hero for his whole life

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He is loyal to the country

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
After returning to the old Li, he should have a good life

30
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Who knows, he will be a hero in the future

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
General Li, you are a hero

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You are a hero

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
General Li, you are a hero

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:13,000
General Nie circled the party

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Pissed off, loyal to the country

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
For me, he did this for a reason

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,080
This is retribution.

38
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,160
General Li,

39
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,440
the state's important affairs

40
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,120
are not as small as you.

41
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,440
You're so excited.

42
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,400
Is there anything between you and him?

43
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,920
Everyone knows that General Li is loyal to the family.

44
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,160
You are so vicious and hurt.

45
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,560
Could it be that the case of the destruction of the family is related to you?

46
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,080
Where did you get the idea?

47
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,360
Get out of here!

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,720
I think you look so ugly in black.

49
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,480
You must be separated from your family.

50
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,240
There must be bloodshed in the pool.

51
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,400
The whole family will be dead within three days.

52
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,000
You're talking nonsense.

53
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,560
Do you know who I am?

54
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,200
You're the young master of the Ghost Valley.

55
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,400
You should know it.

56
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,880
The Ghost Valley.

57
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,520
I'm waiting for you.

58
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,640
You're really a man of your word.

59
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,160
Why don't you have a banquet in the city today

60
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,960
and take a break?

61
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,200
First, you'll get rid of the disaster.

62
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Second,

63
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,800
you'll have more ghosts.

64
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,000
You found it yourself.

65
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,280
Young Master,

66
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,280
the little monkey is missing.

67
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,680
I won't let you down today.

68
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,920
Let's go.

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,520
Five,

70
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,760
six,

71
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,600
seven,

72
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,520
eight,

73
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
nine.

74
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,920
Who is it?

75
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Why are you so blind?

76
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,440
Young Master,

77
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,200
you're really a man of your word.

78
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,120
Young Master,

79
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,800
you're really a man of your word.

80
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,680
You believe such nonsense?

81
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
He likes to have fun.

82
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,200
It must be at the banquet.

83
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,080
Let's go.

84
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,640
Let's go.

85
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,680
Welcome to the wedding party.

86
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,880
Tonight is the wedding night.

87
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,600
Everyone is having fun.

88
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,520
Young Master.

89
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Young Master, are you having fun?

90
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,480
Are you having fun?

91
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,520
Young Master, please.

92
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,760
Why are you all so excited?

93
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,520
This way, please.

94
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,320
Young Master.

95
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
Young Master.

96
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,000
Are you here to find...

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,800
Behind you.

98
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,480
Young Master.

99
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,960
Why are you so handsome?

100
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,200
Why are you so handsome?

101
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,160
Young Master.

102
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Young Master, don't be shy.

103
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,200
Who are you looking for?

104
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,640
Come in.

105
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,200
Young Master.

106
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,840
If it's really you,

107
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,920
I must take you to the tomb

108
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
and bury you in the ground.

109
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,440
Young Master.

110
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,200
Everything is well arranged.

111
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,560
Young Master.

112
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,480
Did you find the thief?

113
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,200
No.

114
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,960
Come on.

115
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,400
Let's go.

116
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,480
The auspicious time has come.

117
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,080
Young Master.

118
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,560
Let's go.

119
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,640
The bride is about to come out.

120
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,080
I don't know what to do.

121
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,600
I think you're dark and dark.

122
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,560
You're full of shame.

123
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,200
You must have a family separation.

124
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,800
There must be bloodshed in ten steps.

125
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,800
In three days,

126
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,240
all the clans will be dead.

127
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,880
That's what I said.

128
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,600
You can't live on your own.

129
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,720
I'm afraid of everything.

130
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,880
I'm so worried.

131
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,200
I want to believe you once.

132
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
The bride is coming.

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,960
Do you want to see how beautiful she is?

134
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,600
I know.

135
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,440
Action.

136
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,200
Four.

137
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,080
Who is it?

138
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,520
Someone is killed.

139
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,040
Zhu Fei is killed.

140
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,400
Someone is killed.

141
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,760
Good night.

142
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,120
Beauty.

143
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,840
The bright night is beautiful today.

144
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,320
I want to say goodbye to you.

145
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,920
We're even now.

146
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
From now on,

147
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,960
as long as you want,

148
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,760
I will love you with all my heart.

149
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,520
Don't cry.

150
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,440
Why are you crying?

151
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,160
I'll untie you.

152
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,360
Untie you, will you?

153
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,160
If I didn't want to keep our clan safe,

154
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
I wouldn't have had to take you back for the wedding.

155
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,760
It's all that bastard's fault.

156
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,600
Forget it. I don't care.

157
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,760
If you don't want to,

158
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,560
when I get the disaster,

159
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,440
I'll give you a gift

160
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,840
and send you back.

161
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,920
Stop crying.

162
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,840
How come it's you?

163
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,680
You're a scoundrel.

164
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,640
You'll be killed

165
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,760
when I catch you.

166
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,520
You're a scoundrel.

167
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,800
Where are you going?

168
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,280
He's not a human.

169
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,640
I have to find a way

170
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,280
to find out the truth as soon as possible.

171
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,840
You're the one who's waiting.

172
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,520
Do you want to see

173
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,760
if you have the talent of blood?

174
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,240
You...

175
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,520
Tell me.

176
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,760
Who are you?

177
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,640
You're making fun of me.

178
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,680
Why are you doing this?

179
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,480
If you don't tell me,

180
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,440
I'll kill you

181
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,920
one by one.

182
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,680
Kill you?

183
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,240
Come closer.

184
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,360
Come closer.

185
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,560
You want to play, right?

186
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,600
I'll play enough with you today.

187
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,960
The three swords of the sword

188
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,280
are exactly the same as the black man's.

189
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,680
Could it be

190
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,240
that they

191
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,360
are really capable of fighting with me alone?

192
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
You're despicable.

193

You're shameless.

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What did you say?

195
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
You're despicable.

196
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
You're shameless.

197
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
You're shameless.

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
You're shameless.

209
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,600
You're shameless!

210
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,720
I love him.

211
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
I love him.

212
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,840

What did you say?

225
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,720
I won't let you go.

226
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,080
You're so self-righteous.

227
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,400
Young Master.

228
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,520
My head.

229
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,880
Young Master.

230
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,480
I'm afraid you're crazy.

231
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,880
Let's go.

232
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,560
If you dare to enter the Ghost Valley,

233
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,640
you'll be dead.

234
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,560
Shi Tou.

235
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,600
Throw him into the back mountain to feed the wolves.

236
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,000
Remember.

237
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,280
Don't alert the Master.

238
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,280
Yes, Young Master.

239
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,040
I'll make a fool of my innocence.

240
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,520
Who will be the one to be blamed if the law is broken?

241
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,680
I've been through ups and downs in my youth.

242
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,320
But I've fallen in love with you.

243
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,960
We've been through ups and downs together.

244
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,240
That's our destiny to live and die

245
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,760
Snow falls on a Qing Shan mountain

246
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,760
Zabdご ва 깏та

247
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,200
membership is over

248
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,640
Leave the earth and love is short

249
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,720
Never letting lie don't reason with the machines
