1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will stay by your side, and wait for your return.

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We will travel around the world together,

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and travel around the world together.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The mountains are vast and the rivers are vast,

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the waves are vast and the moon is bright.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The earth is full of laughter.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The snow is soft and the north is full of snow.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You are suffering and suffering alone.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is the end of life.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full and you can't escape.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The snow is soft and the north is full of snow.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's the heart that breaks through the waves.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The snow is soft and the north is full of snow.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Legend of Chusen

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I will risk my life to leave you.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is not your fault.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You must not do anything stupid.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The Legend of Chusen

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The Legend of Chusen

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The Legend of Chusen

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Xiao Xi, I misunderstood you for the past few days.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This person is up to you how you want to deal with him.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I killed Li Yan once.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He is not dead.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's the arrangement of God.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I have decided to let go of the grudge of the past.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You have to listen to me.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I know he is Li Jianwei, not Li Yan.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I will punish him for his misdeed

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and drive him down the mountain.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Young Master, you are too naive.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You are the son of the rich and the poor.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Kill him today.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Tell the hero of the Zhongyou Army.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes, kill him.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Kill him.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Kill him.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Kill him.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Kill him.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have decided.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why does Chen Wenshan's son

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
smell so good?

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Execute.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Li Jianwei,

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
do you know your fault?

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I know my fault?

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Li Jianwei,

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
do you know your fault?

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I know my fault?

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Li Jianwei,

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
do you know your fault?

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,480
Everything had to be done,

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,240
it wasn't all thatBLE.

55
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
ictro deed ?

56
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,940
Li Jianwei.

57
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,480
Do you assisted me?

58
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,360
This was negotiated before.

59
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,840
It's difficult to fix.

60
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,520
Li Jianwei.

61
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,420
Do you assist me ?

62
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,500

To bring you and me

65
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,700
Out of the way

66
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,060
Let the sun Area

77
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,500
I'm sorry for my mistake.

78
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,820
Yan'er,

79
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,540
when you wake up,

80
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,180
I'll take you down the mountain.

81
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,060
From now on,

82
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,180
you can forget everything here.

83
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,900
It's all my fault for not taking good care of you.

84
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,780
Yes.

85
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,380
When Yan'er wakes up,

86
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,220
I'll take her away.

87
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,700
Fate is cruel.

88
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,180
She and Xiaoxi

89
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,340
lived in the same year, month and date.

90
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,580
If Li Pu doesn't commit the sin,

91
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,700
they could be good brothers.

92
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,500
You mean,

93
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,820
Wan Niang and Hui Niang

94
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,500
were born at the same time in the army?

95
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,620
Wan Niang and Hui Niang

96
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,060
were sisters.

97
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,660
But I didn't expect that

98
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,540
things would change so suddenly.

99
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,660
Manor

100
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,060
Okay.

101
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:57,940
Okay.

102
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,740
Come on.

103
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,620
Wash it carefully.

104
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:08,900
Here you are.

105
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,340
Good.

106
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,340
Come,ванись.

107
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,220
Okay.

108
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,060
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,820
Sister,

110
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,660
I feel uneasy.

111
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,900
Pu Lang has violated the military flag this time.

112
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,620
Even if my brother-in-law forgave him,

113
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,820
he didn't eat any good fruit after he returned to the capital.

114
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,900
Don't mention him.

115
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,420
He didn't ask about it when you were in the tomb.

116
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,900
He has been silent for days

117
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,220
when the military flag is so important.

118
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,620
All right, let's not talk about it.

119
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,780
Why didn't you take it?

120
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,060
I'll go get it now.

121
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,460
I'll be back soon.

122
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,380
Good boy.

123
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,780
What's wrong with him?

124
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,300
What's wrong with him?

125
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,260
Are you okay?

126
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,940
I'm fine.

127
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,580
Tell me what happened outside.

128
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,900
Li Pu is in chaos.

129
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,340
He wants me to protect his wife and child.

130
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,740
What? Li Pu?

131
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,740
No, no.

132
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,620
My child and I are safe.

133
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,260
Li Pu is being cruel.

134
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,580
If he fails, he'll be an adult.

135
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,380
Lord Chen, go help General.

136
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,780
Go, go, go!

137
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,380
Protect his wife!

138
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,020
Yes!

139
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,660
Protect his wife!

140
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,620
Don't cry.

141
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,740
Don't cry.

142
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,300
Why is your father so mischievous?

143
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,100
We're family after all.

144
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Right?

145
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,380
Good boy.

146
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,380
Don't cry.

147
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Don't cry.

148
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,020
Don't cry.

149
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,300
Good boy.

150
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,660
Don't cry.

151
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,340
Madam, run!

152
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
General!

153
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,620
Don't cry.

154
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,620
Madam!

155
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Madam!

156
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,620
You're awake.

157
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,620
You should go down the mountain.

158
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,820
Master hates Li Pu so much.

159
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,940
Twenty soldiers can't kill him.

160
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,420
You'll be dead if you don't go down the mountain.

161
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,420
I'll go with you.

162
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,420
I'll go with you.

163
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,420
Go.

164
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,420
Go.

165
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,420
Go.

166
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,420
Go.

167
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,420
Go.

168
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,420
Go.

169
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,420
Go.

170
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,420
Go.

171
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,420
Go.

172
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,420
Go.

173
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,420
Go.

174
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,420
Go.

175
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,420
Go.

176
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,420
Go.

177
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,420
Go.

178
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,420
Go.

179
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,420
Go.

180
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,420
Go.

181
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,420
Go.

182
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
I can't kill you.

183
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,420
But I can't guarantee that someone will come in and kill you.

184
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,420
You are

185
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,420
a tough man.

186
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,420
At first, I really wanted to throw you to the back mountain to feed wolves.

187
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,420
But you know what?

188
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,420
Since you came back to Langya,

189
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,420
I've been admiring you with my heart.

190
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,420
I really want to give you my heart, too.

191
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Let's go.

192
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,420
No.

193
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,420
No.

194
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,420
No.

195

Come on.

199
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
Let's go.

200
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,420
The wound is so heavy but it's not well.

201
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,420
Do you think

202
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,860
I should call you Li Yan

203
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,420
or Li Jianwei in the future?

204
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,420
I don't know what you're called.

205
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,420
In the future,

206
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,420

Life and death are hard to tell.

210
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,420
The snow falls on the green hills.

211
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,420
In the dream,

212
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,420

213
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,420
The lonely land is crowded with people.

214
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,420
I can't stop missing the past.

215
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,420

227
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,420

I can't stop missing the past.

232
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,420
I can't stop missing the past.

233
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,420
I can't stop missing the past.

234
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,420
I can't stop missing the past.

235
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,420
I can't stop missing the past.

236
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,420
4 eye울

237
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,420
Are you alright, Yuan?

238
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
It is fine.

239
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,420
Mom!

240
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,660
Mom!

241
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,420
Prince Chen.

242
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:18,860
Yun.

243
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,740
What's wrong?
