1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How ridiculous the world is

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This blood-red sadness is full of blood

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You are suffering from heartache and suffering alone

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This scene is a life of taste

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Deep abyss is full of difficulties and there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This blood-red sadness is full of blood

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's a heart-wrenching cold that breaks through the grass

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A life of pain and sorrow is full of blood

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I saw you didn't have any proper clothes after you went up the mountain

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yesterday's inner shirt was broken

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Take it back

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
How can I take back what I gave you?

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hurry up, get me a new one

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What?

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You are shy?

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Fine, you can change it yourself

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll wait for you over there

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So stupid, you can't even remember the clothes

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Come, let me help you

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Have you ever heard what I said in my dream?

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, I heard it very clearly

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What?

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You said you are not Li Jianwei, you are...

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What?

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You are a bad guy

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Boring

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay, I was kidding

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't move, it will be done soon

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Not bad, not bad, you are talented

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But it's not as good as mine

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What are you doing?

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I gave you the new clothes, don't worry about my wolf tooth

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Zhe Si cares about this wolf tooth so much

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Fine, I'll let you take it to the coffin sooner or later

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Bastard, what did you do to him?

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll kill you

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Bastard, I knew you are not a good person

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Young master, let him tell us

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What's going on?

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You still don't admit it?

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Young master, he is missing

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can't go there

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Why not?

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Is there any secret?

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Then

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Then what is it?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What?

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is there anything more important than finding the walnuts?

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I didn't mean that

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then go and have a look

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Jianwei

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What's wrong?

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Who hurt you like this?

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I followed the order from young master

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
To investigate the ghost valley

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I can't find a woman with a high martial arts

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Woman?

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And this flower

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's also hers

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't know

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't know

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't know

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't know

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't know

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And this flower

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's also hers

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This flower is so strange

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Princess

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There is still something missing

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Since Rong Chen came back

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You seem to have no idea

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Twenty years ago

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There was an old friend

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I thought he was already in the desert

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Become a lonely ghost

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But now it seems

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That battle

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Someone really escaped from heaven

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You know

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Twenty years ago, he finally went to the nianan

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I saved Yan'er

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It was a bitter heart

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I never thought

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's hard to predict

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Fate makes people

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Forget it

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Siyu

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You don't have to go to the ghost valley

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's heal first

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This is a wordless tomb

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's a long story

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Then let's talk for a long time

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's important to find small walnuts

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll tell you when I have a chance

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm afraid I didn't think it through

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Also

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm an outsider after all

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I never thought of you as an outsider

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Just

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The story behind this is too long

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's find small walnuts first

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Then I will tell you without hesitation

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Young master, come quickly

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Shouze, what's wrong

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Young master

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Small walnuts, his bamboo basket

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Inhuman

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Li Jianwei

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What the hell did you say yesterday

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
If he is sleeping three times

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I will also sleep three times

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I will also sleep three times

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You are not a person

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You are not a person

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I will also sleep three times

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I will also sleep three times

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I will also sleep three times

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I will also sleep three times

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If you sleep three times

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I can't find you

131
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yesterday

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Small walnuts

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You don't have to be so good to me

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Do you understand

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't understand

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Forget it

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's useless to tell you

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
In short

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No need

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Brother Jianwei

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Are you like stone

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Also think I am annoying

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Li Jianwei

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Why are you so idle

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I drank too much last night

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Drunk too much

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Stone

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's not time to blame Jianwei now

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Find someone to take care of

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Young master

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Don't you think since he came

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The whole ghost valley has changed

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Stone, what are you talking about

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
When did you see the little walnuts so unhappy

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And now you are with him all the time

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You are not angry

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Still defending him everywhere

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Even the valley master is depressed

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You don't care about the hidden heart

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Stone, don't talk nonsense

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This has nothing to do with Jianwei

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Xiao He was just disliked by him

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So he left with a heart

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
When did the ghost valley

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Because of an outsider

166
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Make your own people feel wronged

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Jianwei is already a ghost valley person

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He is our brother

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Brother

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Young master

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You treat him as an outsider

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
As your brother

173
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't worry

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I will definitely take Xiao He

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Bring back with no damage

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You don't have to be so happy

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
In this world

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You and we are not the same person

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Why are you doing this

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Stone, shut up

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Young master

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He is a person

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
An unknown liar

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't be deceived by him

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't you care about

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
His background

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Why are you all protecting him now

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I didn't

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Didn't

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I think you are confused by him

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Deep in it

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Now you can only blame yourself

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Stone

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Young master

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Young master

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
How are you

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Young master

199
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What happened to you

200
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Is it the hair style again

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It was all my fault just now

202
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I shouldn't have said so

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's okay

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't worry about me

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's important to find someone

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll go to the back hill to find it again

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Li Jianwei

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Take good care of our young master

209
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Otherwise, the old accounts with you

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You go quickly

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Ok

212
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Jianwei

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I didn't expect you have this skill

214
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How many things do you hide from me

215
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
My father also suffered from a headache

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Every time I have a problem

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I give him

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It turns out

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Jianwei

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Thank you

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I feel much better

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Jianwei

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Don't blame stone

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He and little walnuts

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Grow up together

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Feelings are deep

227
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Only when you are in a hurry

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Will you say sorry

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It doesn't matter

230
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I have something to believe

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Where will the little walnuts go

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Maybe someone can help us

233
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Qingyi

234
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yan'er

235
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Sit

236
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Where is your young master

237
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It happened suddenly

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I told him to wait outside

239
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You go and invite him in

240
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I want to see that kid

241
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Why does Qingyi want to see him

242
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yan'er

243
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You are ready to stay

244
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I want to meet them

245
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Don't worry

246
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I have my own sense

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Come

248
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Since you are a friend of Jianwei

249
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Then I will be straightforward

250
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
My sister is missing

251
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Where did the wild boy come from

252
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There is no rule

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You

254
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You are also calm

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Meiyu doesn't look like Chen Meng

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It shouldn't be his child

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Qingyi

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It happened suddenly

259
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We have no choice

260
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Qingyi

261
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Xiaoxi cares about her sister

262
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Now life is uncertain

263
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You have to look like a beggar

264
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I didn't see how much she cared

265
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What do you mean

266
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We came to beg for help

267
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You are so shameless

268
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Jianwei, let's go

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Xiaoxi, calm down

270
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's important to find someone

271
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Now only Qingyi can help us

272
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Qingyi, you are good

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I kneel down for you

274
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Jianwei

275
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What are you doing

276
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm begging her

277
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Not a beggar

278
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You calm down, Xiaoxi

279
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Then since it is

280
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You can go

281
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The sky is not good

282
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
People have bad luck

283
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's all a cycle

284
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Qingyi

285
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I just offended you

286
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I was worried about the safety of my sister

287
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's why I said it

288
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You have a lot

289
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Don't be mad at me

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Forget it

291
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Get up

292
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Give me

293
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Qingyi

294
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
This is where Xiaohe disappeared

295
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You wait

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm so angry

297
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Jianwei

298
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
If it wasn't for you just now

299
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I really want to kill her

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Is this woman reliable?

302
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If she delays our business

303
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What good does Xiaohe have?

304
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I can't spare her

305
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Don't you believe me

306
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I do believe you

307
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But

308
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Open it

309
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
This is

310
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The door

311
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Open it

312
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Open it

313
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Open it

314
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Open it

315
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Open it

316
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Open it

317
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Where is it so standard?

318
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Really beautiful

319
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Really handsome

320
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You're so cute.

321
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Who are you?

322
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Don't come over.

323
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's weird.

324
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's a girl.

325
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't laugh at her.

326
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You all get out of here.

327
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You're so cute.

328
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You're so cute.

329
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You're so cute.

330
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You're so cute.

331
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You're so cute.

332
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You're so cute.

333
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You're so cute.

334
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You're so cute.

335
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You're so cute.

336
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You're so cute.

337
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're so cute.

338
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You're so cute.

339
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You're so cute.

340
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're so cute.

341
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The sword pierces through the night,

342
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
the youthful face

343
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
is about to fall in love.

344
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The snow falls,

345
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
the snow falls,

346
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
life and death are hard to tell.

347
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The snow falls,

348
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
the mountains are in the air,

349
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
the wind blows,

350
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
the waves are on the horizon.

351
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The lonely world is full of hatred.

352
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It can't stop the fate from turning against the past.
