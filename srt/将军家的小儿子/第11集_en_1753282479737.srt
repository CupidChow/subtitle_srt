00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
You all

4
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
get out of here!

5
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Yes.

6
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Let's go.

7
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Let's go.

8
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,500
The Taoism Grandmaster

9
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Who are you?

10
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Where am I?

11
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
This is the Hundred Flower Manor.

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,500
I'm the owner here,

13
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
Wan Qianhong.

14
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Wan Qianhong?

15
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
I don't know you anymore.

16
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Why did you bring me here?

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,500
I didn't bring you here.

18
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
I just saw you

19
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
shooting in the mountains alone

20
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
and brought you back.

21
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm kind and kind.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,500
Why don't you thank me?

23
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Instead,

24
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
you're pregnant with me.

25
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Then, thank you.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Wan...

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Madam.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You haven't told me your name.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
My name is Little Walnut.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Little...

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Walnut?

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Can I

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
leave now?

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Little Walnut.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's not peaceful outside these days.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're here to rob.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're a thief and a thief.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're not evil.

39
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
You're a thief and a thief.

40
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
It's too dangerous for you to go back alone.

41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Why don't you

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
stay in my manor?

43
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
What do you think?

44
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
But...

45
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
There's no but.

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
I can still hurt you.

47
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Madam,

48
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
I want to go home.

49
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
I told you.

50
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
This is

51
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
your home.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The flower is from the Flower Manor.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It must be related to the owner of the manor, Wan Qianhong.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,500
You need to be

55
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
childish

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
to play with the old and new walnuts.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No, thanks.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This boy is really good.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I want to touch it.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I wonder what kind of touch it is.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
They're looking at us.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's so comfortable.

64
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
It's so delicious.

65
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Look at you.

66
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
No one will eat you.

67
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Be careful.

68
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Pay attention to your eyes.

69
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Imagine you're a handsome wolf.

70
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Why do you have to do this?

71
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
You're not usually

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
in the Ghost Valley.

73
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Now you're out for business.

74
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
You're shy like a lady.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How can you be like this on the street?

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why am I so nervous?

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Besides,

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
why am I the only one like this?

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He is your sister.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So you should be more careful.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But he was tricked by you.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I didn't mean that.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I just...

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's okay.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I was wrong too.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's go.

87
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Let's go meet him.

88
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Here you are.

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Enjoy your meal.

90
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Xie,

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
the view is so beautiful.

92
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
I don't feel like seeing the view.

93
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Xie,

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
a man and a man

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
can't be attracted to love.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
In my opinion,

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
that woman

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
must be a woman of beauty.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're familiar with her.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But she ran away with another man.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
She's obviously

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
a heartless woman.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
If I want to blame her,

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I can only blame myself for being so fond of her.

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's why I was tricked by Zhuyou.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I didn't see her clearly.

107
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,500
It's not good to just be in love.

109
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
It's better to be in love

110
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
than to be in love.

111
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
It's rare

112
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,500
to be so fond of a man.

113
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Don't blame me, Madam.

114
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm still

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
trapped in love.

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I can't pull myself out.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But Madam

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
is so beautiful

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and so beautiful.

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I can't help

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
but fall in love with her.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're so considerate

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
but you're so talkative.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Why don't

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I be more honest?

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Little man,

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll give you a toast.

128
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
I'm willing to

129
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
drink with you

130
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
to get rid of all my sorrows.

131
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Thank you, Madam.

132
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Little man,

133
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
come home with me.

134
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Okay?

135
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
I'm willing to.

136
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Why don't you take me with you?

137
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
If that's the case,

138
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
I'll have you.

139
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
The King's Queen

140
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
A'xi.

141
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
This is the performance

142
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
I prepared for you.

143
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Do you like it?

144
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Come and greet

145
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
your new queen.

146
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Queen.

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,500
Are you going to

148
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
deprive me of my queen?

149
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Please.

150
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Please don't take the queen.

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Useless man.

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You can't make me happy.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Why do you keep it?

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
it can be used

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
to make you fat.

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Madam.

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
A'xi.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Madam.

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
My good A'xi.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't be afraid.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
In life,

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
it's time to be happy.

164
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's forget all the troubles

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and do the happiest thing

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
in the world together.

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay?

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You

169
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,500
come with me.

170
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Wait.

171
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Madam.

172
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Since we're going to do

173
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
the happiest thing in the world,

174
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
we have to do it alone.

175
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Besides, I'm the new queen.

176
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
How can they cooperate with me to fight for favor?

177
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
I didn't expect

178
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
you're greedy.

179
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Fine.

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Then you

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
all go away.

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Wait.

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You

184
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
stay.

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Go find the little walnuts.

186
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
A'xi.

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I know you're friends.

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I let him accompany you.

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But why do you only care about him

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and ignore me?

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Madam.

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm a very affectionate person.

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Since you want to be with me,

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
he will leave.

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm not considerate.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
A love-hate relationship like A'xi

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
is not worthy of you.

198
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You

199
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
get out.

200
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Did you hear me?

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Get out.

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Be good.

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't bother me.

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
A'xi.

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Now

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
there are only two of us.

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm like you.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Should I

209
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
be happy?

210
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
No.

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Madam.

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Let's drink first.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Then

214
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
let's drink this cup of wine

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and play a game.

216
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Is this a secret palace?

217
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Where is the little walnuts?

218
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Little walnuts.

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Little walnuts.

220
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't know why

221
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Madam is so fond of that little girl.

222
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Who said no?

223
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
This is a delicious meal.

224
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
The little walnuts are really here.

225
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
The blue sea used to be the water of the South.

226
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
The clouds are not the clouds except the birds.

227
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
The flowers are gone and the blue sky is back.

228
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Half of the garden is cultivated and half is gone.

229
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Yongning for seven years.

230
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Dongzhi.

231
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Li Bo.

232
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Father.

233
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Father.

234
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Father.

235
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Father.

236
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,000
Father.

237
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Father.

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Father.

239
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Father.

240
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Father.

241
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Father.

242
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Father.

243
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Father.

244
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Father.

245
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Father.

246
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Father.

247
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Father.

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Father.

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Father.

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Father.

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Father.

252
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Father.

253
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Father.

254
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Father.

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Father.

256
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Father.

257
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Father.

258
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Father.

259
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Father.

260
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Father.

261
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Father.

262
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Father.

263
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Father.

264
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Father.

265
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Father.

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Father.

267
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Father.
