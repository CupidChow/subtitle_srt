1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The earth is full of laughter

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The blood is soft and the sadness is full of blood

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The old and the new heartache is not alone in the sword

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is the end of life

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full of difficulties and there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The blood is soft and the sadness is full of blood

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat the heart and act as a cold and break the cold and break the cold

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The old and the new heartache is not alone in the sword

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Abyss of Love

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Look, there is a lantern.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Lantern.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Bad news.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's a message from Qing Yi.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
They can't find it.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The weather is getting warmer.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If the lantern falls into the mountain, it will cause a fire.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We should set it down.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You are so silly.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Brother, Jian Wei is right.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's set it down in case...

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let me do it.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Who are you?

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You are not the owner of my territory.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Get out.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Get out.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The young master is over there.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Over there.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Young master, over there.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Watch out.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Shoot.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Good.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Good.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Good.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Good.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Good.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Good.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Come on.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's have a drink.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come on.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Li Jian Wei, the lantern is burning.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's dangerous to fall into the forest.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You go to the forest alone.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll pick it up.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Brother.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There are so many wolves in the mountain.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You want him to go alone.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What's the point of sending him to death?

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's right.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I just want him to go to the wolf's den

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
to see the lantern.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Li Jian Wei, since you want to stay,

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
you should show us your ability.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You are so capable.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I think the little white face

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
won't dare to go.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What's the big deal?

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Back then, the owner led his brothers

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
to fight with the wolves for 15 days.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's why we have this territory today.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
To the owner.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
To the owner.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
To the owner.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
To the owner.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Come on.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Cheers.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Cheers.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Jian Wei.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't force you.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's right.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Come on.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Come on.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Master.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If so,

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I must go.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now, Xiao Xi has grown up.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Brother Jian Wei.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Xiao Xi.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You are so young.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You really go.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There are many wolves in this place.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This guy hasn't come back for a long time.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm afraid he's dead.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If he's dead, he's alive.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Brother.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Don't say that.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't know how the little guys are doing.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's see.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He's here.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's drink.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Come on.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's go.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Come on.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Come on.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Come on.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Come on.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Brother Jian Wei.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How are you?

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Sit down.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
How are you?

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Brother Jian Wei.

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Young Master.

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The ring.

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is...

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Wolf's Teeth?

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Wolf's Teeth.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's really a wolf's tooth.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's the wolf's wolf's wolf's tooth.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's right.

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's really a wolf's wolf's tooth.

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Jian Wei is a wolf's wolf.

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This guy is really good.

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's right.

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This guy is really good.

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's right.

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He's really good.

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The flowers of Spring are falling slowly.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The light wind doesn't let the clouds to stop.

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The wind blows away the floating waves.

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Chang'an is in full bloom.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's good for the people.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's a game of hide and seek.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If you don't run away from the wolf,

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
we won't laugh at you.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's right.

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Young Master, this game

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
is to test my ability.

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I wanted to kill them.

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But I remembered

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Xiao He was acting against me.

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He was

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
from the Wolf's Box.

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I saw him.

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You know a lot.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So what?

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I think the wolf's box

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
has brought him up.

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've married the wolf's wolf.

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Why should I marry him?

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're being unreasonable.

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're lucky.

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Good boy.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You're brave.

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You're kind.

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Xiao Xi, fill Jian Wei's bowl.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Xiao Xi.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Mr. Shi.

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hold it.

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My Young Master Jing.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Please.

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's drink.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Li Xian Wei.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Wake up.

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Brother.

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Li Xian Wei.

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Brother.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Wake up.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:08:04,920
The

161
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,320
How old can he fight?

162
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,600
I'll help him through the Danielle tea.

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,760
Come with me.

164
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,320
What do you think of him?

165
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,120
He's a bit brave.

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,640
But dad,

167
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,400
I really don't understand

168
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,800
why you changed your mind

169
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,680
to keep him.

170
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,200
If he's really brave,

171
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,760
he'll be a big trouble.

172
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,600
He's not a small man.

173
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,880
He can leave the wolf's den with his body.

174
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,200
He must know how to defeat the enemy.

175
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,840
He also knows how to retreat.

176
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,640
Let's keep him for now.

177
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,120
Only when he knows the enemy,

178
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,000
he can fight with him.

179
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,440
Remember,

180
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,960
don't let go of the enemy.

181
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,400
No wonder I've been

182
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,360
so hard on him these days.

183
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,400
He can endure it.

184
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,480
He's really cunning.

185
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,880
Let's be careful.

186
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,560
The past

187
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,480
is in the past.

188
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,440
The past?

189
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,000
What's the past?

190
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Didn't all the people of that family die last year?

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,920
There's still a living one.

192
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,480
The Valley Master knows about this.

193
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,800
No wonder he asked the Valley Master to deal with it.

194
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,080
I'm afraid it can't be delayed for a while.

195
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,120
They're saying that

196
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,360
there's still a living one in my family.

197
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,440
No.

198
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,720
They can't know I'm still alive.

199
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,520
The Valley Master is busy.

200
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,480
Please ask him to leave.

201
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,040
Get lost.

202
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,480
I... I... I...

203
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,000
Get lost.

204
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,240
Go.

205
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,560
This is about the survival.

206
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,000
It's not too late.

207
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,040
Xiao Xi,

208
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,560
you and Shi Tou go down the mountain.

209
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,960
You must get this done.

210
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,960
Don't let anything happen.

211
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,960
Don't worry.

212
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,880
There's something strange.

213
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,080
These bandits

214
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,800
are so good at the Ghost Valley.

215
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Why are they here?

216
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,840
And

217
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,400
how do you explain

218
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,080
the three-edged sword?

219
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,960
It's a narrow path.

220
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,040
Young Master,

221
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,320
why don't we take him with us?

222
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,600
We can help each other.

223
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,920
That's right.

224
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,360
Li Qiang Wei,

225
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,040
go down the mountain with me.

226
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,600
No.

227
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,320
Don't be punished for being forbidden to drink.

228
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,960
So what?

229
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,200
It's not up to you.

230
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,680
Wait.

231
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,320
What?

232
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,560
You're scaring me.

233
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,400
Come on.

234
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,480
Look here.

235
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
I'm telling you three poor guys.

236
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,360
Get lost if you have no money.

237
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,560
This is what you call a business.

238
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,520
Don't bother me.

239
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,160
Yes.

240
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,440
You're so mean.

241
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,120
This place is not a normal place.

242
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,120
Don't mess around.

243
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,400
That's right.

244
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,600
If you want to buy it, you can get the money.

245
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,280
Right?

246
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,680
You can't get one less.

247
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,640
Business is about honesty.

248
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,080
You can get a good price,

249
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,280
but you can't get a good business.

250
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,000
You little brat.

251
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,800
Say that again.

252
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,560
Who are you?

253
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,200
Let go of me.

254
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,800
You dare to touch my men?

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,800
Do you believe that I'll burn your shop down?

256
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
You burn a shop down?

257
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,800
Just two.

258
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
If you can't afford it,

259
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,520
I'll give you a loss.

260
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,320
Are you leaving or not?

261
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,240
Go.

262
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,080
Go.

263
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,440
I'm not doing your business.

264
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,400
Go.

265
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,320
Go.

266
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,960
I'm not doing your business.

267
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,320
Go.

268
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,680
Go.

269
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,240
Go.

270
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,800
Go.

271
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,960
Go.

272
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,920
You're so mean.

273
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,200
Aren't you afraid of losing money?

274
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,600
Money?

275
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,600
Listen.

276
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,560
I'm just going to feed these thieves.

277
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,240
I won't sell them to you.

278
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,960
Come here.

279
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,760
Come back.

280
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,000
Listen.

281
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,280
How many times do I have to tell you?

282
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,640
Kill him.

283
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Or I'll kick you out.

284
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,600
If he comes again,

285
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,720
if I see you again,

286
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
you'll be dead.

287
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,640
Xu Jun.

288
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,360
Get lost.

289
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,240
Get lost.

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,520
Get lost.

291
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,240
Get lost.

292
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,640
One day, I'll be the only one

293
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,920
to burn your shop down.

294
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,600
Xiaowei.

295
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,480
Let's go.

296
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,480
You're a religious priest.

297
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,160
I'm here to buy you.

298
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,800
Go home.

299
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,840
As long as it's a good priest,

300
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,160
I believe he'll be righteous and shot down many法會坛

301
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,720
I'm willing to be an evil priest

302
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,240
who owns and is heyed by all the evil priests.

303
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,360
A good priest

304
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,280
will definitely be able to live anʻtheger

305
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
and grow as a等ился.

306
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,520
When the sun warmens the heart of a peer,

307
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,280
and start your own life under the sun.

308
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,960
Li Yan,

309
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,960
you have to be like her.

310
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,440
All right.

311
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:45,840
You,

312
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,760
carry her.

313
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,760
Give it to him.

314
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,120
Young Master,

315
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,040
why are you so nice to him?

316
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,920
Idiot.

317
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,560
If he's sick,

318
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,360
who will work?

319
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,520
Right.

320
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,720
You're a good young master.

321
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,600
You're thoughtful.

322
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,240
Go.

323
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,240
Okay.
