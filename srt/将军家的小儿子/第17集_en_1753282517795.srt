1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How ridiculous the world is

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,500
This blood-red sadness is full of justice

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
You are suffering from heartache and suffering alone

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,500
This scene is a taste of life

5
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full of difficulties and there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This blood-red sadness is full of justice

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat heart and make waves and break through the grass

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Abyss of Love

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 16

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The battle report said that the traitor Li Pu led the reinforcements

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,500
and defeated Bai Lan and Li Wan and Kuang Lan

12
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,000
He was promoted to the first general of the defense

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,860
But that was also the biggest change in the

14
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,000
last battle of Mount Jianwei

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Li Pu had no war plan and was on the run

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The general thought that he was young and unable to act

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He then took revenge and accused the general of betraying the country

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
While we were killing the enemy

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We killed the Zhongyong Army

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The wind is strong and the waves are strong

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The wind is strong and the waves are strong

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Dad, I remember

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yan'er, a man should be upright and upright

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and be upright and upright

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You should be proud of your father

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You should always remember what your father said

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I only later found out that that night

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Li Pu led the rebels and killed the Zhongyong Army

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Li Pu was the first general of the defense

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The officials praised him for being the chief of defense

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Just with your words, it's not enough to be trusted

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
As expected, Yan'er, you won't believe it

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I won't believe it

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't believe you

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is a big matter and involves a lot of effort

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I will investigate it clearly

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If what you said is true

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I will report it to the officials and clear your name

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But if you have a false word

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I, Chen Wang, swear here

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If there is a word that is not true

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I will be killed by the thunder

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Never survive

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Ok, I remember what you said

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Did you see the guard?

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't know where he went

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The teacher said there were a lot of people under the mountain

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This child won't

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, let's talk later

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yan'er

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Report

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Where are you?

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The soldiers of the capital died

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Siyu, damn it

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He is lying to me

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
My father is not that kind of person

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yan'er

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yan'er

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Qianyi, you stop me

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yan'er, you must calm down

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Qianyi, you forgot how you promised me

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yan'er

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The Ghost Valley is always mysterious

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Never contact with the outside world

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
How sure are you?

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Blood is still deep

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I must report it

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I am willing to die for the pain of fantasy

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Always the dragon is in the pool to protect the blood

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
One stroke to the bed

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But you

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Qianyi, I am determined

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Ok

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Maybe your family should not be dead

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Otherwise, I can't save you

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's destiny

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Your mother and I are like sisters

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I will help you

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Do you know this is suspicious

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I am afraid you will make a big mistake

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Kill my whole family and insult my father

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I will not take revenge and be a part of the Li family

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Qianyi, please give me some time

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let me check it out and make a decision

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What to check?

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You believe her eyes

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Believe my father is a traitor

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Believe those evil people

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
A little old story

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You are blinded by the marriage order

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What I said is a bad thing

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But think about it

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Impossible

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The old story is indeed suspicious

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The court is also investigating the old case

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Please ask you to take revenge

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let me check it out

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If he is really slandering Li Pu

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I will not be here

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I will not be here

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
My father taught me since childhood

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I am just and not evil

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I love my country

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He fought for the country and the people

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Now he is killed

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I am not dead

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I am useless

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Even if the moth is broken and the jade stone is broken

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I will kill the god of the sword

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yan, before this matter is investigated

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If you want to be alone

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Kill me first

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't think I dare not

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yan

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yan

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Now you know everything

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't need to hide it anymore

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You can tell Chen Dawa

119
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't want to

120
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Jianwei brother

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I never thought about telling the owner

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I know you have your own difficulties

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I hope you can let go of hatred

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Think more for yourself

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Myself

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I have no myself

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You still have us

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You

129
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You are my enemies

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Enemies

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
As a son

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But can't take the enemy

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
How do you let me deal with it

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Jianwei brother

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I want you all to be fine

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't want any of you to be in trouble

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If you have to take revenge

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I can give you my life

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I will do it

140
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Jianwei

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Where did you go

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I've been looking for you for a long time

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Little walrus

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What did you say you want to give him

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Nothing brother

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I said

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Give him the herbs you carry

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Really

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay brother

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I think you should think about yourself first

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This time you made such a big mess

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The owner must be angry

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I will take care of it

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
How can you be so heartless

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The old man went up the mountain

156
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I put everyone's life in my heart

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But almost

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The whole ghost valley was buried because of you

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What's the matter

160
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
They want to attack the mountain

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We can just beat them back

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You have a few good things

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't think you have a little bit of martial arts

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There is no law

166
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Will the old man protect you then

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Or did the flower tree block the arrow for you

168
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Don't underestimate people

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You think they live

170
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Is it a joke with you

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Today I will kill you

172
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I will kill you

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I will kill you

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I will kill you

175
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I will kill you

176
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Qianwei

177
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What are you doing

178
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I didn't find the persuasion in time

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Should be punished together

180
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Punish with the young master

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Qianwei

182
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is not your business

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The owner is so kind

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I should be filial

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Qianwei, go, go

186
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Xiaoan

187
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Shuzi

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Do you know who suffered for you today

189
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
For the sake of Qianwei

190
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Go to Wuzi tomb by yourself

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Punish for three days

192
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
At that moment

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Why can't I bear to see him punished

194
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yesterday, the fierce father taught me

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
how

196
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Today I found my conscience

197
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Punish with me

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Sometimes I really can't tell

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Which one is really you

200
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What are you doing

201
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Let me see if you are the same person

202
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Why are you reacting so much

203
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Boring

204
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Qingyi

205
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You were cheated by the thief

206
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Punish me

207
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I can only think of another way

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Drive you down the hill as soon as possible

209
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So that I can implement my plan

210
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Qianwei

211
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Li Xiangwei

212
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What are you staring at

213
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Maybe it's been a long time

215
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You don't have my experience

216
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Come

217
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Come up and walk

218
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Kneel later

219
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's okay

220
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I won't find it

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
it is good

222
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Qianwei, are you hungry

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Fortunately, I have prepared

224
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm hungry

225
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You used to have a hair style

226
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Put it on

227
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I know you still care about me

228
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But no need

229
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I can hold it

230
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Be good

231
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Good skin

232
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Look, there is a meteor

233
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Why are you standing here

234
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Go to the hospital

235
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Father, mother

236
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What was the truth twenty years ago

237
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Where should I go

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What is the purpose

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's not good to say it

240
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But it's about you

241
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Do you remember

242
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Our agreement in the White Flower Manor

243
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
If we can get out of here

244
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'll teach you Li Jiaqiang

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Then I will teach you Chen's way

246
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Unfortunately, there is no knife and gun here

247
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Why not

248
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Fold bamboo as a gun

249
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Fold branches as a knife

250
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Wuyi's knife

251
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Why bother

252
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You are right

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Li Jiaqiang

254
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Li Jiaqiang

255
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Chen Xiaoxi

256
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You are a little bit of a loser

257
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Unfortunately

258
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
We are still strangers

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
After this

260
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You won't blame me

261
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sorry

262
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sorry

263
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
