1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The earth is full of laughter

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,500
The blood is full of sorrow, the blood is full of justice

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
The old and new heartache is only being felt

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,500
This is the only song that I can sing

5
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full of darkness, there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The blood is full of sorrow, the blood is full of justice

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat the heart and make it cold, break the law and run away

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The love of our life is long but it will be end soon

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The Ghost Valley has always been mysterious

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It has never been in contact with the outside world

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How sure are you?

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The blood is full of sorrow, the blood is full of justice

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I am willing to take the pain of fantasy

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Even if it's a dragon's blood, it's a wall of justice

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But you...

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Qianyu, I have made up my mind

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Fine

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Maybe your family's fate is not decided

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Otherwise, I can't save you

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's destiny

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Your mother and I are like sisters

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I will help you

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I will help you

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're awake

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't worry, it's just some skin wounds

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I have applied the secret medicine of the Ghost Valley to you

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It should be fine soon

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you for saving my life

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
By the way, my name is Xiao He

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What's your name?

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Li Jianwei

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Li Jianwei?

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What a coincidence

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why are you like a mountain?

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Are you the one who was caught by my brother?

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But I heard you are a flowery man

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You are the sister of that man?

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But we are not siblings

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I was picked up by my brother from the wolf group

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No wonder you are so different

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We can't stay here for long

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You'd better go

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You can leave the mountain by the water

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Take the new clothes and go

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Go

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hello, master

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Hello, master

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Don't rush

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's just a bubble

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Damn it

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why is it him again?

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Give me some cotton

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's so hard to make the herb with the little walnuts

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'd rather take the opportunity to take your life

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Can you hear me?

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Are you deaf?

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Give it to me

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You are so stubborn

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Help me press it

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll see when you grow up

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I think the old man should take the old trouble

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He deserves it

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Shi Tou, we'll go to the mountain when the sun rises

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:47,240
But by then, the wolf may not even give him a

68
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,000
Look at us today

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We are so poor

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How dare you attack the young master

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Shut up

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Shi Tou

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Young master, don't come here

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Brother, let go of our young master

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It seems you can't go anywhere

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You are so despicable

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You are a thief

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You'd better be honest with me

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Let's go to see your master

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Brother, I'll take you there

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Leader man

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
temporarily

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
One person does what one person does

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Actually the young master took the troubles

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I will help him

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Do you hear me?

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I will do what I said

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,240
You want to see me?

90
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
This is our master.

91
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,120
If you have any requests, just ask.

92
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
Your Highness, leave him alone.

93
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,800
I'll kill him.

94
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,960
I'll send you to your death.

95
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,480
Wait.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,320
If you let Quan Zi go,

97
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,200
I, Your Highness, can guarantee

98
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,360
that I won't hurt you.

99
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,400
Let's see.

100
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,440
How can I trust you?

101
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,080
A man should be loyal to his country.

102
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,600
He can't be trusted.

103
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,880
You can leave.

104
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,080
Yes.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,400
I hope you can keep your word.

106
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,680
Of course.

107
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
It's not a trap.

108
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
I'm a man of my word.

109
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,280
I'll send you to your death now.

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,880
No.

111
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,160
No.

112
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,880
A man should be honest.

113
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,320
I, Lord Chen, will keep my word.

114
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,000
I won't kill innocent people.

115
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Even if I die,

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,720
I'll make you understand.

117
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,560
Kneel.

118
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,240
I think you look

119
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,920
extraordinary.

120
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,960
Since you're trying to enter the Ghost Valley,

121
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,960
you must have a plan.

122
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,720
Luckily, you opened the window and said something.

123
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,760
They have many people and many ways.

124
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,400
They can't be selfish.

125
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,640
Life and death are both good and bad.

126
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,200
I'm Li Jianwei.

127
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,320
I was a dancer when I was young.

128
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,160
I was unfortunate to die with my parents.

129
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,240
I was injured by a man who hung me up to watch the wind and water.

130
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,640
He hung you up to watch the wind and water.

131
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,160
Don't believe him.

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,080
I'm a man of my word.

133
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
I didn't lie.

134
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,520
So?

135
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,720
I saw the mountain,

136
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,400
the water and the medicine.

137
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,560
It must be a hidden treasure.

138
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,680
So,

139
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,720
I had to go up the mountain and grab the ground.

140
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,000
Grab the ground?

141
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,680
I'm afraid you have a misunderstanding.

142
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,840
We're all wild men.

143
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,800
The mountain is not a treasure.

144
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,240
There must be no place for you.

145
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,120
I respect you as a man.

146
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,960
You can go down the mountain tomorrow morning.

147
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,360
Chen Dawang, you're stupid.

148
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
You can't let him go down the mountain.

149
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,320
What if I have to stay?

150
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If so,

151
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
you should stay alive.

152
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,880
There must be a place for you

153
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,120
to stay when you see the mountain.

154
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,800
Shuzi.

155
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,520
You don't know how to go down the mountain.

156
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,840
You go down the mountain without telling me.

157
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,920
How dare you tie the saint back?

158
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,280
Have you realized your mistake?

159
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,440
Father.

160
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,280
I know my mistake, but I don't accept it.

161
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,080
I was fooled by him for a moment.

162
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,560
But I didn't make any trouble.

163
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,480
Then you still don't know your mistake.

164
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,360
We were together.

165
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,640
We almost didn't contact the outside world.

166
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,480
But you made such a big noise.

167
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,360
Why didn't you let me kill him?

168
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,120
But you let him go down the mountain?

169
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,240
He has a strange background.

170
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,760
His behavior is abnormal.

171
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,040
If you want to find out the truth,

172
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,800
you have to give up the mountain.

173
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,280
You just want to test

174
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,720
his sincerity and determination.

175
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,640
What if he really goes down the mountain?

176
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,720
I'll make him die faster.

177
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,640
The secrets of the Ghost Valley

178
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,120
can't be leaked out.

179
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,360
Really?

180
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,120
I thought you were old.

181
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,320
I've told you many times.

182
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,960
You need to calm down and think.

183
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,360
You act recklessly every day.

184
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,040
What if you make a mistake?

185
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,040
How can you

186
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,440
make up for the death?

187
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,320
The mountain is praying in the dream.

188
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,800
The wind blows through the ice.

189
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,400
