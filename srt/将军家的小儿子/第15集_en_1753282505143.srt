1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The candle burns, the shadow smiles, when will it end?

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The wind blows through the waves, the music is heard,

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the sound of the flute plays, the sound of the flute plays,

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the sound of the flute plays, the sound of the flute plays,

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the sound of the flute plays, the sound of the flute plays,

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the sound of the flute plays, the sound of the flute plays,

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the sound of the flute plays, the sound of the flute plays,

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the sound of the flute plays, the sound of the flute plays,

9
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:36,120
they

10
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,920
can the water

11
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,500
hello

12
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,460
The

13
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,020
Isn't this Qingyi's house?

14
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,180
Could it be that he saved us?

15
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,580
Chen Xiaoxi.

16
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,660
Chen Xiaoxi.

17
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,460
You're awake.

18
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,740
Master.

19
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,220
What are you doing here?

20
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,340
Chen Xiaoxi.

21
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,180
Chen Xiaoxi.

22
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,180
Chen Xiaoxi.

23
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,820
Chen Xiaoxi.

24
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
Chen Xiaoxi.

25
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,340
Chen Dawao.

26
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,700
Why are you here?

27
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,060
You're still too shy to say

28
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,700
that you asked you to come down the mountain to learn people.

29
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,380
But you lost yourself.

30
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,060
Don't blame me.

31
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,740
I really had an accident.

32
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,700
Jingwei.

33
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,060
Don't speak for him.

34
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,380
I'm not injured.

35
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,580
I'm protecting you.

36
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,740
Look at me.

37
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,940
My body hurts.

38
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,980
My whole body hurts.

39
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,020
It hurts.

40
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,420
Don't touch me.

41
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,180
It hurts.

42
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,180
Let go.

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,380
All right.

44
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,980
How do you know each other?

45
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,740
Chen Dawao.

46
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,060
Not bad.

47
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,900
Just friends.

48
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,140
It seems that you two are fine now.

49
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,820
You can rest for a few more days.

50
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,100
I'll find a way

51
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,900
to break the bond between you two.

52
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,500
It's weird.

53
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,620
How could Qingyi be friends with Chen Dawao?

54
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,460
What's wrong with you?

55
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,140
Go. Go. Go.

56
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,860
My stomach hurts. I need to go to the toilet.

57
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,780
Go by yourself.

58
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,580
Hurry up.

59
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,980
How can I go by myself?

60
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,260
Hurry up. Hurry up.

61
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,820
You're not dead.

62
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,420
Why do you need to go to the toilet when you wake up?

63
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,460
Do you want me to die?

64
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,420
I didn't say I wanted you to die.

65
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,820
You're not dead.

66
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,620
Chen Dawao.

67
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,900
These days,

68
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,260
you know I have many doubts in my heart.

69
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,660
But you never talk to me.

70
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,020
You don't trust me.

71
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,500
Yuan'er.

72
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,020
I trust you.

73
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,740
You should trust me, too.

74
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,700
When the time comes,

75
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,620
I'll tell you everything.

76
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,940
I'll tell you everything.

77
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,620
When the time comes?

78
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,900
When is the time

79
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,460
when you'll tell me everything?

80
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,660
You'll be gone for 20 years.

81
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,300
Do you want me to wait another 20 years?

82
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,180
What happened that year?

83
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,260
Why did you stay in the Ghost Valley

84
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,580
for 20 years?

85
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,220
What about the rumored

86
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,620
Ghost Valley criminals?

87
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,780
Why did Zhong Yongjun become a traitor overnight?

88
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,940
What happened to the Ghost Mountain?

89
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,300
When will you stop hiding from me?

90
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,300
About the Ghost Valley,

91
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,180
I won't bother you anymore.

92
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,100
The past

93
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,740
is gone.

94
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,340
These days,

95
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,260
I've never thought about it.

96
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,540
Please

97
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,380
don't compare yourself to me.

98
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,780
It's good to compare yourself to me.

99
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,620
Forget it.

100
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,420
I'd rather you die.

101
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,780
Now, the chess game is over.

102
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,020
The two black and white pieces are tied.

103
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,140
It's like a game of chess.

104
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,020
A game of chess is not a game of death.

105
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,740
In another perspective,

106
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,020
it may be a game of life.

107
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,020
In this case,

108
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,020
what's the worry?

109
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,580
You have to be steady this time.

110
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,620
Why not?

111
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,820
What's so fun about this stone?

112
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,020
Is it over or not?

113
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,780
Can I untie it?

114
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,140
I'm going to break down.

115
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,500
Qingyi,

116
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,740
let's play one more round.

117
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,220
Come on.

118
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,100
Qingyi,

119
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,740
you've found the key long ago.

120
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,860
This lock is built by the army.

121
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,500
I don't know why it appeared in the White Flower Manor,

122
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,780
but it's not difficult to untie it.

123
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,700
The army?

124
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,220
If so,

125
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,900
why didn't it untie it directly in the daytime?

126
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,700
Yan,

127
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,020
what's your plan now?

128
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,380
I think your feelings for them

129
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,420
are not fake.

130
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,700
They treat you

131
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,580
like a piece of stone.

132
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,340
No matter what,

133
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,620
I must revenge.

134
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,020
But I have to

135
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,460
figure out the whole story.

136
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,060
You can't open the lock

137
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,940
so easily.

138
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,060
We need to observe more.

139
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,340
This is an unexpected difficulty.

140
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,900
By the way, Qingyi,

141
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,700
why are you colluding with Chen Dawang?

142
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,220
He is...

143
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,420
It's not clear yet.

144
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,660
If I tell you his identity now,

145
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,820
it will only make the situation more chaotic.

146
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,420
I met him by chance in the martial arts world.

147
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,940
I didn't expect he would be your master.

148
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,340
You cancelled the action that day

149
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,420
because of him?

150
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,820
Don't worry.

151
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,740
If he really did something evil,

152
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,820
I won't stop you from revenge.

153
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,780
Qingyi,

154
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,220
there's one more thing.

155
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,860
Do you know

156
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,500
Wan Qianhong of Baihua Villa

157
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,180
is my father's old friend?

158
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,500
Wan Qianhong?

159
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,500
Yu Lipu?

160
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,140
No one knows it and won't know there is a black stirrup in it.

161
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,420
She is extravagant

162
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,460
and burnish.

163
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,780
When the fish goes code Dis一点

164
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,820
it will turn into stirrup and feel burned.

165
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,500
She is so good at armed battle 으

166
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,380
Next day again,

167
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,660
she would despise Yuanacterみたい

168
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,940
with her형

169
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,420
How awful she is.

170
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,020
I take a lesson from her for the past such a tough time.

171
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,020
Now that we fighting,

172
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
it's my time to applaud her.

173
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,340
As a junior,

174
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,820
I'll give you a toast.

175
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,420
Let's give her a toast.

176
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,820
Okay.

177
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,860
But last night,

178
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,340
I dreamed

179
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,340
an old immortal was dreaming.

180
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,220
Guess what he said to me in his dream.

181
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,980
What old immortal?

182
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,500
The old immortal who is in charge of the peace-making agency.

183
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,860
Such a treasure

184
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,020
is made of the northern sea crystal.

185
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,980
It's hard to open in the sky.

186
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,340
It's not strange to have a soul in my dream, right?

187
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,220
What did the old immortal tell you?

188
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,980
The old immortal told me

189
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,500
the key to the peace-making agency

190
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,260
is in a fox's room.

191
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,780
And the fox's room

192
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,220
is in

193
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,660
this yard.

194
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,300
As long as I find the fox's room,

195
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,580
I can open the agency.

196
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,980
Chen Xiaoxi, don't be ridiculous.

197
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,820
Qingyi, you almost forgot.

198
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,380
Let me give you a toast.

199
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,900
Chen Xiaoxi.

200
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
You're the old fox.

201
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,580
So you're the old fox.

202
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,380
What are you talking about?

203
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,300
Chen Xiaoxi, don't be ridiculous.

204
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,540
Apologize to Qingyi.

205
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,900
You found the key for the agency.

206
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,380
Why didn't you take it out?

207
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,420
You're so evil.

208
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,060
I think

209
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,700
there must be another reason.

210
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,340
So what if there is?

211
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,060
So what if there isn't?

212
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,500
You bastard.

213
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,340
Get out.

214
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,420
Shen Dao Wang.

215
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,900
You hit me for this fox.

216
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,300
Qiangwei, let's go.

217
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,100
You...

218
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,780
You're a bastard.

219
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,700
Don't take it to heart.

220
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,980
I know you're...

221
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,500
Forget it.

222
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,140
I just failed for a long time.

223
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,860
I'm not going to stay here.

224
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,620
What's the point of this woman?

225
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,860
I'm just like a stranger.

226
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,900
I thought I could cheat men

227
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,780
after a long time.

228
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,900
How could you slander Qingyi?

229
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,140
Who are you?

230
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,020
Are you being deceived by that woman?

231
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,620
Or are you hiding something from me?

232
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,660
What do you mean?

233
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,020
Nothing.

234
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,620
Just say it.

235
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,940
Why are you panicking?

236
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,500
Boring.

237
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,380
Qingyi escaped from us.

238
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,940
But you're so rude to her.

239
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,620
It's not a gentleman's doing.

240
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,740
Gentleman?

241
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,220
Li Qiangwei,

242
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,740
you're talking to me about gentlemen?

243
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,980
Fine, let me ask you.

244
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,540
Do you dare to swear to God

245
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,660
that you have nothing to hide from me?

246
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,380
I...

247
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,820
You don't dare, do you?

248
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,740
I swear to God

249
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,220
that if there's anything to hide from Chen Xiaoxi,

250
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,460
I'll...

251
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,100
Enough.

252
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
Just kidding.

253
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,460
Why are you being so serious?

254
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
Just live your life.

255
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,140
Your Majesty.

256
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,780
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,460
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,060
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,660
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,260
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,860
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,460
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,060
I'm sorry.

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,580
I'm sorry.

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,060
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

268
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,300
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,100
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,900
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,700
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,500
I'm sorry.

274
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,300
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,100

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,940
I'm sorry.

277
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,940
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,740

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,740
I'm sorry.

284
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,740
I'm sorry.
