1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How ridiculous the world is

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This blood-red sadness is full of blood

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You are suffering from heartache and suffering alone

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This sentence is not over yet

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The deep abyss is full of difficulties and there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This blood-red sadness is full of blood

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat the heart and move the waves to break through the grass

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A lifetime of wandering and looking forward to this morning

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who... who is holding me?

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Push... push

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Where is this?

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What is this?

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Love lock

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Crazy woman, you untie me

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Love lock loves life and death

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Unless one of them dies

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The other can regain freedom

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Since he doesn't want to kill you

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Then you two can kill each other

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Despicable

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Old woman, are you crazy?

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
By the way, your old lover mentioned you to me

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do you want to hear it?

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What did he say?

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So rude, how can I say it out loud?

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Or you come here

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Say it

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
My eyes

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My eyes

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You bad men, you lie to me

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Dead

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Dead

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
She was a beauty

39
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
She died, but she was so ugly

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
She probably hates us

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't know what you have to do with my father

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why do you hate him so much?

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Now I just hope you can lose the hatred of this life

44
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Master

45
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Master

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Little walnuts

47
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's the sound of little walnuts

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Little walnuts

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Little walnuts, how are you?

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Where are the young masters?

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How are you?

52
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Where are the young masters?

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Master, go save them

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Go save them

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Do you know where they are?

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Baihua mountain villa

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Master, go save them

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Where is this Baihua mountain villa?

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We never heard of it

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Little walnuts

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you know who the person who kidnapped you is?

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
His name is Wan Qianhong

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He is the owner of the Baihua mountain villa

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
By the way, he gave me this

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Little walnuts, you go

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I am not your mother

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You are not my daughter

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
My daughter died long ago

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I knew it from the beginning

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This gold lock was left for my daughter

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Now I give it to you

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Keep a memory

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Just consider it as the whole of our mother-daughter relationship

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What should I do?

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What is this place?

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Why does it seem to be here?

77
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's back to the original place

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Did I meet a ghost?

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm not leaving

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm not leaving

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Our master said he didn't know this

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Please go back

83
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Our master said he didn't know this

84
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Please go back

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yuan'er, are you still blaming me?

86
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Please tell me

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If your master doesn't want to come out to see me

88
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I will kneel down

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Please

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Please take a break

91
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There is no ghost god in the world

92
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There are five-star gossip hidden here

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's just that we can't see through it for a while

94
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Qianwei

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You said we were wise

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Won't you die here?

97
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If they come to familiarize us

98
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Will they recognize us as his male fans?

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Then we are too far away

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You talk nonsense again

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Believe it or not, I beat you

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Are you kidding?

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Qianwei, don't press me

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
My hand is numb

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I didn't press you

106
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What's going on?

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I guess I was poisoned when Wan Qianhong bit me

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Wake up, don't sleep

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We can go out soon

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We can go out soon

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Li Yan

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Are you here to lock me up?

113
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If you want to lock your life, then lock mine

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't lock the life of Jianwei

115
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It has nothing to do with him

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Chen Xiaoxi, wake up

117
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Don't talk nonsense

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
No one wants to lock your life

119
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You are all dead

120
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Qianwei

121
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's so dark

122
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I think you are full of hatred

123
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You will be separated from your family

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There will be bloodshed in ten years

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
In three days, the whole family will be destroyed

126
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's the saying

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You can't live by yourself

128
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You found this yourself

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why are you here?

130
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I am the one who can keep your family safe

131
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you like the taste of this wine?

132
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If you like it, I will give you more next year

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Remember what you said in Rong City

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The grudge after death should end here

135
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Since you have reported it

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why are you insulting him?

137
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Qianwei

138
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You are right

139
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The dust is dust, the soil is soil

140
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Let's end it all

141
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Chen Xiaoxi

142
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
How is it? Is it good?

143
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
There is no herb here

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I can only put your blood in first

145
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And push out the poison

146
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay

147
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Talk to me

148
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I am afraid I won't be able to wake up if I sleep

149
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay, you talk, I will listen

150
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You are so stubborn

151
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I will go to sleep

152
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I will go to sleep

153
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I will go to sleep

154
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You talk, I will listen

155
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You

156
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Is this a way to talk?

157
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I just dreamed of the five-character poem by Jian Weishan

158
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Five-character poem

159
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Didn't you ask about the story behind the five-character poem?

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Stop talking

161
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I am going out

162
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You tell me slowly

163
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
My father, my mother

164
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And the brothers of Jian Wenshan

165
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
They are all there

166
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Then why is there no name?

167
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Because there are too many people

168
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's hard to carve on the back

169
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So I left this back

170
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Chen Dan said

171
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Their names don't have to be carved on the back

172
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Should be written in the heart

173
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Written on the history book

174
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
History book

175
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You are a bad person, you won't understand

176
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
In the future

177
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What should I do if the brothers of the ghost valley lose Xiao Ye?

178
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Qian Wei

179
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If we really can't get out

180
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Do you have any wishes?

181
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes

182
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I have a must-do task

183
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Can you do it?

184
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't do it anymore

185
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What is it?

186
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What is it?

187
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No matter what your wish is

188
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You have to get out of here alive

189
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Otherwise, Xiao He will be sad

190
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Really?

191
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Qian Wei

192
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What do you think of Xiao He?

193
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He is kind, smart

194
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And handsome

195
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I think this girl is not normal to you

196
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Or you be my brother-in-law

197
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Take care of her for me in the future

198
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Do you have a brother like you?

199
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Whose sister, who takes care of you?

200
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Qian Wei

201
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I really want to go outside

202
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I want to go to Jiangnan to listen to the small car

203
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The light is ripe

204
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Eat the pot

205
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm afraid I can't go to these places

206
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You go for me in the future

207
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Chen Xiao Xi, stop talking

208
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm kidding

209
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Why is your ugly hair so ugly?

210
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I forgot that you have wounds on you

211
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Nothing good happens after I meet you

212
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Nothing good happens after I meet you

213
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You are the star of my life

214
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It seems that you didn't count yourself

215
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If we stay here

216
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Can't get out for a day

217
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I will be your friend for a day

218
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I want to be your friend for a lifetime

219
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I want to be your friend for a lifetime

220
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I want to be your friend for a lifetime

221
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
OK

222
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If we can get out of here

223
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I will teach you Li Jiaqiang

224
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
OK

225
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I will teach you Chen Jia Dao

226
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Then

227
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's a deal

228
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm hanging up

229
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I want to ask you one last thing

230
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You say

231
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If

232
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I mean if

233
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm dead

234
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You must take me back to Jianghuishan

235
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I will be in my own grave

236
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I will be in my own grave

237
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I will be in my own grave

238
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I will be in my own grave

239
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Xiao Xi

240
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
