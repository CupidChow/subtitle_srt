1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How ridiculous the world is

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This bloody sadness is full of blood

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You are suffering and suffering alone

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This sentence is not over yet

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full of difficulties and there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This bloody sadness is full of blood

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat the heart and act as a cold and rush to the end

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A life full of difficulties and there is nowhere to escape

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Abyss of Love

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
A'Xi, come here

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Madam

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Madam

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Come here

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Madam

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You caught me

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's my turn to catch you

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
A'Xi, where are you?

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm going to catch you

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Who is going to save me?

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't want to die

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
A'Xi

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This old woman, Jiang Wei

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't understand

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What's going on with you?

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A'Xi, I didn't expect you to play with me

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You are so good

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I like it

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Madam

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is it interesting to play with it?

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You are cute

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
A'Xi, I'm going to catch you

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
A'Xi, I caught you

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
A'Xi

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
A'Xi

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Am I good?

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In the past, Yang Guifei bathed in Huaqing Lake

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Today, you and I are in the Baihua Lake to take a break

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's really moving

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
A'Xi

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I can't wait

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It smells good

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Madam, you are not in the mood today

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sleepy after drinking

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm going to sleep

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The past is gone

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why?

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not in the mood

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm not in the mood

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
A'Xi

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What's the relationship between my father and Wan Qinghong?

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Why are you so stupid?

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm asking you

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Is Xiao Hao here?

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He should be

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What do you mean he should be?

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Did you find Xiao He?

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Is Xiao Hao here?

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
If he is, we should go

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This place is really not a place for people to stay

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I almost got carried away by that old woman

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This place is extraordinary

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
As I inferred

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Xiao He should be safe

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This place is like a ghost valley

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's hard to get in and out

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Besides, with Wan Qinghong's martial arts

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Even if you and I work together

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's hard to fight against it

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
As long as Xiao He is fine

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why did you come to such a ghost place?

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I think this place is not compatible with me

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I came here from the mountain

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,300
It's a

75
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,300
In my opinion, that lady is quite lucky

76
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,300
You don't have a bad mouth, do you?

77
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,300
What kind of lady is she?

78
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,300
She's almost my mother's age

79
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,300
This kind of woman must keep a distance

80
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,300
And you have to promise me one thing

81
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,300
What?

82
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
You know it

83
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Anyway, if you dare to say a word

84
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
I'll make you die

85
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Threaten me?

86
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
In my opinion

87
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
We should get Wan Qinghong first

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
I'll fall to death if I can't do anything

89
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Xiao He

90
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Xiao He

91
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
I brought you something

92
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Come and have a look

93
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
This is the chicken soup I made for you

94
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Try it

95
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Xiao He

96
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
I didn't mean to leave you here

97
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I just want to see you

98
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
I just

99
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Madam

100
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
What's wrong with you?

101
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Do you know?

102
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
You really look like my daughter

103
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
You look like my daughter

104
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
You look like my daughter

105
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
You look like my daughter

106
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
You look like my daughter

107
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
You look like my daughter

108
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
You look like her

109
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,900
You look like her

110
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
You look like her

111
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
You look like her

112
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
Even the bracelet you're wearing

113
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
Even the bracelet you're wearing

114
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
Is exactly like my daughter's

115
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
I picked this bracelet up from the woods when I was a child

116
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Did she misunderstand me as her daughter?

117
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,900
Did she misunderstand me as her daughter?

118
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,900
What about your daughter?

119
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Madam

120
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Don't be sad

121
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
I have no parents since I was a child

122
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,900
I have no parents since I was a child

123
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
Maybe

124
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
I'm your daughter

125
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Come here, your highness

126
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,900
I don't know what this old woman is up to

127
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
I don't know what this old woman is up to

128
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,900
I don't know what this old woman is up to

129
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,900
I'll put it in her wine

130
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,900
I'll put it in her wine

131
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
A Xi

132
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,900
A Xi

133
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,900
Today

134
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,900
Today I'll let you try the most fun game here

135
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,900
Today I'll let you try the most fun game here

136
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
Go

137
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Go

138
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Old rules

139
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
The loser

140
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
The loser will be the one who makes the flower fertilizer

141
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Are you ready?

142
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,900
The game is about to start

143
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,900
The first round of the game, start!

144
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
You're so stupid

145
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
The second round of the game, start!

146
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
It's you

147
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Then I

148
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
will treat you to grapes

149
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Continue, continue

150
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
I'm done, I'm done

151
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
I'm done, I'm done

152
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
I'm done, I'm done

153
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,900
You little naughty

154
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,900
You're going to die

155
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,900
I'll find a way to let them live

156
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
Continue, start!

157
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,900
A Xi, Jian Wei

158
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,900
A Xi, Jian Wei

159
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,900
You two are so kind

160
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
But in this world

161
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Not all kindness

162
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
will have good rewards

163
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,900
King of the Deceased, spare my life, I dare not

164
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,900
Looking at you

165
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
so cute

166
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
I'll give you a little punishment

167
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Then

168
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
beat you to death

169
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Great, great

170
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
I'm tired today

171
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
A Xi, Jian Wei

172
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
You drink with me

173
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Coming, coming

174
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
King of the Deceased, spare my life, I dare not

175
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
King of the Deceased, spare my life, I dare not

176
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
What are you still doing here

177
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Get out of here

178
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Yes

179
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Madam

180
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Madam, why are you so extreme

181
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Yes, madam

182
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
You, you're playing too crazy

183
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
You scared me

184
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Young people nowadays

185
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
really learned to

186
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
fish for fame

187
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Why are they

188
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
fooled by you

189
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
People are not grass

190
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Madam, you are too cruel

191
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
I'm cruel

192
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
So what

193
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
In this world

194
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
we are all weak

195
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Not to mention

196
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
In this Baihua Villa

197
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
I'm the only one who can talk

198
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
You two

199
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Don't think

200
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
you can

201
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
You can tell me

202
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
to die

203
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
You

204
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,900
You poisoned my wine

205
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,900
No

206
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
Madam, you're drunk

207
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,900
Say

208
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,900
Where is the antidote

209
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,900
No antidote

210
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,900
You let her go

211
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
She gave me the antidote

212
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Don't

213
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Don't give her the antidote

214
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Give it to me

215
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Okay, I'll give it to you

216
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Didn't you say you didn't want to give it to her

217
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
You'll die if I don't give it to her

218
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
This isn't the antidote

219
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
You're

220
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
despicable

221
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
You almost killed Xiao Ye

222
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
How can you not use any tricks

223
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
She's poisoned

224
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
She won't last long

225
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
I think we should go find Xiao He first

226
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Madam, please

227
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Xiao He

228
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Why are you here

229
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Madam, I just saw

230
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
dead people

231
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
in the garden

232
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
I'm scared

233
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Xiao He, be good

234
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Don't be afraid, it's not clean here

235
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
I'll send you back to your room

236
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
I'll send you back to your room

237
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Today, for my daughter's sake

238
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
I'll spare you

239
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Go

240
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Madam, what's wrong with you

241
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Are you okay?

242
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Madam, what's wrong with you

243
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Madam

244
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400

245
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
