1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How ridiculous the world is

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,500
This blood-red sadness is full of justice

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
You are suffering from heartache and suffering alone

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This sentence is not over yet

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full of difficulties and there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This blood-red sadness is full of justice

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat the heart and make it cold and break the law and grass

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A girl's life is full of difficulties and there is nowhere to escape

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Abyss of Love

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're here to steal the garlic?

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
At least we are brothers

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why didn't you tell me when you left?

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What did you say? I can't hear you

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Thank you for coming to see me off

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Tianzhuang

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Tianzhuang

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yan'er

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't go, Yan'er

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yan'er

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Did your mother tell you why she named you Li Yan?

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yan'er

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So this is the reason why you had to suffer

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You are really my child

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I knew all this

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Xiaoqi, take off your clothes

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hurry

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What's wrong?

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Qianwei is General Chen's aunt

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And Xiaoqi is the son of the Li family who was wronged

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry, Wan Niang

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry, General Chen

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You are their child

35
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Impossible

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Impossible

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This is not real

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm not

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
How could I be?

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Impossible

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You are lying to me

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Tian Xiaoqi

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You are all lying to me

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Tian Xiaoqi

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Calm down

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Listen to me

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't want to see you

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What are you going to do?

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Isn't it just an identity?

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Isn't it just an identity?

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's so strange

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I've been hiding in the Ghost Valley for more than 20 years

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Just to avenge my father

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Now you tell me

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
My father became my enemy

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Isn't it just an identity?

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Then you tell me now

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Who am I?

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Who am I?

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you remember?

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You asked me the same question

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Who are you?

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes, you still don't dare to say it?

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Who are you?

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I was killed by the sword 20 years ago

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Zhou Yongjun

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I was killed by the sword 20 years ago

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Zhou Yongjun

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Killed by the sword

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Zhou Yongjun will become a good son

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What about you?

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Who are you?

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I am Li Jianwei

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You are yourself

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No one needs to give you an identity

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You are Chen Xiaoqi

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The young master of the Ghost Valley

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He is my friend

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Live as you want

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But how do you let me face all this?

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
How do you let me face it?

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
My father is a traitor

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I killed him myself

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And those dead soldiers of the Zhou Yongjun

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I killed Xiao He

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I almost killed you

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I am guilty

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I am guilty

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I am guilty

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Chen Xiaoqi

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We are friends

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We are brothers

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We can face it together

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Not to mention

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's not your fault

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Who is to blame?

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Is it the evil world?

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Li Jianwei

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Now I

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't deserve to be your friend

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let me go

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Chen Xiaoqi

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Come out

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Chen Xiaoqi

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Chen Xiaoqi

108
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Where are you?

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Come out

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Chen Xiaoqi

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Come out

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Chen Xiaoqi

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Chen Xiaoqi

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Where are you?

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Chen Xiaoqi

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We are all very happy

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Chen Xiaoqi

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Come out

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Chen Xiaoqi

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Chen Xiaoqi

121
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is the general

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Your father left it to you

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Father

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Mother

125
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yan'er

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I know you can't accept it for a while

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The general knows it all

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't want to see you like this

129
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Did you find him?

130
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I found him

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I found him

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I found him

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I found him

134
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I found him

135
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I found him

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I found him

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I found him

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I found him

139
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I found him

140
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I found him

141
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I found him

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I found him

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I found him

144
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I found him

145
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I found him

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I found him

147
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I found him

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I found him

149
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I found him

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I found him

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I found him

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I found him

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I found him

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I found him

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I found him

156
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I found him

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I found him

158
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I found him

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I found him

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I found him

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I found him

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I found him

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I found him

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I found him

165
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,600
He's the half man

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't drop bad money

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I will

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,980
Unknown

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,280
Company commander

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Find out

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,720
I can't see how much the earth is laughing

172
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,120
This snowy and sad snowy road

173
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,960
You said you were in pain

174
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,280
This scene is a taste of life

175
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,440
Deep and deep, you can't get out of it

176
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,800
This snowy and sad snowy road

177
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,600
What are you doing

178
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,400
I'm sorry

179
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,320
I'm sorry

180
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm sorry

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,880
Young girls, the heart of the youth

182
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,240
are exhilarating

183
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,700
My heart flutters

184
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,440
Till morning

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,500
Cheng Xiao Xi!

186
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,440
Stop!

187
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,360
Cheng Xiao Xi!

188
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,920
With such little skills,

189
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,060
will you hide like this for the rest of your life?

190
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,320
From now on,

191
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,600
learn to live in the darkness.

192
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,960
You'll be safe there.

193
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,640
Let...

194
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,360
Let me go.

195
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,640
Cheng Xiao Xi!

196
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,320
Let me go!

197
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,200
colder now!

198
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,460
I won't

199
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,600
offend you again.

200
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,800
I'll live in the darkness forever.

201
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,920
Xiang Wei,

202
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,400
you don't understand.

203
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,480
I have no choice.

204
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,640
Who says you have no choice?

205
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,680
You can decide for yourself

206
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,720
what kind of person Chen Xiaoxi wants to be.

207
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,880
But fate doesn't count.

208
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,720
Then fight with the sky.

209
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,360
We can't decide our birth,

210
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,360
but we can control our life.

211
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,720
Chen Xiaoxi I know

212
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,160
has always been

213
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,360
you.

214
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,480
But...

215
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,680
But I'm a disloyal father.

216
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,840
So what?

217
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,720
She is her.

218
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,920
You are you.

219
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,240
You are not loyal.

220
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,720
You are disloyal and ungrateful.

221
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,920
People will only marry you.

222
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,840
Don't comfort me.

223
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,160
I'm telling the truth.

224
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,120
And

225
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,200
we have promised

226
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,200
to be good friends for life.

227
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,040
What's the point of running away?

228
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,200
You can't be heartless.

229
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,360
For life.

230
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
For life.

231
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,720
But...

232
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,040
No buts.

233
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,680
But

234
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,920
in this life,

235
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,240
we will encounter many things.

236
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,720
I have this light in my hand.

237
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,480
Look.

238
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
It's dark and dark.

239
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,600
But it's the way to move forward.

240
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,880
The darkness behind us.

241
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,680
We face it calmly.

242
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,920
The road ahead

243
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,000
is nothing to fear.

244
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,200
Why should I beematy

245
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,400
the leaf and steak?

246
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,400
Flowing in the mountains,

247
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,360
asking for the photogenic sessions,

248
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,160
is it not worth resteath

249
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,600
to serve you,

250
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,600
to cherish your beauty?

251
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,200
A sharp sword in my eyes,

252
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:54,720
excuses my
