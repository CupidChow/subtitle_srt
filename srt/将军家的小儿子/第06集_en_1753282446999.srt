1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How ridiculous the world is

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,500
The snow is soft and the north is long, the snow is full of bow and arrow

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
The old and the new are in pain, the loneliness is in the shoulder

4
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
This is the end of life, the abyss is full

5
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,000
The south is hard to build, there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,500
The snow is soft and the north is long, the snow is full of bow and arrow

7
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat the heart and make the waves, break the waves and run

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The snow is soft and the north is long, the snow is full of bow and arrow

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Snow Flows

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 2

11
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
I just came to see how capable you are

12
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,000
In case you get into trouble and get the whole Gui Valley

13
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,500
It seems that you don't believe me

14
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I'm not afraid of you

15
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
You can't be so stubborn

16
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,500
If you can't, you can take advantage of the situation

17
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
I'll protect you later

18
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Shut up

19
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,500
You are not good at coming

20
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Since you are here, come out

21
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
He really came

22
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
He really came

23
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
I'm looking for you today

24
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
He said he was looking for you

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
No, he's looking for you

26
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
The Snow Flows

27
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Yan'er is kind

28
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Those thieves are hidden

29
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
I'm afraid it's not as simple as he thought

30
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Today in the forest, someone followed the young master

31
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,500
I thought they sent the young master to kill people

32
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Must be a trap

33
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Siyu

34
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Here

35
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Go to Rong City and meet the young master

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Qiangwei

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Qiangwei

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Qiangwei, how are you?

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't worry about me

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's really important

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Stop talking nonsense

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let me see your wound

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No, it's bleeding

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We have to stop the bleeding

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Who saved us just now?

47
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
We

48
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
It's news from the Ghost Valley

49
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Look

50
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Qiangwei

51
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Qiangwei

52
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Qiangwei

53
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Qiangwei

54
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Qiangwei

55
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Qiangwei, how are you?

56
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Are you okay?

57
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Qiangwei

58
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
You

59
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
You

60
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Stop talking

61
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
I'll take you to Rong City

62
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
I'll take you to Rong City to find a doctor

63
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Come on, get up

64
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,500
It turns out that I am the one you want to kill

65
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Ridiculous Chen Xi

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Chen Xiaoxi

67
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
You wait

68
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
I must let you all go

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Xue Chen Xicheng

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Qiangwei, Xie Chen Shu

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Go to hell

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Go to hell

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Qiangwei

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Qiangwei, how are you?

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Are you okay?

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's my fault

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm going to find you a doctor

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Your leg is hurt

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't worry

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Qiangwei

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's okay

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It doesn't matter

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Qiangwei

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Let's rest a little

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I told you, don't care about me

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You go

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Go

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Qiangwei

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Don't worry

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I won't leave you

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't come over

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If you come over again, I'll kill you

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You calm down

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's all my fault

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's go to the doctor first, okay?

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Find a doctor

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Then you ask him

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If the seed is bad

99
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
But it can be eaten

100
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Can be eaten

101
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Sorry

102
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
We are going down the mountain to buy new ones

103
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
I'll feed you this time

104
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Okay?

105
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Come

106
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Doctor

107
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Doctor, are you okay?

108
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Doctor, come out and save people, doctor

109
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Doctor

110
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
My friend is hurt

111
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Come out

112
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Are you okay?

113
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Come out, doctor

114
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Doctor, open the door

115
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Come out

116
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Doctor, come on

117
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Doctor, I beg you

118
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Come out

119
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
I beg you

120
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Come out

121
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
My friend is seriously hurt

122
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Why are you in such a hurry?

123
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
You are pregnant

124
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
And your family is dead

125
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Didn't you see it raining so hard?

126
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Doctor, my friend is seriously hurt

127
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
He is seriously injured

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
My friend is seriously injured

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Please save him

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Is he dead?

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Not dead

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Come back tomorrow

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Save me

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Little bastard

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You beg me to save people

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You threaten me

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you kill me

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You just wait to clean up for him

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Please

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Save him

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Forget it

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Get up

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I think you are also a person of great love

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You just help him in

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you, doctor

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm sorry

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sorry

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sorry

156
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Qiangwei, get up

157
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Who would have thought

158
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
General Li has been fighting for his life

159
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
But after he told the people

160
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
He ended up like this

161
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
If he died for the country and the people

162
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
He is dead

163
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
General died for the country and the people

164
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
He died for ten years

165
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
He can return to his hometown

166
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
But some people

167
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
They didn't even have a body

168
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
They even carried a life

169
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,500
I'm grateful to you for staying with me

170
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
I will help you find out the truth

171
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
To clear my father's name

172
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Get up

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We are both from the same country

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There is no need to do this

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
How is Young Master?

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
He has been injured

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He just got badly injured yesterday

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But you don't have to worry

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He is fine now

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I tried to contact him

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And let him come here to discuss

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Since the Li family's case of closing down the family

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Has nothing to do with the Ghost Valley

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The Supervision Bureau will not sit back and do nothing

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We are ready to

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Come to the end

187
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
To the end

188
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Yes

189
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Did he take care of me all night?

190
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
This is a good move

191
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's just that last night was a clear day

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I almost got caught in the trap

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Fortunately, there was no danger

194
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Didn't expect

195
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The people you want to kill

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Are standing in front of you

197
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll send you on the road first

198
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Qiangwei

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You are awake

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Do you want some water?

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll pour it for you

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's a little cold

203
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
I'll get you a hot cup

204
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
No need

205
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
How is your leg?

206
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
It's fine

207
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Just a small injury

208
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
If you don't believe me, I'll walk for you

209
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
No need

210
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Thank you for yesterday

211
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
But

212
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
The person in the shabby temple

213
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Do you know the origin?

214
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Maybe some gangsters

215
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
When you see a little rich

216
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
You want to take advantage of the fire to rob

217
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Is it?

218
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
That man's martial arts are not below you and me

219
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Are you sure it's just a thief?

220
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Then you have to ask him

221
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
But

222
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Why did you save yourself yesterday?

223
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
I

224
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
I ran into the ghost valley

225
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
I will naturally find the young master

226
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Just the young master

227
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Last night was attacked by a strong enemy

228
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But I just stood there and stayed

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Not like before

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We still have a task to do

231
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If it is not done by chance

232
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm afraid it will delay

233
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,500
The task given by the king of Chen

234
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So it is

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Just didn't expect

236
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Rong City

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There is such a skilled thief

238
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Stop talking

239
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Are you hungry?

240
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I have cooked for you several times

241
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Go to eat

242
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
I'm hungry

243
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
I'm hungry

244
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
I'm hungry

245
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
I'm hungry

246
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I'm hungry

247
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
I'm hungry

248
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
I'm hungry

249
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
I'm hungry

250
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
I'm hungry

251
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I'm hungry

252
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
I'm hungry

253
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
I'm hungry

254
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
I'm hungry

255
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I'm hungry

256
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
I'm hungry

257
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I'm hungry

258
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
I'm hungry

259
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
I'm hungry

260
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I'm hungry

261
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
I'm hungry

262
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
I'm hungry

263
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
I'm hungry

264
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
I'm hungry

265
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
