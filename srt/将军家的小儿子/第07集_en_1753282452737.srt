1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The candle burns, the shadow smiles, when will it end?

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The wind blows through the waves, the music is heard,

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,860
the sound of the flute, the flow of the strings, the

4
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,380
curious and previous twists, When 5 chimes are sounding,

5
00:00:52,380 --> 00:01:02,820
the snow prophetess news to me with electric

6
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:10,540
fan

7
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,600
the days are away after going to look for the

8
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,800
shadow brandishing the also

9
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,640
Ko clang my Insignia

10
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,400
Terfur Gang

11
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:46,080
Janto

12
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,360
Cheers.

13
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,200
It's Qingyi.

14
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
If I contact her now,

15
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,440
I'll have to find a way to get her.

16
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,720
Is Lord Chen here?

17
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,240
What I just did was a delusion.

18
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,760
If I leave now,

19
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,960
she'll suspect me.

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,360
This dish...

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,920
This dish...

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,720
This dish is awful.

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,240
Maybe it's been heated too many times.

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,840
I'll go to the street to buy some snacks.

25
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,360
Qian Wei,

26
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,280
what were you talking about?

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,400
I don't have much appetite.

28
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,120
You can go by yourself.

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,440
Okay.

30
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,600
I'll bring you some delicious food.

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,280
Let me see.

32
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,440
Chief.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,200
Follow me.

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,920
Where to?

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,040
Do you want to go to see Qian Wei?

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,960
No need.

37
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,240
Young Master.

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,000
Young Master.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,520
Go.

40
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,480
Your Highness,

41
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,680
you can test him.

42
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,960
Why did you hurt him?

43
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,760
How can I

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,640
kill him without blood?

45
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,120
But he risked his life to save me.

46
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,680
I even set him up.

47
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,840
What kind of brother is he?

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,440
Enough.

49
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,720
Since he has been tested,

50
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,440
he deserves to be trusted.

51
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,520
He will tell you after he's done.

52
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,800
Now the most important thing

53
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,560
is to kill the thief

54
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,160
to save the future.

55
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,760
We must get rid of him this time.

56
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,320
But...

57
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,760
But what?

58
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,280
We must involve Jian Wei.

59
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,560
After all,

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
he has nothing to do with Li Yan.

61
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,640
Xiao Xi,

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,560
the situation should be important.

63
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,280
Don't be a womanizer.

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,280
He has nothing to do with Li Yan.

65
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,280
He has to make the decision.

66
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,400
But...

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,040
But what?

68
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,720
Let's go.

69
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,600
Your Highness, Young Master.

70
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,680
He's really a man of his word.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,640
What?

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,680
It's just a face.

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,120
He's the dead man

74
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,160
in the Great Jade City.

75
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,800
Don't worry, Young Master.

76
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,080
I've given him the medicine

77
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,080
and he's been treated.

78
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,160
Yan, come and have a rest.

79
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,600
Yan,

80
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,160
I have a good gift for you.

81
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,080
A gold silk soft armor?

82
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,040
Father, I don't need it.

83
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,000
Just keep it.

84
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,280
If you're in danger,

85
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,480
it'll help you.

86
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,880
Thank you, Father.

87
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,920
Father, you're a man of your word.

88
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,000
Let me help you.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,560
Yan.

90
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,800
Yan.

91
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,480
Yan.

92
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,280
Qingyi.

93
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,440
What's wrong?

94
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,280
It seems that

95
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,360
the woman behind this matter

96
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,120
has slandered our family.

97
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,440
TheseRight 💩- 💩- exploded

98
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,640
all out of ACP's trap.

99
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,400
Your Highness,

100
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,520
we've found out

101
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
that they'd use it

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
to block the vent.

103
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,560
We're on the trigger.

104
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Either we make a move

105
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,400
or we'll get killed.

106
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,960
Qingyi.

107
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,240
Yan, what's the matter with you?

108
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,280
Get up.

109
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,920
It's just a fallacy.

110
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,480
Only when we have the enemy,

111
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,760
we can get away with it.

112
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,600
We can't even defend the Sword Guards.

113
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
I'd like to see

114
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,760
who these evil thieves are.

115
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,360
According to the people of Rong City,

116
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,200
after Li's son escaped from the death,

117
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
he was raised by Xu Qiu.

118
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,280
He returned to the old house a few days ago.

119
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,880
He will be sealed in the capital later.

120
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,240
We don't have much time left.

121
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,400
Then we have to act quickly

122
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,680
to avoid long dreams.

123
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,280
Goodbye.

124
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,160
Jian Wei, look who's here.

125
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,320
Greetings, Master.

126
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,960
Why are you here?

127
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,440
Are you afraid that I'm not doing my job well?

128
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,320
No, no.

129
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,440
Your Highness.

130
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,440
Jian Wei,

131
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,720
things are getting a little complicated.

132
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,560
We need to act quickly.

133
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,080
I'm here to help you.

134
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,480
I heard that you were hurt

135
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,320
to save Young Master.

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,480
How are you feeling?

137
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,880
Are you feeling better?

138
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,840
Thank you, Master.

139
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,920
I'm fine now.

140
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,920
If you take the action this time,

141
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,120
we will win.

142
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,440
We plan to act tonight.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,480
Jian Wei, what do you think?

144
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,400
Okay.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Get ready now.

146
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,200
It's time.

147
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,680
Chen Xiaoqi.

148
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,280
Jian Wei, what's wrong?

149
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,720
Forget it.

150
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,320
Nothing.

151
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,840
Jian Wei,

152
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,600
are you feeling unwell?

153
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,320
If you're not feeling well, don't go.

154
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm fine.

155
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,080
I'm fine.

156
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,680
I know.

157
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,160
You must be nervous.

158
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,120
Jian Wei,

159
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,400
you just need to go to the investigation with us.

160
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,960
I'll take care of the dangerous things.

161
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,840
Don't worry.

162
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,520
I won't hurt you again.

163
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
We've known each other for a long time.

164
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Do you have any wishes?

165
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,120
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

166
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,400
Speaking of wishes,

167
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,440
there are many.

168
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,440
I want to go to the outside of Jian Wei.

169
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,360
I want to go to places I've never been before.

170
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,840
I want to eat a lot of delicious food.

171
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,360
I want to see pretty girls.

172
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,760
I want to find a good husband for Xiao He Tao.

173
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,320
If you put it this way,

174
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,160
I can't finish my wish in three days and three nights.

175
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,640
Qian Wei,

176
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,080
when all this is over,

177
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll take you there.

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,640
I'm leaving.

179
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm sorry for the trouble.

180
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,520
Let's go, Jian Wei.

181
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,640
According to our plan,

182
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,480
when the two of us meet,

183
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:23,380
they'll

184
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,440
meet up.

185
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,400
Bo Wei,

186
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,000
come here.

187
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,880
Come on.

188
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,520
Yes.

189
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,240
Princess, are you all right?

190
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,840
It's too quiet.

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,880
There might be a strange situation.

192
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,360
Please be careful.

193
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,000
Your Highness, there are rebels outside.

194
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,800
Be careful of ambushes.

195
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,440
It seems that they are ready

196
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,120
to use a trick

197
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,280
to kill Li Yan.

198
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,200
Yes.

199
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,360
Be careful.

200
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,000
Princess, it's time.

201
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,720
Siyu.

202
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,920
Retreat.

203
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,280
Siyu.

204
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,040
I'm afraid there are many people involved in this.

205
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,000
Cooperate with Young Master for now.

206
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,000
Don't let him reveal his identity.

207
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,720
Yes.

208
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,080
I'll help Young Master complete the assassination.

209
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,960
Big Brother.

210
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,760
We can use fire.

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,720
You go to help Jian Wei.

212
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,160
Get out.

213
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,040
Okay.

214
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,560
Young Master, be careful.

215
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,480
Go ahead.

216
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,220
Gotta go.

217
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,880
Let me carry you to the morgue.

218
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,160
Just give me the key larger.

219
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,680
Okay, decide.

220
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,860
Qianwen.

221
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
Get more breakfast for two people.

222
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,520
Yes.

223
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,320
Let's go.

224
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,760
Xiaowei.

225
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,520
Xiaowei.

226
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,400
Tonight, you'll be our first enemy.

227
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,560
From now on,

228
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
I'll be your brother.

229
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,960
Sit.

230
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,920
Today,

231
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,560
you've worked hard.

232
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,640
Come on.

233
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,720
Who killed him?

234
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,800
Why did you lie to me that he was a horse thief?

235
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,920
To be honest,

236
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,560
he's the son of General Li Pu,

237
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,680
Li Yan.

238
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,000
Why did you kill him?

239
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,680
Why?

240
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,640
Because he's the son of Li Pu,

241
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,880
he deserves to die.

242
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,040
Li Pu is a secret man.

243
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,080
He killed a man of high rank.

244
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,280
He's a vicious man.

245
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,240
What kind of general is he?

246
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,120
It's a big joke.

247
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,520
I wish I could kill him.

248
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,120
He Kevin.

249
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,440
iPhone 11?

250
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,240
The bread character of the three colored lanterns can't be written,

251
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,520
but the rim Aut年前,

252
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,760
The emperor broke the shield.

253
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,240
The《 Apartments прவerne zone 》

254
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,440
War heroes第三 watching the highway out.

255
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,760
Lao 백신 doesn't last,

256
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,240
so the太后肯成为议员,

257
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,440
and only allow the早上倒下,

258
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,360
yet suspect her to be taxpayers.

259
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,720
and talk about loyalty.

260
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,280
What does it have to do with the young man?

261
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,840
Did he hurt others?

262
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,840
As the saying goes,

263
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,440
a father owes his son a long life.

264
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,080
The price

265
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,200
should be paid.

266
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,880
Xiao Wei.

267
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,560
You're not a good daughter.

268
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,560
You're not a good daughter.

269
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
You're not a good daughter.

270
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,560
You're not a good daughter.

271
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
You're not a good daughter.

272
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
You're not a good daughter.

273
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
You're not a good daughter.

274
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
You're not a good daughter.

275
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
You're not a good daughter.

276
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
You're not a good daughter.

277
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
You're not a good daughter.

278

You're not a good daughter.

287
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560

You're not a good daughter.

291
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,760
The world is full of blood and wounds.

292
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Life and death are hard to tell.

293
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
The great master fell from the green hill.

294
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
He prayed in his dream.

295
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,760
The wind blew past the ice.

296
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,760
How could the world be silent?

297
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,760
The war never ends.

298
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,760
The grudge never ends.

299
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,760
The world is full of blood and wounds.

300
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,760
The great master fell from the green hill.

301

The wind blew past the ice.

303
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
The great master fell from the green hill.

304
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
The grudge never ends.

305
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
The war never ends.

306
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
The great master fell from the green hill.

307
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
The grudge never ends.
