1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The earth is full of laughter

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,500
The blood is full of sorrow, the blood is full of justice

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
The old and new heartache is suffering alone in the sword

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,500
This is the taste of life

5
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,000
The abyss is full of darkness, there is nowhere to escape

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The blood is full of sorrow, the blood is full of justice

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Eat the heart, turn it into a cold, break through the dark and grass

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The love of the past is still vivid, but it is too late to be forgotten

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Legend of Chusen

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I bless Yan'er to be safe

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Princess, are you alright?

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yan'er is in danger alone

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If something bad happens, the only blood left in Li family will be broken

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Rumours say that 20 years ago, the Ghost Valley was full of evil people

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But they have been gone for years

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Now it's strange to go back to the underworld

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Why did the court suddenly find out about this old case?

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't know

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This is all because of you

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What do you think about?

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll kick you out if you want to go

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ok

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's my fault

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,840
I'll send you down the mountain.

27
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,960
A man's word is hard to follow.

28
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,480
I'll keep this valley.

29
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,000
Come on, sit down.

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,800
Listen to me.

31
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,000
There's no outsider here.

32
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,080
Don't be shy.

33
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,840
I'll send you down the mountain myself.

34
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,680
No one dares to stop me.

35
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,280
If you don't remember,

36
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,840
you can stay for two more days.

37
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,960
When you've thought it through,

38
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,000
you can go down the mountain.

39
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
I've made up my mind.

40
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,360
You don't have to persuade me.

41
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,640
Even if I die,

42
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I'll never leave you.

43
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,320
Jian Wei,

44
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,880
we're brothers.

45
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,120
Why don't you reconsider?

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,200
It's pointless to say more.

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,840
Jian Wei,

48
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,200
we used to be without grudges,

49
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,160
but we've been together for a long time.

50
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,320
It's great to make friends.

51
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,160
If you really have any difficulties,

52
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,280
you can tell me directly.

53
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,640
As long as I can do it,

54
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
I'll do whatever I want.

55
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,480
Really?

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,480
Of course.

57
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,080
I always say it.

58
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,080
I'm staying.

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,200
Okay.

60
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,280
You have the guts.

61
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,640
I'll give you a toast.

62
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,720
Shi Tou.

63
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,560
Since you want to stay,

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,920
drink this bowl of wine,

65
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,720
we're brothers.

66
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,480
How is it?

67
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,280
Do you like the taste of this wine?

68
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,640
If you like it,

69
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,640
I'll give you two more bowls of wine next year.

70
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,600
You have to be steady when you're down.

71
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,880
You have to be accurate when you're up.

72
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,080
Yan Er,

73
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,080
don't be angry.

74
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,520
People are dangerous.

75
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,800
There are battles everywhere.

76
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,200
Remember,

77
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,640
no matter when and where,

78
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,240
even if you're in a desperate situation,

79
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,080
don't give up easily.

80
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,280
Okay.

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,440
What?

82
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,280
You're giving her the medicine?

83
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,360
I don't know what Shen Dan Wang is thinking.

84
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,440
Why did he change the poison wine?

85
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,480
Brother,

86
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,240
the valley master has his own reason.

87
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,880
Besides,

88
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,160
I don't think Jian Wei is a bad person.

89
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,040
Yes.

90
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,760
If he's not a bad person, I am.

91
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,440
If you didn't run around when the previous one went down the mountain,

92
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,360
how could I have met him?

93
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,080
Brother, don't say that.

94
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,720
Maybe

95
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,600
this is your fate.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,360
Okay, I won't talk to you anymore.

97
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,560
The medicine is cold.

98
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,280
Wait.

99
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,040
I'll give you the medicine.

100
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,760
Just take it as an apology.

101
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,400
Then be polite to her.

102
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,760
Don't worry.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,840
I'll take good care of her.

104
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,920
Go back.

105
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,040
Let's go.

106
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,280
Go.

107
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,200
Li Xiang Wei,

108
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
my father, a man who respects you,

109
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,000
agreed to let you stay for now.

110
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,240
From today on,

111
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,240
you're my man.

112
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,640
This is...

113
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,560
I made the medicine for you.

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,720
Drink it.

115
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,280
Please make the medicine for me.

116
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,160
He isn't a good person.

117
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,160
You may leave now.

118
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,200
I think this fief has too many materials

119
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,460
he can't handle alone.

120
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,200
Some of them can he make enem Ã¼berall?

121
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,600
Some people may even kick this globalization

122
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,600
to make many people strengthening.

123
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,920
That's it.

124
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,800
I just gotta talk to him in private,

125
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,560
go back home and talk with Wen Shuai.

126
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,600
I think

127
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,560
you spells my name here,

128
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,840
You're my man.

129
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
I made this medicine for you.

130
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,040
Drink it.

131
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,040
What are you looking at?

132
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,440
Don't drink it if you're afraid of death.

133
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,160
I believe in you,

134
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,880
but...

135
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,000
But what?

136
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm afraid I can't stand

137
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,840
your kindness.

138
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,440
Do you want me to feed you?

139
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
Don't be so rude.

140
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,000
If so,

141
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,880
I'll take this medicine.

142
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,600
Li Jiawei, you...

143
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,880
Wait for me.

144
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,880
Li Jiawei.

145
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,520
Brother.

146
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,440
What are you doing?

147
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,920
What are you looking at?

148
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,160
If you don't work hard,

149
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,280
you'll be in trouble.

150
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,440
He did this

151
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,680
to make me leave in a difficult situation.

152
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,680
With only one sword,

153
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,840
the most difficult to confirm

154
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,440
that the bandits are the Black Cloak Man.

155
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,680
But they can't escape the danger.

156
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,800
Now I have to think of a way

157
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,520
to investigate carefully.

158
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,320
I hope do believe in me.

159
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,680
Brother, disappear.

160
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,120
But this is very important.

161
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,480
I want to arrive at the location

162
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,560
I was so worried about.

163
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,320
You've been here good.

164
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Great.

165
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,680
He as Heracledos,

166
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,840
let's ask the Black Cloak Man

167
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,000
to give us a new competitive conclusion.

168
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,640
In this city,

169
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,920
we're not afraid of death.

170
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
Before Then,

171
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,560
ago a war can't be poped with the sword,

172
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
You can be rude to Brother Jian Wei.

173
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,360
Otherwise, I won't talk to you.

174
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,080
You sit over there.

175
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,680
Brother Jian Wei, you sit here.

176
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
Uncle Chai, come on.

177
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,160
I'll get it for you.

178
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,480
Brother Jian Wei, come on.

179
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,240
Let's eat the cakes.

180
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,400
The cakes are just baked.

181
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,680
Come on, Shi Tou.

182
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,440
Let's share it with everyone.

183
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,360
Uncle Chai.

184
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,240
Come on, share it.

185
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,080
Uncle Chai.

186
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,760
Give me a piece of cake.

187
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,680
Okay.

188
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,600
Do you want to eat it?

189
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,360
If you want to eat it, you can eat it yourself.

190
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,040
Come on, shake it.

191
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,280
Come on.

192
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
You're too gentle.

193
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,920
What?

194
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,120
You're anxious?

195
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,880
I baked the cakes for you,

196
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,520
but I didn't give them to you.

197
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,200
I didn't say you.

198
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,760
Eat your food.

199
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,160
Look, there's a lantern.

200
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,200
Lantern.

201
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:27,920
Oh, no.

202
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,080
It's a message from Qing Yi.

203
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,080
They can't find out.
