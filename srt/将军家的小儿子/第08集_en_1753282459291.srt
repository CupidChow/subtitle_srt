00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The Li family

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
should all die.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Qiangwei.

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Lord Chen.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're drunk.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Qiangwei.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't blame him.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We all have our own difficulties.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll tell you

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
if I have a chance.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's getting late.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Go back and rest.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Qingyin.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why?

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why?

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You said you'd help me.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why did you stop me?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yan'er.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not that I wanted to stop you.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not what I wanted.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm afraid

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
it's not as simple as we thought.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So what?

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They killed my whole family.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Shouldn't I die?

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Or...

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I should die?

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Or...

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You were with them.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yan'er, calm down.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You should kill them.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Aren't you curious

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
what's the reason

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
between them and the Li family?

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why did they kill you?

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The wolf is in a coma.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The sun and moon are in the sky.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The paper is cold.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The paper is cold.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The paper is cold.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The paper is cold.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Qianwei.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yan'er.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry for what happened tonight.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I know you have many doubts.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But please believe me.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll find out the truth.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In that case,

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll find out the truth.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Even if I die,

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll make them understand.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yan'er.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Are you going back to Mount Jianwei

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
with them?

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Last year, today,

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
in this gate,

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
the peach blossoms are in full bloom.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They smell like cherry blossoms.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't know where they are.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The peach blossoms still smell like...

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Stop.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Stop.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Chen Wang.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You've got the wrong person.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Even if I got the wrong person,

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
how can I explain

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
the bandage on your hand?

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're still alive.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Why didn't you come to me?

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's been 20 years.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I thought you were dead for 20 years.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The culprit is right in front of you.

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You can't do this.

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Li Yan.

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're a son of a bitch.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Father.

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Mother.

89
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What should I do?

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Tell me.

91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How should I face all this?

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yan'er.

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Even if the road ahead is difficult,

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
you have to overcome the difficulties

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and move forward bravely.

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Remember.

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
When the wind blows,

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
the waves will be strong.

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The wind will be strong.

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The wind will be strong.

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Father, I remember.

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay.

103
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
When the wind blows, the waves will be strong.

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Only the clouds will be broken.

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Only the waves will be broken.

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What is he doing here?

107
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Li Yan.

108
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If you want to blame,

109
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
blame your father for too many sins

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and you can't live.

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
My brother Li Jianwei killed you today.

112
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He had no choice.

113
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He is pure.

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He shouldn't have gotten into our grudge.

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Today,

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm here to burn incense for you.

117
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I hope you can get rid of your grudge

118
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and die soon.

119
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You are a good man.

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Don't hate Li Jianwei.

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't hate Li Jianwei.

122
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
If you still have a grudge

123
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and want to find revenge

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and come to the ghost valley

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to find me Chen Xiaoxi,

126
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm not afraid of you.

127
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He is doing it for me.

128
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No.

129
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He just wants to make himself safe.

130
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Wait.

131
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Jianwei.

132
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Why are you here?

133
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You didn't say anything when you left.

134
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Why are you here to burn incense?

135
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Life is like a tree with a tree.

136
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He is dead.

137
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Those grudges

138
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
are over in my opinion.

139
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes.

140
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You are dead.

141
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You are still here to burn incense.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
One day,

143
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I will let you taste the taste of the death.

144
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You don't understand.

145
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Some people

146
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
have their own mission

147
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
to live their whole lives.

148
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You…

149
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You should have a try.

150
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Especially that little boy in the Li family.

151
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The one you met and killed.

152
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He is almost

153
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
the same age as us.

154
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
After all,

155
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
what does the previous life

156
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
have to do with him?

157
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Why did you kill him?

158
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
To get justice for them.

159
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They…

160
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Justice?

161
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Jianwei.

162
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Look at that grass.

163
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Although it's like a red hair,

164
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
it's hard to get rid of the wind and rain.

165
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But their souls will not die.

166
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Even if the wind blows down the mountain,

167
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
it can still

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
bring you the spring breeze.

169
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The heaven is kind.

170
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The punishment of the Li family

171
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
will be

172
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
reported to the world one day.

173
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Dingyuan.

174
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What have you done?

175
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You…

176
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Come on, let's eat.

177
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Come on.

178
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Let's buy some food.

179
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Come on.

180
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Let's buy some wine.

181
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Come on.

182
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Guys.

183
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Jianwei

184
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
helped us to kill the enemy today.

185
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He will be our own man in the future.

186
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes.

187
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Let's eat.

188
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Jianwei.

189
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You have done a great job for us this time.

190
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes.

191
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I promise.

192
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Let's toast to Jianwei.

193
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Cheers.

194
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Come on.

195
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
