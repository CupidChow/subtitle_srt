1
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,280
I know you wanted to protect me

2
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,680
to protect me.

3
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,800
You think too much.

4
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,760
I just don't want you to drag me down.

5
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,840
Really?

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,120
What is this?

7
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,840
Nothing.

8
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,600
Can you make it clear?

9
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,800
Do you know

10
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,520
how much trouble you've brought to the Huo family?

11
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,400
Do you still think you're a lady?

12
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,480
What do you mean?

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,600
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,400
Nian Nian.

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,920
My father wants to kill me.

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,600
He may do it anytime.

17
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,360
Huo Residence is dangerous for you.

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,120
Pushing you away

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,080
is the only way to protect you.

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,640
Think about it.

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,400
Diary. Another diary.

22
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,920
You finally show up again.

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
You didn't finish last time.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,840
Who did he kill?

25
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,720
Did he kill my father?

26
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,760
Why do I only

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,240
only see a page of the diary?

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,000
Where did the diary go?

29
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,480
What are you...

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
What's wrong?

31
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,400
Our baby...

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,480
died.

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,280
We...

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,440
I had a child with my husband.

35
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,400
He died.

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,560
After Huo Hanjin went to the pharmacy,

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,920
my medicine was replaced with abortion medicine.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,680
He must have killed our child.

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,160
No.

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,320
There's no way he killed our child.

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,320
He got hurt because he protected me yesterday.

42
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,400
No way.

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,120
It's impossible for him.

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,240
I can feel his existence.

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,960
But I watched him die.

46
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,960
or killed by my closest friend.

47
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,040
Huo Hanjin.

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,720
He is a murderer.

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,480
I remember.

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,520
We do have a child.

51
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,600
We had a child.

52
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,360
right?

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,600
Yes.

54
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
She died

55
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,600
before she was born.

56
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,600
You changed the medicine.

57
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,320
You killed our child.

58
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,520
Say something!

59
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,240
Why?

60
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,080
Why did you kill our child?
