1
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,720
What is it?

2
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,160
Huo Zhenhua.

3
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,880
Su Nian Qing.

4
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,760
How dare you point a gun at my house?

5
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,800
Are you crazy?

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,160
The one who killed my father

7
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,280
who killed my father?

8
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,520
Su Nian Qing.

9
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,680
no matter what happens,

10
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,240
you are my daughter-in-law.

11
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,080
You and Hanjin and me

12
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,760
are a family.

13
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,640
Hanjin is my only son now.

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,960
The Huo family will be yours and Hanjin's.

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,720
Do you

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,920
about me?

17
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,880
Nian Nian.

18
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,840
Young Master.

19
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,440
Young Mistress is missing.

20
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,440
Oh no.

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,680
Let's go.

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,920
Do you know

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,040
Do you know it?

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,640
No.

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,720
What?

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,840
You want to shoot me?

27
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,800
Huo Zhenhua.

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,880
I’d like to see

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,600
how long you can be stubborn today.

30
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,079
Are you playing this trick with me?

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,560
You don't know where

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,040
when I licked blood.

33
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,920
I didn't kill your father.

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,160
I only asked the gunman to hurt him.

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,480
You...

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,560
Do you really want to kill me?

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,600
Fine.

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
In that case,

39
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,920
I'll return this gun to you on behalf of my father.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,880
I've returned

41
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,840
you shot my father.

42
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,320
Tell me.

43
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,000
Who killed my father?

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,560
Tell me.

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,920
Who killed my father?

46
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,520
What's wrong?

47
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,160
Huo Zhenhua.

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,400
Huo Zhenhua!

49
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,360
Kill!

50
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,360
The one who killed Su Fang.

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,360
The one who killed Su Fang

52
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:11,960
Yes.

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,120
Yes.

54
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,200
Yes.

55
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
Yes.

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,560
Huo Zhenhua.

57
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,960
Huo Zhenhua!

58
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,040
I didn't hit the vital part.

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,120
Su Nian Qing.

60
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,720
Is this the reason?

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,920
I didn't want to kill him.

62
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,160
Give it back.

63
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,120
Su Nian Qing.

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,480
I have your father's autopsy report.

65
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,840
Do you want to know how he died?

66
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,040
Beg me.

67
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,120
Huang Ying!

68
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,440
You killed my child.

69
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,680
and hurt me again and again.

70
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,840
Why are you always picking on me?

71
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,160
You stole my man.

72
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,200
and made me a mistress.

73
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,519
You have many chances and choices.

74
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,440
but you cut off my only way to get married.

75
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,160
So in this year,

76
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,840
only for men in this year.

77
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,840
Did you study and read

78
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,240
just to marry a good man?

79
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,440
Huang Ying.

80
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,720
What you've been through...

81
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,480
are you stupid?

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,320
It has nothing to do with me.

83
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,640
None of your business?

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,520
I've been harmed by you all my life.

85
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,400
So,

86
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,760
I want you to experience the same pain as me.

87
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,120
Hwang Young.

88
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,640
You're crazy.

89
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,840
Madam.

90
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,240
Goodbye.

91
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,880
Miss Su.

92
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,000
Stop!

93
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,040
What's going on?

94
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,080
Hanjin.

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,160
Su Nian Qing killed Old Master.

96
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,480
I didn't mean to kill him.

97
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,600
How dare you deny it?

98
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,880
I saw you shoot Master.

99
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,960
Shut up!

100
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,920
We all saw

101
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,920
Su Nian Qing killed Old Master.

102
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Young Master.

103
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,760
Are you trying to cover up for your father?

104
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
I shot Huo Zhenhua

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
was shot by me.

106
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,280
But I didn't mean to kill him.

107
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,280
We agreed to find the gunman together.

108
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,480
But you deliberately sent me away.

109
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,480
to kill my father.

110
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,680
So you planned all this?

111
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,040
I'm just a pawn for your revenge.

112
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,480
Right?

113
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,880
Yes, it's the one. It's the one. It's the one.

114
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,520
You're right. You're right.

115
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,000
That's why you can't remember anything.

116
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,920
and start all over again.

117
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,360
You ruined my family.

118
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,840
is what you want.

119
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,000
Really?

120
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,880
Maybe this is our destined ending.

121
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,920
Hanjin.

122
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,200
You can't let Su Nian Qing go.

123
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,960
You have to give your father an explanation.

124
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,000
Erhu

125
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,560
Take her away.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,160
I'll interrogate her myself.

127
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,480
What?

128
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,800
What I said doesn't work?

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,480
Let go!

130
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Hanjin.

131
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,840
Nian Nian.

132
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,160
Are you okay?

133
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,600
I asked Erhu to find you.

134
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,520
and found the gunman's body.

135
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,400
I knew someone was trying to kill him.

136
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,080
Luckily, you're fine.

137
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,640
I thought...

138
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,040
you really thought I killed your father.

139
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,120
Don't worry.

140
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,840
I've asked someone to give my father a forensic test.

141
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,920
I will prove your innocence.

142
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,920
But,

143
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,120
tell me

144
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,000
What happened at the scene?

145
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,840
Huang Ying took my father's autopsy report.

146
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,960
The real cause of my father's death wasn't gunshot.

147
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,880
It's raw aconite poisoning.

148
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,000
Little Madam.

149
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,040
Where were you when my father died?

150
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,880
I was in the bedroom.

151
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,159
I asked the maid.

152
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,960
You were there when my father died.

153
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,280
You killed my father.

154
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,520
right?

155
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,200
How could I kill Old Master?

156
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,320
You should ask Su Nian Qing.

157
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,240
I've sent someone to examine the body.

158
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,320
No matter who killed my father,

159
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,360
I will avenge him myself.

160
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,120
He's the only son of the Huo family.

161
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,840
If we don't punish Su Nian Qing severely,

162
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,920
she doesn't deserve to be the chairman of the Huo family.

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,960
Mr. Qian is right.

164
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,080
Whether I deserve it or not,

165
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,320
to tell me what to do.

166
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Everyone is here today

167
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,320
to kill Old Master Huo's murderer.

168
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,919
If you

169
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,200
If you are suspected of

170
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,160
for colluding with the Su family,

171
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,760
doesn't deserve to be the president.

172
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,600
You're right.

173
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,440
Master Qian is right.

174
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,160
That's right.

175
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,440
My father just died.

176
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,560
You guys came here so quickly.

177
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,000
Did someone inform you

178
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,600
or have you been planning for a long time?

179
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,960
I think everyone here

180
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,200
are suspects.

181
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,920
If you want to investigate,

182
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
none of you can escape.

183
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,800
Young Master

184
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,720
Young Master

185
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,120
Bad news!

186
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,240
Master's coffin is on fire!

187
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,760
How could this happen?

188
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,080
Why is it on fire?

189
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,680
Yeah.

190
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,480
Get some water.

191
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,920
Okay.

192
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,160
I'll get someone here.

193
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,720
Okay.

194
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,120
