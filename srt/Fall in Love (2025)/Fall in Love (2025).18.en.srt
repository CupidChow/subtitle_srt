1
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,960
It's thirty percent higher than the market price. Okay.

2
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,280
Nian Nian.

3
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,120
Young Master Huo

4
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,680
is not as professional as you said.

5
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,080
Let’s think of another way

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,120
Young Master Shen

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,800
You’re asking for food

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,960
to separate personal and personal

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,880
or to control the Su family?

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,280
You...

11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,960
Huo Hanjin!

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,720
You know we need these machines.

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,520
to save the Su family.

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,560
Why are you making things difficult for us?

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,280
Are those machines that important?

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,960
Do you know

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,640
how many shares

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,280
in secret these years?

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
If my brother hadn’t

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,360
protect Su’s assets in this way,

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,039
I'm afraid the Su family

22
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,000
by your Huo family.

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,280
One more thing.

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,640
The Huo family has been coveting our assets.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,200
So I transferred some of my assets

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,759
to my personal account.

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,520
Don't worry.

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,240
I didn't take a penny of the money.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,039
I was going to tell you later.

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,920
But I’m worried that Huo Hanjin

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,600
will make use of this.

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,200
Don't worry.

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,600
He won't.

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,600
Nian Nian.

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,520
Don't be fooled by him again.

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,840
I sent someone to find Huang Ying.

37
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,760
She looked crazy.

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,960
But she said

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,880
the one who killed Huo Zhenhua

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,960
is Huo Hanjin.

41
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,639
Nian Nian.

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,560
Do you really know him?

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,720
I knew you would slander me.

44
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,280
I don't think you did it for Nian Nian.

45
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,760
You just want the machines.

46
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,720
Shen Renran.

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,200
I'm the chairman of the Huo family now.

48
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,120
The secrets between you and my father...

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,640
I can find out

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,200
if I touch my finger.

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,400
As the president,

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,640
because you killed your father.

53
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,560
What did you say?

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
I said you killed your brother and father. You don't admit it.

55
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:36,960
Brother.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,079
You're a scumbag.

57
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:38,760
Brother.

58
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,120
Shen Renran.

59
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,240
Nian Nian.

60
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,840
Huo Hanjin!

61
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,200
I won't let you off!

62
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,760
Brother.

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,240
Brother.

64
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,040
Let's go.

65
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,560
Here.

66
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,160
Nian Nian.

67
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,320
I'm telling the truth.

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,720
You can't go with him.

69
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,000
I hope you

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,400
consider our cooperation seriously.

71
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,640
Brother.

72
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,040
Brother.

73
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,960
Nian Nian.

74
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,079
Why are you here?

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,960
About the machines,

76
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,040
about the machines.

77
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,079
You haven't recovered yet.

78
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,720
About the machine,

79
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,200
I'll think of another way.

80
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
Have you eaten?

81
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll get you something to eat.

82
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,000
Have a seat.

83
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,280
Okay.

84
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,160
This is my diary.

85
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Su Nian Qing.

86
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,400
Where are you?

87
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,400
Please tell me.

88
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,840
who killed my father.

89
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,120
Shen Renran?

90
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,600
or Huo Hanjin?

91
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,760
Why can't I find the truth

92
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,520
but never find the truth?

93
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,720
Did you

94
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,159
found the truth?

95
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,480
They told me the murderer who killed my father was drowned.

96
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,840
I don't believe it.

97
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
But why does Huo Hanjin

98
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,320
stop me from investigating?

99
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,120
But I won't give up.

100
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,240
The yarn factory has been in trouble lately.

101
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,880
The return of the goods hasn’t come yet.

102
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,440
Huo Hanjin helped me find funds everywhere.

103
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,040
Luckily, I have him.

104
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,240
We quarreled again today.

105
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,440
Huo Hanjin never did it for me.

106
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,760
He wanted to help the Huo family take over the Su family.

107
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,760
Then why did he stop me from investigating?

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,680
Could my father's death

109
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,560
related to the Huo family?

110
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
After we got married,

111
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,800
Huo Hanjin is no longer the man he used to be.

112
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,640
There are only quarrels and suspicion between us.

113
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,280
So from the beginning,

114
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,520
we were destined to be a tragedy.

115
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,480
Huo Hanjin bought raw crow.

116
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,840
He killed my father.

117
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,480
Impossible.

118
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,560
Absolutely impossible.

119
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,200
It's not true.

120
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,480
Nian Nian.

121
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,040
You...

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,880
remember anything?

123
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,600
How could it be true?

124
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes.

125
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,320
I've been investigating for so long.

126
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,159
I didn't expect that

127
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,680
the murderer was Huo Hanjin.

128
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,520
He's not that kind of person.

129
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,200
Did Nian Nian forget how he treated you?

130
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,800
And the car that hit you

131
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,480
the car that hit you was his.

132
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,480
But why did he do that?

133
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,760
For the benefit.

134
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,360
He wanted to kill my father before controlling you.

135
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,840
Now he refused to help us get the machines.

136
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,240
just in case our Su family

137
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,320
threaten their status again.

138
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,480
Before this,

139
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,000
I didn't return the diary to you

140
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,000
because I didn't want you to remember the pain in the past.

141
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,320
Now that you've seen it,

142
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,120
don’t be deceived by Huo Hanjin.

143
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,120
It's all my fault.

144
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
I made you live with a murderer

145
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,800
with a murderer?

146
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,080
That's right.

147
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,360
We can't let Nian Nian

148
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,080
live next to a murderer.

149
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,480
Nian Nian.

150
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,600
It's too dangerous here.

151
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,280
Come with me.

152
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,720
Isn't it dangerous to be with you?

153
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,440
Are you

154
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,040
Are you suspecting me?

155
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,200
Huo Hanjin.

156
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,520
Do you think I'm not here?

157
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,880
No matter what happens today,

158
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,280
I'll take Nian Nian away.

159
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,000
Nian Nian.

160
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,400
Why do you trust him so much?

161
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,000
Because he's my brother.

162
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,120
I've lived with him for ten years.

163
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,120
Huo Hanjin.

164
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,720
It's useless to say anything.

165
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,360
You killed my father.

166
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,640
I'll let you pay with your life!

167
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,640
No!

168
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,680
Nian Nian.

169
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
What are you doing?

170
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,919
Leave.

171
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,880
Why won't you let me kill him?

172
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,080
Brother.

173
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,000
You can’t be accused of murder.

174
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,559
So he can't die in the Su family.

175
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,600
Miss Su.

176
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,840
As I ordered last time,

177
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,520
I’ve bought

178
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,840
I've copied all the drugs

179
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,360
I copied them all.

180
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,680
Have you

181
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,960
have you seen the drug on this list?

182
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,400
Yes.

183
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,360
It's a raw crow. It's very poisonous. It's very poisonous. It's good. It's good. It's good.

184
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,000
is extremely poisonous.

185
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,600
A slight mistake could lead to death.

186
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,120
I paid extra attention to the plagiarism.

187
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,920
Could it be a mistake?

188
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,080
No way.

189
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,760
This is a special medicine.

190
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,960
I'll keep an eye on it.

191
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,920
It can't be wrong.

192
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,920
