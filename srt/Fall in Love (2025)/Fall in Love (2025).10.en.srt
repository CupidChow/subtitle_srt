1
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,800
It's called Suyunfang

2
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
When I was little,

3
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,760
my father often brought me here.

4
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,600
Nian Nian.

5
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,600
Su Yun Textile

6
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,519
is my first shop

7
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,280
In the past,

8
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,640
he was only 1 feet wide.

9
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,160
Father.

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,840
I know

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,200
Su Yun Textile is your original intention of doing business

12
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,640
I won’t forget it.

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,280
I want to tell you

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,720
I can give you

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,320
the vast Su Yun Mill

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,880
has become like this

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,000
If you...

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,720
If I encounter difficulties in the future,

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,800
I will be like you.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,960
I won't be afraid of difficulties.

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,240
Start from the beginning.

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,440
Just remember it.

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,600
Good.

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,640
Hanjin.

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,240
What do you think of this new wedding dress?

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,320
Isn't this Su Nian Qing's wedding dress?

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,440
Why is it here?

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,880
I arranged this.

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,000
Master gave Huo Yun Textile to me.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,280
I should at least show some respect to my former master.

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,480
Hanjin.

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,320
Is this dress

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,920
remind you of that woman?

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,200
It's okay.

35
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,880
When I wear it,

36
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,720
you'll think of me.

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,680
Hanjin.

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,480
Do you want to see me wear it?

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,360
As long as you like it,

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm fine with anything.

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,360
Hanjin.

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Come in and help me zip up, okay?

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,280
Hanjin.

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,720
What took you so long?

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,160
Come and help me.

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,120
I can't pull it up.

47
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,120
Hanjin!

48
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,760
There are people outside.

49
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,720
Isn't it inappropriate?

50
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,120
Why not?

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,360
Don't you like to take it off?

52
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,760
Su Nian Qing.

53
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,720
Why are you here?

54
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,840
If you take mine,

55
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,560
you have to get it back for me.

56
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,840
Not only the wedding dress,

57
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,000
and Su Yun Spin.

58
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,680
I'll get them back.

59
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,640
Su Nian Qing is a crazy woman.

60
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,000
Hanjin.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,360
Look at her.

62
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,200
Su Nian Qing.

63
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,920
It's not enough for you to make a scene in Huo Residence.

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,680
Now you're making a scene at Huo Yun Textile.

65
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,000
Look at you!

66
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,520
You're the second son of the Huo family.

67
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,560
yet you don't know each other well.

68
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,360
Look at you.

69
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,440
Su Nian Qing.

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,000
If it weren't for you,

71
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,920
Hanjin and I wouldn’t be like this.

72
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,480
Let me tell you.

73
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
the store

74
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,200
and your ex-boyfriend

75
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,160
are all mine.

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,840
Let me introduce.

77
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,040
This is Mr Xu.

78
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,240
You don't know Mrs. Huang, do you?

79
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,400
Mr Xu just took over

80
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
the director of Yuncheng Welfare House.

81
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,520
I don't care.

82
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,000
You're making a scene in my territory.

83
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,400
What do you want?

84
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,920
Let me remind you.

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,159
Huo Zhenhua stole this shop from me.

86
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,480
He said he would follow my father's tradition

87
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,440
and continue to donate half of the profit

88
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,480
to Yuncheng Welfare House.

89
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,280
So what?

90
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,120
How Huo Yunfang is now

91
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,320
has nothing to do with you.

92
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,240
It's not up to you

93
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,280
is not up to you.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,920
Mrs. Huang.

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,440
It's been a year

96
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,800
for a year.

97
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,120
One year ago,

98
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,760
you took over Huo Yunfang

99
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,880
Did you

100
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,920
by you, Huang Ying?

101
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,760
by you, Huang Ying?

102
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,400
Sign this contract

103
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,320
Give me all your shares

104
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,640
to me

105
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,280
in exchange

106
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,960
you embezzled the money.

107
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,400
Otherwise,

108
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,159
the entire Yun City business sector will know about this.

109
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,320
The Huo family's reputation will be ruined.

110
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,240
I don't think Huo Zhenhua will let you off easily.

111
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,880
Mrs. Huang.

112
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,560
Su Nian Qing.

113
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,520
I've treated you well this year.

114
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,040
Why did you frame the Huo family?

115
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,240
Su Nian Qing.

116
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Do you think you can threaten me?

117
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,280
Even if I sign the contract today,

118
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,440
you still can't get Huo Yun Textile back.

119
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,680
Little Madam.

120
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,280
Don't worry.

121
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,920
If dad asks,

122
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,120
I'll carry it for you.

123
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,080
Hanjin.

124
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,800
I'm content

125
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm content.

126
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,760
Don't worry.

127
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,680
I have an idea.

128
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,280
to let Su Nian Qing fail.

129
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,560
This plaque

130
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,440
will be changed to Su Yun Textile

131
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:52,920
Give it to me.

132
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,920
Su Nian Qing,

133
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,480
You'll never get Huo Yunfang back.

134
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,040
Do you think you can get back Huo Yunfang

135
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,480
with my shares?

136
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,600
I gave the rest 60 percent

137
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,360
to the Qian family and the Zhou family.

138
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,000
As long as I get them back,

139
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,160
Huo Yunfang

140
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,200
I'm still the one who took the lead

141
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,040
and helped me solve this big trouble in the orphanage.

142
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,000
and gave up such a good man.

143
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Su Nian Qing.

144
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,880
You're such a kind person.

145
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,120
The remaining 60 percent

146
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,080
have been taken into my pocket?

147
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
Thank you, Mr Xu.

148
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,960
for accompanying us to finish this scene.

149
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,520
I should thank you.

150
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,280
Well,

151
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,120
help me realize a wish.

152
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,960
You...

153
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,400
You're all in this together.

154
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,560
Wedding dress.

155
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Su Yunfang

156
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,680
Men

157
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,200
I want everything.

158
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,600
Huang Ying.

159
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,160
You really have nothing now.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,800
The ledger you tore is not the only one.

161
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,760
The other one

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,640
should be sent to the newspaper office.

163
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,800
Mrs. Huang,

164
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,960
You did a great job

165
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,200
for Huo Zhenhua.

166
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,440
Su Nian Qing.

167
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,080
See the guest out.

168
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,600
I will take back

169
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,679
one by one.

170
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,480
Happy cooperation.

171
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,120
How could you cut it?

172
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,000
Didn't you say

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,640
I've been wasting my whole year?

174
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,520
We pretended to fight that day

175
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,880
to fool Hwang Young?

176
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
How could you take it seriously?

177
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,680
Our business

178
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,760
has nothing to do with Huang Ying.

179
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,720
Have you forgotten

180
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,520
in this year?

181
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,040
Maybe we loved each other.

182
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,280
But when I woke up,

183
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
everything that happened

184
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,240
is telling me the truth.

185
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,240
This year,

186
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,880
in this year.

187
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,560
My father...

188
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,480
the Su family,

189
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,200
and our children.

190
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,160
Many things

191
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,840
are in our relationship.

192
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,240
Maybe our marriage

193
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,200
was a mistake.

194
