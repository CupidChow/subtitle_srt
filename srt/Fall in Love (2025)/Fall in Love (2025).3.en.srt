1
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,080
Did you marry me

2
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,920
to gain the power of the Su family?

3
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,680
Now the Su family has completely fallen.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,560
You want to kick me out?

5
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,480
Are you done?

6
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,840
I have something to do tonight.

7
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't have time to argue with you.

8
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,680
What does the divorce announcement mean?

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,640
I didn’t make up

10
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,600
I didn't do it.

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,560
You didn't do it?

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,800
What else didn't you do?

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,920
Is my father's death

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,760
related to you?

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I told you.

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,039
I have nothing to do with your father's death.

17
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,120
You'll only put yourself in danger.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,840
Su Nian Qing.

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,840
It's been a year.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,120
Have you ever trusted me?

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,280
How can I trust you?

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,680
You kept stopping me.

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,360
because you're afraid I'll find out something.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,120
If I find something,

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,000
will the Huo family

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,720
want to kill me?

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,680
I have solid evidence.

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,400
I can finally avenge you.

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,200
Where am I?

30
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,440
Today is my wedding day.

31
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,160
The doctor said

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,520
Su Nian Qing hurt her head in a car accident.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,240
She'll never wake up.

34
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,640
Little Madam seems very happy.

35
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,800
Su Nian Qing is already like this.

36
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,800
You still call me Little Madam?

37
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,960
Hanjin.

38
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
You know

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,040
I only want to marry

40
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,520
is you.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,680
Little Madam.

42
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,200
Please behave yourself.

43
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,840
In the past year,

44
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,960
in order to avenge his father,

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,720
to avenge his father.

46
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,400
I know

47
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
your grievances.

48
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,080
Hanjin.

49
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,800
I really care about you.

50
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,120
I really hope Su Nian Qing will never wake up.

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,200
Without Su Nian Qing,

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,960
we can finally be together forever.

53
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,279
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

54
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,680
Su Nian Qing.

55
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,320
You're awake.

56
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,399
Huang Ying.

57
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,560
I treat you as my best friend.

58
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,680
How dare you seduce my fiance?

59
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,400
How dare you!

60
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,960
I'm Hanjin's concubine.

61
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,520
I'm your mother-in-law.

62
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,400
Today,

63
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,920
I'll teach her a lesson for Hanjin.

64
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,120
You immature daughter-in-law.

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,000
When did you become my mother-in-law?

66
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,400
Huo Hanjin.

67
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,040
Isn't today our wedding?

68
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,520
Isn't she our bridesmaid?

69
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,600
How dare you hit me?

70
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,080
Are you out of your mind?

71
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,880
I'll tell Master now.

72
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,560
You're disrespecting me.

73
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,920
How dare you!

74
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,840
Then I'll show you

75
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,360
what is truly disrespecting the superior.

76
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,200
Guards!

77
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,480
Young Master.

78
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,240
Second Young Madam just woke up from a car accident.

79
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,280
and lost her mind.

80
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,040
Take her back to her room.

81
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,960
in case someone gets hurt.

82
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,480
Yes.

83
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,160
Did it hurt?

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,840
Huo Hanjin.

85
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,040
Stop pretending.

86
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,000
We agreed

87
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,120
I'll help you manage the Huo family.

88
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,680
and you protect the Su family.

89
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,160
Even if you want to go back on your word,

90
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
you can tell me.

91
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,800
Yun City is full of talents.

92
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,520
I don't have to marry you.

93
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,200
Do you remember

94
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,640
Do you remember?

95
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,000
Today is the day

96
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,080
our wedding day.

97
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,240
But now,

98
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,040
I need to reconsider.

99
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Marriage?

100
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,360
We've been married for a year.

101
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,960
Su Nian Qing.

102
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,520
What tricks are you playing now?

103
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,880
A year?

104
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,159
Huo Hanjin.

105
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,920
I should be asking you that.

106
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,600
Huo Hanjin.

107
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,200
Why are you torturing me?

108
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,040
From now on,

109
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,080
no one is allowed to enter this room.

110
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,400
Especially Second Young Madam.

111
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,920
Yes.

112
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,280
Huo Hanjin.

113
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,200
What did you say?

114
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,400
Let me out!

115
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,400
Master.

116
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,400
There is no hostess in our mansion now.

117
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,200
Let me hold the New Year's Eve banquet.

118
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,880
It's just that I'm not justifiable.

119
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,720
I'm afraid people will gossip.

120
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,560
or gossip.

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,760
I shouldn't have had this thought.

122
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,400
If it weren't for my eldest son,

123
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,760
you wouldn't be able to enter the Huo family.

124
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,880
No.

125
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,040
We can't let him trap us here.

126
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,080
The key.

127
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,280
Welcome, Young Master

128
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,000
Sir.

129
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,880
You're here.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,160
I thought

131
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,800
you would never come to see me again.

132
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,360
Her Ladyship just woke up.

133
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,160
How can I leave you alone?

134
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,640
Sir, let me.

135
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,160
I'd like to see

136
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,840
what you're up to.

137
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,800
No.

138
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,960
The chains are not in his clothes.

139
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,800
It must be somewhere close to him.

140
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,280
Madam, why are you so considerate today?

141
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,160
If you like it,

142
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,000
I can do it every day.

143
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,840
every day.

144
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,039
You always take advantage of me.

145
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,559
You're right.

146
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,720
After all, the place we met

147
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,919
is so special.

148
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,520
The initial use is true.

149
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,920
It's true that you covet me.

150
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,080
I didn't.

151
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,840
No?

152
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,760
Even if you lose your memory,

153
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,520
your body's reaction won't lie.

154
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,520
Don't tell me...

155
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,440
Don't you want to?

156
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,960
Sir.

157
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,160
I'm not feeling well today.

158
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,600
Stop playing tricks.

159
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,960
Give it to me.

160
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,600
Stay in your room.

161
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,160
for your own good.

162
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,240
The Yaheng Party

163
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,240
Weiyu Committee.

164
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,800
Yin Peng.

165
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,160
Yin Peng.

166
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:04,720
Yangwei.

167
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,280
Cheng Peng Qingxue Ke Yangwei.

168
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:05,600
Peng.

169
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,120
Cheng, Peng Qingxue, Keyang.

170
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:19,720
Hao.

171
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:20,760
Yu.

172
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,440
Mingxin is smart.
