1
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,640
Go!

2
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,080
My medicine.

3
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,920
There's a boat tonight.

4
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,480
Let's leave Yuncheng City.

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,039
Let's go together.

6
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,600
When will I come back?

7
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,800
I'll pick you up

8
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,160
after I finish my work.

9
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,640
Okay.

10
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,960
I'll wait for you.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,880
You will marry me.

12
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,000
right?

13
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,080
It's your turn. It's your turn.

14
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,080
I'm pregnant with your child.

15
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,960
Do you know what I hate the most?

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,200
I hate being threatened.

17
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,040
If you say it's mine, it's mine.

18
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,560
Who knows if he's a bastard or not?

19
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,520
No.

20
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,440
It's our child.

21
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,079
Impossible.

22
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,680
You can't have my baby.

23
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,320
Because you don't deserve to have my child.

24
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,400
My baby.

25
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,440
My child.

26
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,200
Leave Yuncheng now.

27
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't get in my way.

28
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,680
Shen Renran.

29
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,520
I read Su Fang’s autopsy report.

30
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,120
You killed Huo Zhenhua and Su Fang.

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,240
I'm going to make everything public.

32
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,520
You framed Su Nian Qing.

33
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,120
Don't fail again this time.

34
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,200
Don’t worry.

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,880
Young Master

36
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,640
Young Mistress is missing.

37
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,800
Oh no.

38
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,840
Let's go.

39
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you know why no one can threaten me?

40
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,160
Because all the people who threatened me died.

41
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,200
Let go of me!

42
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,200
Hey!

43
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,240
What are you doing?

44
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,440
Huang Ying.

45
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,480
Huang Ying!

46
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,440
Wake up!

47
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,440
Huang Ying!

48
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,440
Don't kill me!

49
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,680
Don't kill me.

50
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,240
Go away!

51
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,920
Don't kill me.

52
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,640
Who did this to you?

53
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,000
Shen Renran.

54
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,120
I'm going to kill you.

55
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm going to kill you.

56
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,920
Why did you kill my child?

57
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm going to kill you.

58
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,480
Huang Ying!

59
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,360
I'm going to kill you!

60
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,480
Wake up.

61
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,920
Shen Renran.

62
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,120
I've always been obedient.

63
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,440
I didn't tell him

64
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,400
you asked me to poison Huo Zhenhua.

65
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,000
You promised to marry me.

66
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,200
Why did you change your mind?

67
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,320
Why did you kill our child?

68
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Impossible.

69
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,920
How could it be him?

70
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,160
This year,

71
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,280
the only person I haven't suspected was him.

72
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,800
Impossible.

73
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,680
No way.

74
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,640
He's my brother.

75
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,280
Nian Nian.

76
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,400
Did you hear what Huang Ying said?

77
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,200
Huang Ying is crazy.

78
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,520
How can I believe her?

79
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,200
Nian Nian.

80
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,640
Actually, you know that

81
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,960
You just can't accept the fact for the time being.

82
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,040
It doesn't matter if Hwang Young is crazy or not.

83
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,720
No way.

84
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,000
Absolutely impossible.

85
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,760
Impossible.

86
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,600
Nian Nian.

87
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,960
Nian Nian.

88
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,160
Watch the steps.

89
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,400
Nian Nian.

90
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,400
Nian Nian, look who's here.

91
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,080
Nian Nian.

92
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,200
Do you remember my cousin's brother?

93
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
Yes.

94
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,520
From now on,

95
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,240
he is your brother.

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,400
We'll be a family.

97
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,960
Okay?

98
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,200
Okay.

99
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,120
Call me brother.

100
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,800
Hello.

101
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
Hello, sister.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Nian Nian is so good.

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,080
Ranran is so good.

104
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,640
Here are the noodles.

105
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,680
Noodles are ready.

106
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,000
Nian Nian.

107
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,200
You can't do that.

108
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,880
Today is Renran's birthday

109
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,680
This is for you

110
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,840
Here

111
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,920
Brother I

112
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,080
I want to eat.

113
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,760
It's okay.

114
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,840
Every time it's my birthday,

115
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,080
for Nian Nian.

116
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,400
Sure.

117
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,200
Thank you, brother.

118
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,760
Nian Nian is so good.

119
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,760
Nian Nian is such a good girl.

120
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,720
Everything in the Su family is mine.

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,520
What's wrong?

122
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,200
Are you okay?

123
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,360
Brother.

124
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,960
I just had a nightmare.

125
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,080
You're still as weak

126
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,600
as a kid.

127
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,039
Brother.

128
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,679
Thank you.

129
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
All these years,

130
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,680
for so many years.

131
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,720
This is what I should do.

132
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,000
But sometimes I think

133
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,120
not only be your brother,

134
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
There's something

135
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,360
I don't know how to tell you.

136
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
What happened?

137
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,960
Xu Zixiao

138
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
to those machines.

139
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,680
Nian Nian.

140
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,760
Why don't we give up?

141
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,600
What did he ask for?

142
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,640
He requested

143
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,840
to pay in cash.

144
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
And we have to find the airline channel ourselves.

145
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,320
It's okay.

146
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,000
I’ll ask Huo Hanjin for help.

147
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
All these years, Shen Renran

148
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,360
is secretly transferring Su’s assets.

149
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,520
Second Young Madam and Shen Ren Ran are here.

150
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,680
Perfect timing.

151
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,240
Let's go.

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,240
The Yaheng Party

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,240
Weiyu Committee.

154
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,320
Yin Peng.

155
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,240
Ye Wensong.

156
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,480
Cheng Peng Qingxue, Ke Yangwei.
