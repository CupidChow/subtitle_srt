1
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,920
What you said before

2
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,680
is it true?

3
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,840
When your father was shot,

4
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,920
the murderer disappeared.

5
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,240
A month later,

6
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,480
we found several bodies by the river.

7
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,080
The case was closed

8
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,600
he closed the case

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,160
that the murderer was drowned.

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,160
Do you remember?

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,880
the real murderer didn't die?

12
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,880
Someone was trying to cover up the truth.

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,520
That's right.

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,000
The murderer left Yun City successfully.

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,760
and changed his appearance.

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,880
No one knows where he is.

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,320
But I

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,800
I found the person behind the murderer.

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,880
You don't want to tell me.

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Let's read it.

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,000
Do you want to know?

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,600
As long as you follow me,

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,920
I'll tell you.

24
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,880
Huo Qixuan.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,039
Why are you here?

26
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,920
I warned you.

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,320
If you ever think of Nian Nian again,

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,640
I won't forgive you.

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,000
Why are you holding me?

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,840
Beat him!

31
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,680
Hit him!

32
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,199
Nian Nian!

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,039
Nian Nian.

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,800
Brother.

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,040
don't mind him.

36
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,079
Enough.

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,720
For Nian Nian's sake,

38
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,200
I'll spare you today.

39
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,320
Let's go.

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,040
Take care of yourself first.

41
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,360
Take care of yourself.

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,680
Nian Nian.

43
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,000
Stay away from him.

44
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,120
Young Master

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,000
You're awake

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,280
Erhu

47
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,320
I'm just in a coma.

48
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm not dead.

49
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
Why are you wearing mourning?

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,360
Young Master

51
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,560
He...

52
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,640
What did he do this time?

53
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,160
He's dead.

54
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,040
What did you say?

55
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,280
You followed me.

56
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,160
I can not only help you find out who killed your father,

57
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,760
but also make you Mrs Huo.

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,760
Why are you still obsessed with that illegitimate child?

59
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,600
You are obsessed with me.

60
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,840
because I’m Huo Hanjin’s woman.

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,120
right?

62
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,920
What?

63
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,840
You don't want to?

64
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,880
I want you.

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,519
I just want him to experience

66
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,480
how it feels

67
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,880
how it feels to lose your wife.

68
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,680
I also know

69
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,160
you know business.

70
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,280
and the yarn factory.

71
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,360
I want you to help me

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,040
what Huo Hanjin took away from me.

73
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,880
and take back my position in the Huo family.

74
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,400
Sure.

75
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,440
Let's make a deal.

76
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,520
Tell me.

77
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,760
Who is the murderer?

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Are you okay?

79
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,000
Tell me.

80
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,960
who killed my father.

81
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,360
Huo...

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,760
Huo Hanjin!

83
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,440
Huo Hanjin!

84
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,520
You...

85
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,000
Qi Xuan.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
Qi Xuan.

87
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,960
I'm your mother. I'm your mother.

88
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,600
Although I'm not your mother,

89
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,120
we are mother and son after all.

90
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,120
Why are you leaving?

91
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,080
Master.

92
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,320
We have found out his whereabouts.

93
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,400
The last person he saw was...

94
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,680
Tell me.

95
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,520
It's Second Young Madam.

96
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
What Second Young Mistress?

97
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,400
Su Nian Qing

98
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,040
is no longer a member of our Huo family.

99
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,240
She killed Qi Xuan.

100
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,160
The day my brother died.

101
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,960
Su Nian Qing

102
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,240
I did see him.

103
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,800
It's Su Nian Qing indeed.

104
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,760
She doesn't

105
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,800
the Huo family at all.

106
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,880
Tell everyone in the Chamber of Commerce

107
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,680
no matter what he does,

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,160
from now on,

109
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,520
all cooperation with the Su family

110
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,680
with the Su family.

111
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,840
Yes.

112
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,240
Su Nian Qing.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,560
You can't stay.

114
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,640
Let me go.

115
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,520
If Su Nian Qing kills my brother,

116
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,720
I'll kill her myself.

117
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,440
Master.

118
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,680
I'm afraid that Young Master

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,200
for Su Nian Qing.

120
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,000
Haven't you always wanted to join the management of the ship station?

121
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,680
They need someone reliable.

122
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,840
to

123
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,440
this matter.

124
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,200
Yes.

125
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,680
Father.

126
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,680
Hanjin.

127
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,240
You're the only son of the Huo family now.

128
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
Don't let me down.

129
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,320
Okay.

130
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,760
Master.

131
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,520
Let's go.

132
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,600
You can leave now.

133
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,240
Hanjin!

134
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,040
Hanjin.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,080
The one who has been blocking us

136
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,360
is Su Nian Qing.

137
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,400
If Young Master could kill her,

138
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,360
it's not your turn to teach me what to do.

139
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,800
You...

140
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,080
As long as you can kill Su Nian Qing,

141
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,640
I can help you get more than the Wheel Bureau,

142
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,840
and everything about the Huo family.

143
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,440
Who are you to decide

144
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,120
Who are you to decide?

145
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,440
Nian Nian.

146
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,880
Nian Nian.

147
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,560
Why didn't you tell me

148
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,720
Why didn't you tell me?

149
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,000
Don't go anywhere now.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,960
Stay at home.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,520
I've sent someone to investigate the murderer.

152
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
I will clear your name.

153
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,160
Brother.

154
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,800
I didn't kill Huo Qixuan.

155
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,160
You don't have to say anything.

156
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,240
Of course I trust you.

157
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,680
Young Master!

158
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,040
Young Master!

159
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,920
Bad news.

160
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,560
Nian Nian.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,480
Have a good rest.

162
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,440
Don't go anywhere.

163
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
I will find a way to prove your innocence.

164
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,200
I don't know what happened.

165
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,160
From top to bottom,

166
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,000
from top to bottom.

167
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,480
When Nian Nian was suspected,

168
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
when Nian Nian was suspected.

169
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,080
I'm afraid the Huo family is behind this.

170
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,120
Young Master.

171
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,760
You have to find a way.

172
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,800
How's the investigation going?

173
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,600
The murderer who killed Huo Qixuan

174
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,240
is now in the abandoned flour factory in the west of the city.

175
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,320
Thank you.

176
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:51,920
[I'll prove my innocence.] Okay.

177
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,120
But I will prove my innocence.

178
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,800
The Yaheng Party

179
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,800
Weiyu Committee.

180
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,360
Yin Peng.

181
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:49,720
Yin Peng.

182
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,040
Cheng Peng Qingxue, Ke Yangwei.

183
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,240
Peng...

184
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,680
Cheng, Peng Qingxue, Keyang.

185
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,000
Mingxin is smart.
