1
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,200
Master!

2
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,480
Get him! Get him!

3
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,760
How dare you!

4
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,520
How dare you seduce your sister-in-law?

5
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,560
I miss you.

6
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,480
I'm willing to marry you

7
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,440
and stay with you forever.

8
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,360
and be with you forever.

9
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Just like your mother,

10
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,400
You're a disgrace.

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,360
Since you're my son,

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,840
I let you into the Huo family.

13
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,680
You shouldn't covet things that don't belong to you.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,800
You misunderstood.

15
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,600
This handkerchief...

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,160
to give this to you.

17
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,360
In that case,

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,200
prepare for your brother's wedding.

19
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,320
Get this done.

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,039
Don't delay the marriage between Su and Huo families.

21
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:50,920
Okay.

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,920
Okay.

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,200
I got it.

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,760
Nian Nian.

25
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,640
Eat it while it's hot.

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,200
I made you Yangchun Noodles.

27
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,680
Can you try something else?

28
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,200
Why do you cook noodles for me whenever you need me?

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,000
Here.

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,600
Let me guess.

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,760
it's related to Young Master Huo's marriage.

32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,800
Huo Qixuan is gentle and mediocre.

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,960
In the future,

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,600
I have to choose my own marriage.

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,400
Who would choose for me?

36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,400
Do you really want me to marry into the Huo family?

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,200
The Huo family

38
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,079
is not as good as our Su family,

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,000
but in the future, we want to go further

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,320
and work with the Huo family

41
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,560
is the best choice.

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,320
I think what you said makes sense.

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,040
The son of the Huo family

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,160
might really be my Mr. Right.

45
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,560
Yes.

46
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,800
Master.

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,440
Young Master Huo is here.

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,120
Speak of the devil.

49
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,320
Hello, Mr. Su.

50
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,280
Hello.

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,760
Uncle Su.

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,560
My brother caught a cold

53
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,320
he was afraid that he might infect you and Miss Su.

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
So he asked me

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,640
to discuss the details of the wedding.

56
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,680
Hanjin.

57
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,960
Please come in.

58
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,000
Miss Su.

59
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,480
Where are you taking me?

60
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,720
Miss Su.

61
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,960
This is your bedroom.

62
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
It's inappropriate.

63
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,640
You're my future sister-in-law.

64
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,400
Really?

65
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,320
Then I shouldn't call you Mister.

66
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,440
I should call you uncle.

67
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,240
I thought I was cunning and calculative.

68
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,040
I didn't expect

69
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,280
I was fooled by you.

70
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,000
What do you mean?

71
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,600
If I remember correctly,

72
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
you asked me out first.

73
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,000
Why am I playing with you?

74
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,680
The love words on your handkerchief

75
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,200
contains our names.

76
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,440
The flower symbolizes a win-win situation.

77
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,040
When you gave me the handkerchief,

78
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,320
when you gave me the handkerchief.

79
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,720
But my father received the news early.

80
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,360
It means

81
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,760
you planned all this.

82
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,880
With your scheming strategy,

83
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,959
one day,

84
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,120
I'll be driven to a dead end by you.

85
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,959
You're much smarter

86
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,079
than your stupid brother.

87
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,120
I'm satisfied.

88
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,480
Aren't you afraid that I'll ruin this marriage?

89
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,000
I guess in Yun City,

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,320
in Yun City.

91
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,240
you were the illegitimate son

92
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,280
Mr. Huo's illegitimate son.

93
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,560
The reason he kept you

94
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,560
because he was afraid that his family would be exposed.

95
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,600
Second, he wants you

96
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,760
his precious son, Huo Qixuan.

97
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,760
I didn't expect the investigation to be so clear.

98
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,880
In other words,

99
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,160
if these secrets were revealed to others,

100
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,160
and ruin the reputation of the Huo family,

101
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,960
I'm afraid your father won't let you stay.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,720
I'll keep these secrets for you.

103
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,120
Actually,

104
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,640
saved your life.

105
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,040
Why don't you save me?

106
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,680
I'll protect you forever.

107
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,200
See you at the wedding.

108
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,680
It's indeed Miss Su and Mr Huo's wedding.

109
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,200
Yes, it's magnificent.

110
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,159
Why isn't the groom here yet?

111
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,000
How could something like this go wrong?

112
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,840
It’s my dream

113
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,000
to marry the Su family.

114
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,520
Unfortunately, his eldest son, Huo Qi Xuan,

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
is doing nothing.

116
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,360
It's not a good thing.

117
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,320
Brother.

118
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,960
Here's to you.

119
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,240
Brother.

120
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,320
Thanks to my love for you.

121
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
Your marriage with the Su family

122
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,160
can go so smoothly.

123
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,160
But after you marry Miss Su,

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,200
I’m afraid

125
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,120
have no chance to drink like this again.

126
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,000
Although

127
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,000
I hate you.

128
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,640
But sometimes I really envy you.

129
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,640
Look at me.

130
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,600
I'm the eldest son of the Huo family.

131
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,800
In your eyes,

132
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,440
I'm just a pawn.

133
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,440
They all agree

134
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,520
to this marriage.

135
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,560
Did anyone ask my opinion?

136
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,840
Your fate is arranged by me.

137
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,440
But my fate

138
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,720
is up to me.

139
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,040
What a perfect match.

140
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,560
And since they met,

141
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,840
since they met.

142
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,040
Master, we can't find him.

143
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,680
What?

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,640
Nonsense.

145
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,240
Find him.

146
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,960
Bring him to me even if he's unconscious.

147
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,920
No matter what, hold the wedding for me.

148
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,120
Do you hear me?

149
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,920
Yes.

150
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,440
The auspicious time has passed.

151
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Mr. Huo.

152
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,000
What a scene!

153
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,320
Could it be...

154
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,400
the only daughter of the Su family?

155
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,080
No.

156
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,760
What are you talking about?

157
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,960
Master Su.

158
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
I just asked someone to urge him.

159
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,280
The child is still preparing carefully.

160
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,160
Calm down.

161
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,720
Have a seat.

162
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,600
The peach tree is beautiful.

163
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,480
The candles are shining.

164
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,800
Brides and grooms are in pairs.

165
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,600
Look.

166
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,440
to the flower hall.

167
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,600
Sir, you're late.

168
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,000
Fortunately, I didn't let you down.

169
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,000
Aren't you marrying the eldest son, Huo Qixuan?

170
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,120
How did you become Huo Hanjin?

171
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,600
This...

172
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,320
Nonsense.

173
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,720
Marriage

174
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,960
How can you be so childish?

175
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,000
I want Huo Qixuan,

176
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,840
not Huo Hanjin.

177
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,760
Father-in-law.

178
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,200
Nian Nian and I really love each other.

179
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,800
I'll treat her wholeheartedly from now on.

180
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,640
I won't let her suffer.

181
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,760
Please grant her wish.

182
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,880
This is my choice.

183
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,160
I'm willing to marry him.

184
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,720
Then...

185
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,920
Have you really decided?

186
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,400
Let's begin.

187
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,280
Witness, please print it.

188
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,760
Please print it.

189
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,680
Uncle Sheng.

190
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,760
I'll help you manage the Huo family.

191
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,280
But don't forget what you promised me.

192
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,640
