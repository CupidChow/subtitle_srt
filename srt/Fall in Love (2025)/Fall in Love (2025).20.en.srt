1
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,600
Ready. Ready. Ready.

2
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,920
It's over.

3
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,720
From now on,

4
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,280
everything is a new beginning.

5
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,520
Nian Nian.

6
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,720
I want to be with you in another identity.

7
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,720
I want to protect you

8
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,800
as your brother,

9
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,320
and love you.

10
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,760
So, Su Nian Qing,

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,720
please marry me.

12
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,360
Only when I'm with you,

13
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,840
can the Su family go back to the past

14
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,560
and not let you down.

15
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,720
for our Su family.

16
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,400
Promise me.

17
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,040
This time,

18
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,680
I want to wear a wedding dress.

19
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,720
What?

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,079
I want to

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,040
I want to wear the wedding dress you made for me.

22
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,360
Okay.

23
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,160
I promise you.

24
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,079
The Su family needs two things the most.

25
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,440
First is the airline channel that the Huo family manages.

26
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,160
and high cash.

27
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,200
Huo Hanjin just died.

28
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
someone told me

29
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,000
I could have both things.

30
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,040
I've been in business for so many years,

31
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,040
I've never encountered such a good thing.

32
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,240
Do you think I'm a fool?

33
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,120
Mr Shen,

34
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,079
Of course we have our own plans.

35
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,440
The cash is mortgaged by Su’s big and small enterprises.

36
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,840
Mr. Jin lent it to you.

37
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,880
After that,

38
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,920
Mr. Jin wants Su’s Group

39
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,680
30% shares.

40
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,839
No.

41
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,720
No matter what,

42
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,880
mortgage Su’s assets.

43
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,280
This is the only way.

44
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,680
Besides that,

45
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,640
I also have contact with some foreign trade capital.

46
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,480
They can help us overcome the difficulties

47
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,159
and get foreign funds.

48
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,240
That's an act of hurting the entire nation's industrial.

49
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,480
We can’t do anything.

50
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,880
My original intention of doing business

51
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,280
is to revitalize the national industry.

52
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
The most important thing now

53
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,400
find out who Mr. Jin is.

54
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,320
The one who forced us into the difficult situation

55
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,080
was Xu Zixiao.

56
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
Then someone appeared

57
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,120
took the initiative to pull us out.

58
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,040
to get the shares of the Su family.

59
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,440
Even if we can’t find it,

60
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,640
I can guess this person

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,200
must be Xu Zixiao.

62
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,400
Now that you know who Mr. Jin is,

63
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,040
it’ll be easy.

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,320
After all,

65
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,160
he set us up first.

66
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,240
Happy cooperation.

67
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,280
Happy cooperation.

68
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,280
Besides,

69
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,040
I have another favor to ask you.

70
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,040
Go ahead.

71
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,320
My wedding with Miss Su is coming.

72
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,040
Mr. Jin is highly respected.

73
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:44,760
So,

74
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,960
I want him to be our witness.

75
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,520
The cooperation between the Su family and Mr. Jin is still long.

76
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,080
This is

77
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,640
our sincerity.

78
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,400
Congratulations, Mr Shen.

79
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,320
I'll definitely bring it.

80
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,960
See you.

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,680
Mr. Jin

82
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,920
We've talked about Shen Renran.

83
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,400
This is the invitation from him.

84
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,280
He wants to invite you to be a witness.

85
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,560
I don't like

86
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,000
these things.

87
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,440
Take it.

88
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,280
Yes, ma'am.

89
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,720
What?

90
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,720
Not satisfied?

91
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,520
One year ago,

92
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
my father personally made a wedding dress for me.

93
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
But at that time,

94
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,400
I didn't understand your intention.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,400
and insisted on wearing a wedding dress.

96
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
Then our wedding...

97
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,560
wear that wedding dress?

98
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,120
When are we getting married?

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,360
Three days later.

100
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,120
So soon?

101
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,280
If you delay any longer,

102
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,280
we can’t hide it.

103
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,960
It's bad for both you and the Su family's reputation.

104
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,320
Don’t worry.

105
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,560
I will take good care of you and the baby.

106
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,880
and raise him.

107
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,400
Let's try on the wedding dress tomorrow.

108
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,600
Okay.

109
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,280
Nian Nian.

110
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,080
Put it on.

111
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,400
Let me see.

112
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,480
Okay.

113
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,880
Nian Nian.

114
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,120
Are you okay?

115
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
I'm fine.

116
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,760
Nian Nian.

117
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,800
All the clues point to Shen Ren Ran.

118
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,840
If you trust me,

119
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,560
I'm willing to help you

120
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,280
take back everything that belonged to us.

121
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,600
In this gun,

122
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,080
in this gun.

123
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,320
I believe I can fool Shen Renran.

124
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,400
Do you miss me?

125
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,720
Do you know how worried I was?

126
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,320
Don't worry.

127
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,840
I won't stop you

128
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,480
doing what you want to do.

129
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,920
Everything is going as planned.

130
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,760
I don't want you to hurt yourself anymore.

131
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,480
Nian Nian.

132
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,280
Nian Nian.

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,800
Not done yet?

134
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,360
No.

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,960
He's still outside.

136
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,040
Nian Nian.

137
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,880
Do you need help?

138
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,320
Nian Nian.

139
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,960
I'm coming in.

140
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,080
No need.

141
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,000
Nian Nian.

142
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,000
Nian Nian.

143
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,040
I'm coming in.

144
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,760
Nian Nian.

145
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,520
The Yaheng Party

146
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,520
Weiyu Committee.

147
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,040
Yin Peng.

148
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,160
Yangwei.

149
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,280
Cheng Peng Qingxue Ke Yangwei.

150
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,560
Cheng Peng Qingxue Keyang
