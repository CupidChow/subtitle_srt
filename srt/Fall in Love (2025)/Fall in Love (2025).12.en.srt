1
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,560
Why are you here?

2
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,240
Why are you here alone?

3
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,640
Do you really want to

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,640
with Xu Zixiao?

5
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,480
It's none of your business.

6
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,560
You just divorced me.

7
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,920
and now you're trying to

8
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,320
to get back to work.

9
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,120
Don't you have the right to be jealous?

10
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,280
I think you misunderstood.

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,360
When did I promise

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,720
to start over with you?

13
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,680
You're just my hostage.

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,080
I advise you

15
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,920
too immersed in the character.

16
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,479
Now,

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,200
I'm barely qualified.

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,640
We need to check.

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,640
What are you doing?

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Huo Hanjin, you hurt me.

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,920
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,320
I always

23
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,240
always take revenge.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,640
How do I look today?

25
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,960
It's pretty.

26
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,040
But today is just a daily date.

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,960
You don't have to be so grand.

28
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,200
Madam.

29
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,880
What are you doing?

30
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,120
Close your eyes.

31
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,400
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,240
You misunderstood.

33
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,120
I'm going to meet another man.

34
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,240
Su Nian Qing.

35
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,240
Am I not enough?

36
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,400
You didn't do your best.

37
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,480
Su Nian Qing, think carefully.

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,320
What will happen if you say so?

39
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,640
Please.

40
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,200
Miss Su.

41
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,240
This is a token of my gratitude.

42
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,520
The Zhou family is a big business.

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,040
in the future.

44
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,360
So please take care of me.

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,120
We need to talk.

46
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's talk inside.

47
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
Where are the handcuffs?

48
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,720
How did you open it?

49
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,920
You're so naive

50
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,720
How naive.

51
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,120
How is it?

52
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,040
How did they do?

53
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,520
For example, that bastard from the Zhou family.

54
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
Or

55
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,720
that charming singer

56
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,080
Compared to you,

57
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,840
compared to you.

58
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,880
What if something happens

59
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
if something happens?

60
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,960
Mr. Huo.

61
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,920
I'm not the only one

62
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,960
to do anything.

63
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,480
Really?

64
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,600
Then what is it that has to be me?

65
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,320
All right.

66
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,280
If you don't let me go,

67
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,600
I can't do

68
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,840
you asked me to do.

69
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,880
Don't talk nonsense.

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,360
We have to get this done today.

71
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,400
Okay.

72
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,920
Don't worry.

73
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,640
I will do my best.

74
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,720
Wrong.

75
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,400
must be you.

76
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,080
Yes.

77
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,440
Father.

78
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,040
Don’t worry.

79
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,800
I’ll take back everything

80
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,640
back little by little.

81
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,880
The Su family's establishment of Susutra Children's City.

82
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,000
Thank you all for coming here.

83
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,960
Thank you for your generous invitation.

84
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,720
Mr Xu.

85
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,240
We're here today

86
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,400
for the machines in your hand.

87
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,280
Besides the factory,

88
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,480
and the Huo family.

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,920
But the Su family

90
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,760
in the Su family.

91
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,520
was burned down.

92
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,400
I think

93
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,840
they are not qualified

94
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,600
to compete with us for the machines.

95
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,400
Are you here to eat

96
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,360
or ask us for some charity?

97
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,680
I can stand here today

98
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,040
because of your bargaining chips.

99
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,560
belongs to the Su family.

100
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,520
Su,

101
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,480
we are your seniors after all.

102
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,040
Your father died early.

103
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,120
Didn't he teach you to respect your elders?

104
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,120
Mr. Zhou,

105
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Why don't you leave yourself some space?

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,360
You don’t know it, do you?

107
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,320
When I had coffee with Mr. Zhou,

108
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,200
I knew a lot of your secrets.

109
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,080
Mr. Zhou smuggled foreign yarn

110
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,200
and disturbed the industry.

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,720
If I give these evidence to the newspaper,

112
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,200
I wonder if Mr. Zhou

113
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,520
will be ruined.

114
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,440
Su Nian Qing.

115
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,480
Stop dreaming.

116
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,960
The Su family has nothing now.

117
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,680
Even if Mr Xu

118
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,000
will not be wasted

119
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,240
I won't give it to you for nothing.

120
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,760
But what does Master Qian have?

121
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,120
If I remember correctly,

122
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Master Qian.

123
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,480
He was eager to be a good man.

124
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,120
You changed your surname on the first day you married into the family.

125
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,720
You don’t even have your family name.

126
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,520
Who are you to say that?

127
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,880
Zi.

128
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,440
Master Qian.

129
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,880
Are you familiar?

130
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,720
You...

131
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,080
Why did you ask her to come here?

132
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,880
This is the guest

133
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
for you.

134
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,480
This...

135
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,880
Please.

136
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,880
The son-in-law of the Qian family

137
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,600
has a lover outside.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,160
and a child.

139
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,720
I wonder if Mrs. Qian and your father-in-law

140
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,400
what will happen

141
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,360
Mr. Qian?

142
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,280
Since we've come to this point,

143
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,680
If you don't want to suffer,

144
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,240
I'll get down to business.

145
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,520
Yaheng Party.

146
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,520
Weiyu Committee

147
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,080
Yaheng Party

148
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,080
Weiyu Committee.

149
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,800
Yin Peng.

150
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,160
Yin Peng.

151
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,720
Yangwei.

152
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,280
Cheng Peng Qingxue Ke Yangwei.

153
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,840
Cheng Peng Qingxue, Ke Yangwei.

154
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,240
Cheng Peng Qingxue.

155
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:31,720
Hao.

156
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:32,760
Yu.

157
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,080
Xincong.
