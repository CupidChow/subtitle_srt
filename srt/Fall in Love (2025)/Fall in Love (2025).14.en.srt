1
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,080
What are you doing? I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you.

2
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,400
Because you stole Huo Hanjin.

3
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,520
I was pregnant with Huo Qixuan's child.

4
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,840
But they forced me to abort my child.

5
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,360
They said I don't deserve it.

6
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,280
I don't deserve it. You don't deserve it?

7
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,720
Do you deserve it?

8
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:20,800
So...

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I killed the baby in your belly too.

10
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,320
Hwang Young.

11
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,200
You're crazy.

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,560
You ruined yourself.

13
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,640
What I hate the most

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,759
the way you are.

15
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,080
Are you okay?

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,640
Huo Hanjin!

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,680
This woman broke us up.

18
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,360
Why are you still protecting her?

19
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,000
Huang Ying.

20
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,800
never had us.

21
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,320
You got what you are today

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,800
because you deserve it.

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,880
I'm warning you.

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,200
If you dare lay a finger on Su Nian Qing again,

25
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,120
I won't let you off!

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,600
Stop right there!

27
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,600
I told you before.

28
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,640
you can't keep this woman.

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,640
She is my woman.

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,120
You know your last name?

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,680
Don't you know how many things

32
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,160
Don't you know?

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,360
Those things belong to the Su family.

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,720
Don't you know?

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,800
You still know that I'm your father?

36
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,280
Don't forget

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,040
how you got into the Huo family.

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,360
Everything you have now is given by me.

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,200
I can give you everything.

40
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,960
I can get everything back.

41
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,120
Of course I didn't forget.

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,600
You kicked my mother out.

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,640
You also freezed my mother to death on the street.

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,200
But don't forget that

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
I'm the only bastard

46
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,640
except you.

47
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,200
You...

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,680
Father.

49
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,760
You're old.

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,080
Don't get angry.

51
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,480
If you die,

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,960
everything in Huo Residence

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,720
will be mine.

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,240
Nian Nian, let's go.

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,240
Let's go.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,920
I can get you back even if you leave.

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,960
Miss Su, you're awake.

58
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,640
Uncle Zhao.

59
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,200
Why are you here?

60
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,880
Where am I?

61
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,520
Young Master Huo

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,720
for retired employees like us

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
for retired employees.

64
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,680
is my home.

65
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,800
Of course I'm here.

66
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,240
Young Master Huo.

67
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,120
Yes.

68
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,800
Uncle Zhao.

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,680
Young Master

70
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,040
Miss Su.

71
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,840
You can ask Young Master directly.

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,640
Okay.

73
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,160
Nian Nian.

74
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,120
You're finally awake.

75
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,079
What happened?

76
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
My father took over Su’s factory.

77
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,320
Those old workers

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,440
were all fired.

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,520
You and I are a couple.

80
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,000
Of course I have to

81
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,120
for you.

82
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,240
Thank you.

83
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,640
for me.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
The Su family

85
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,560
You did so much.

86
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,960
I should thank you.

87
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,720
Don't worry.

88
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,400
From now on,

89
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,360
I will protect you

90
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,120
and our baby.

91
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,680
What child?

92
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,640
I know everything.

93
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,640
You're pregnant again.

94
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,800
That day,

95
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,520
I saw the prescription

96
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,920
on the table of your room.

97
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,600
It's written on it.

98
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,080
It was forged.

99
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,800
To find out

100
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,040
who killed my child.

101
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,120
Fabricated.

102
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,800
By the way,

103
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,960
drink this medicine first.

104
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,160
It's a bit bitter.

105
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,360
I'll peel an apple for you.

106
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,440
Okay.

107
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,320
It's hot.

108
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,360
for letting you down.

110
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,200
The road ahead is dangerous.

111
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,640
If you knew I was pregnant again,

112
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,400
you will stop me from avenging my father.

113
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,600
Brother Liu.

114
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:57,920
Are you making firewood?

115
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,640
Go shopping.

116
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,600
Vegetables

117
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,040
The kids are back today.

118
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,400
I often wonder

119
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,120
if you weren't Mr. Huo,

120
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm not Miss Su.

121
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,800
We are just children of ordinary families.

122
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,560
Wouldn't we be happier?

123
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,280
No matter who you are,

124
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,960
I will make you happy.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,880
Have a seat.

126
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,440
Have some sweet wine soup.

127
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,240
Warm yourself up.

128
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,560
Here.

129
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,960
During the pregnancy,

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,280
you mustn't drink.

131
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,680
What's wrong?

132
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,440
Today,

133
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,840
drink today.

134
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:58,600
Who?

135
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,120
Young Master, it's me

136
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,680
Young Master

137
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,000
We found the person who shot.

138
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,880
What is it?

139
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,520
Nian Nian.

140
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,320
I want to tell you something.

141
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,280
that I should tell you.

142
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,640
We found the man

143
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,960
who shot your father at the wedding.

144
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,960
He's not dead.

145
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,440
This gunman often appears in two places.

146
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,840
One is a tavern in the east.

147
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,400
and the other is his hiding house.

148
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,600
Let's split up.

149
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,680
Go to the tavern.

150
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,520
I'll go to the cabin.

151
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,920
Don't let him get away!

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,480
No!

153
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
I can't let you take the risk alone.

154
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,080
I've been waiting for a year.

155
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
I can't miss any chance to take revenge.

156
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,800
Erhu.

157
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,480
Follow Madam Mu'er.

158
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,560
and protect her.

159
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,480
Yes, Young Master

160
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,640
No matter what,

161
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,360
you can't put yourself in danger.

162
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,440
Don't worry.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,280
Huo Hanjin.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,880
You've done enough for me.

165
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
You don't have to

166
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
between the Huo family and me.

167
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,240
The bowl is still warm.

168
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,640
He hasn't gone far.

169
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,480
Look around.

170
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:36,960
Okay.

171
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,480
Miss Su.

172
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,560
You're here.

173
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,800
You killed my father.

174
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,920
I shot him.

175
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,520
Who ordered you to do this?

176
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,400
Huo Zhenhua.

177
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,120
This is the gun Huo Zhenhua gave me.

178
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,320
It was this gun

179
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
was this gun.

180
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,200
Before I finish Huo Zhenhua,

181
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,000
you’d better live well.

182
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,200
The Yaheng Party

183
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,200
Weiyu Committee.

184
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:38,840
Yin Peng.

185
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:40,680
Cheng Peng, Da Xue, Yang Wei.

186
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,000
Cheng Peng Qingxue, Ke Yangwei.

187
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,080
Cheng Peng Qingxue but Yangwei.
