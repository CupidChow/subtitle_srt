1
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,600
This day

2
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,920
for a year.

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,360
Tomorrow,

4
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,840
we must do this well.

5
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,879
I will never let another man marry you.

6
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,920
One year ago.

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,600
Tomorrow will be the same.

8
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,800
What took you so long?

9
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,960
I must be very careful

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,360
Of course I have to be very careful.

11
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,520
Father.

12
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,320
Did you see that?

13
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,120
I'm going to marry Nian Nian.

14
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,880
I'm going to take back everything that belongs to us.

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,880
Even if you look down on me,

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,200
the Su family and Nian Nian are mine now.

17
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,800
Father.

18
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,320
I will take good care of the Su family.

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,120
Father.

20
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,560
Don't worry.

21
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,960
I will avenge you.

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,920
Nian Nian.

23
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,800
Today is our big day.

24
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,040
Thank you.

25
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,280
Not at all.

26
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,200
This day has finally come.

27
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,880
Nan Nan.

28
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
Mr. Hong. Mr. Cao.

29
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,520
Congratulations.

30
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,080
Thank you.

31
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,000
Thank you.

32
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,680
Mr. Li.

33
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,320
Congratulations, Mr Shen.

34
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,840
Okay.

35
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,920
Congratulations, Mr Shen.

36
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,720
Please come in.

37
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,160
Okay.

38
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,520
Thank you for the food.

39
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,560
Congratulations, Mr Shen.

40
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,600
Thank you.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,800
Where is Mr. Jin?

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,720
He's here. Let's go. Let's go.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,640
Keep a close watch.

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,840
Once he appears,

45
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,960
do as planned.

46
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,440
Yes, sir.

47
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,680
Chairman Cho.

48
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,320
Congratulations.

49
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,000
Please come in

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,840
The bride is here

51
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,240
Please.

52
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,000
Please.

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,200
So beautiful

54
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:41,840
Congratulations, Boss Shen

55
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,240
Please come in

56
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,720
Congratulations.

57
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,360
Nian Nian.

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,640
This is...

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,600
Before that,

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,760
I have something to tell you.

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,320
Here.

62
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,680
Now

63
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,640
Yes.

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,760
Okay.

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,280
I've been envious of kids with older brothers since I was young.

66
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,200
And my father

67
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,840
brought you home.

68
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,400
I'm happy.

69
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,079
Because I finally have a brother.

70
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,000
One year ago,

71
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,920
you were unhappy

72
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,000
you're always upset.

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,280
I think

74
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,080
you must be more reluctant to let me get married than dad.

75
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,680
Unfortunately,

76
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,800
didn't let you come to my wedding.

77
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,159
Yes.

78
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,280
What Master Huo and I want

79
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,040
is the same.

80
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,920
Yes.

81
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,760
If he dies,

82
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,600
is good for both of us.

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,560
After father passed away,

84
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,800
you did everything you could

85
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,600
to transfer Su’s assets

86
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,840
so that you can protect the Su family for me.

87
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,240
From now on,

88
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,960
in the future.

89
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes.

90
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,240
Kill Huo Zhenhua.

91
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,200
You used Huang Ying to kill Huo Zhenhua.

92
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,040
but you framed me.

93
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,240
He also told everyone that Huo Hanjin killed my father

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
and let himself escape.

95
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,840
Nian Nian.

96
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,280
What are you talking about?

97
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,880
What are you doing?

98
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,840
Of course I want to thank you.

99
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,480
This toast

100
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,720
on behalf of dad.

101
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,560
Just like

102
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,280
you gave me back then.

103
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,640
Look, it's so beautiful.

104
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,040
Yes.

105
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,159
I want a wedding like this too.

106
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,760
Aren't you getting lucky soon?

107
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,600
Don't worry. It'll be your turn soon.

108
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,159
Yes.

109
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,120
Hello, sir.

110
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:49,800
What can I do for you?

111
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,320
This is the wine he ordered.

112
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,840
Please deliver it.

113
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,640
Okay.

114
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,240
Thank you.

115
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,440
Sir, your wine.

116
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,160
Thank you.

117
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,200
It's the new shop.

118
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Take me there next time.

119
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,760
Sure.

120
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,320
Okay.

121
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,800
Are you afraid of poisoning?

122
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,720
Shen Renran,

123
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,960
You're the murderer who killed my father.

124
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,159
Su Nian Qing.

125
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,120
We're siblings.

126
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,360
Now we're going to marry.

127
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,760
Why are you slandering me?

128
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,960
You know

129
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
whether it's a slander or not.

130
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,360
If it's not slander,

131
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,159
what about the evidence?

132
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,200
The evidence you want

133
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,240
are with me.

134
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,280
Huo Hanjin.

135
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,560
You colluded with this murderer

136
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,480
to plot against me.

137
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,840
Everyone.

138
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,960
He's the culprit for all this.

139
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,720
I never thought

140
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,640
you would change my diary.

141
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,080
and forged my handwriting?

142
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
What brother and sister?

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,240
What friendship?

144
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,280
are just your means of using me.

145
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Su Nian Qing.

146
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,880
Have you forgotten who has been protecting the Su family

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,400
and who protected you?

148
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,120
Didn't you just say you want evidence?

149
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,520
Then let's

150
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,680
to the world.

151
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,120
Yaheng Party

152
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,520
Wei Yu, Yang,

153
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,120
Weiyu Committee.

154
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,840
Yin Peng.

155
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,200
Yin Peng.

156
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:45,960
The snow is shiny.

157
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:45,960
Yangwei.

158
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,600
Cheng Peng, Qing Xue, Ke Yang.

159
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,280
Cheng Peng Qingxue.

160
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,400
Mingxin is smart.
