1
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,560
Xiao Ying.

2
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,880
Xiao Ying.

3
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,480
Where should I put the towel?

4
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,600
Xiao Ying.

5
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,880
Xiao Ying.

6
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,560
You...

7
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:14,840
Miss.

8
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,440
This is the men's bathroom.

9
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,160
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,400
I went the wrong way.

11
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,280
Don't do this again.

12
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,160
Miss.

13
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,160
Slow down.

14
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,479
Don't fall again.

15
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,320
No.

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:50,960
This...

17
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,200
Who is this lady?

18
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,840
has such a hobby?

19
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,440
She's the eldest daughter of the Su family.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,920
Su Nian Qing.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,280
Your future sister-in-law.

22
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,240
You know her?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,760
No.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,720
I'd like to see

25
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,240
what she is up to.

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,240
Tell her

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,120
If you want the necklace, come to the New World Nightclub.

28
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,000
Nightclub?

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,680
Why did you ask me out here?

30
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,079
Miss, this way.

31
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,600
Miss, what would you like to drink?

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,880
A glass of water, please.

33
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,600
Okay

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,480
Young Master

35
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,640
It's not good if Eldest Young Master knows about this.

36
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,840
As long as I want it,

37
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,600
must be mine.

38
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,600
No matter who it is,

39
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,840
Isn't this Miss Su?

40
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,680
I asked you out so many times but you didn't come out.

41
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,600
You pretended to be serious.

42
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,280
Why did you come here alone today?

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,280
I rejected you

44
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,440
because I hate you.

45
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,960
I'd like to see

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,280
how long

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,880
stop pretending?

48
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,280
Stop pretending.

49
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,960
Don't be shameless.

50
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,280
My woman!

51
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,200
How dare you touch her!

52
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,240
Young Master.

53
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,400
You...

54
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,920
Get lost!

55
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,840
Are you okay?

56
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,480
I thought

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,680
come today.

58
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,480
Sir, your wine.

59
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,080
Thank you.

60
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,280
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,480
I shouldn't have asked you to come here.

62
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Where's my necklace?

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,000
Go ahead.

64
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,200
Are you here

65
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,040
for this necklace

66
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,040
or for me?

67
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
For you.

68
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,320
The necklace in your hand

69
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,880
So pretty.

70
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,920
It's from my mother.

71
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,120
Of course.

72
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,760
I'm not talking about the necklace.

73
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,480
Don't go. I can still drink.

74
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,240
Be careful.

75
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,640
I feel dizzy.

76
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,120
Miss Su.

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,360
Wake up.

78
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,040
Don't go.

79
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,920
Don't go.

80
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,560
Be careful.

81
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,760
Be careful.

82
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
Where is your address?

83
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,520
I'll call a taxi to send you home.

84
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,720
Don't go.

85
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,640
Where is her bedroom?

86
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,120
This way.

87
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,920
Go make her hangover soup.

88
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,640
I'll be right there.

89
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,640
We have plenty of time.

90
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,880
Miss, you're awake.

91
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,840
Am I seeing it right?

92
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,000
The man who sent you back is the second young master of the Huo family.

93
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,000
He is Huo Hanjin.

94
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,520
That's why I'm willing to act with him.

95
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
But Miss,

96
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,480
you're marrying Huo Qixuan,

97
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,360
not Huo Hanjin.

98
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,280
So what?

99
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,200
The business world of Yun City is like a chess game.

100
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,480
Huo Qixuan is just a pawn of the Huo family.

101
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,840
Huo Hanjin is the last player.

102
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,040
If I join hands with him,

103
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,440
to take over Yuncheng Spinning Factory.

104
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,120
When Huo Hanjin returned to the Huo family,

105
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,200
He took over half of the Huo family's business in just two years.

106
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,640
He's very scheming.

107
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,280
He's very cunning.

108
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,240
He's no ordinary person.

109
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,040
I gave him a gift.

110
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,560
If he catches it,

111
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,920
he will be rich.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,240
What if I can't?

113
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,920
then

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,240
is the price for him bullying me.

115
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,360
Stop!

116
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,800
Sorry, Young Master

117
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,480
Master

118
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,760
Bastard!

119
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,039
How dare you!

120
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,799
How dare you seduce your sister-in-law?

121
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,480
The Yaheng Party

122
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,480
Weiyu Committee.

123
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,840
Yin Peng.

124
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,000
Xue Ke Yang Wei.

125
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,000
Cheng Peng Qingxue Keyang.

126
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,600
Mingxin Cong, Xiaohao.
