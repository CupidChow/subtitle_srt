1
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,000
Young Master

2
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,520
Here he is.

3
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,040
He's inside.

4
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,120
Keep an eye on Master.

5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,520
Okay.

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,000
Go.

7
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,000
Nian Nian.

8
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,240
Why are you here?

9
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,840
You killed him.

10
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,840
It's my fault.

11
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,759
You must be scared.

12
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:55,560
Don't come over.

13
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,200
Nian Nian.

14
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,960
Huo Qixuan said

15
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,360
you killed my father.

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,000
You trust Huo Qixuan.

17
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,920
I don't trust him.

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,000
But I don't trust you either.

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,440
It doesn't matter if you believe me or not.

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,360
We can't stay here for long.

21
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,759
Let's get out of here.

22
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,240
I'll shoot you.

23
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,920
Nian Nian.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,040
This is a conspiracy.

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,280
Let's get out of here first.

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,440
They're almost there.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,440
Nian Nian.

28
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,400
Nian Nian.

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,120
Don't come over.

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,880
Calm down. Put the gun down.

31
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,280
Stay back!

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,800
Watch out!

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,920
Are you okay?

34
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,960
Nian Nian.

35
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,320
I didn't kill Butler Zhang.

36
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,600
nor your father.

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,560
To be exact,

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,000
I didn't kill anyone.

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,320
Butler Zhang killed Huo Qixuan.

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,880
He knew he had no choice,

41
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,960
he committed suicide by taking poison.

42
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,520
Su Nian Qing.

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,840
You vicious woman!

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,880
Murderer!

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,280
Apologize now!

46
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,920
Nian Nian.

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,920
Trust me.

48
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,880
I never did anything wrong to you.

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
What are you doing?

50
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,560
Su Nian Qing.

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,240
Stop bluffing.

52
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,360
Isn't it enough that you killed one son of the Huo family?

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,400
How dare you kill another one?

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,840
This is the only son left in the Huo family.

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,400
Do you dare to bet?

56
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,800
Su Nian Qing.

57
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,880
What are you doing?

58
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,680
What I want

59
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,360
is to avenge my father.

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,079
Who killed your father? Who are you looking for?

61
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,480
Who will avenge Qi Xuan?

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,880
Three.

63
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,520
Since you entered the Huo family,

64
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,240
the Huo family has been in chaos.

65
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,360
Today,

66
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,880
I'll make you pay with your life.

67
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:39,960
Go!

68
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,360
Go!

69
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
They ran away.

70
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,320
Where?

71
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,400
Well...

72
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,720
Go after him!

73
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,080
Go!

74
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,720
Steamed buns.

75
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,040
Freshly steamed buns

76
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,080
Young Master

77
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,520
Young Master

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
Young Master

79
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,800
Young Master

80
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:35,880
Young Master

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,280
Young Master

82
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Come and have a look.

83
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,640
Little steamed buns.

84
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,280
Hanjin.

85
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,520
Mr. Huo.

86
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,640
We're divorced.

87
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,760
You're just my hostage.

88
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,960
You forced me to leave.

89
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,880
Now you're being my hostage.

90
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,360
What do you want?

91
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,960
I forced you to leave to protect you.

92
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,120
I was your hostage to protect you.

93
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,840
I did everything

94
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,560
to protect you.

95
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,400
Nonsense.

96
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,600
I don't believe it.

97
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,280
Where is it?

98
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,680
Let's go.

99
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
Dumpling!

100
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,320
Where could they have gone?

101
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,600
We lost them here.

102
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,240
Let's go.

103
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,880
Yes.

104
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Dumpling.

105
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,400
Nian Nian.

106
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,440
Are you okay?

107
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,920
Brother.

108
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,960
Huo Hanjin!

109
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,080
How dare you come?

110
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,600
My sister has suffered a lot

111
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,000
after she married into the Huo family.

112
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,840
I'm sorry for Nian Nian.

113
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,680
But it's not your turn to ask for my debt.

114
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,200
On the day my sister married into the Huo family,

115
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,120
my father died for no reason.

116
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,560
But your Huo family took advantage of me

117
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,280
to take over the Su family business.

118
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,480
All my father’s efforts

119
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,840
was ruined.

120
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,160
Today,

121
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,040
Today,

122
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,480
with you today.

123
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,080
Brother.

124
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,920
Let me do it.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,520
Nian Nian.

126
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,720
I miss you.

127
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,840
Huo Hanjin.

128
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,800
Today, on behalf of your father,

129
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,920
for your father

130
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,160
kneel in front of my father's memorial tablet.

131
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,720
Okay.

132
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,960
Today, on behalf of the Huo family,

133
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,400
for the Huo family.

134
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,200
Do you remember

135
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,600
I will pay you back

136
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,640
I will pay you back one by one.

137
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,680
Family heirloom of filial piety.

138
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,760
Nian Nian.

139
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,960
Nian Nian.

140
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,280
Nian Nian.

141
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,080
Nian Nian.

142
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
You're finally here.

143
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,120
No one is watching you.

144
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,960
How long are you going to kneel?

145
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,240
My father's men are still watching Su Residence.

146
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,799
I'm your hostage now.

147
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,559
Since you're acting, you need to do a full set.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,799
You think too much.

149
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,240
I'll pay you back

150
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,440
I'll return them to you one by one.

151
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,920
It's just revenge.

152
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,440
Fine.

153
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,120
I'll take it as revenge. I'll take it as a revenge.

154
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,800
The Yaheng Party

155
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,800
Weiyu Committee.

156
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,880
Yin Peng.

157
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,280
Cheng Peng.

158
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,640
Cheng Peng Da Xue, Yang Wei.

159
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,320
Mingxin Cong, Xiaohao.
