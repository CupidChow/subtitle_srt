1
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,760
Hey.

2
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,080
I'm glad you're not hurt.

3
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,600
Rumor has it that

4
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,040
you killed Master Huo.

5
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,920
What happened?

6
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,320
Brother.

7
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,440
I think I fell into Huang Ying's trap.

8
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,680
What do you mean?

9
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,400
When Huang Ying rushed in,

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,920
she insisted that I killed Huo Zhenhua.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,160
But she didn't go to check his injury.

12
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,320
It's like

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,080
she knew Huo Zhenhua was dead.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,200
You mean

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,880
Huang Ying killed Huo Zhenhua?

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,280
and frame you.

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
I remember it clearly.

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,840
That shot didn't hit the vital part.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,080
Okay.

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,960
This matter

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,720
find out the truth.

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
But promise me,

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
you won't go to the Huo family again.

24
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,160
I've avenged my father.

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,520
As for the rest,

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,800
Let me do it.

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,800
Thank you.

28
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,000
Remember.

29
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,680
In this world,

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,880
we are

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,080
always a family.

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,120
Yes.

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,080
Here, have some soup.

34
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,080
Family.

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,280
I killed Huo Zhenhua for you.

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,320
That's my husband.

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,759
Now,

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,000
are we a family now?

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,520
Let's drink.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,280
Master.

41
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,480
Yes.

42
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,040
Nice wine.

43
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,880
Have you forgotten

44
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,400
you promised to marry me?

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,960
Of course I didn't forget.

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,840
I want to marry you

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,240
in front of the whole Yun City.

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
and let everyone know

49
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,560
you are the wife I married.

50
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,240
But where is the thing I want?

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,840
Where is it?

52
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,360
Mr Shen,

53
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,440
keep your promise.

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,560
Of course.

55
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,720
This is Huang Ying's recent medical bill.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,320
She went to buy raw weed

57
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,040
Raw aconite?

58
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,079
Raw grass is poisonous.

59
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,560
Brother.

60
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,520
Huang Ying drugged Huo Zhenhua.

61
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,040
That's right.

62
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,680
Huang Ying killed Huo Zhenhua

63
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,800
and then frame you for his death.

64
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,520
Huang Ying is so cruel.

65
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,960
I'll get even with her now.

66
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,360
Young Master!

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,240
Young Master.

68
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,520
Something happened to the yarn factory.

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,360
What's wrong?

70
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,520
Mr. Li from the Chamber of Commerce wants to see you.

71
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,840
Tell him

72
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,080
I don't have time to see him now.

73
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,800
Young Master.

74
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,280
He said he must see you today.

75
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,760
Otherwise...

76
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,200
Brother.

77
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,600
Let's deal with the yarn factory first.

78
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,360
Wait for me at home.

79
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,400
Don't act on your own anymore.

80
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,960
Okay?

81
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,720
Okay.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,640
Nian Nian.

83
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,960
My father's forensic test results are out.

84
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,840
Nian Nian.

85
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,520
You've been wronged.

86
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,480
The real cause of my father's death

87
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,880
was also poisonous.

88
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,320
It has nothing to do with your shot.

89
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,400
Huang Ying poisoned him.

90
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,480
That's why

91
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,200
she burned my father's body in a hurry.

92
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,920
My father and Master Huo

93
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,800
died of the same poison.

94
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,400
In other words,

95
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,920
the enemy of our father

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,440
could be the same person.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,480
Yes.

98
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,880
Nian Nian.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,400
I used to think

100
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,160
I didn't want you to get blood on your hands.

101
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,760
I don't want you to get close to all this to protect you.

102
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,000
But now,

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,280
I'll take revenge with you.

104
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,800
Miss Huang, take care.

105
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,200
Take care of yourself and check regularly.

106
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,440
Okay.

107
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,560
She is...

108
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,400
Huang Ying.

109
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,400
Are you pregnant?

110
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,240
What are you talking about?

111
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,600
Hanjin.

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,960
Master just died.

113
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,480
Why are you with this vicious woman?

114
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,360
Of course I need to find the murderer who killed my father.

115
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,960
It's you.

116
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,680
poisoned my father.

117
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,240
Master was killed by this vicious woman.

118
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,680
Before you destroyed the evidence,

119
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,120
before you destroyed the evidence.

120
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,800
Huang Ying.

121
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,160
Do you really think you can fool everyone?

122
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,280
No.

123
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,480
It's not me.

124
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,400
It's her.

125
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,720
Su Nian Qing killed Old Master

126
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,760
because of his father's autopsy report.

127
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,960
I was about to ask you.

128
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Why did you take my father's autopsy report?

129
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,160
He died of the same poison.

130
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,760
Was it you

131
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,600
killed my father?

132
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,280
What nonsense are you talking about?

133
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,640
Father was poisoned.

134
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,040
Stop quibbling, Huang Ying.

135
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,600
If you tell the truth,

136
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,200
I might spare your life.

137
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,520
So what?

138
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,880
So what?

139
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,280
Come on.

140
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,880
Miss Su.

141
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,240
killed me.

142
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,280
I advise you to think it through.

143
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,920
I'll let you go today.

144
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,880
But remember,

145
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,280
your life,

146
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,080
and your child.

147
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,480
I'll come and take it anytime.

148
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,880
Nian Nian.

149
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:46,920
What's wrong?

150
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,920
Are you sick?

151
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,240
Let's go.

152
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,840
Follow her.

153
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,960
we can find the person behind her.

154
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,840
And that person

155
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,960
is the real murderer.

156
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,640
Wai-yu, Commissioner.

157
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,400
Yaheng Party.

158
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,400
Weiyu Committee.

159
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,480
Yin Peng.

160
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,800
Cheng Peng Qingxue, Ke Yangwei.

161
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:54,880
Cheng Peng Qingxue, Yangwei.

162
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,280
Cheng Peng Qingxue Keyang

163
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,280
[KUN]
