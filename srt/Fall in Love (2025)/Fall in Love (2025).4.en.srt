1
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,960
What do you want to say?

2
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,920
Say it.

3
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,120
What are you going to do, sir?

4
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,200
I have something to do.

5
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,080
Sir.

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,680
I...

7
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,200
Can I go with you?

8
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,080
I'll be alone.

9
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,200
to be alone.

10
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,480
You can't go.

11
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,240
Second Young Madam.

12
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,080
How dare you!

13
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,120
I'm going to deliver the seal to Young Master

14
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,759
If you delay Young Master

15
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,720
you will be punished.

16
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,440
Brother.

17
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
I'm back.

18
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,720
Nian Nian.

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,480
Brother.

20
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,440
I'm home.

21
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,000
I miss you so much.

22
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,760
Nian Nian.

23
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,960
I'm glad you're fine.

24
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,400
They said you had a car accident.

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,200
I thought I would never see you again.

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,160
Brother.

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,720
I'm fine.

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,880
Where's Father?

29
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,880
Where is Father?

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,960
I bought him his favorite wine.

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,040
Nian Nian.

32
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,800
What's wrong?

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,840
Father has left.

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,079
Where did he go?

35
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,760
Did he go to the factory

36
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,600
or went to buy me some candied fruits?

37
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,480
Nian Nian, don't you remember?

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,440
One year ago at your wedding,

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,720
my father died.

40
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,360
Father has been gone for a year.

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,400
After my father passed away,

42
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,240
the Su family has been suppressed by the Huo family.

43
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,440
The Chamber of Commerce supported by my father

44
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,400
instead, they ate our family.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,079
In the past year,

46
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,920
for the past year.

47
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,640
but I couldn't turn back.

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,680
Nian Nian.

49
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,079
If I can see you get married,

50
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,760
I'll rest in peace.

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,800
Nian Nian.

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,520
Come back.

53
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll protect you.

54
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,400
I'm the only one who won't hurt you.

55
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,240
Brother.

56
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,680
Don't worry.

57
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,560
I will find out who killed my father.

58
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,920
You are my only family.

59
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,959
You must be safe.

60
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,600
You know what?

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,360
Brother.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,360
Is Father just going to die?

63
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,360
It's too dangerous.

64
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,320
Leave it to me.

65
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,480
I will find out the real murderer.

66
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,560
You need to protect yourself.

67
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,440
Don't make me worry anymore, okay?

68
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,400
Okay.

69
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
I'm here to see you.

70
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,720
I will make sure

71
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,840
who hurt the Su family.

72
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,280
If the murderer is in the Huo family,

73
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,600
I'll go back to the Huo family.

74
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,640
Su Nian Qing.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,120
I'm in this situation because of you.

76
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,480
You made me like this.

77
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,440
Say something, Su Nian Qing.

78
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,159
Why did you marry Huo Hanjin?

79
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,240
Aren't you marrying me?

80
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,760
Do you know

81
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,120
Because of your decision,

82
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,480
I’m even worse than a dog at the door.

83
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,120
You and your Su family

84
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,320
are helping Huo Hanjin

85
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,280
and taking away everything that belongs to me.

86
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,760
You used Huo Hanjin

87
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,240
to strengthen Su’s business status.

88
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,120
and get his true heart.

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,400
In the end, I have nothing.

90
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,880
What do you mean?

91
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,440
Your Su family

92
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,760
is about to go bankrupt.

93
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,960
In the end, both of us are pawns.

94
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,160
We are a couple.

95
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,560
Are you done?

96
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,720
Get lost if you're done.

97
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,640
Do you think your car accident

98
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,520
has nothing to do with your father's death?

99
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,440
Master Huo declared

100
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,480
has taken over a large amount of Su's business.

101
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,280
Su Nian Qing,

102
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,520
Your good days are over.

103
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,800
This is my handwriting, the residual page of my diary.

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Huo Hanjin wants to kill someone.

105
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,400
Who is he going to kill?

106
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,960
Be careful.

107
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,800
Who are you?

108
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,720
I am you.

109
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,560
I...

110
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,600
What do you want me to be careful of?

111
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,480
Who?

112
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,600
Is Huo Hanjin

113
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,120
related to Huo Hanjin?

114
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,040
Be careful of everyone.

115
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,200
Especially him.

116
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,040
He is no longer

117
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,080
the Huo Hanjin you know.

118
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,280
Then tell me

119
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,640
what happened this year?

120
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,600
Did he kill my father?

121
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,799
Huo Hanjin wants to kill someone.

122
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,720
Kill me?

123
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,919
Who's going to kill you?

124
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,880
Why didn't you hear anything when he came in?

125
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,600
Why don't you listen to me?

126
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
Why did you sneak out?

127
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,120
You even lied in front of me.

128
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,840
Aren't you afraid I'll punish you?

129
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,320
I won't do it again.

130
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,880
Again?

131
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Why do you always

132
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,600
touch these dangerous things?

133
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,920
Keep them safe.

134
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,280
Remember.

135
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,360
Aim at your enemy in front of the gun.

136
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,560
Put your gun away.

137
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,560
Young Master

138
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,400
Young Master

139
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,720
The car has been sent

140
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,880
to the repair factory.

141
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,280
Yes.

142
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,160
Okay.

143
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,320
He wants to fix the car. Did he hit me?

144
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,600
I need to check his car.

145
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
What are you thinking?

146
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,040
The Yaheng Party.

147
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,040
Weiyu Committee.

148
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,120
Yin Peng.

149
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:52,800
Cheng Peng Da Xue, Yang Wei.

150
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,120
Cheng Peng Da Xue, Yang Wei.

151
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:53,960
Cheng Peng.

152
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,240
Li Wenhan: Li Wenhan.
