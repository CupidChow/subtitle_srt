1
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,520
Su Nian Qing.

2
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,080
Have you forgotten who has been protecting the Su family

3
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,480
and who protected you?

4
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,920
Didn't you just say you want evidence?

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,280
Then let's

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,440
to the world.

7
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,200
Nian Nian.

8
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,680
They colluded.

9
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:06,800
Guards!

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,840
Arrest him!

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,039
You colluded with Huo Zhenhua

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,280
and killed my father.

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,039
But Huo Zhenhua is cunning.

14
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,840
He didn't kill my father.

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,240
But you...

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
my brother

17
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,760
was poisoned.

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,640
These

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,160
are your letters with Huo Zhenhua.

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,400
is all your evidence.

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,720
Nonsense!

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,400
Nonsense!

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,320
I wasn't at your wedding.

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,920
Then who is this?

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,840
Okay.

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,840
It's you.

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,039
killed my father.

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,720
She's talking nonsense.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,120
She's talking nonsense.

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,160
It's you.

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,720
for many years.

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,120
He wants to take the Su family as his own.

33
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,479
Where did you get the evidence?

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,720
I searched everywhere after the accident.

35
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,800
You have no evidence.

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,320
This is a blade

37
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,240
who destroyed me.

38
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,920
After my aunt died,

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,240
my father took you home as his own.

40
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,280
But you killed him.

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,079
Su Fang asked for it.

42
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,840
He wouldn't let me change my surname.

43
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,840
He'd rather give the Su family to you,

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,040
than me.

45
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,440
If he hadn't looked down on me,

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,320
he wouldn't have died.

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,920
Shen Renran.

48
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,840
Aren't you afraid of karma?

49
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,560
retribution?

50
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,240
retribution.

51
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,680
He's dead.

52
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,800
What can you do to me?

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,680
You can't stop me.

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,960
When foreign capital enters,

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,280
the Su family will eat westerners' food.

56
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,760
The Su family will never eat their food.

57
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,000
Not only the Su family won't,

58
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,720
I will also cooperate with the entire Yuncheng Cotton Mill

59
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,600
to boycott foreign funds

60
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,880
to revitalize national industries.

61
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,680
Don’t forget

62
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,800
the Su family is still under my control.

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,040
Why do I remember

64
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,000
Su’s business

65
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,240
has been mortgaged to Mr. Jin.

66
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,680
That's right, Mr Shen.

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,800
We've been talking business for a long time.

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,600
We finally meet today.

69
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,680
Mr. Jin

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,880
We've talked about Shen Renran.

71
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,120
This is the invitation from him.

72
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,920
He wants to invite you to be a witness.

73
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,440
Let me tell you.

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,760
the Su family

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
and the Su family.

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,480
are all mine now.

77
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,960
And Mr Xu's batch of machines

78
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,840
to the Su family.

79
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,040
It has nothing to do with you.

80
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,440
Not only that,

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,600
I will also ruin your reputation.

82
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,160
and lose everything.

83
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,360
Nian Nian.

84
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,120
Nian Nian, give me another chance.

85
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,360
No matter what,

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm a member of the Su family.

87
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,160
Can you give me another chance?

88
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,320
Can you give me another chance?

89
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,800
Give me another chance.

90
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,600
Shen Renran.

91
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,200
Don’t move.

92
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,120
Don't move.

93
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,120
Don't move.

94
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,160
Put the gun down.

95
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,840
Put the gun down!

96
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,520
Stop struggling.

97
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,480
From the moment you decide to do evil,

98
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,720
there's no turning back.

99
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,080
Cut the crap.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,880
Your life is still in my hands.

101
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Be good.

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,320
I'll spare your life.

103
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,760
You're still my good sister.

104
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,600
My life

105
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,320
is in my own hands.

106
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,880
I told you to die a horrible death.

107
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,920
Why don't you believe me?

108
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,040
Grab the bride!

109
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,400
Kill the groom!

110
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,560
There's a wolf in Yuncheng who eats sheep.

111
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,720
You eat meat.

112
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,520
I eat intestines.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,280
You can only be a bride after eating.

114
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,080
Grab the bride!

115
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,280
Kill the groom!

116
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,920
There's a wolf in Yuncheng who eats sheep.

117
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,880
You eat meat.

118
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,480
[I'll eat it.] Okay.

119
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,080
I have intestines.

120
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,320
You can only be a bride after eating.

121
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,680
Father asked me to give you this letter.

122
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,360
The chance you want.

123
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,960
the opportunity you wanted.

124
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,920
In the will,

125
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,840
in the will.

126
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,320
and asked me to help you

127
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,160
your own Shen’s Cotton Mill.

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,320
Because he never wanted to deprive your surname.

129
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,400
You ruined everything.

130
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,240
Thank you.

131
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,080
for doing what I never did.

132
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,960
Thank you.

133
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,720
for giving me the evidence.

134
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,040
Father's soul

135
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,000
can rest in peace.

136
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,120
But you still

137
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,240
the past.

138
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,880
It's okay.

139
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,920
Let bygones be bygones.

140
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,520
The most important thing

141
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,120
is always tomorrow.

142
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,480
right?

143
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,200
Nian Nian.

144
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,920
It's okay.

145
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,640
It's all over.

146
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,720
Fortunately, you are still

147
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,720
is you.

148
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,000
I took your marriage again.

150
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,640
You know what?

151
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,400
You seem to be back to the beginning.

152
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,000
Brave.

153
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,280
impulsive,

154
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,160
I even didn't care about the consequences.

155
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,400
I used to think

156
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,000
marriage should be restrained

157
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,000
and endure.

158
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,240
and giving in silence.

159
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,680
But tell me,

160
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
marriage and love are as passionate.

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,680
So,

162
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,880
Will you marry me again?

163
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,880
From the first time I met you,

164
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,720
I've decided

165
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,760
you are my husband in this life.

166
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,320
When I first met you,

167
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,880
I swore

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,520
I would marry you.

169
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,080
But...

170
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,960
our first meeting

171
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,480
not in the bathroom.

172
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
One glance for ten thousand years.

173
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,560
Beautiful women

174
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,240
One dream for a year

175
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,160
Just like the first time we met

176
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,720
No matter how many times we start over,

177
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,360
I will say

178
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,360
I love you.

179
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,320
I do.

180
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,440
Alheng Party.

181
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,440
Weiyu, Commissioner.

182
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,200
Yaheng Party.

183
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,200
Weiyu Committee.

184
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,280
Yin Peng.

185
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,600
Cheng Peng Qingxue, Ke Yangwei.

186
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:07,680
Cheng Peng Qingxue, Yangwei.

187
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,080
Cheng. Peng Qingxue. Keyang.
