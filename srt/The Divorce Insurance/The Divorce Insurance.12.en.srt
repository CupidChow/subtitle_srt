FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,362
Did you sleep well?

4
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,657
Good morning.

5
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:20,956
When did you prepare all this?

6
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,500
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

7
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:28,214
Holy cow, this is delicious.

8
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,381
What did I tell you?

9
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,217
Every side dish here
makes you keep eating.

10
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,177
The kimchi is good too.

11
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,930
-Does your mom make it?
-Yes, she makes it herself.

12
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,685
FINAL EPISODE

13
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,105
You're so cute. What's your name?

14
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,190
His name is Mi-nu.

15
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:48,984
Ah-young?

16
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,945
The dog's name is Mi-nu.

17
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,112
Min-u?

18
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,240
Not Min-u. It's Mi-nu.

19
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,825
Oh, I see. Mi-nu.

20
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:57,660
Nice to meet you, Mi-nu.

21
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,370
He's my one and only sibling.

22
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,965
I'm so busy with work
that my parents usually walk him.

23
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,675
But I try to do it when I can.

24
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,510
You must be tired
with the launch coming up.

25
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,683
Then do you want to try walking him?

26
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,811
If you two hit it off,
I might ask you to walk him sometimes.

27
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,730
Of course. Leave it to me.

28
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,692
Hey, Mi-nu. Let's go for a walk.

29
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,569
Come on.

30
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,249
Mi-nu stopped. What should I do?

31
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,671
Here.

32
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,342
TODAY'S WORKOUT GOAL

33
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,303
The app says he walked enough today.

34
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,388
-This is great.
-It's cool, right?

35
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,561
You're so smart, Mi-nu.
How did you know when to stop?

36
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,271
Here's a treat.

37
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,947
Honey, wait for me!

38
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,368
That's why I said I'd carry one.
Give it here.

39
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:22,953
My back is killing me.

40
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:33,213
I'll carry them.
I don't want your wrist to hurt.

41
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,257
I've carried them just fine on my own.

42
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:36,967
I'll carry them from now on.

43
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,845
Let's go. I'll make you
sliced rice cake and dumpling soup.

44
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:46,977
Wait for me.

45
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,483
The ring looks good on you.

46
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,862
It's late, but thank you for the gift.

47
00:03:56,946 --> 00:04:00,449
I also brought you a gift
I've been meaning to give you.

48
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,034
What is it?

49
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:06,872
A blind date.

50
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,085
She's a pretty awesome person.

51
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,504
After avoiding me for so long,
this is why you wanted to meet?

52
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,797
Because of a blind date?

53
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,676
-Yes.
-Sorry, but no thank you.

54
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,053
If you're done, I think I'll get going.

55
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,109
Hello, Mr. Park Woong-sik.

56
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,694
My name is Joh Ah-young.

57
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:41,365
You became a dancer
despite your parents' objections, right?

58
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,702
That's pretty cool.

59
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,373
I don't want to get married.

60
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,625
Is that okay?

61
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,381
Are you going to leave me hanging here?

62
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,845
You're pretty cool too.

63
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,681
Anything is fine with me…

64
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,184
as long as we're both happy with it.

65
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,627
I slept through the night.

66
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,271
She'll be back again anyway.

67
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,195
Jeez, why is the fridge so full?

68
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,323
SORRY, I DON'T HAVE A FRIDGE
AT MY PLACE YET

69
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,116
BUT FEEL FREE TO HELP YOURSELF!

BIG BRO DAE-BOK

71
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,458
Yes, Mr. Na?

72
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,795
-The rejected cases have been resolved!
-Really, sir?

73
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,549
PLUS GENERAL INSURANCE

74
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,593
PLUS GENERAL INSURANCE APPLICATION FORM

75
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,720
POLICYHOLDER: NA DAE-BOK
POLICYHOLDER: LEE SO-JEONG

76
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,305
Thank you, Mr. Na.

77
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,099
Oh, it was nothing.

78
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,559
Remember what I said?
I knew Mr. Na would sign up.

79
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,481
No surprise coming
from Ssangmun-dong's top agent.

80
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,607
How did you convince her?

81
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,359
Well, the thing is…

82
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,740
You should eat too.

83
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,286
What's this?

84
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,706
POLICYHOLDER: LEE SO-JEONG
INSURED: LEE SO-JEONG

85
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,085
You promised me 1% every day.

86
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,336
Make sure you keep your word.

87
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,420
Okay.

88
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,090
By the way,

89
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,718
why did you sign the form?

90
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,054
-Should I take it back?
-No.

91
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,932
I'm just curious
because it must've been a hard decision.

92
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,100
Was it because of the kids?

93
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,144
Why would it be
when they're all grown up?

94
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,939
This is just between the two of us.

95
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,860
Right.

96
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,654
I thought of who I was before I met you.

97
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,199
And who you were before you met me.

98
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,034
I looked back on those days.

99
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,203
We were so young back then.

100
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,791
I think we got to this point

101
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,835
simply because we worked so hard

102
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,590
to hold our family together
after getting married.

103
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,925
We both wanted the same thing.

104
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,469
All we wanted was to live a good life.

105
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:53,056
It's not like
we committed crimes or had affairs.

106
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,310
We just wanted to live well
and ended up like this.

107
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,521
Are you crying?

108
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,606
No.

109
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,650
I just ate something spicy.

110
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,406
Thank you, honey.

111
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,285
My wife and I both looked back on it.

112
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,955
Noh Ki-jun, you said so yourself
from your experience.

113
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,207
-I did?
-Yes.

114
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,376
"When you look back on it,
you'll find the answer."

115
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,628
Right.

116
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,421
I think there really is an answer.

117
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,174
In any case, thank you.

118
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,427
Nam Chang-hee?
Mr. Na, isn't he your junior colleague?

119
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,262
-Yes.
-He signed up too?

120
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,597
Oh, the thing is…

121
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,529
Is this a bad time?

122
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,115
I have a client in 30 minutes.
What do you need?

123
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,243
What is it? Do you want to break up?

124
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,869
Why would you say that?

125
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,162
We've been together for seven years.

126
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,456
If we're not getting married,
we should break up.

127
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,166
Am I wrong?

128
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,085
It's not that, Ga-eul--

129
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,879
Then what is it? Should I wait
until you've saved more money?

130
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,507
I've made enough money
while working at the hair salon.

131
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,716
It's not about that.

132
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,801
Then what is it?

133
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,724
PLUS GENERAL INSURANCE APPLICATION FORM

134
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,184
It's still in the pilot launch stage,

135
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,228
so they're looking for people
who won't get divorced.

136
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,065
Divorce talk? We're not even married.

137
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,776
You were the only person
I could think of, Ga-eul.

138
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,696
I'm saying we should get married.

139
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,449
NAM CHANG-HEE, YEO GA-EUL

140
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,910
Ga-eul, let's build
a beautiful life together.

141
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,787
What's this insurance policy?

142
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,415
If, by any chance, there ever comes a time

143
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:45,002
you don't want to live with me any longer,

144
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,463
I'll keep making
these monthly payments for you.

145
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,049
How could you say that?

146
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,845
I'll make sure that never happens
and love you until death do us part.

147
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,805
"Until death do us part"?

148
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,641
I'll never let that happen.

149
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,060
Do you promise?

150
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,355
Of course.

151
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,902
I see.

152
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:14,406
Gosh, who knew divorce insurance
could make people get married?

153
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,783
We made this product,
but I never could've imagined this.

154
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,036
I know. It's so ironic.

155
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,954
We can use this as a marketing angle.

156
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,958
In any case, the rejected cases
have been resolved.

157
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,628
I'm in a good mood,
so let's have a team dinner!

158
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,131
Come on, sir. Don't forget the 1%.

159
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,634
-Seriously, old man.
-Don't call our team leader "old man."

160
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,345
-It's okay.
-Apologize to him.

161
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,306
-I'm an old man and that's not important.
-Hold on, sir. Apologize to him.

162
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,225
What a close call.
Just pretend I didn't say anything.

163
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,852
Don't get too excited just yet.

164
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:45,979
Hello, ma'am.

165
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,981
Conference room.

166
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,525
INFLUENCER MS. A GETS DIVORCED
BECAUSE OF UPCOMING 'P' INSURANCE PRODUCT?

167
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,403
MS. A RECENTLY TOOK OUT
A NEW INSURANCE POLICY

168
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,198
I think they wrote this article
when Ms. Han Yeo-reum went live.

169
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,657
Jeez.

170
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,911
Why did they write it up
as if we really encouraged their divorce?

171
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,246
We can ask for the article
to be taken down.

172
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,459
However, the higher-ups
are concerned about this issue.

173
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,336
We were worried this might happen too.

174
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,714
But then, we have cases like Mr. Na's.

175
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,132
Right.

176
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:17,928
So? How do you plan on convincing them?

177
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,017
Noh Ki-jun, any ideas?

178
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,438
What about you, Ms. Kang?

179
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,525
I'm not sure…

180
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,945
You have until the next meeting.

181
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,863
Find a solution
to the divorce promotion issue.

182
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,033
If we don't resolve this,
we can't launch the divorce insurance.

183
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,327
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

184
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,334
Yes?

185
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,964
Here's what you requested, ma'am.

186
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,715
-I'll take a look.
-Yes, ma'am.

187
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,426
And?

188
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,553
Excuse me?

189
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,224
Never mind. So…

190
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,352
Would you like
to see a movie with me tonight?

191
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:09,855
Sounds good.

192
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,575
The rooftop. Now.

193
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,046
My head's about to explode. What is it?

194
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,215
-Number one.
-What?

195
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,884
Number one. The friend mode.

196
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,635
Okay. Go ahead and ask.

197
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,429
But be quick about it.

198
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,431
I got a job offer.

199
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,559
What? From where?

200
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,270
An overseas branch.

201
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,481
An overseas branch?

202
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,736
Don't tell me it's Singapore.

203
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,406
I knew something was up.

204
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,075
So are you going?

205
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,287
Yes, I think so.

206
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,955
This isn't like you.

207
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,542
You're obsessed with safety
even when you go to a nearby market…

208
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,052
Is Ms. Jeon the one
who offered you the job?

209
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,599
She needs a risk surveyor to work with.

210
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,189
In that case, you should go.

211
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:37,859
Do you mean that?

212
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,194
Yes, totally.

213
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,532
Don't worry about me. We're beyond that.

214
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,825
You won't regret it, right?

215
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:47,953
Right.

216
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,496
Then that's all that matters.

217
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,748
And you two will be happy together?

218
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,252
Then that's all that matters.

219
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,964
Did you tell her you're going?

220
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,299
I'll tell her once the divorce insurance
is officially launched.

221
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,302
-Why?
-The divorce insurance isn't 100% ready.

222
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,639
Jeez.

223
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,519
When you play it safe like this,
you're An Jeon-man.

224
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,605
But then you're not An Jeon-man.
You've changed.

225
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,067
It went against my nature
to get into divorce insurance at all.

226
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:24,072
I admit that jumping into
an uncertain project

227
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,699
was a big leap for you.

228
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:29,160
Singapore sounds good.
It'll be a great turning point.

229
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,245
Thanks.

230
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,581
I'm off.

231
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,082
Off to where?

232
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,876
To launch this product
as soon as possible.

233
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,961
Wait for me.

234
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,759
A turning point…

235
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,777
What is it, sir? You can tell us.

236
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,447
Oh, it's just that…

237
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,908
I thought younger folks
would know more about this…

238
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:09,993
About what, sir?

239
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,371
Actually, I want to give my wife a gift.

240
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,207
That's so sweet.

241
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,169
But I've never gotten a gift
for her before.

242
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,381
What do women like these days?

243
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,841
The most memorable gift is money.

244
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,219
I like small gifts
that come from the heart.

245
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,889
"From the heart"? Jeez, that's hard.

246
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,770
Okay. The best kind of gift is one

247
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,397
when you thoughtfully sense
what someone wants.

248
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,733
-That's right.
-Thoughtfully sense it?

249
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,109
That's even harder.

250
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:46,112
But it's the kind of thoughtful gift
that will blow her away

251
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,405
because it requires attention.

252
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,826
-Why not go through her social media?
-Right.

253
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,161
Let me see your phone, sir.

254
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,537
-My phone?
-Yes, hand it over.

255
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,873
But why?

256
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,210
I'll take a good look at it.

257
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,759
THE NORTHERN LIGHTS
HOPE TO SEE THEM BEFORE I DIE

258
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,344
Hey, this is it.

259
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,097
What's this? The Northern Lights?

260
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,141
This takes more thought
since it's on the other side of the world.

261
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,976
Don't stress too much about it, sir.

262
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,606
-You got this, Mr. Na!
-How am I going to…

263
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,025
Why are you slacking off and not working?

264
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,569
Can you take a look at
the risk data I put together, sir?

265
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,613
What?

266
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,781
Let's see here.

267
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,251
MS. KANG
MR. NOH, YOU SHOULD HEAD HOME FIRST

268
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,630
MR. NOH
WHY? ARE YOU WORKING LATE?

269
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,301
NO, I WANT TO VISIT MY PARENTS,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME

270
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,891
I'M NOT WORRIED,
I KNOW YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF

271
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,695
"The policyholder and insured will"…

272
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,039
Ta-da!

273
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,001
What's this?
Did you get them off the street?

274
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,461
Seriously?

275
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,714
Each of these flowers I chose
reminded me of you.

276
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,215
You're being ridiculous.

277
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,885
Look at all this laundry.

278
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:36,389
All right. Time to start folding laundry.

279
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,226
It's 1% a day.

280
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,145
Don't change too much all at once.

281
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,313
You'll get sick.

282
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,607
Get sick? That's ridiculous.

283
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,359
My liver and stomach might be ruined

284
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,529
because I drank so much every day.

285
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:55,617
But my heart still beats strong for you.

286
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,457
As far as I know,

287
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,501
this is my house.

288
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,294
What about the movie?

289
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,088
Watching movies at home is the best
because you get front-row seats.

290
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:10,965
Didn't you know that?

291
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,347
Where are the plates?

292
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,516
-They're in the cabinet.
-The cabinet?

293
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,946
He's really into the movie.

294
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:24,122
This must be your kind of movie.

295
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,832
You were so focused on it

296
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,917
that I thought
you might fall into the screen.

297
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,086
It was better than I expected.

298
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,046
It was just so-so for me.

299
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,799
I can't really relate
to the human-robot love thing.

300
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:35,967
I can relate to it.

301
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,218
Really?

302
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:44,475
Cars are just hunks of metal,
but people name them all the same.

303
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,145
They also show affection to robot vacuums.

304
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,565
That's just a waste of emotional energy.

305
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,484
You can't fight off feelings
that just come to you.

306
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:57,363
But if even robots can love,
and humans can't live without love,

307
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,949
then why do we get divorced?

308
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,202
That's what I wondered about.

309
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:06,164
You get divorced if you're not compatible.
You know this.

310
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,583
But humans and robots
aren't compatible either.

311
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,503
So?

312
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,173
What's your point?

313
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,383
Divorce might not always be the answer.

314
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,472
This needs to be clearly outlined
in divorce insurance.

315
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,225
You're more serious than I expected.

316
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,977
It's time for me to be serious.

317
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,960
Here we go.

318
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,628
I'm not done eating that.

319
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,215
We still have some wine left,
so let's watch another movie.

320
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,759
I'm sorry, but I have to work.

321
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,010
Right now?

322
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,181
I'll drink the rest of this
and watch a movie.

323
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,265
Go ahead and work.

324
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:08,518
You're done, right?

325
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,812
-No, there's still some left.
-It's just a little bit.

326
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,028
I'll leave on my own.

327
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,197
-Sorry I can't walk you out.
-I said I'm leaving.

328
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,200
-Wait, my bag.
-Go ahead and put your shoes on.

329
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,254
I have to put my shoes on before I can go.

330
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,923
Hurry… I mean, take your time.

331
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:45,930
I'm really leaving now.

332
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,765
Right, and I really have to work.

333
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,475
Seriously?

334
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,144
I seriously have to work.

335
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:54,605
Goodbye and take care.

336
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,149
Wait, but…

337
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,320
What's the matter with him?

338
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,395
Promoting divorce…

339
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,108
Promoting divorce…

340
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,861
My wife and I both looked back on it.

341
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,031
Noh Ki-jun, you said so yourself
from your experience.

342
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,658
"When you look back on it,
you'll find the answer."

343
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,327
Promoting divorce…

344
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:52,121
Sounds good.
It'll be a great turning point.

345
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,711
Ms. Kang.

346
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,925
You're not on the swings tonight.

347
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,010
What are you doing here?

348
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,012
I'm just…

349
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,014
Is it the divorce promotion issue?

350
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,558
Thoughts are swirling around in my head,

351
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,394
but there's no flash of insight.

352
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:18,815
We should put our heads together for this.
Don't struggle on your own.

353
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,275
But this whole thing started in my head.

354
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,905
Let's have some ice cream
and wake up our brains.

355
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,291
Take the bigger one, Ms. Kang.

356
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,461
Hey, this is good.

357
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,971
Thank you for the bed.
I slept well because of it.

358
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:53,057
Don't mention it.
It's nothing compared to the side dishes.

359
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,477
Did you see your parents? How did it go?

360
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,983
-They're giving up on me.
-What?

361
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:07,738
I think they've maybe accepted it.

362
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,742
My dad is reserved and isn't good
at expressing himself, you see.

363
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,452
I see.

364
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,208
I don't think I've fully conveyed
my thoughts or feelings

365
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,210
to my parents until now.

366
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:25,339
"I hope I never make Mom and Dad sad."

367
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:28,009
"If I can just get past this moment,

368
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,136
nothing bad will happen."

369
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,221
That's what I thought.

370
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,975
But I think it's my fault
things turned out this way.

371
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,769
Hey, don't blame yourself.

372
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,480
It's not blame. It's self-reflection.

373
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:42,565
Self-reflection?

374
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,858
Yes.

375
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,652
That's why I'm going to
meet things head-on from now on.

376
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,947
Even if it's a bit painful
and uncomfortable,

377
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,407
and even if I receive hate,

378
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,203
those feelings I want to avoid
are still mine.

379
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,788
And I'm at the center of it all.

380
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:02,126
Right. I'm always in the center.

381
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,674
The center…

382
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,054
I found it.

383
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,222
What do you mean?

384
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,474
A solution.

385
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,020
A "self-care program"?

386
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,314
I start off alone as "myself,"

387
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,108
then meet someone and become a couple.

388
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,986
And if this couple eventually reaches

389
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,030
the point of divorce,

390
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,366
it's like salmon swimming upstream,

391
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,452
trying to return to "myself,"
where it all began.

392
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,789
What do we get
if we apply our previous cases?

393
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:40,915
Except for Mr. Kim Seon-man.

394
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,421
You always went
looking for something else,

395
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,465
but not for me who was right beside you.

396
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,593
I wanted to show it to you
and get your acknowledgment.

397
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:55,096
Remember you held out your hand
when I was about to give up in Santiago

398
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,723
even though we had never met before?

399
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,809
The moment I took your hand,

400
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,437
I had already acknowledged you.

401
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,316
-You!
-You!

402
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,860
Do you want them to visit during holidays?

403
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:11,320
-No.
-Yes.

404
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,449
-What did you say?
-What did you say?

405
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:18,119
Did you settle on the holiday matter?

406
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,745
They'll visit my house
on even-numbered years

407
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,289
and her house on odd-numbered years.

408
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:24,041
Getting everything out in the open
before the wedding

409
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,459
is more suitable.

410
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,758
OPTIONS FOR NEW HOME

411
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:36,762
MONEY GIFT FROM HUSBAND ON 60TH BIRTHDAY
USE TO SEND ME TO A NURSING HOME

412
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,723
Why didn't she spend any of this?

413
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,058
Why is she so foolish?

414
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,776
I'll improve by 1% every day…

415
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,654
and I'll change 100% for the better.

416
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,823
POLICYHOLDER: LEE SO-JEONG
INSURED: LEE SO-JEONG

417
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,285
You promised me 1% every day.

418
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,661
Make sure you keep your word.

419
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:03,622
They say you have to confront reality
to understand yourself.

420
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:07,877
So I can't help but understand my partner
since they're a part of me.

421
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,961
Exactly.

422
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,922
That can become
a new turning point or starting point.

423
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,633
So, this could give them
the courage to start over together again?

424
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,761
It also includes the courage
to get divorced like Mr. Kim.

425
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,472
In conclusion, divorce insurance is…

426
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,807
A tool or opportunity
for couples to look back

427
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:25,561
and figure out
how they got to the point of divorce.

428
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,396
-So does it promote divorce?
-No!

429
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,647
-Right.
-I see.

430
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,858
Just like getting cancer insurance
and taking care of your health,

431
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,026
you can get divorce insurance

432
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,904
-and care for yourself and your marriage.
-That's exactly it.

433
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,156
Just like hospital fees that are covered
upon a cancer diagnosis,

434
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,574
we can improve the process

435
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,035
by covering self-care program costs

436
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,411
when high divorce risk is diagnosed.

437
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:43,746
That sounds good.

438
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,540
-Okay. Let's speed things up.
-Yes, ma'am.

439
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:47,750
I knew it.

440
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,710
All right. Let's do this.

441
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,298
We got this!

442
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,260
REASONS FOR DIVORCE

443
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,472
WHEN THE INSURED INFORMS…

444
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,142
-Can you check this for me?
-Sure.

445
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:07,645
INSURANCE BENEFITS

446
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,363
-Good night.
-Good night.

447
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,948
-See you.
-Good work today.

448
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,991
-Take care.
-Okay.

449
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,035
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

450
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:37,925
You didn't go home last night?

451
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,093
Good morning.

452
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,469
Good morning!

453
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,930
SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

454
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:48,811
SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR
JEON NA-RAE

455
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,774
-Take this.
-Okay.

456
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,778
Did you review
the fact-based analysis, Mr. Na?

457
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,321
-You must be exhausted.
-Ms. Jeon.

458
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,698
Ms. Jeon.

459
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,783
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

460
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:05,911
This looks great.

461
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:14,962
I'm heading out now.

462
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,423
Wait… wait for me.

463
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,177
-Bye.
-See you.

464
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,481
You must be exhausted.

465
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,149
I guess I dozed off.

466
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,901
Did everyone go home?

467
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,527
Yes, just now.

468
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,117
Here, Ms. Kang.

469
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:49,914
It'll wake you up.

470
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:52,833
Thank you.

471
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,547
I want to wake up too.

472
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,725
Let's do this.

473
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,851
We got this.

474
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,488
I think we're good to go.
What do you think?

475
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,406
I'm okay with it. What about you?

476
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,783
-Okay.
-Ms. Joh?

477
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,868
-Okay.
-Mr. Na?

478
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:29,245
Ms. Jeon?

479
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,622
-Ms. Kang?
-There's just one more thing.

480
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:33,582
What?

481
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,919
We also have to check the AI underwriting

482
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,420
since there are probably changes

483
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,756
based on the insight gained
through the pilot sales.

484
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,883
You're right.

485
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,552
I'll participate this time too.

486
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,598
After all, I'm on the task force too.

487
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:51,767
That sounds good.

488
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,020
But the questions
will be different than last time.

489
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,605
They're upgraded versions.

490
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,651
Okay.

491
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,613
DIVORCE INSURANCE
FOR A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE

492
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,949
SELF-CARE PROGRAM, NEW

493
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,137
How did it go? What did the FSS say?

494
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,521
They gave the okay.

495
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,404
-Mr. Na.
-Great job.

496
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:46,947
Great job.

497
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:51,327
The official launch will be decided
after going through the executive meeting.

498
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,455
Great work, all of you.

499
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,123
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Great work, everyone.

500
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,207
Good job.

501
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,460
Good work, everyone.

502
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,712
-Good job.
-I gave it my all.

503
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:02,796
What day is it today?

504
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,215
We pulled so many all-nighters
that I have no idea.

505
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,178
Hey, what does this Chinese character say?

506
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,180
-"Ga" for "Home."
-"Ga" for "Home"?

507
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,556
"Ga" for "Home."

508
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,058
Let's go home.

509
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,226
Everyone, go home!

510
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,063
-We're finally off work!
-Let's go home!

511
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:20,856
-Goodbye, sir.
-Let's go.

512
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,941
Hey, Ms. Joh!

513
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:24,985
Ms. Joh!

514
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:26,779
How dare you leave
before your senior colleagues?

515
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,822
Ms. Joh!

516
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:36,413

CEO: LEE WON-U
SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR: JEON NA-RAE

CONFIRMATION OF
DIVORCE INSURANCE LAUNCH

519
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:05,734
Good morning.

520
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,528
We've seen each other every day,

521
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,863
but why does it seem like
we haven't in a long time?

522
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:11,657
Because we were busy working every day.

523
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,244
But I avoided
completely running out of energy.

524
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,664
I just charged you up.

525
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,128
Me too.

526
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,060
I can't believe this got launched.

527
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:43,147
LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT

528
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,483
Did you know this was coming out?

529
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:47,693
It's divorce insurance.

530
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,698
LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT
PRODUCT NAME: DIVORCE INSURANCE

531
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:02,374
Ninety-eight… Hey, make it to a hundred.

532
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,710
Hurry. Just two more.

533
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,670
Ninety-nine…

534
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:08,464
Good morning.

535
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,257
Goodness, ma'am.

536
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,717
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

537
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,968
Good morning.

538
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,220
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

539
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:18,182
Let's wrap up the task force now.

540
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:20,768
Excuse me?

541
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,692
The official launch date has been set,

542
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,736
and your work here is now done.

543
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,989
Jeez, I can't believe it's over.

544
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,868
I feel sad now that it's really over.

545
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:41,163
Well, let's just keep this
as a fond memory

546
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,457
since we'll be very busy soon.

547
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,583
Yes, ma'am.

548
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,211
Then are we returning
to our respective teams?

549
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:50,172
Before that,
how about a dissolution ceremony?

550
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,926
Like a team dinner?

551
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,010
Yes.

552
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,429
A team dinner? That sounds great.

553
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,307
Actually, I can't make it.

554
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,433
Why not?

555
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:04,895
How about the ocean?

556
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:06,814
The ocean?

557
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:09,483
We need to get out of this stuffy office

558
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,193
and go to a cool and wide-open space.

559
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,820
I'm in. I've been wanting to go.

560
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,864
-That sounds good.
-The ocean sounds good, Ms. Joh.

561
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,537
Should we look into it
and make reservations?

562
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,163
-I'll look into it.
-Let's do it together.

563
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:34,258
Hey, Seok-gi.

564
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,718
Remember the thing
we talked about last time?

565
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,887
Shall we leave together, then?

566
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,681
-Sounds good.
-Same. It's been a while.

567
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,391
-We're leaving now, right?
-Of course.

568
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,978
-Where's a good place?
-Are you coming from somewhere?

569
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,313
Oh, someone stopped by to see me.

570
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:50,023
Go home before you hit traffic.

571
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,108
-Yes, sir.
-We're going.

572
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,485
We're having fried chicken and beer.
Why don't you join us?

573
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,448
I can't. I need to cut back on drinking.

574
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:01,243
Then just have some fried chicken.
Come with us, sir.

575
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,327
Come on, sir.

576
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:03,412
Fried chicken…

577
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,998
Darn it, I can't resist that.

578
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,499
Hold on a second.

579
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,712
Honey?

580
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,797
Don't make dinner tonight.

581
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:15,507
I'll pick up some fried chicken.

582
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,219
Do you want glazed or half-and-half?

583
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:21,597
Is it okay for Mr. Na
to change all of a sudden?

584
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,056
He's like a different person.

585
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,934
They say if someone suddenly changes--

586
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,603
That's enough.

587
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,187
-It's nice to see him this way.
-I agree.

588
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,148
-All right. Let's head out.
-Sounds good.

589
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:38,405
Honey, is there anywhere you'd like to go?

590
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,115
Not really.

591
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,285
I traveled so much for a while, so…

592
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,037
Seok-gi told me

593
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,707
there's a place
that can rekindle your love.

594
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,542
Where would that even be?

595
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,586
It's not a joke. I'm telling the truth.

596
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:56,089
Stop talking nonsense
and hand me the laundry.

597
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:06,683
What's this?

598
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,645
WOOSEOK TRAVEL AGENCY
ITINERARY

599
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,649
Let's go see the Northern Lights.

600
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:15,859
We should see them once in our lifetime.

601
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:18,028
FLIGHT INFORMATION
FROM INCHEON TO HELSINKI

602
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,949
People do vow renewal ceremonies.

603
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:25,035
So let's think of this
as a second honeymoon.

604
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,414
I'm not dreaming, am I?

605
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,502
Our flight leaves tomorrow night.

606
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:36,838
Where did you get the money for this?

607
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,842
Let's pack our suitcases.

608
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,886
But the credit card payment due date…

609
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,200
Come on. It's our honeymoon.

610
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,994
Is that right?

611
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,760
We're at the beach!

612
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,018
Hurry up!

613
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,940
It's good now that we're actually here.
It's so nice and open.

614
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:38,692
The East Coast is the best.

615
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:39,776
That's right.

616
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,987
This is great. It's been so long.

617
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,615
The weather is amazing.

618
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:46,908
Let's take a photo.

619
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,410
Here we go.

620
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,080
One, two…

621
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,916
That turned out great. One more.

622
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,253
Hey.

623
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,337
One more?

624
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,423
Let's take one more.

625
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:06,678
Okay, one more time. One, two…

626
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,431
-How about a selfie?
-Sounds good.

627
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,349
-Make a cheek heart!
-Cheek heart.

628
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,188
BIG BRO DAE-BOK

629
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,774
-What the heck?
-Hello, Mr. Na. What's on your head?

630
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,067
Hello, sir.

631
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,611
We arrived here safely.

632
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,072
Look. Isn't it amazing?

633
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,991
-What about you guys?
-We got here safely too.

634
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:31,161
-You're looking good, sir.
-Of course I am.

635
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,872
Don't have too much fun without me,
or I'll be sad.

636
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,957
Of course not, sir.
It's no fun without you here.

637
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,168
-It's super boring.
-Let's just go home.

638
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,586
Don't worry and have fun, sir!

639
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,047
-Sounds good. You guys have fun.
-Bye!

640
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,924
-Goodbye, sir!
-Bye!

641
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:46,176
Goodness.

642
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,719
What are you doing? Let's go.

643
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,387
What? Already?

644
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:50,639
We have to get a good spot.

645
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:51,723
All right, then.

646
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,229
Goodness!

647
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,744
That's cute.

648
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:20,544
What? I don't come across
as someone who likes this stuff?

649
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:23,046
No, it's not that…

650
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,050
I used to see the world
from an investment perspective,

651
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:29,719
and I liked debating and assessing risks.

652
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,306
But now, I'm starting to notice

653
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,517
all of the little things in between.

654
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,145
That shows how hard
you've worked this whole time.

655
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,819
I'm going back to Singapore.

656
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,446
When?

657
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,740
Right after the divorce insurance launch.

658
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,161
That's a shame.

659
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:58,206
I just started to feel
comfortable around you.

660
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:00,584
Really?

661
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,713
You were the senior managing director…

662
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,259
and there were many barriers between us.

663
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:13,221
But as we gradually became a team,

664
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,640
it just happened before I knew it.

665
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,520
There's nothing else to think about.

666
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:23,815
Kang Han-deul and Jeon Na-rae.

667
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,067
That's all that matters.

668
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,913
You haven't told her yet?

669
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,916
At times like this,
you're definitely Wuss-man.

670
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,542
I'm going to tell her today.

671
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:46,713
Good. Imagine how she must feel
while waiting for your answer.

672
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:50,175
Hey, aren't you at least a little sad
that I'm leaving?

673
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,384
Jeez.

674
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,680
I'm not your girlfriend.

675
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,098
But you're my friend.

676
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,976
Right. Friends just need to know
they're doing okay.

677
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,394
Stay healthy.

678
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:04,606
Oh, and get me some duty-free whiskey
when you come to Korea.

679
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,524
Whiskey is expensive.
I'll get you mango jelly.

680
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,610
-Mango jelly?
-Or kaya jam.

681
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,863
JUMPING CRAB

682
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,495
Woong-sik is why we're here, right?

683
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,208
Congratulations on
the official launch of divorce insurance.

684
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,335
Thank you.

685
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,879
Thank you. You had a hand in it too.

686
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:29,297
Thank you.

687
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,259
But how did you manage to come
during planting season

688
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:34,261
when I'm in the village?

689
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,353
The water here is really good.

690
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:50,485
Here, try this.

691
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,574
-What's going on with you two?
-We're finding out.

692
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:57,909
Finding out what?

693
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:00,370
You don't need to know everything.

694
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:01,663
It's private.

695
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,958
-Is this right?
-Come on. They look good together.

696
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,334
You look good together.

697
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:09,796
Here's the food.

698
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,465
-Holy cow.
-Here you go. Enjoy.

699
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:14,801
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you, ma'am.

700
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:17,053
This is good.

701
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:18,513
Here, try this.

702
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,807
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

703
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,475
Until the very end…

704
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,731
Ms. Jeon is going to Singapore next week.

705
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:33,445
Singapore? That soon?

706
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,448
Please come visit when you have time.

707
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,533
Sounds good to me.
Everything's on you, then.

708
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,868
Sure. Why not?

709
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:45,081
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

710
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,378
What am I supposed to do if you leave?

711
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,466
Ms. Jeon, you were

712
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,884
my super cool role model.

713
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:01,431
Thank you for saying
I was your role model.

714
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,309
Na-rae. Can I call you Na-rae?

715
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,942
I mean, it's all over now,

716
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:15,153
so why can't I just call you Na-rae?

717
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,237
Ah-young.

718
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,948
-Ah-young, don't do that.
-No?

719
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,535
-Woong-sik?
-Jeez.

720
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,039
-Is he okay?
-He drank too quickly.

721
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:27,123
It'll get on his white pants.

722
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:28,792
I knew that would happen.

723
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:32,337
Ah-young is drunk,
so please don't hold it against her.

724
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,089
Right, it happens.

725
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:36,508
Na-rae?

726
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,760
Seriously.

727
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,972
I like that, actually. "Na-rae"?

728
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:53,483
-"Na-rae," huh?
-That's cute.

729
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,986
I need some fresh air.

730
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,321
Ms. Kang, will you come with me?

731
00:44:58,405 --> 00:44:59,656
Okay.

732
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:02,992
We'll be right back.

733
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:15,255
It feels cramped in here, doesn't it?

734
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,134
-Don't you agree?
-It doesn't feel cramped.

735
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,617
Honey.

736
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:47,245
Honey, wake up!

737
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:48,913
I wasn't sleeping. I…

738
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,006
Did you know?

739
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:02,260
The Northern Lights are
a shield created by Earth

740
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,554
to protect the life forms
living on its planet

741
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,391
from solar winds.

742
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:09,684
That sounds exactly…

743
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,313
like insurance.

744
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:15,940
That darn insurance.

745
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,112
You can be my Northern Lights…

746
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,200
until the day we die.

747
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,704
Seriously? Will you let me?

748
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:18,628
If Mr. Noh says
he wants to develop a new product,

749
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:22,799
tell him about
the space travel SOS insurance.

750
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,219
Don't hold back and push the idea hard.

751
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,388
Don't be a wuss.

752
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,230
Or I guess

753
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:40,233
I could push it forward in Singapore.

754
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:43,403
Would you really do that for me?

755
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:47,782
Yes.

756
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,463
Actually…

757
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:07,927
I made up my mind.

758
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,627
Believe me, I was going to tell you today.

759
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:11,199
At times like this,

760
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:15,578
it feels like I'm lost in a tunnel
that I thought was a cave,

761
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,997
and then finally finding light.

762
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,083
Isn't that what I said?

763
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:22,418
That's right.

764
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,963
So what happened?
Did you escape the tunnel?

765
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:28,216
Of course.

766
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,719
-Let's go see the stars more often now.
-Okay.

767
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,643
Can I ask you something?

768
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,520
What is it?

769
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:43,690
What was your question
during the tarot reading?

770
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,281
The tarot reading turned out to be true.

771
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:54,701
Remember how it predicted your success?

772
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,744
That wasn't the question I asked.

773
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,455
Excuse me? It wasn't?

774
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,333
Then what was the question?

775
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:04,460
I'm not telling you.

776
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,754
Seriously?

777
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,882
I'll tell you when the results come out.

778
00:50:09,966 --> 00:50:11,050
Seriously…

779
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:14,053
No, wait. If I succeed,
I'll tell you then.

780
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:19,100
I asked if it was possible
to meet my twin flame.

781
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:21,644
"Twin flame"?

782
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,313
A twin flame is basically

783
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:26,149
the other part of your soul.

784
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:31,028
Humans were originally created
with four arms, four legs, and two faces,

785
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:33,531
but the gods felt threatened,
so they split them in half.

786
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:38,453
So there's someone out there
who shares the same soul as me.

787
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:41,414
They say meeting someone like that

788
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:42,915
leads to a whole new chapter in life

789
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:46,127
and not just a romance.

790
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,754
But it's difficult to find that person.

791
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,006
How can you recognize them?

792
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,135
They say you just do,
as if you've known them all along.

793
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:58,055
The tarot reading results said

794
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,933
you'd succeed.

795
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:03,060
Right.

796
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:05,521
Then what about in real life?

797
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:07,857
Did you succeed?

798
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:12,069
Did you manage to succeed?

799
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:24,040
That's when you knew, right?

800
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:26,292
When you called future Han-deul,

801
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:29,462
you asked, "Did you manage to succeed?"

802
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:30,922
And then you smiled, just like now.

803
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,173
You remember that?

804
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:36,928
Hey, Noh Ki-jun.

805
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,430
Remember today.

806
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,773
Of course, I remember.

807
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:52,026
I'm a little disappointed, though.

808
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,364
Because I knew from the beginning.

809
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:59,116
Really? Since the mattress incident?

810
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,326
No.

811
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:03,788
Since the supermarket.

812
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:31,607
Mr. Noh?

813
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:36,696
Come on.

814
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,741
Hurry.

815
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:10,313
Excuse me.

816
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:09,872
Looking good.

817
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,251
Which one should I wear?

818
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:21,133
Today's a special day, so I'll choose you.

819
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:26,555
Wish me luck.

820
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:57,837
I basically memorized this…

821
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:02,717
Amazing news!

822
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,135
Why? What is it?

823
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,262
We scored our first contract!

824
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,471
What?

825
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:09,015
-Seriously?
-Yes.

826
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:10,683
-Already?
-Who is it, sir?

827
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:12,018
The CEO's daughter.

828
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:13,811
Oh, I remember.

829
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,980
The one who was getting divorced
and falling apart.

830
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:19,483
That's right.
She just signed the contract.

831
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:23,529
I think we have the CEO's full support
on divorce insurance.

832
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,782
This is great.

833
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:29,660
What a great start!

834
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,371
This is insane.

835
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:34,915
-Jeez.
-Mr. An.

836
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,252
IS YOUR MARRIAGE OKAY?

837
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,378
Please come over here.

838
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,756
But it's so hard when you get married.

839
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,215
There are divorce litigation fees,

840
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:46,719
child support, and alimony.
And what about the house?

841
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,304
It's more stressful than marriage.

842
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:51,015
This is when you need divorce insurance.

843
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,558
What if you don't get divorced?

844
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:55,227
Then just get a refund.

845
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:57,646
More importantly, this divorce insurance

846
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,482
will not only build trust

847
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:02,568
but also help couples
to be more thoughtful.

848
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:03,652
That sounds right.

849
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:05,821
So would you like to read
the terms and conditions?

850
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:09,075
I can take a breather,
thanks to the divorce insurance.

851
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:10,284
Good work.

852
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,870
Not at all, sir.
It was the task force that worked hard.

853
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,205
I can trust them with another project.

854
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,915
You're departing soon, right?

855
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:18,375
Yes, sir. I'll visit you
when I'm back in Korea.

856
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,294
Goodbye, sir.

857
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:10,261
I'm not too late, am I?

858
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:16,892
Do you enjoy making a fool out of me?

859
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:19,770
I just…

860
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:23,149
I just couldn't find the right time…

861
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:39,540
The…

862
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,543
Our living arrangements in Singapore--

863
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:43,752
They'll be separate.

864
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:48,382
We need our own personal space, after all.

865
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:51,886
As expected,

866
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:54,638
we're on the same wavelength.

867
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,641
We're late. Let's go.

868
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:51,737
The world offers various insurance plans.

869
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,572
STORM AND FLOOD COVERAGE INSURANCE

870
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:54,782
EARTHQUAKE AND DISASTER INSURANCE

871
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:00,496
However,

872
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,749
there was no insurance
to prepare you for this until now.

873
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,709
And that is divorce.

874
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:08,837
Divorce insurance
that ensures your happiness.

875
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:11,757
-Plus General Insurance will support you!
-Support you!

876
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,844
DIVORCE INSURANCE

877
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:17,304
PLUS GENERAL INSURANCE
LAUNCHES DIVORCE INSURANCE

878
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:18,847
THE COUNTRY'S FIRST DIVORCE INSURANCE
ROCKS THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

879
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:21,016
WE SEEK TO PREPARE OUR CUSTOMERS
FOR THIS CRISIS…

880
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,102
"Plus General Insurance's
stock price surges."

881
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,355
I think we really pulled it off.

882
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,524
Of course. Look who was behind it.

883
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,025
Not bad for a first project, right?

884
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:31,735
We did an amazing job.

885
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:33,237
No, I mean this sweater.

886
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,074
This is first-rate too.

887
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:38,784
You're lying.

888
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,413
What are your thoughts
on the official launch?

889
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,665
It's a shame the project is over.

890
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:48,794
But for some reason,
I'm looking forward to something more.

891
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,421
What are you looking forward to?

892
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,924
The fact that I don't know
what will happen in the future.

893
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:57,678
By any chance,
is that pride insurance still valid?

894
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,179
The idea of making it, that is.

895
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:00,639
Yes, it's still valid.

896
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,224
Then give it a shot.

897
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:06,186
But do you think it'll work?

898
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,189
We made it happen with divorce,
and everyone has pride.

899
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:13,694
If the talented Ms. Kang heads it,
then Noh Ki-jun will actively assist.

900
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:30,961
Okay, then. Let's make this work.

901
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:33,797
Let's make this work.

902
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:47,644
By the way, what happened
with Na-rae and Mr. An?

903
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:49,480
They're doing well.

904
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:52,483
But Jeon-man isn't the type
to go into detail about things.

905
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:56,862
"Na-rae"? When did you two get so close?

906
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:59,615
It's a secret between us women.

907
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,617
I see.

908
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:05,329
By the way, how long
will we keep speaking formally?

909
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:09,249
Should we speak casually, then?

910
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,210
Cool.

911
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,294
I'm sorry?

912
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:13,837
Cool.

913
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,934
We will now begin.

914
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:29,353
What is the most important thing

915
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,189
for middle-aged people
to maintain their marriage?

916
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:35,651
(4) MY SPOUSE BESIDE ME

917
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:37,861
My lovely wife, of course.

918
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:40,197
Which of the following

919
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,783
is the most ideal way
to achieve happiness?

920
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,619
(1) TO BE MARRIED (2) TO GET DIVORCED
(3) TO NEVER MARRY (4) NONE OF THE ABOVE

921
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,038
Number five, other.
All three of the above.

922
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:51,750
Please select the advice you would give

923
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:53,877
to someone
contemplating divorce or remarriage.

924
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,129
(4) IF NO REGRET, GO FOR IT

925
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:59,091
Sometimes, you just need to take a leap.

926
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:01,301
Which of the following
describes the reason

927
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,512
for deciding to remarry?

928
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:07,766
I can't say pet rock, so…

929
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:08,934
Number one.

930
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,185
(1) LIFE COMPANION

931
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:12,521
What is the biggest change in your life

932
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:13,981
after getting divorced?

933
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,901
Number three. Having the…

934
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:19,361
HAVING THE MIND-SET TO START FRESH

935
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:20,571
…courage to start fresh.

936
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,489
What do you think helped you

937
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:24,950
to overcome your trauma?

938
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:26,702
(2) MAKING TODAY COUNT

939
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:28,495
No more regrets for me.

940
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:31,832
We will now move on to the next question.

941
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:35,002
Are you happy right now?

942
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:37,087
-Yes.
-Yes.

943
01:02:57,733 --> 01:02:59,151
Goodness.

944
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:01,028
Mr. Na!

945
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,907
-Don't clear out your desk yet.
-What?

946
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:05,991
One last time.

947
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:08,076
What do you mean?

948
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,579
Let's make one last hit product.

949
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:13,373
What is it?

950
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:15,834
Pride insurance.

951
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:21,048
No!

952
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:28,680
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
THE DIVORCE INSURANCE

953
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,599
-We did it!
-We did it!
