1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,711
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,380
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,717
I think we're going deeper
into the mountain.

4
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,427
Are you sure GPS won't work here?

5
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:53,471
Actually,

6
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,681
my battery died a while ago.

7
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,017
What about yours?

8
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,020
If I still had any battery left,
I'd have called Ah-young ages ago.

9
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,855
I'm not using it because it's dead.

10
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,983
Yes, of course.

11
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,736
Don't worry about it.
We can find our way back.

12
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,238
All paths are connected to each other.

13
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:13,783
-This isn't the time for bravado.
-Because the Earth is round.

14
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:16,285
I'm afraid we'll come across
something scary here.

15
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,579
Seriously? Why would you say that?

16
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,319
Stay still.

17
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,240
Don't look into its eyes.

18
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,617
And don't turn your back on it.

19
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,092
Hey, kitty.

20
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,469
"Kitty"?

21
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,139
Don't move.

22
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,269
Good kitty. Nice kitty.

23
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,106
One…

24
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,941
Two…

25
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,151
Say cheese.

26
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,415
Damn it!

27
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,877
Run!

28
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,215
Where are we going?

29
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,218
Mommy!

30
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:15,696
Ms. Kang.

31
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,072
Ms. Kang, are you okay?

32
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,211
A tiger!

33
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,505
I can't believe I took this masterpiece!

34
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:34,798
I took a photo of a tiger!

35
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,593
Excuse me, but are you okay?

36
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,386
I took a photo of a tiger.

37
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,388
Right.

38
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,603
His beard…

39
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,651
Excuse me.

40
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,570
Are you Mr. Shin Hyeon-jae?

41
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:01,700
Do you know me?

42
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,458
We actually spent the whole day
looking for you, Mr. Shin.

43
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,584
You did?

44
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,170
I was scouting for new spots
to set up and wait.

45
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,047
I can't believe a tiger appeared for real.

46
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,632
It's a miracle.

47
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,302
Thank you, sir.
If it weren't for you, we'd be tiger food.

48
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:22,304
I should be the one thanking you.

49
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,556
I was actually acting on a tip I got.

50
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,058
But a tiger in Gangwon Province?

51
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,893
If I had been alone,

52
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:30,479
I wouldn't have survived the tiger,
much less taken a photo of it.

53
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:35,401
You two made my lifelong dream come true.
How can I ever thank you?

54
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,279
Actually, we have a favor to ask of you.

55
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,240
Name it, and I'll do it.

56
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,200
Please meet with Ms. Gu!

57
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,746
Did something happen to Mi-rae?

58
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,084
I guess you had no idea.

59
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,508
Thanks for the coffee.

60
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,053
If you need anything, just let me know.

61
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,722
-Yes, sir.
-I'm leaving now.

62
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,142
So that's why he was here.

63
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,153
Thank you.

64
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,530
Thank you.

65
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,328
Ms. Gu gave us a warm beverage too.

66
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,123
That's right.

67
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:34,126
Now that I think about it,
you two resemble each other.

68
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,128
Yes, well…

69
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,632
We're not your average married couple.

70
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,092
Our appearances are unusual,

71
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,304
and we both chase after the unreal.

72
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,638
I guess that's why

73
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,267
we fell for each other as soon as we met.

74
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,020
I see.

75
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,688
But this is how we ended up.

76
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:01,528
My wife believes in tarot readings
but not in the existence of wild tigers.

77
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,030
It's funny, isn't it?

78
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,742
She believes in things
that can't be proven,

79
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,119
but she can't believe in me

80
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,581
because I can't give her proof.

81
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,584
But you can prove it now.

82
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:20,380
She might change her mind
if you show her that photo.

83
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,134
No.

84
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,180
I think it's too late.

85
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,807
If I see Mi-rae right now…

86
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,685
I think we'll really get divorced.

87
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,778
If you place a cat and a vial of poison

88
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,698
that could break at any moment
in a sealed box,

89
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,994
would that cat be dead or alive?

90
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,917
Well…

91
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:02,297
I'm not sure. I don't know.

92
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,633
Right?

93
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:08,846
There's no way to know.

94
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,434
Unless you open the box.

95
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,944
I see.

96
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,532
I'll never know
what will happen in the future…

97
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,578
unless I meet with Mi-rae.

98
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,630
I'm afraid…

99
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,050
But I will…

100
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,012
meet with Mi-rae.

101
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,102
Okay.

102
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,827
It feels like I had a dream.

103
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,623
Yes. I'd believe it was a dream
if you told me so.

104
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,418
"A dream"?

105
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,465
You told me to come
to Gorangae Village immediately.

106
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,009
What dream were you two having
that you're just now showing up?

107
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,804
Right. I forgot I called you.

108
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,765
You forgot you called me?

109
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,310
It's because we ran into a tiger.

110
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,938
A tiger?

111
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,689
I see. You ran into a tiger.

112
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,526
Why don't you put some effort
into your lies?

113
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:51,907
What do you take me for?

114
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,077
Seriously? A tiger?

115
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,286
It's the truth.

116
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,289
And we found Mr. Shin Hyeon-jae.

117
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,792
Why do you work like this?

118
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,795
There's no plan or strategy.
It's so impulsive.

119
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,215
I suggested that we come, ma'am.

120
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,304
We thought meeting the parties in person
was necessary to prevent their divorce.

121
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,223
Ma'am.

122
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,851
On what basis did you call
the team members here to Gangwon Province?

123
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,816
I didn't call you, Ms. Jeon.

124
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,283
I'm exhausted. I'm going to pass out.

125
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:38,412
-We looked everywhere, but he's not here.
-He's not here.

126
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,458
Why is Ms. Jeon here?

127
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,716
Why does it feel like
I'm an unwelcome guest?

128
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,135
I brought her here.

129
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,180
After all, Ms. Jeon is part of the team.

130
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,435
Should we head back?

131
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,979
That's too much for you, Mr. An.
Let's sleep here and head back tomorrow.

132
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:04,980
Got it.

133
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:06,982
You're a pair.

134
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,900
You're a pair.

135
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,652
And we're a pair.

136
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,197
-Ms. Ah-young. This is fate.
-No, it's not.

137
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,200
I'll sleep in my car.
You had a long day, so rest well.

138
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,245
Here. Thank you for this.

139
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,755
Why don't you ladies take the house, then?

140
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,923
Let's go.

141
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,300
-What?
-I said let's go.

142
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,052
-Go where?
-Let's just go for now.

143
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,059
I'm so tired.

144
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,735
All set.

145
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,950
What do you think you're doing?

146
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,411
You called me out of the blue,
so at least give me a place to sleep.

147
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,580
Go back to Seoul.

148
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,416
It took us five hours to get here,
but you want me to go after five minutes?

149
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,834
Do you like me or something?

150
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,254
That's why
I came to spend the night with you.

151
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,508
Thanks a lot, you punk.

152
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:20,931
-Where are you going?
-Go to sleep!

153
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,478
Jeez, that punk.

154
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,086
What's wrong with me?

155
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,133
If you want to make a confession,
go to a priest.

156
00:11:57,008 --> 00:12:00,262
I haven't committed a sin yet,
so it's not a confession.

157
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,847
Then what is it?

158
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,934
I need advice.

159
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,697
-Choose one.
-Choose what?

160
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,031
Number one, friend mode.

161
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,701
Number two, Homo sapiens mode.
Number three, AI mode.

162
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,327
Number four…

163
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,874
Ex-husband mode.

164
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,094
-I'm going to sleep.
-Number four.

165
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:48,894
What are you doing?

166
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,938
I thought you were sleeping.

167
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,483
I don't sleep well around others.

168
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:55,775
Especially with other women.

169
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,778
I'm sorry for making you come
all the way here.

170
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,617
Do you like it?

171
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,703
Do you want to look together? Over there--

172
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,288
No, not that.

173
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,627
Do you like hanging out with Mr. Noh?

174
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,635
Didn't we tell you
that we found Mr. Shin Hyeon-jae?

175
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,054
Right, the tiger.

176
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:29,017
I forgot about that,
as the tiger story left an impression.

177
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,645
I'm sorry if you felt offended.

178
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,944
You're quick to apologize.

179
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,737
I'm quick at everything.

180
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,323
I was quick to get married
and quick to get divorced.

181
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,158
I'm quick when it comes to work too.

182
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,496
You make everything
look so easy, Ms. Jeon.

183
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,498
I do?

184
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,253
That doesn't mean
I didn't put in any effort.

185
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,923
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disparage you.

186
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,969
Everything is difficult for me, you see.

187
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,765
Maybe that's the reason why

188
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,476
we're not a good match.

189
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:16,940
Knitting, I mean.

190
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:18,650
Knitting?

191
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:23,488
It's too slow, rough, and uneven.

192
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,575
It's just bothersome and frustrating.

193
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,703
I'll just do my usual thing
and go to a designer store

194
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,080
and get what I want.

195
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,709
What about you, Ms. Kang?

196
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,629
I'm going to knit until I'm done.

197
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,090
Really?

198
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,886
It'll take a long time, though.

199
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,932
It might,
but it'll become sturdier over time.

200
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,604
Then I'll take that as you giving up

201
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,648
and claim the green one for myself.

202
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:09,618
It began when the flowers started to fade
and ended before the leaves changed color.

203
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,786
We didn't even last a season.

204
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,580
Time isn't everything.

205
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,125
Maybe not, but it's still important.

206
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,253
It was intense

207
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,088
but also fragile.

208
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,592
It didn't endure.

209
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,594
That's sad.

210
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,223
Yes. It wasn't pleasant for me either.

211
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,059
Are you sure it's over?

212
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,560
Yes.

213
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,187
Does the other person think so too?

214
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,105
It's over for me at least.

215
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,482
You sound firm about it.

216
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:44,944
It wasn't easy to get to this point.

217
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,615
It's not easy for me either.

218
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,246
I know.

219
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,291
That's why I'm scared.

220
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,922
Do I have to bring up
Schrödinger's cat again?

221
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,717
You don't always have to open the box.

222
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,888
If you still can't open it
after the seasons change,

223
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,265
then come back for more advice.

224
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,852
I'll go with number one when that happens.

225
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,064
That's the option
you've been talking to all along.

226
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,777
An Jeon-man.

227
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,946
What is it, Noh Ki-jun?

228
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,116
That's my default mode.

229
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,780
Jeez, look at the time.

230
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,503
PLUS GENERAL INSURANCE

231
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,385
K… H…

232
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,563
NEW MAIL

233
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:21,893
Let's skip the greetings.

234
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:22,977
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

235
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,562
Good morning!

236
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,234
Have you had breakfast yet?

237
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,708
I'm asking as your ex-ex-ex-wife.

238
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,629
What's going on between you two?

239
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:03,768
The two of us?

240
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,743
We're elementary school friends.

241
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,539
-Ma'am.
-Right.

242
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,758
This is fermented plaice and millet

243
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,761
served with napa cabbage wraps
and rice dish.

244
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:42,390
It's a Gangwon Province special delicacy.

245
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:52,609
Eat up, Ms. Ah-young.

246
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,903
-No, thank you.
-Open wide.

247
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:56,529
Seriously!

248
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:01,576
How is it?

249
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,119
It's really good.

250
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:27,727
It's good, right?

251
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,453
-Isn't it good?
-Yes.

252
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,006
-Is there any more?
-There's more inside.

253
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,217
-Bring some more.
-I'll go bring some more.

254
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,362
Thank you for coming.

255
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,114
-You found my husband?
-Yes.

256
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,198
Where is he?

257
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,284
He's waiting
at the bench near the pine tree.

258
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,157
Over here.

259
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,518
There's nothing we can do but wait.

260
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,062
We'll just have to wait
and hope for the box to open.

261
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,273
What if it opens
and the outcome turns out to be a divorce?

262
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,114
Well…

263
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,999
We'll have them eat fermented plaice
and napa cabbage wraps.

264
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,292
-Seriously?
-Right.

265
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:39,627
That's genius.

266
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,962
Seriously?

267
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,548
-I want to eat them again.
-I'm suddenly hungry.

268
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,341
-Me too.
-Shall we have some more?

269
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:04,485
I…

270
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,579
The thing is…

271
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:21,669
I saw a tiger.

272
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,255
What?

273
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,389
I'm sick of that damn tiger.

274
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:38,144
I came all the way here,
but the tiger's more important, right?

275
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,398
What did I expect?

276
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,694
I'm so sick of this.

277
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:49,780
They're coming.

278
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,742
Damn it. Why aren't they coming together?

279
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:53,868
Did it go wrong?

280
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,215
Did you talk things out?

281
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:08,466
I want a divorce ceremony.

282
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,719
Tigers are more important to that man.

283
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,679
Thank you for confirming
I made the right decision.

284
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,681
No, please wait a second.

285
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,517
Mr. Shin, please talk to her.

286
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,522
No, please.

287
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,691
-What are you doing?
-Wait.

288
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:28,486
I'm sorry.

289
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:33,407
Please just give it one more try.

290
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,451
-I'm sorry.
-What are you doing?

291
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,663
-Why are you doing this?
-I'm sorry, ma'am.

292
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,456
-I'm so sorry.
-Wait.

293
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,375
I'm sorry.

294
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,879
The two of you need to let it all out
and say what's on your mind

295
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,631
like other married couples.

296
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,840
I'm sorry.

297
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:54,845
-What is it? Should we go?
-What's going on?

298
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:57,515
-Just go!
-Ms. Jeon!

299
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:02,687
Mi-rae.

300
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,190
What now?

301
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,025
Are you going to talk about
that damn tiger again?

302
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,655
Yes, it's about the tiger.

303
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,781
But…

304
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,536
I wanted to give you proof.

305
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,292
I wanted to prove that what you thought
was unreal actually exists.

306
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,670
I never asked you to prove such nonsense.

307
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,005
I just…

308
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,844
I didn't want to be alone.

309
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,721
You always went
looking for something else,

310
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,681
but not for me who was right beside you.

311
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:43,519
I wanted to show it to you
and get your acknowledgment.

312
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,397
I thought if my photos were acknowledged
by people around the world

313
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,317
that you'd acknowledge me too.

314
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:53,195
Acknowledgment?

315
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:00,494
Remember you held out your hand
when I was about to give up in Santiago

316
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,830
even though we had never met before?

317
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,416
The moment I took your hand,

318
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:08,878
I had already acknowledged you.

319
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,269
So I trusted

320
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,190
we'd walk together for a lifetime
and that I'd never be lonely.

321
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,153
Oh, no…

322
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:41,535
I'm sorry.

323
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,456
I'm so sorry for making you feel lonely.

324
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,586
But I really had no idea.

325
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,797
Why didn't you tell me this before?

326
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:56,467
Because I didn't want to admit
that I had made the wrong choice.

327
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:58,844
You know I have a lot of pride, right?

328
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,573
This is fermented plaice and millet

329
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:22,493
served with napa cabbage wraps
and rice dish.

330
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,662
Here, try it.

331
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,040
-Thank you.
-Sure.

332
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:32,044
This is a Gangwon Province
special delicacy.

333
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,796
Oh, sure.

334
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,756
Hurry and try it.

335
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,427
-Hurry up now.
-Okay.

336
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,013
Are they eating it?

337
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,351
It's good, isn't it?

338
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,771
It's really good, right?

339
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:53,190
There's plenty,
so let me know if you need more.

340
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,653
-Oh, shoot.
-Hey.

341
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,664
So I was wondering

342
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:12,251
if you would mind
looking at the tiger photo I took.

343
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,045
Let's see it.

344
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,090
Hold on.

345
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,384
See? He said tiger.

346
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,094
-We really did see one.
-Seriously?

347
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:23,596
Here.

348
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,647
You're annoyed, right?

349
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,357
You already know.

350
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:40,946
But at least it's a real tiger.

351
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:43,491
Congratulations.

352
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,703
Then are we--

353
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,455
I think I'll head back now.

354
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,333
Wait a minute.

355
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,879
Are you two enjoying…

356
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,465
There's so much food left over.

357
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:03,552
We should appreciate the effort
of the person who prepared this meal,

358
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,262
so how about we finish this off?

359
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:08,724
And we prepared something
that you haven't seen yet.

360
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,101
We'll get it ready in a jiffy,
so take your time and eat.

361
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:12,228
-I have to get going--
-No.

362
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,021
No, just enjoy the meal.

363
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,732
-No, we actually--
-Please take your time.

364
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,236
-What are you doing?
-Let's go.

365
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,531
-Ms. Jeon, get going.
-Hey.

366
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,200
Can you stay a little longer?

367
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,163
-What is it?
-What's going on?

368
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,832
It feels like we need to do something.

369
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,293
See what I mean?
You're terribly impulsive.

370
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,921
So we're just going to
let them get a divorce?

371
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,839
What more can we do for them?

372
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,049
Damn it.

373
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,851
A continuation ceremony.

374
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,186
-Continuation ceremony?
-Continuation ceremony?

375
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,188
Not a divorce ceremony
but a continuation ceremony.

376
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:59,108
It's a ceremony to encourage
the continuation of their marriage.

377
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,818
Like a vow renewal ceremony.

378
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:07,908
But how do you perform
a continuation ceremony?

379
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,955
Can we pull that off by today?

380
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,126
And for less than 30,000 won at that?

381
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,754
This is so hard.

382
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,352
Mr. Village Head.

383
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,021
Yes?

384
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,986
Ms. Gu and Mr. Shin agreed
to have a continuation ceremony.

385
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:20,689
-I wonder if I ever had days like this.
-Of course.

386
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,317
I'd like to carry this bouquet
and get married again.

387
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:29,865
You can arrange them like this.

388
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:34,536
Great job.

389
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:36,955
It's so pretty.

390
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,212
Let's make one more.

391
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,474
Here, let me do it.

392
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,643
-It's okay.
-I'll do it.

393
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:10,197
I raised nine children in this house.

394
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:15,285
It may be hard to believe,
but I had a modern wedding back then.

395
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,162
This is so pretty.

396
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,331
This reminds me of my husband.

397
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,001
You two must be married.

398
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,378
What?

399
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,296
-No.
-No, we're not.

400
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,633
"It's not your fault.
Things happen for a reason."

401
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,719
You have to believe this to live together.

402
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,847
Can you guess
who the unhappiest person in the world is?

403
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,098
It's someone

404
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,517
who has nobody to lift them up
when they fall.

405
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,478
That's why couples live together.

406
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:45,149
It's so you have someone
to lift you up when you're down.

407
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:46,942
Yes, ma'am.

408
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,444
Yes.

409
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,076
Thank you, sir.

410
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,121
When I was a miner dispatched to Germany,

411
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,165
my wife was a nurse.

412
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:04,543
This is the suit I had tailored there
for our wedding.

413
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,003
"Glück Auf."

414
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,839
It means "Good luck and ascend safely."

415
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:12,342
My wife stitched that herself
in the hopes that I'd return alive.

416
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:17,890
But I don't know why
I treated her so terribly back then.

417
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:21,185
Saying kind words to her
wouldn't have cost me anything.

418
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,104
Be good to each other while you still can.

419
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,939
Don't live with the same regret that I do.

420
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,860
Yes, sir.

421
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,757
Please welcome the bride!

422
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,019
Ladies and gentlemen,

423
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,521
thank you for attending
this continuation ceremony.

424
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:21,406
I may be out of line, but as village head,
I'd like to say a few words.

425
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:25,452
Our village lives by embracing the winds.

426
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,329
It's not easy to farm these fields

427
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,706
and harvest our crops on a mountainside

428
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,041
where the temperature drops.

429
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:34,795
Our harvest seems small and unimpressive
compared to crops grown on flat land.

430
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:35,879
However,

431
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,590
our crops boast rich flavors.

432
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:43,261
It's an unexpected gift
from the harsh farming conditions.

433
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:46,682
I realized when I began farming

434
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:50,727
that even fog and frost
play a part in farming.

435
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:56,858
Just like napa cabbage
pushing through harsh, rock-filled fields,

436
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:02,781
I hope you two continue to live
with the same resilience.

437
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,163
-Congratulations!
-Be happy!

438
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:12,165
Congratulations!

439
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:14,084
-You look beautiful!
-Congratulations!

440
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:18,005
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

441
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,631
Looking good!

442
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,384
-Be happy!
-Congratulations!

443
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:56,626
Those two will hold hands again
and continue as travel companions, right?

444
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,420
I think it's good.

445
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,590
What's good? Being together again?

446
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,635
It's good that you can be uncertain.

447
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,513
It makes you feel free
yet firm at the same time.

448
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:13,226
Having a partner who can keep you steady
even when you feel lost…

449
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:20,901
is something only the fortunate
get to experience, right?

450
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:34,081
Now let's take a photo
to mark the occasion.

451
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,293
One, two, three.

452
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,866
-Come along now.
-No, thank you.

453
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,951
Just come.

454
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,017
I didn't tell you this before,

455
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,269
but when I held out my hand to you,

456
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:22,731
I was actually about to give up
because it was too hard for me.

457
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,818
I set out on the trail
with half-hearted courage.

458
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:30,864
I was only able to complete the journey
because I met you.

459
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,866
That's a surprise.

460
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:37,120
I figured you were adventurous
since you searched for tigers.

461
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,748
The thing is…

462
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:42,667
To be honest…

463
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,378
I…

464
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:49,925
I'm a wimp.

465
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:52,677
It was all an act.

466
00:41:57,641 --> 00:42:00,143
Do you remember
the milestone with scallop shells?

467
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:01,228
Of course.

468
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,481
That's where I was crying on the ground.

469
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:06,483
Safe travels.

470
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:11,738
There were shoes hanging
from the eucalyptus tree.

471
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:15,575
We kept wondering
how someone got them to the top.

472
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:16,785
"Welcome."

473
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,914
-The Korean scribbled on the wall.
-Right. Do you remember?

474
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,123
Of course I do.

475
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,794
Words were scribbled on the wall
in all sorts of languages,

476
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,837
but you found it.

477
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,506
How could I forget that?

478
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,592
They're memories only the two of us share.

479
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:37,347
Right. They're our secret codes.

480
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,141
We'll remember…

481
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,354
this moment, too, right?

482
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:48,525
We already have.

483
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,322
Just promise me one thing.

484
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,284
Don't grow out a beard.

485
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,035
I only care about looks.

486
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,042
Thank you.

487
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,347
You seem to be
in desperate need of escape.

488
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,353
Can you help me escape?

489
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:26,938
Of course.

490
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:29,858
Then take me to a hotel
within a ten-minute radius.

491
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,735
Excuse me? What?

492
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:35,113
I need to crash.

493
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:52,130
Are you sure the continuation ceremony
cost less than 30,000 won?

494
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:55,008
Yes, all the villagers helped prepare it.

495
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,302
The paper used to make confetti
cost 2,700 won.

496
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,845
The kids' snacks cost 7,800 won.

497
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,722
Additional beverages cost 16,200 won.

498
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,932
So we spent a total of 26,700 won.

499
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:04,601
Which leaves 3,300 won.

500
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,480
Do you want the change?

501
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,023
What can I do with that money?

502
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:12,901
If you're lucky, you can get
a full convenience store meal.

503
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,403
Two triangle gimbap for the price of one
and a can of coffee.

504
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:19,407
Hold on to the change. We'll eat together.

505
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,123
I'll drive this time.

506
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,125
You drove down here.

507
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,049
That's reasonable.

508
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,280
One, two. Let's go.

509
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,616
-Don't do it.
-Leave it to us.

510
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,077
We'll wrap things up here,
so you can go now.

511
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,121
He's right, Han-deul.
You and Mr. Noh can go.

512
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:09,290
-What about Ms. Jeon?
-She and Mr. An just left.

513
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,669
We'll take care of the rest here.

514
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,463
Let's go.
It feels like we're getting in the way.

515
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:18,299
You're right. We'll head out, then.

516
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,135
-We'll leave you to it.
-See you later.

517
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:22,554
Please wrap things up here

518
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:23,763
and treat the villagers.

519
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:26,516
Your personal credit card?
Top 1% salary sure is good.

520
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,561
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

521
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:31,312
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

522
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:33,440
Okay.

523
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:37,152
How many stars does it have?

524
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:38,695
It has three.

525
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,281
Three?

526
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:43,616
I had to pick between a ten-minute radius
and the star rating.

527
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,868
Jeez.

528
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,370
If you don't like it,
there's a 4-star hotel 45 minutes away.

529
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:51,666
Should I drive back to Seoul?

530
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,503
Three-star hotel it is.

531
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:57,589
Very well.

532
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:09,100
The tarot reading turned out to be true.

533
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,603
Remember how it predicted your success?

534
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,607
Oh, actually…

535
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:19,486
That wasn't the question I asked.

536
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:20,570
Excuse me?

537
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,363
It wasn't?

538
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,325
Then what was the question?

539
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:27,952
I'm not telling you.

540
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:30,622
Seriously?

541
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,791
I'll tell you when the results come out.

542
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:34,959
Seriously…

543
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:37,879
No, wait. If I succeed,
I'll tell you then.

544
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:42,133
Fine, then.

545
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:44,594
Just how big of a question did you ask?

546
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,971
Let's see if you succeed or not.

547
00:46:55,438 --> 00:47:00,485
At the end of an exhausting day,
how about winding down with me?

548
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,736
Good night.

549
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,240
Hello, listeners.
I'm your host, Park Ji-yoon.

550
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,535
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

551
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,122
HASONG GENERAL STORE

552
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:14,791
It feels warm tonight.

553
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:15,917
Yes, it does.

554
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,804
I was a little disappointed
with you before.

555
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,185
I'm asking as your ex-ex-ex-wife.

556
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,106
What's going on between you two?

557
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,524
The two of us?

558
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,406
We're elementary school friends.

559
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:50,034
-Ma'am.
-Right.

560
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:52,704
Never mind.

561
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:13,975
This is making me emotional.

562
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:19,939
And the stars are bright.

563
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:24,902
The stars look like a Christmas tree.

564
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:29,032
What was Christmas like
when you were young?

565
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,828
It felt a bit empty.

566
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:35,496
Empty?

567
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:42,712
Our family didn't celebrate Christmas
the way it was meant to be.

568
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,797
There were no shiny decorations.

569
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:46,841
It was just quiet.

570
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:52,055
My parents didn't have
a good relationship.

571
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:01,064
It made me sad when I was a kid,

572
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,608
but I'm fine now.

573
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,614
Then why don't you put up
a shiny Christmas tree this year?

574
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,159
It doesn't feel right,
given the situation at home.

575
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,751
It's a pay phone.

576
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:25,672
Hey, that's really old.

577
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:28,091
I know. I wonder if it still works.

578
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,731
It doesn't work.

579
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:55,993
Hello?

580
00:49:58,788 --> 00:49:59,956
Who are you calling?

581
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:01,833
Future Han-deul.

582
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,671
Okay. Don't mind me
and continue your call.

583
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:10,925
Hello?

584
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,971
Hi, it's Han-deul from the present.

585
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,181
So…

586
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:20,852
Did you manage to succeed?

587
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,147
Why don't you call future Ki-jun?

588
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:10,359
Okay.

589
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:19,118
I'll put this over and behind you.

590
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:28,252
Redial.

591
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,263
Hello?

592
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:43,309
Hey, Noh Ki-jun.

593
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:49,690
Remember today.

594
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,397
This was the best you could find?

595
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:32,692
It looks better than the photos.

596
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:34,694
I'll get the room keys.

597
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,183
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

598
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,102
Will you rate us, please?

599
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:46,784
Let's skip the greetings.

600
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,662
-Very well. I'll meet you outside.
-Okay.

601
00:54:57,962 --> 00:54:59,463
Here's your credit card, sir.

602
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:00,840
-You're all set.
-Thank you.

603
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,137
GUEST FEEDBACK CARD

604
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,847
WARNING: TIGER SIGHTINGS

605
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,682
IF YOU SEE A TIGER
IN DEULMEORI FOREST PATH,

606
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:10,766
DO NOT APPROACH IT

607
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,852
PLEASE BE CAREFUL
AND ONLY TAKE PROOF SHOTS

608
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:24,071
-You must be sleepy.
-Yes, well…

609
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:36,625
Just relax.

610
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:42,006
N equals

611
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:45,217
Rs times fp times ne times

612
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:47,928
fl times fi times fc times L.

613
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,597
What formula are you reciting now?

614
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,016
It's called the Drake equation.

615
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:55,561
It's a formula to estimate the possibility
of meeting extraterrestrials.

616
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:57,938
-There's such a formula?
-There's a formula for everything.

617
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,440
Jeez, scientists…

618
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,109
What's even more interesting is that

619
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:05,571
a scientist used the equation to calculate
the chance of meeting your soul mate.

620
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:06,822
Seriously?

621
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:08,699
So what's the probability?

622
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:11,077
It's 0.00034%.

623
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:15,456
That basically means
there's no such thing as a soul mate.

624
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:16,999
That's not true.

625
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,835
It's not zero.

626
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,390
So I've been thinking…

627
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:37,311
What do you think of this?

628
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:41,732
This situation isn't
exactly at zero either, so…

629
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:47,863
LEFT TURN SIGNAL
PEDESTRIAN SIGNAL

630
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,249
Do you want to live at my place?

631
00:57:04,964 --> 00:57:06,715
Stay at my place.

632
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:23,399
SPECIAL THANKS TO HAN SEON-HWA AND
KWAK SI-YANG FOR THEIR GUEST APPEARANCES

633
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,773
You're coming to work together now?

634
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:07,651
Coming to work together means
they're more than just colleagues, right?

635
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:10,154
-What do you think, Mr. An?
-How did you know it was me?

636
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,072
You're really cute right now,
you know that?

637
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,365
They say being cute is all it takes.

638
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,910
I can't stand
complicated things like this.

639
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,953
They filed an insurance claim.

640
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:19,955
-What?
-They signed the divorce papers

641
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:21,248
and are at the courthouse right now!

642
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:23,459
We have to change their minds
within the four-week waiting period.

643
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,169
Would you like to try couples therapy?

644
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:26,921
I'm getting a divorce.

645
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,006
Let's get a feel for the situation first.

646
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:30,633
How are you so strong?

647
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,718
Hello? Goodness, Ms. Choi.

648
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,136
I'm not positive,

649
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:37,223
-but I think he has another woman.
-Another woman?

650
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:39,266
If we can't stop this divorce…

651
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,351
Scope of coverage.

652
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:41,602
"The insured must be

653
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,438
an adult male or female who is
currently not engaged in an affair."

654
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,024
We can declare this contract void.

655
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:48,817
Do we really have to do this?

656
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:51,111
She's decided to get divorced
and must be upset as it is.

657
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,238
We have to.

658
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:53,989
It's for the success of this project.
