00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,146
Do you want to live at my place?

5
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,233
Stay at my place.

EPISODE 7

7
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,140
-Mr. Noh?
-Yes.

8
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,725
Have you eaten anything?

9
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,269
There's stuff in the fridge.
Help yourself to it.

10
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,149
I don't have anything at home. I feel bad.

11
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,775
Should I bring you anything?

12
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,861
No worries. It's okay.

13
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,280
I'll just order in.

14
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,741
Let's treat
each other's places like our own

15
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,075
and make ourselves comfortable.

16
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,327
Thank you.

17
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,495
Don't mention it.

18
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,580
Goodbye.

19
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,178
This fridge is cute.

20
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,142
So is the stuff inside it.

21
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,698
I guess she likes toast.

22
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,788
How has she been living like this?

23
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,140
I guess he doesn't have a toaster.

24
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,607
Do you want to live at my place?

25
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,527
Stay at my house.

26
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,040
And I'll stay at your place, Ms. Kang.

27
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,213
Oh, I meant that we should swap places.

28
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:58,882
What?

29
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,261
I don't really have any good memories
of my current place either.

30
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,972
Of course,
it's not as bad as your situation.

31
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,977
But it will be uncomfortable for you
because there's nothing at my place.

32
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,311
That's okay.

33
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,772
Plus, our units are in the same building
and are the same size.

34
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,649
So their values are nearly equal.

35
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,192
There's nothing complicated about it.

36
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,863
We're just swapping places
until either of us sells our apartment.

37
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,573
What do you say?

38
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,248
Then how about a month-long stay?

39
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,584
"A month-long stay"?

40
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,007
I've actually often thought about

41
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,426
getting out of there immediately.

42
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,553
But I couldn't just leave without a plan.

43
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,514
-Just get out of there right now.
-Right now?

44
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,642
-You don't want to?
-It's not that.

45
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,439
It's just that this wasn't planned.

46
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,649
They say plans change without warning.

47
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,791
Right.

48
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,044
Since when has life ever gone as planned?

49
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,103
It's so empty here.

50
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:39,149
I'll either have to move that
or put something in it.

51
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,027
I'll bring my own chair next time.

52
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:18,665
Oh, wait.

53
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,834
I don't even have a pillow at my place.

54
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,364
I should keep it down
at this time of night.

55
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,868
I'll just do it tomorrow.

56
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,040
This isn't good.

57
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,378
Right, I don't have a watch.

58
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,509
Should I call…

59
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,806
A text message is probably better, right?

60
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,934
"If by any chance you're…

61
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,146
still awake…"

62
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,071
Hey.

63
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,199
Good, you're still awake.

64
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,910
I'm on my way
to grab my charger from my car.

65
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:37,995
What about you?

66
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,415
I thought you might need a pillow.

67
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,667
Thank you.

68
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,254
Since you're here,
why don't you grab whatever you need?

69
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,729
-Then if you'll excuse me…
-Okay.

70
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,270
Here we go.

71
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,825
If I go up now,
she might feel uncomfortable.

72
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,079
Then I might as well…

73
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,236
I need to fix that motion sensor light.

74
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,701
Ms. Kang, you're not back, are you?

75
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,787
It's me.

76
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,253
Why am I tiptoeing in my own house?

77
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,840
Let's see here.

78
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,846
Which one should I wear?

79
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:02,973
Right.

80
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,643
This one is the best.

81
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,147
I'm leaving now.

82
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,785
No, wait! It's me!

83
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,747
-Ms. Kang, it's me.
-What?

84
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,976
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.

85
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,812
Are there bricks in that bag?

86
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,731
Of course not.

87
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,317
I came for this.

88
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,362
A new tomorrow has just begun.

89
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,242
Right. We usually call that "today."

90
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,411
Oh, that's right.

91
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,704
You're right.

92
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,959
I…

93
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,520
The motion sensor is broken.

94
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,272
Okay.

95
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,358
So you…

96
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,195
You can just keep this one on instead.

97
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,696
I see. Okay.

98
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,201
I should've told you earlier.

99
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,376
-I'll be off, then.
-Okay.

100
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,545
Right.

101
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,380
Okay.

102
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,675
Good night, Ms. Kang.

103
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,760
-Okay.
-Bye.

104
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,069
UNDERWRITER KANG HAN-DEUL

105
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,488
ARE YOU HOME?
HOW'S YOUR HEAD?

106
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,865
ACTUARY NOH KI-JUN

107
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,867
IT THROBS A BIT,
BUT IT DOESN'T HURT

108
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,619
AND YOU?
DID YOU GET WHAT YOU NEEDED?

109
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,247
BY THE WAY,
WILL YOU BE USING THE TOASTER?

110
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,292
I COULDN'T FIND ONE HERE,
SO IF YOU DON'T USE IT…

111
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,544
NEVER MIND, I WAS JUST ASKING.
YOU CAN USE IT, MR. NOH.

112
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,173
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE POLITE
ABOUT YOUR OWN TOASTER

113
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,927
I WON'T USE IT.
I'LL BRING IT TO YOU LATER.

114
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,139
OKAY. MESSAGE ME ANYTIME
IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING YOU NEED.

115
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:38,188
AND THANK YOU FOR HOLDING
THE ELEVATOR EARLIER.

116
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:46,237
OKAY. MESSAGE ME ANYTIME
IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING YOU NEED.

117
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:52,661
WILL DO. SWEET DREAMS.

118
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,204
No.

119
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:02,087
WILL DO.

120
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,718
WILL DO.

121
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,601
Great, it's my pillow.

122
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,121
The images carved on the moon

123
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,331
are not a fairy tale about a rabbit.

124
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,625
They're craters
formed by fallen meteorites.

125
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,672
Most meteorites that fall toward Earth

126
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,716
either burn up
while entering Earth's atmosphere,

127
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,176
or if they survive,
they land in the ocean.

128
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,389
Some cosmic disasters…

129
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,728
leave scars that remain raw and vivid

130
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,604
even after thousands of years.

131
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,029
I need to get a bed in here right away.

132
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:13,742
Let's just sleep.

133
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,377
Good morning.

134
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,015
ALARM QUESTION

135
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,562
How do I…

136
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,659
I thought you might need this.

137
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,536
I really do.

138
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,799
It looks like you slept really well.

139
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,888
Here, I'll take that.

140
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,974
Get ready for work.
I'll wait for you downstairs.

141
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:35,740
Crap.

142
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,581
Ms. Kang, over here. Get in.

143
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,672
How did you sleep?
Was the bed comfortable?

144
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,091
-I slept well.
-That's good.

145
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,218
Thank you for earlier.

146
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,555
I know you purposely came over
to help with the alarm.

147
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,809
I couldn't send
Jeon-man over there, could I?

148
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,858
Hey, this is my favorite travel mug.

149
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:10,942
How did you know?

150
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,903
Really? It just caught my eye.

151
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,864
I guess we have similar tastes in things.

152
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,825
Try this and see
if we have similar taste as well.

153
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,207
This is really good.

154
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:29,836
When did you make this?

155
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,885
Ms. Kang, take your time eating.

156
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,469
Okay.

157
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,889
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

158
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,726
-Would you like some coffee?
-Sure.

159
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,065
This coffee is great.

160
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,817
Really? Is the flavor strong enough?

161
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,819
It can be stronger.

162
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,362
-Okay. I'll take note of that.
-Okay.

163
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,626
You're coming to work together now?

164
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,423
What's going on between you two?

165
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,599
We'll head up first, Ms. Jeon.

166
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:25,725
Let's go.

167
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:33,524
Coming to work together means
they're more than just colleagues, right?

168
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,486
What do you think, Mr. An?

169
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,699
Well, they must've carpooled here.

170
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,871
How did you know it was me?

171
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,667
I recognized your scent, Mr. An.

172
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,799
You're really cute right now,
you know that?

173
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,514
They say being cute is all it takes.

174
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,748
Just a second!

175
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,921
-Sorry.
-Excuse me.

176
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:11,080
Excuse me.

177
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,332
I'm sorry.

178
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,505
Excuse me.

179
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,633
Okay.

180
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,556
Can we have a quick chat before going in?

181
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,815
I'm sorry, Ms. Kang,

182
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,609
for putting you in an awkward position.

183
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:45,776
It's okay.

184
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,822
It's not just because of you, Mr. Noh.

185
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:57,747
Then should we

186
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,334
put a name to our relationship?

187
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,797
If open-ended questions are too hard,
we can go with a scale of 1 to 5.

188
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,099
Please answer the following

189
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,770
by saying "up" or "down"
to describe our relationship.

190
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,439
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:27,443
Number one, neighbors.

192
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:29,820
Up.

193
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,865
Number two, work colleagues.

194
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:34,909
Up.

195
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,163
Number three, friends.

196
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,377
Up.

197
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,676
Number four…

198
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,761
Number four is…

199
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,515
Down.

200
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,893
I'm sorry. It's somewhere
between three and four,

201
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,938
but I can't think of a good name for it.

202
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,065
Since our relationship is so evasive.

203
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,027
Then let's call it a gray zone.

204
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,281
Gray zone?

205
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:14,740
Yes.

206
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,537
-That's genius.
-Do you like it?

207
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,664
For now.

208
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:22,623
Good.

209
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:26,210
Then, let's keep our relationship
in the gray until we find our number four.

210
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,753
Okay. Then…

211
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,506
I'll be "gray."

212
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:32,550
Then I'll be "zone."

213
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:34,552
And stay right next to "gray."

214
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,481
Hey!

215
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,484
We're in trouble.

216
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,653
-Why? What is it?
-What is it?

217
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:55,406
Ms. Woo Seon-hee filed an insurance claim.

218
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,615
-What?
-What?

219
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,617
She's filing divorce papers!

220
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,161
-Hold on a second.
-Look into it now!

221
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:03,414
She isn't on the first-to-sign-up list
or high-risk group list.

222
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,291
She's our latest applicant.

223
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:08,085
She can't file an insurance claim
because of the 90-day waiting period.

224
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,463
-Right.
-You're not getting it.

225
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,131
Don't you think I know that already?

226
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,800
What about the zero percent divorce rate
during the six-month term?

227
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:17,386
It doesn't matter if they divorce now
or 90 days from now.

228
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,929
What are you going to do about this?

229
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:22,350
They signed the divorce papers
and are at the courthouse right now!

230
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:25,311
Now is not the time
to be sitting around like this!

231
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,937
-No, that can't happen!
-No, sir!

232
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:29,690
-No!
-Get moving!

233
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:33,361
You don't have time to grab your scarf!
Don't make me come after you!

234
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:34,862
Get going right now!

235
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,866
SUPREME COURT OF KOREA

236
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,205
Where could they be?

237
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,707
Let's check the submission counter
and then split up to look for them.

238
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,167
But we don't know what they look like.

239
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,419
Just grab anyone
who looks to be 70 or older…

240
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:51,504
I think I found them.

241
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,963
Where?

242
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,051
This is what you wanted.

243
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,345
I gave you what you wanted, got it?

244
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,014
Thanks.

245
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:06,310
You never once did what I asked until now.

246
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:09,271
The least you can do is apologize.

247
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,649
You're such a stubborn woman!

248
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,734
Exactly.

249
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:18,155
So don't live with an ignorant woman
who doesn't get you.

250
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:20,908
Go find a young, intelligent woman

251
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,202
who is sweet and affectionate.

252
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:27,873
I'm going to live freely from now on too.

253
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:29,542
Freely?

254
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,293
Did you say freely?

255
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:35,214
Goodness. Calm down
before you actually pass out.

256
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,882
Don't work yourself up out here.

257
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,592
Let's just go home.

258
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,887
What's the matter with her?

259
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,931
Honey, is there food at home?

260
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,891
Let's eat now if your blood sugar is low.

261
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,560
Forget it.

262
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,895
You don't even like restaurant food.

263
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,356
Stop acting like you care all of a sudden.

264
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,610
I guess they've already filed
the divorce papers.

265
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,946
We're doomed. This whole thing is doomed.

266
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,533
Let's go.

267
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,666
Get out. Just get out.

268
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,126
I don't want to look at you.

269
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,463
What are you going to do about this?

270
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,131
Tell me what you're going to do!

271
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,341
I'm so stressed.

272
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,219
We still have four weeks left.

273
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:25,890
Ms. Jeon.

274
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,641
Hello, ma'am. I'm sorry.

275
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:32,563
Darn it.

276
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,568
This is a serious situation, ma'am.

277
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:41,906
A gray divorce doesn't just happen
after 10 or 20 years, ma'am.

278
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:45,367
That's why I have
all you intelligent people here.

279
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,164
Put your heads together
and come up with something.

280
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,042
We have to change her mind
within the four-week waiting period.

281
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,336
-Let's have a meeting.
-Yes, ma'am.

282
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,758
How can we possibly change her mind
in four weeks?

283
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,134
Why aren't you coming in?

284
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,845
-You'd better follow me in!
-We're coming.

285
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,517
All of you milling around,
get inside right now!

286
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,143
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

287
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:17,233
POLICYHOLDER PERSONAL INFORMATION

288
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:23,072
She's not on the first-to-sign-up list
or high-risk group list,

289
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,448
so maybe the divorce was impulsive.

290
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:29,161
The thing about divorce
is that it's never impulsive.

291
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,579
On what grounds?

292
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:38,754
You'd understand if you'd been divorced.

293
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,674
It's especially true for gray divorces.

294
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,051
They've probably gone through
all sorts of hardships together.

295
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,345
Well, damn it. Good for you.

296
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:49,890
Fine, let's move on for now.

297
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,685
How did she slip through
the high-risk group filter?

298
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,938
It could've happened
if she hadn't intended to divorce.

299
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,482
They filed the divorce papers together,

300
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,859
but you're saying
they didn't really mean it?

301
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,361
And on what grounds?

302
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,196
After they filed the papers,

303
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,574
we saw them go home together,
like it was the most natural thing to do.

304
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,076
As if they were needle and thread.

305
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:12,037
They kept talking about divorce,

306
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:14,248
but it didn't seem like
it had sunken in for them.

307
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,874
Freely?

308
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,794
Goodness. Calm down
before you actually pass out.

309
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,962
Honey, is there food at home?

310
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,464
Let's eat now if your blood sugar is low.

311
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,216
You're right.

312
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,509
How does that make any sense?

313
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,803
Why would they file for divorce
if they don't intend to…

314
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:33,475
Wait, do you think
they're after the payout?

315
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,897
If so, they'd have considered
the waiting period before filing.

316
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:39,815
No.

317
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,484
Right. In any case, this is weird.

318
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,529
The fact that she even signed up
for divorce insurance at her age is weird.

319
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,574
How did she even know
about divorce insurance?

320
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,951
That's what I'm saying.

321
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,537
That's because…

322
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:55,873
-What the heck?
-Jeez!

323
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,124
What?

324
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,752
Who are you?

325
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,462
Calm down.

326
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:04,256
-Who's that?
-Things have been happening so quickly

327
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,841
that I forgot to introduce him.

328
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,926
He's a junior colleague
who works in insurance.

329
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,762
Calm down. Come back and sit down.

330
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,598
Hey, say hello.
This is our senior managing director.

331
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,350
And these are members of the team.

332
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,560
Hello, everyone.

333
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:18,729
I'm Nam Chang-hee,
and I sell insurance in Ssangmun-dong.

334
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,732
-I look forward to working with you.
-Nice to meet you.

335
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:23,442
-Take a seat.
-Are you okay?

336
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,612
Sit down. We're short on time
and need to finish this meeting.

337
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,906
Ms. Jeon, please continue.

338
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,116
Why is he here?

339
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:35,120
The thing is, since we have
a couple of rejected cases--

340
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,330
Mr. Na.

341
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,583
I'd rather hear it straight from him.

342
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,004
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

343
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,049
Mr. Na asked me

344
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:51,095
to take care of the two cases
that were rejected.

345
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,680
So?

346
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,182
So I did.

347
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,725
Did what?

348
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,937
I'm the one who got Ms. Woo
to sign up for divorce insurance.

349
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,898
No way.

350
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,156
TEXT, TEXT, TEXT

351
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:17,496
ENERGETIC AND EXCITING SINGING CLASS

352
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,874
Send me a text, text, text

00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:23,377
Send me a text, text, text

354
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,716
-Just me
-Just me

355
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,428
-Please send me a text
-Please send me a text

-Are you curious about what I do?
-Are you curious about what I do?

357
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:41,145
-Then send me a text
-Then send me a text

358
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:46,108
-If you want to know what I'm thinking
-If you want to know what I'm thinking

359
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,359
-Then you should…
-Then you should…

360
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,695
Just a moment, please.

361
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:53,365
Let me dry off her tears
before we continue.

362
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:58,829
Ms. Woo is a student in my singing class.

363
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:01,999
We were singing an upbeat song
when she started sobbing.

364
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,083
Thank you.

365
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,710
Are you feeling okay now?

366
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,463
My friend of 30 years sent me a text

367
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,048
saying her house was going to get seized.

368
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:13,135
How could I refuse to help her?

369
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:16,013
The bad person here is the one
who schemed to exploit me.

370
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:20,100
But why does he only blame me
for what happened?

371
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:23,187
It turned out that she was
a victim of a phishing scam.

372
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,898
Luckily, she didn't lose any money.

373
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,025
But her husband gave her
a lot of grief over it.

374
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,652
He keeps saying
I'm stupid or that I'm a fool.

375
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,362
He says I'm frustrating and belittles me.

376
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:34,907
Just because he's the breadwinner,

377
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:39,077
he only sees me as his wife
who cooks and does laundry.

378
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,454
I'm nothing but a servant.

379
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:46,210
If I could, I'd get divorced right now.

380
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,337
Ma'am, don't say that.

381
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,172
That's more unfair to you.

382
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,174
Think of how long you've put up with him.

383
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,093
Unless you have something like this.

384
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,054
"Divorce insurance"?

385
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,600
Of all the people to sign up--

386
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,186
I thought you just needed the numbers.

387
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,646
Right.

388
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,481
Why me?

389
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,819
I'm terribly sorry, Ms. Jeon.

390
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,863
But even so,

391
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,783
it doesn't make sense to get divorced
over a phishing scam.

392
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,744
The phishing scam was a trigger.
This has been a long time coming.

393
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:21,912
That's right.

394
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:25,415
Mr. Young-kyu is very stingy and stubborn,

395
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,668
and he looks down on Ms. Woo all the time.

396
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,673
But Mr. Young-kyu
isn't the only one to blame

397
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,259
because Ms. Woo
has made bad financial decisions.

398
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:38,345
She's very kind,
so she agrees to act as a guarantor

399
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,138
and lends money to people.

400
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,057
Oh dear.

401
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,978
Goodness, the damage is too deep.

402
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,146
Noh Ki-jun, what should we do?

403
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,108
You can fix this, right?

404
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,320
Since we know the gist of the situation,

405
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,739
Ms. Joh and I will go
and see Ms. Woo Seon-hee.

406
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,116
Okay, good.

407
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,828
Okay, then Mr. An and I
will meet the husband.

408
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,622
-No, you can't meet Mr. Young-kyu.
-Why not?

409
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:08,667
If he finds out Ms. Woo
took out a policy, he'll lose it.

410
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,129
He'll scold her for being naive
and falling for a scam again.

411
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,841
And if he finds out
it's divorce insurance,

412
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,259
it'll make him want to get divorced.

413
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,594
I understand.

414
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:23,265
If I were to find out my wife
took out a divorce insurance policy…

415
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,227
The thought of it alone is horrible.

416
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,355
Come on, sir.

417
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:34,109
That hasn't even happened. It's okay.

418
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,527
It's not like the old woman
actually did it.

419
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:37,195
You punk, you can't call her an old woman.

420
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,239
My apologies. I meant Ms. Lee.

421
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,285
Mr. Na.

422
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,748
I'm sorry, Ms. Jeon.

423
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,334
We'll put off formally meeting
the husband, then.

424
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,419
Let's get a feel for the situation first.

425
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,546
How?

426
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,423
Mr. Na, you have pent-up anger.

427
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:57,716
You have a herniated disk in the neck.

428
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,177
As for me…

429
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,263
I threw my back out.

430
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,396
ONSAEM KOREAN MEDICINE CLINIC

431
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,483
-They must live upstairs.
-Right.

432
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,402
But where is…

433
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:19,738
Look.

434
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,325
I think that's her.

435
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,409
-Shall we go?
-Let's go and check.

436
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,204
Ma'am!

437
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,207
Nobody shops for groceries
and cooks every day like you.

438
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,667
Dr. Park is so fortunate.

439
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,877
-Enough with the flattering.
-Yes, ma'am.

440
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,546
By the way,
where is Dr. Park off to these days?

441
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,881
He's been going out often.

442
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,092
-Really?
-Yes.

443
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:43,220
He's so energetic
it's like he's turned back the clock.

444
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,138
He has gotten younger.

445
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,683
He's always been like that.

446
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:51,269
This is why you should put more effort
into your appearance too.

447
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:54,648
You should dress better
as the wife of a doctor.

448
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:58,193
Regardless of their age,
men prefer younger women.

449
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,695
Stop talking nonsense.

450
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,154
Yes, ma'am.

451
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:03,949
Why don't you come in
for a warm cup of tea before you go?

452
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,283
-What?
-Follow me.

453
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,661
Just follow me already.

454
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,372
-Let's follow them.
-Okay.

455
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,458
Mr. Na Dae-bok,
the doctor will see you now.

456
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,004
DIRECTOR PARK YOUNG-KYU

457
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,799
Hello, sir.

458
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,011
-Over here, please.
-Yes, sir.

459
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,973
Goodness, that's…

460
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,769
What's wrong with your complexion?

461
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:36,148
You're still young,
but you look so exhausted.

462
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,944
You're truly an amazing doctor
as they say.

463
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:44,281
You can tell just by looking at me
for the first time?

464
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:47,659
I need to examine you to know more.

465
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:49,995
-Give me your hand.
-Yes, sir.

466
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,462
Your solar plexus is blocked by something.

467
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:01,089
Doesn't your heart race occasionally?

468
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:04,176
Yes, sir. It does.

469
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,053
You don't sleep well,

470
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:09,097
and if you wake up early, you feel dizzy.

471
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,683
And no matter how long you sleep,
you still have a headache.

472
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,268
Yes, that's right.

473
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,895
You have pent-up anger.

474
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,938
Why are you so stressed all the time?

475
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,857
You're right, sir.

476
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:26,281
To be honest, I got a divorce.

477
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,450
I think that's why I feel this way.

478
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:31,953
Divorce?

479
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,914
You couldn't have made a better decision.

480
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,373
Your stress levels will drop then.

481
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,585
No, that's not true.

482
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,922
When I walk into a dark house after work,

483
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,215
it feels empty and cold.

484
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,217
But you save on electricity.

485
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,513
After I have a quick meal alone,

486
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:52,516
I wonder why my life turned out this way.

487
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,351
Go to a soup kitchen.

488
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,978
During election season,
they provide special meals

489
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,730
served by assemblymen.

490
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:01,900
But what if I fall sick or…

491
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,319
You need some acupuncture. Get up.

492
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,821
-Acupuncture?
-Get up.

493
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,280
-But…
-Take off your jacket.

494
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:10,575
But I've never had acupuncture before.

495
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,494
Give me this and come here.

496
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,580
-Excuse me? Sir, just a moment.
-Come here. Just lie down.

497
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,586
Nothing beats acupuncture
when it comes to releasing pent-up anger.

498
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,171
Goodness, Dr. Park.

499
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:26,758
How old are you, sir?
How are you so strong?

500
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,511
It's one of the benefits of divorce.

501
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,304
I don't have to waste my time arguing,

502
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:32,722
so I'm full of energy.

503
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,058
Isn't that a drawback though?

504
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,228
If you're full of energy
but lonely at night--

505
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,188
Streaming services!

506
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,523
Just watch that.

507
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:42,691
Streaming…

508
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,943
Streaming service.

509
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:01,293
I'll release the Hegu point,
so just relax and take a nap.

510
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,429
You truly are an amazing doctor.

511
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,224
Hello?

512
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:20,270
Goodness, Ms. Choi.

513
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,813
Really?

514
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,481
Are you free right now?

515
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,693
I'm just really excited, that's all.

516
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,613
Okay, I'm on my way right now.

517
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:30,697
A woman?

518
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,123
The nurse will remove
the acupuncture needles when it's time.

519
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,126
That hurts.

520
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,591
Jeez, that stings.

521
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:50,842
Oh, my back.

522
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,429
My back hurts.

523
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,722
Darn it.

524
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,479
-Yes, sir?
-Jeez, just…

525
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,605
Just what, sir?

526
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,357
No, we're still waiting.

527
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,154
Something urgent came up,
so no more consultations today.

528
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,447
Sir?

529
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,497
Jeez, just follow him!

530
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:23,750
-Hey, follow him.
-Hurry!

531
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,383
Right, I had something to tell you.

532
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,219
It's good I ran into you.

533
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,679
But what's with the face?

534
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:37,639
It's nothing, ma'am.

535
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:41,059
No, it's definitely something. What is it?

536
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,730
Her father is in the hospital right now,

537
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:48,733
but they want to discharge him
because of unpaid medical bills.

538
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,986
He's about to be sent home
without receiving treatment.

539
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,738
Goodness. You poor thing.

540
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:56,700
I think we can manage somehow

541
00:42:56,783 --> 00:43:01,371
if we sell our current house
and move into a smaller one,

542
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,832
but there aren't any listings available.

543
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:07,335
Why don't you ask her?

544
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:10,255
Stop talking.
She doesn't have money like that.

545
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:27,480
Here.

546
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,691
What is this?

547
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:33,653
Actually, I've been holding on to that
to use as a security deposit

548
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:36,489
for when I find my own place.

549
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,284
Your own place?
Why are you looking for one?

550
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,703
I have my reasons.

551
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:44,497
But I think you need this more than I do.

552
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:47,667
Use this to pay off
your father's medical bills for now.

553
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:51,338
Ma'am, you're the best.

554
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,131
Just take it
and pay it back with interest.

555
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:54,841
I'm a witness to this, okay?

556
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,761
Ma'am, thank you so much.

557
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:01,348
Not a single person offered to help,
not even my husband or siblings.

558
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:04,601
We've known each other for a long time.

559
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:09,189
I'll pay this back with interest
when I sell my house.

560
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,483
Forget the interest.

561
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,402
Just waive the commission fee
when I find a place to live.

562
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,698
Ma'am, what's going on?
Why are you looking for a place?

563
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:24,496
I need to go home and start cooking.

564
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:29,709
My husband only eats freshly cooked meals.

565
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:33,755
Thank you, ma'am.
I'll pay you back as soon as possible!

566
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:34,923
Goodbye, ma'am!

567
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,966
Ladies, are you here
to get your hair done?

568
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,302
-We'll come again later.
-What?

569
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:41,096
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

570
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,472
I'm sorry.

571
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,933
Come and take your pick!

572
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,357
What brings him here all of a sudden?

573
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,650
How should I know?

574
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,780
He looks really excited though.

575
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,784
Hold on. This is the Titanic, right?

576
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,327
Hello, sir. It works fine
and costs 150,000 won.

577
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:07,622
-You look more excited.
-How did you know?

578
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,250
You looked like this
during elementary school treasure hunts.

579
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,544
Was I that obvious? Does this work, sir?

580
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,087
Yes, and you can have it for 150,000 won.

581
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,755
Hey, enough with the treasure hunt
and let's go.

582
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:18,133
How about you take it for 130,000 won?

583
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,300
I'd like…

584
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:23,513
Where do all of these items come from?

585
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,598
They say you can catch fleas
at a flea market.

586
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:26,850
Don't try to find out the source.

587
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,519
Look, it's a portable cassette player.

588
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,062
Oh, cool!

589
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,690
I can't believe this is still around.

590
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:36,317
It's a rare find, sir.

591
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:48,455
-You're going to buy it?
-I'd be crazy not to.

592
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:50,248
How about a 20,000 won discount?

593
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,375
I'm selling this at a loss.

594
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:53,751
Oh, he's selling it at a loss.

595
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:01,050
Hey.

596
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,178
He disappeared!

597
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:04,888
-This is bad.
-Damn it.

598
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:06,389
-What should we do?
-Thank you, sir.

599
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:07,640
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, sir.

600
00:46:09,476 --> 00:46:12,145
-Damn it.
-What should we do?

601
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,607
-Hey, look over there.
-Right.

602
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,943
Who is that next to him?

603
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,001
Ms. Woo?

604
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,503
-Ma'am.
-Ms. Woo.

605
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:37,921
-Ms. Woo.
-Ma'am.

606
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,673
-Hello.
-Hello.

607
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:42,133
Who are you?

608
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:44,344
We work for Plus General Insurance.

609
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,304
You filed a divorce insurance claim.

610
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,223
Right, the divorce.

611
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,683
I got divorced.

612
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:53,353
But what brings
insurance company employees here?

613
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,772
We're here because you filed
an insurance claim.

614
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,815
That's right. The insurance claim.

615
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,360
When can I get the payout?

616
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:06,991
We'd like to explain that part to you.

617
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:08,660
Is now a good time to talk?

618
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:12,121
Did you say 90 days?

619
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:14,457
Yes, it's called a waiting period.

620
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:18,294
You have to wait 90 days after signing up
before your coverage takes effect.

621
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,256
I'm sure you heard about this
when you signed up.

622
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,049
I think I did.

623
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:24,926
I probably did.

624
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:30,139
Then should I get divorced after 90 days?

625
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:32,850
Technically, yes.

626
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:35,186
But would you like to try
couples therapy during that time?

627
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,355
"Couples therapy"?

628
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,648
Yes.

629
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,568
We're providing marriage support measures
for our policyholders

630
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:44,445
to help improve
their marital relationships.

631
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:45,989
"Marriage support"?

632
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:48,408
Yes, you can receive couples therapy

633
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,577
or participate in couples hobbies.

634
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,913
For example, you can take
ballroom dancing lessons together.

635
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:56,291
No, I don't need any of that.

636
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,418
There's no additional cost,

637
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,795
and you'll enjoy it
once you give it a try.

638
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,090
I am…

639
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:07,510
getting a divorce.

640
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:15,852
But why do you want to leave him?

641
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,229
You've managed to live with him until now.

642
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:24,193
Because my husband
is still full of energy.

643
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,322
Full of energy?

644
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:32,744
Then I'll file the insurance claim
90 days from now.

645
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:33,911
We're set now, right?

646
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:37,332
Yes, ma'am.

647
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,300
Take care.

648
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,470
If you ever need help,

649
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,264
please contact me anytime.

650
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:55,600
Thank you, Insurance Lady.

651
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:58,227
Go on now.

652
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:00,146
-We're leaving now, ma'am.
-Okay.

653
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,940
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

654
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:04,233
Bye.

655
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:15,620
Please give us a progress update
on the insurance product.

656
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:18,998
The risk-related data
and terms and conditions you gave me

657
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:20,541
were handed over to relevant departments.

658
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,336
They'll inform us by the end of this month
if revisions are required.

659
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,505
We must hurry and ensure

660
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:28,758
we launch this product
before Plus General Insurance does.

661
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:32,804
But the risk-related data
we currently have is insufficient.

662
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,639
It'll take some time.

663
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,349
Is that so?

664
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:41,437
Then I'll work with some external teams
to gather the additional data we need.

665
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:42,522
Yes, ma'am.

666
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:45,024
What was she like in person?

667
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:47,110
She was more resolute than we'd thought.

668
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,320
When we explained
the 90-day waiting period,

669
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:50,988
she said she'd file 90 days from now.

670
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:52,907
We suggested couples therapy to her,

671
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,535
but she refused
and insisted on getting divorced.

672
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:56,661
Is that so?

673
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,539
What about the husband?

674
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:00,915
Right, the thing is…

675
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:05,211
The husband had
a very positive view of divorce.

676
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:09,215
He stayed firm despite the negative things
I said about divorce.

677
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:12,927
I'm not positive,

678
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:16,597
but I think he has another woman.

679
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,099
Another woman?

680
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,851
He's right.

681
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,602
He disappeared with a mysterious woman.

682
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,438
He didn't disappear.
We lost him because of you.

683
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,524
This is why I'm not getting married.

684
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:27,984
But…

685
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:32,321
It seemed as though
Ms. Woo Seon-hee wasn't ready.

686
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:34,115
What do you mean?

687
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:35,867
She had no grasp of financial matters

688
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,327
and seemed naive about the real world.

689
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:39,412
More than anything,

690
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:42,123
she still seemed to care for her husband.

691
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,417
I thought the same thing.

692
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,253
Despite everything,
she still cooked and cleaned for him

693
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:50,840
and kept calling him "my husband."

694
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:53,009
They did live together
for a long time after all.

695
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:56,596
You can't break a habit like that
just because you file divorce papers.

696
00:50:56,679 --> 00:51:00,725
It could be a problem for someone her age
if her daily routine changes suddenly.

697
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:04,645
What matters to us

698
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:06,898
is whether or not
they get divorced legally.

699
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:10,568
It doesn't matter
if they're actually living well together.

700
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,071
I agree.

701
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,495
Don't just sit there looking lost.

702
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:24,749
Think of a solution or something.

703
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,501
This is so frustrating.

704
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,796
Noh Ki-jun,
don't you have any bright ideas?

705
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:32,006
If we can't stop this divorce…

706
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,633
But we have to stop it!

707
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:37,386
-If we can't stop this divorce…
-What?

708
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,138
I just said we have to stop it!

709
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,769
Article Two. Scope of coverage.

710
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,063
What are the exact terms and conditions
of Article Two?

711
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:51,484
"The insured cited in the contract
must be an adult male or female

712
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:55,613
between the ages of 18 and 80
who isn't currently engaged in an affair."

713
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,494
-Don't tell me…
-That's it.

714
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,288
-What's it?
-An affair.

715
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:08,209
If we can prove the husband
is having an affair,

716
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,795
we can declare this contract void.

717
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,004
What do you mean "void"?

718
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:14,006
It won't be terminated.
It'll be made void.

719
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,800
That's crazy.

720
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:20,304
Because a void contract is exactly that,
not a termination.

721
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:21,556
So it won't affect our mission.

722
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:23,349
That's right.

723
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:30,147
Awesome! Noh Ki-jun, you're a genius!

724
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:35,361
We're set now.
Let's find any evidence of an affair

725
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:36,946
and render this contract void.

726
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:40,408
So now we're digging into
someone's home life.

727
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:42,910
Do we really have to do this?

728
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:44,787
What?

729
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:48,124
Do we have to expose their private affairs
and hurt Ms. Woo?

730
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,877
She's decided to get divorced
and must be upset as it is.

731
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,170
We have to.

732
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,464
It's for the success of this project.

733
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,052
Even though Ms. Woo Seon-hee
doesn't get any benefits?

734
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,807
This product has to be officially launched

735
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:07,226
for others like Ms. Woo Seon-hee
to receive benefits.

736
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:12,106
If it doesn't get launched,
it's not a product.

737
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,734
It's just a sample.

738
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:53,356
Ma'am!

739
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:54,440
Did you get groceries?

740
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:58,152
-What?
-Did you go grocery shopping?

741
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,364
Yes, I guess so.

742
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,324
Have you had lunch yet?

743
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:07,578
Don't you know what time it is?
It's dinnertime.

744
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:08,829
What about you?

745
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:12,041
Oh, I…

746
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,919
What's today's date?

747
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,879
Today is the fourth.

748
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:22,468
Goodness, the day after tomorrow
is my mother-in-law's death anniversary.

749
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,220
I need to order some rice cakes.

750
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:27,139
Anyway, how do you like them?

751
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:29,392
What do you mean?

752
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:34,522
Dr. Park bought blankets from us
a couple of days ago.

753
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:36,732
Blankets?

754
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,695
Don't you remember? He bought
a full set of hotel-quality blankets.

755
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,282
What blankets are you talking about?

756
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:50,496
He bought blankets imported from Italy
a couple of days ago…

757
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,046
What did you say he bought?

758
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:00,756
Blankets.

759
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,926
Blankets that…

760
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:08,139
I must've gotten him mixed up
with another customer.

761
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,766
Look at the time.
I need to go make dinner.

762
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,101
I'll be heading home now.

763
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,415
-Thank you.
-Goodbye, sir.

764
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:55,603
-I'll meet you outside.
-Okay.

765
00:55:58,689 --> 00:55:59,815
GUEST FEEDBACK CARD

766
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,779
You're really cute right now,
you know that?

767
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:23,923
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

768
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:31,555
IT'S CUTE

769
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:33,933
TRAVESTY

770
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:36,936
SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR
JEON NA-RAE

771
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:41,232
Damn it. Now what?

772
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:53,494
Die already!

773
00:56:54,954 --> 00:56:56,914
Just die, you idiot.

774
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:28,946
Now, give it a tug.

775
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,620
They say being cute is all it takes.

776
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:53,888
SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR
JEON NA-RAE

777
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,434
I can't stand
complicated things like this.

778
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,127
Did you come to get something?

779
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:52,172
Yes, my watch.

780
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:57,553
-It's on your wrist.
-Yes, it is.

781
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:02,891
I meant my alarm clock.

782
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:04,310
You took that this morning.

783
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:05,894
Right.

784
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,777
Actually, I didn't come to get anything.

785
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:17,656
Then what is it?

786
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:19,908
I came to apologize.

787
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:23,620
You were disappointed in me earlier,
weren't you?

788
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:29,501
It wasn't disappointment
but the sense that you felt unfamiliar.

789
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:31,628
I wondered if you were the Mr. Noh I knew

790
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:35,215
or if I was mistaken.

791
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:41,764
Ms. Kang, please sit.

792
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,193
This will sound like an excuse,

793
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,403
but that was the best I could think of

794
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,031
because we have a mission to accomplish.

795
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,992
But I kept wondering
if stopping this divorce

796
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,287
was the right thing to do.

797
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:10,667
So I found a way to accomplish our mission
even if they got divorced.

798
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:14,380
And if he's really having an affair,
and they get divorced,

799
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,633
it wouldn't weigh on my mind as much.

800
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,303
I…

801
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:23,889
I'm a coward, aren't I?

802
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:28,018
No, I didn't know there was such a reason
behind your decision.

803
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:33,649
There's a reason why
Jeon-man calls me Travesty.

804
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:37,069
I'm good at using
sophistry and self-rationalization

805
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:39,613
to find loopholes and avoid things.

806
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,698
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

807
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:45,744
Not at all. I didn't come here for that.

808
01:01:47,246 --> 01:01:48,372
I was just worried

809
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:53,293
that I had hurt your feelings earlier.

810
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:57,506
I couldn't forget that look on your face.

811
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:01,969
I was just…

812
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,347
looking for an answer.

813
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,186
Why did I feel hurt?

814
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:15,524
It was just work,
but why did I feel that way?

815
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:17,943
If it had been Mr. An

816
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:19,570
or Ah-young instead,

817
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:22,656
would I have felt the same?

818
01:02:29,705 --> 01:02:30,789
It's because it was you.

819
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:42,342
I can't stay in the gray zone.

820
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:46,138
No. I don't want to.

821
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:35,854
SPECIAL THANKS TO PARK YOUNG-KYU AND
CHA MI-KYEONG FOR THEIR GUEST APPEARANCES

822
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:05,551
House swapping?

823
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:07,261
But Ki-jun's belongings are still here.

824
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,846
-Are you and Ms. Kang…
-What's going on between you two?

825
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,431
-I was wondering…
-I was wondering…

826
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,475
I don't want you to like me.

827
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:14,935
I don't know how to do that.

828
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,729
Love itself is about being childish.

829
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:20,440
Tell me again.
You're from the insurance company?

830
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,568
That's why you want a divorce?

831
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:25,153
Did we accomplish our mission, then?

832
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:28,156
Not yet.
We have a real mission to deal with now.

833
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,449
A mission?

834
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:39,418
