1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,794
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,464
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,426
As of today, the task force

4
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,969
will be dissolved.

5
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,554
-What?
-What?

6
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:00,394
If that's supposed to be a joke,
it's not funny.

7
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:03,522
I have better things to do
than make jokes like this.

8
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:08,068
So we're really getting dissolved?
Just like that?

9
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,904
This isn't right.

10
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,238
Darn it, that killed my buzz.

11
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:13,282
Hey, sit down.

12
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,785
Ms. Jeon, I'm pretty drunk right now,

13
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,412
so I'm having a hard time
understanding you.

14
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:21,415
You know very well
that our team worked day and night

15
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:25,544
to achieve the success
we're celebrating with this team dinner.

16
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,631
We'll talk tomorrow.

17
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,024
VICE PRESIDENT

18
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,487
Hello, sir. What is it?

19
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,951
What did you say?

20
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,787
It's the same product
with similar terms and conditions.

21
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,789
I heard
the divorce insurance approval is on hold.

22
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:05,459
So dissolve the task force and back off
before we get caught up in this mess.

23
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:06,877
But…

24
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,468
Best General Insurance
requested approval from the FSS

25
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:17,346
for the official launch
of divorce insurance.

26
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,849
What did you say?

27
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,642
Does that answer your question?

28
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:25,813
It can't be…

29
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,108
What is it? Did you hear anything?

30
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,236
Actually…

31
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,701
I recently met with the president
of Best General Insurance.

32
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,370
And?

33
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,916
We went to college together

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,377
and had lunch
because we ran into each other.

35
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,546
She already knew about divorce insurance.

36
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,800
I thought industry insiders heard about it
because of the limited-time sales.

37
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,054
She didn't pry or feel you out?

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,890
No, sir.

39
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,350
She said it was interesting
and wished me luck.

40
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:04,685
That was about it.

41
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:08,147
We're still conducting pilot sales
and revising the terms and conditions.

42
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,025
How did they quickly develop it
and request approval already?

43
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,359
This makes no sense at all.

44
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,903
Then somebody…

45
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,782
gave Best General Insurance information
about divorce insurance--

46
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,159
Nothing is certain right now.

47
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,998
The audit team will look into it,
so we'll discuss this at work tomorrow.

48
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,461
But, Ms. Jeon…

49
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,545
Ms. Jeon!

50
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,136
Noh Ki-jun, what are we going to do?

51
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,265
What if this was all for nothing?
What will happen to us?

52
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,769
Let's all head home for now.

53
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,325
Ms. Kang, are you cold?
Shall we take a taxi?

54
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,868
I'm fine.

55
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:06,330
Walking helps
when I have a lot on my mind.

56
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,539
By the way,

57
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,126
do you remember the FSS complaint?

58
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,504
I think it's connected to this situation.

59
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,590
Yes, I think so too.

60
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,844
But we'll need to wait
for the audit team's results first.

61
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:22,638
I guess so.

62
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,901
They'll be cut loose anyway.

63
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:36,986
EPISODE 9

64
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,989
So get it done right.
I don't want any loose ends.

65
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,325
I'll see you soon.

66
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:50,207
PRESIDENT LEE JEONG-SIN

67
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:59,008
So do we have to pack up right now?

68
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,342
No.

69
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,013
The approval is on hold, not revoked.

70
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,180
There must be a way.

71
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,517
First off, Noh Ki-jun and I will go
to the audit team.

72
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,602
Ms. Kang, contact the FSS.

73
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,146
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,230
Let's go.

75
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,359
What's going on?

76
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:18,944
I'm from the audit team.

77
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,446
What brings you here?

78
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,032
There are signs of a data leak
from Ms. Kang Han-deul's computer.

79
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,616
-What?
-We expect your cooperation.

80
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,701
Excuse me?

81
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,453
A data leak? From me?

82
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,330
Hold on a minute.

83
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,916
Are you sure about this?

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,460
Kindly step aside.

85
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,544
Okay.

86
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,176
Ms. Kang Han-deul, please come with us.

87
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,638
This way, ma'am.

88
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,896
Ms. Kang.

89
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,358
I'll be back.

90
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,405
-But…
-Let's go.

91
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,324
Han-deul…

92
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,159
Ms. Kang.

93
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,380
Your call cannot be connected
and will go to voicemail--

94
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,368
Your call cannot be connected…

95
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,672
Ms. Jeon.

96
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,592
You must be too busy to answer your phone.

97
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,012
Did you call me?

98
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,183
Goodness, my phone was on silent.

99
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,810
Why? What is it?

100
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,020
What do you mean?
You know what I'm referring to.

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,651
I'm all over the place
because it's the end of the year.

102
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,612
The audit team is
investigating signs of a data leak.

103
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:32,286
We need to get Best General Insurance's
divorce insurance approval revoked.

104
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:40,752
Ms. Jeon.

105
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,964
-Have you forgotten what you wanted?
-Excuse me?

106
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,757
What you want is

107
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,177
to steal amazing products
that your employees develop,

108
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,888
take them to China,
and advance your career

109
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,931
as a vice president
at the China branch, right?

110
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,696
Am I wrong?

111
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,531
What are you getting at, sir?

112
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,742
I'm saying that insurance products

113
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,578
are merely a means to your success.

114
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,874
But who says divorce insurance
is the only means?

115
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,002
Given the current situation,

116
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,463
you gain nothing by dwelling on this.

117
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,299
You just said
the audit team is investigating.

118
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:32,095
So just back out
before we get caught up in this, okay?

119
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,474
But still, we created that product first.

120
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,601
Products are endless.

121
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,520
Let's put together a new team
and create a new product!

122
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:43,398
Actually, with the way things are,

123
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,234
you can't trust
anyone on your team right now.

124
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,069
Right?

125
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,572
What is it? What's with the face?

126
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:56,536
Don't tell me
you got attached to the task force.

127
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,664
Is it about teamwork or something?

128
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,086
Teamwork, sir?

129
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,882
Of course not. Not even the slightest bit.

130
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,218
Right.

131
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,761
That's good.

132
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,847
Let's work hard
and give it another try, okay?

133
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,669
Why didn't you answer your phone?

134
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,171
I'm sorry, sir.
What's with Ms. Kang's desk?

135
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,465
The audit team came by.

136
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,260
They claimed Ms. Kang leaked data.

137
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,804
-What?
-Technically, it's not Ms. Kang.

138
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,016
They found signs of a data leak
on Ms. Kang's computer.

139
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,728
You just said
the audit team is investigating.

140
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,023
So just back out
before we get caught up in this, okay?

141
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,357
With the way things are,

142
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,443
you can't trust
anyone on your team right now.

143
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,321
Han-deul leaking data?

144
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,490
That makes absolutely no sense.

145
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:19,661
Do you think some rat
stole Ms. Kang's employee ID number?

146
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,081
It's possible.

147
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,751
But it seems so sloppy…

148
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,294
It just doesn't make sense.

149
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,088
Does anyone come to mind?

150
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:33,342
Have any of you seen a rat
acting suspiciously around here?

151
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,931
Maybe we can find out if we compare

152
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:43,769
Ms. Kang's computer access records
with the security camera footage.

153
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,521
But I believe our office
doesn't have security cameras.

154
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,398
There's one in the office hallway.

155
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,528
I'm not sure if we'll be able
to access the footage, though.

156
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:59,743
Then, I'll check if we can get
the computer access records.

157
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,203
I'll head out with you.

158
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,413
-Where are you going?
-I need to try whatever I can.

159
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,207
Please.

160
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,252
Come on. What are colleagues for?

161
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,463
Help me out here. It's urgent.

162
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,466
It's illegal to show it
without following procedure,

163
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,094
unless the higher-ups approve it.

164
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,390
I'm sorry for asking.

165
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,062
Personal requests are prohibited.

166
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,980
You'll need executive-level approval.

167
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,107
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

168
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,233
Thank you.

169
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,370
How did it go?

170
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,460
We need executive approval
to view the footage.

171
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:51,628
For security cameras too?

172
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,673
They said the same thing
for accessing computer login records.

173
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,804
Ms. Jeon is an executive.

174
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,599
That's right. We have Ms. Jeon.

175
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:08,145
Right. The person holding the key
to the solution has been right here.

176
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,105
-I'll go and ask her.
-Good luck!

177
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,356
But…

178
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,942
Ms. Jeon is a bit prickly,

179
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,902
but she's not cold, right?

180
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,905
Yes, of course.

181
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,161
Yes?

182
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,585
Ms. Jeon.

183
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,254
-What is it?
-We need your help.

184
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,799
The fact is that the audit team

185
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,385
found evidence of a data leak
from Ms. Kang's computer.

186
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,888
At this point,
there's nothing we can do but wait.

187
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,640
So we're just supposed to sit
and do nothing?

188
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,311
The fate of divorce insurance
and the task force is at stake.

189
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,564
The task force is
under my direct supervision.

190
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,151
If I say anything,
they'll accuse me of playing favorites.

191
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,196
Mr. Noh.

192
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,908
Stop wasting time
and get ready to return to your teams.

193
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,578
You don't mean that.

194
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,961
You know better than anyone

195
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:19,299
that you're the only person
who can save Ms. Kang and our team.

196
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,157
What's taking so long?

197
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,125
Mr. An?

198
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,086
-Yes?
-Are you feeling nervous?

199
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:00,340
No, I'm sure the talk is going well.

200
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,466
Right?

201
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:06,221
Positive thinking.

202
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,769
Hey, he's back.

203
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,525
What is it?

204
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,152
Let's wait a bit longer.

205
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,499
Teamwork, sir?

206
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,378
Of course not. Not even the slightest bit.

207
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,248
SOFTWARE INSTALLATION STATUS

208
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,709
NETWORK AND ACCESS RECORDS

209
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,464
KANG HAN-DEUL

210
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:40,023
I wonder if Han-deul has finished
talking to the audit team.

211
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,653
Ms. Kang.

212
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,156
Han-deul.

213
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,325
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

214
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,327
That must've been rough. How did it go?

215
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,914
Honestly, I'm not sure.

216
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,375
They say there are signs of a data leak,

217
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,086
but they didn't tell me
when or how it happened.

218
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,839
I was so confused
that I couldn't ask specific questions.

219
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:08,802
So, did they mention
what will happen moving forward?

220
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,638
For now…

221
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,766
I've been suspended.

222
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,525
Ms. Kang, we tried our best to help but…

223
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:25,902
I'm sorry.

224
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,490
Thank you for your concern.

225
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,742
And I'm sorry for causing trouble.

226
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,327
-Han-deul.
-That's nonsense.

227
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,496
We all know it wasn't you.

228
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,499
Right. We're a team, so of course we know.

229
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,584
Keep your chin up, okay?

230
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,421
It's been a long day for you,
so go home and rest.

231
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,424
-Let's all head in early today.
-Yes, sir.

232
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,594
Han-deul, hang in there.

233
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,390
Just wait until
I get my hands on that jerk…

234
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,474
Thanks.

235
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,977
Give or take one or two minutes,

236
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,856
this aligns with the computer usage time
outside work hours that I reported before.

237
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,357
I think you're right.

238
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:52,947
What level clearance allows you
to view employee ID numbers?

239
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,407
Starting at the CFO level, ma'am.

240
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,284
By CFO, you mean…

241
00:17:56,367 --> 00:18:00,330
The outside director
and the current vice president.

242
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,167
Is that so?

243
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,381
What shall I do
with the copy of the footage?

244
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,844
Just leave it for now.

245
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:16,763
Yes, ma'am.

246
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,093
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

247
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,386
Hello.

248
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,067
Are you getting in, ma'am?

249
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,573
RISK SURVEYOR AN JEON-MAN
LET'S TALK. I'LL BE WAITING

250
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,242
No, I won't be getting in.

251
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,564
I'm busy. I can't come and go
whenever you want.

252
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,648
What is it?

253
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,942
Look at the sky.

254
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,945
The sunset is beautiful at this hour.

255
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,619
I've always had bad eyesight,
since I was young.

256
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,873
So my mom told me
to look into the distance.

257
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,920
She said looking at the sky
would improve my eyesight.

258
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,423
I didn't want to wear glasses,
so I stared at the sky all the time.

259
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,884
Of course, it didn't improve.

260
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,015
It just didn't get worse, that's all.

261
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,311
Mr. An, why did you call me here?

262
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,734
Because I want you to look far ahead.

263
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,445
I hope the choice you make…

264
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,867
doesn't lead to something worse.

265
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:50,291
Hold on. Do you already know?

266
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,336
I just happened to hear you.

267
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,674
How much did you hear?

268
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,259
I heard you say there wasn't even
the slightest bit of teamwork.

269
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,810
I was disappointed.

270
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,521
A lot.

271
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,735
I had to say that

272
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,322
to avoid revealing what was
really on my mind to the vice president.

273
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:22,740
What is really on your mind then?

274
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,330
I can't reveal them to you

275
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,708
because it'd be too damaging.

276
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,841
Then don't reveal them.

277
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,720
Just assume that I'm aware of everything.

278
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,183
It'll make you feel better.

279
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:52,812
And you can revive easily.

280
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,567
This isn't a game.

281
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,403
Revive, my foot.

282
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,698
You're not the type
to die from a critical hit.

283
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,367
Am I wrong?

284
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,289
No, you're right.

285
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,672
It really is pretty.

286
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:22,925
It must be hard for you.

287
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,804
I know it's hard.

288
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,016
But just hang in there

289
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,227
and follow your true feelings.

290
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,312
Trust me, it'll be worth it.

291
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,987
I'm saying this as An Jeon-man,
not Mr. An.

292
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,478
Are you hungry?

293
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,980
Shall we eat something good
before heading home?

294
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,161
I'm sorry, but I can't eat with you.

295
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,413
Why? Is something the matter?

296
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,541
I have to stop by my parents' house.

297
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,959
Is that so?

298
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,460
What's their address?

299
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,838
No, just drop me off there.

300
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,841
-I'll take you there.
-No, it's okay.

301
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,008
Ms. Kang.

302
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:50,054
You had a rough day today.

303
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,807
Just let me drive you there.

304
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,249
You should head inside.

305
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:21,210
-Thank you for the ride here.
-Don't mention it.

306
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:22,712
Han-deul.

307
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:24,797
Mom?

308
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,219
Hello, ma'am.

309
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,814
It's okay. Go inside.

310
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,384
I'm home, Dad.

311
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,327
Dad, have some cake.

312
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,954
I know you like sweet treats.

313
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,761
Don't tell me

314
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,889
you divorced Su-in
because you have a boyfriend.

315
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,474
Mom.

316
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,017
Then who was that man?

317
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,562
He's a work colleague.

318
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,690
Be careful how you carry yourself.

319
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,358
You got divorced recently.

320
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,236
Don't give people a reason
to talk about you.

321
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,821
Mom.

322
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,782
Have you talked to Su-in?

323
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,535
Why would I talk to him?

324
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,538
I told you to bring him
to next week's family gathering.

325
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:25,084
Mom, he's no longer family.

326
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,968
If you won't bring him,
then don't come at all.

327
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,804
I'll tell everyone
you two were too busy to come.

328
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,266
I never planned on going.

329
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,101
What?

330
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:46,564
How can I go
when you two are so ashamed of me?

331
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,441
You're set on this.

332
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:51,569
You're really set on
disgracing your parents, aren't you?

333
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:57,450
As my parents,

334
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:00,828
can't you ask if I'm eating okay

335
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,164
or sleeping well?

336
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,958
Can't you ask me questions like that?

337
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,711
Despite everything,

338
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,797
I'm still your child, Dad.

339
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,424
I'm your daughter, Mom.

340
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,634
You got divorced.
What are you so proud of?

341
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:20,056
What did Su-in ever do to you
that you divorced him just like that?

342
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,100
I did it because I was struggling.

343
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,352
You're not the only one.

344
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,896
Everyone puts up with it
and lives that way!

345
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,564
That's what marriage is!

346
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:34,904
So after putting up with everything…

347
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,366
are you happy now, Mom?

348
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,748
I'm happy right now.

349
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,709
Seriously?

350
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:51,295
Unbelievable.

351
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,950
It's cold.

352
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:04,660
Shall we go?

353
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,611
DOCUMENT ACCESS RECORD

354
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,161
Did you forget we're on the same team?

355
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:51,373
How can we be on the same team
if we had different goals from the start?

356
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:57,505
What do you mean?

357
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,598
Of course, we're on the same team.

358
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:13,145
You and I had different perspectives,

359
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,649
but we shared the same goal.

360
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:20,361
In that sense, aren't we the same?

361
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,828
Do you think bringing this piece of paper

362
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:32,623
makes you feel justified?

363
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,882
I wonder if the task force members know

364
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:44,927
what the great Jeon Na-rae

365
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,179
has been up to behind the scenes

366
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,557
while making them work like dogs.

367
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,367
Jeon Na-rae.

368
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:12,329
You're no different than I am.

369
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,667
If you don't want trouble,

370
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,836
keep your mouth shut and stay still.

371
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,855
Damn, that's hot!

372
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,690
What the hell?

373
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,860
Sorry. My mistake.

374
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:43,944
Why you…

375
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:47,573
You did this on purpose!
I just bought these.

376
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,876
Why won't this come off?

377
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,973
You're no different than I am.

378
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,975
Just hang in there

379
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,519
and follow your true feelings.

380
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,480
Okay then.

381
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,106
It's a solid concept.

382
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:25,944
Great job!

383
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:46,548
It's not even a big deal.

384
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:00,604
RISK SURVEYOR AN JEON-MAN

385
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,435
Han-deul.

386
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,814
A suspension doesn't mean
you have to pack up and leave.

387
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,357
I don't want to cause trouble.

388
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:12,945
-Han-deul.
-Ms. Kang, let's wait.

389
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,823
Our team will be dissolved anyway.

390
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:18,992
We should hold out for as long as we can.

391
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,916
Where have you been this whole time?

392
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,669
Just here and there.

393
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,003
Here and there, where?

394
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,051
I went searching for proof
that it wasn't Ms. Kang.

395
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,554
Okay. Good job.

396
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,682
Since you guys are
supporting me like this,

397
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,642
I'm sure the truth will come out.

398
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,395
Yes, of course.

399
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:51,233
But where the hell is An Jeon-man?
He's nowhere to be found.

400
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,401
Darn it.

401
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:57,030
Speak of the devil.

402
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:58,490
Where have you…

403
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:03,745
Ms. Jeon.

404
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,498
You're all here.

405
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,420
TERMS AND CONDITIONS

406
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,715
What's this, Ms. Jeon?

407
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,717
And why is it in Chinese?

408
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,970
The divorce insurance

409
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,349
was supposed to be launched first
through the China branch

410
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,103
by myself and the vice president.

411
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:40,490
Jeez, it looks like
I'm going to age ten years today.

412
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:47,497
When the vice president suggested
we launch divorce insurance in China,

413
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:50,626
I agreed because I thought
it was a product with great value.

414
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,295
Since such skilled people made it,

415
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:57,674
I thought it would make up for the delay
in establishing the China branch.

416
00:36:58,592 --> 00:36:59,593
Or something like that.

417
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,768
So when sending
the Chinese terms and conditions,

418
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,896
I suggested we use a task force computer.

419
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,233
It would seem more natural that way.

420
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:26,370
Ms. Kang.

421
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,710
I'm so sorry.

422
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,383
Everyone.

423
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:42,511
I'm very sorry.

424
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,060
Why are you telling us this now?

425
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:54,731
It might be too late,
but I want to make things right.

426
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,903
For Ms. Kang
and for the divorce insurance.

427
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:02,531
And for the task force.

428
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,497
You could've turned a blind eye.

429
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,293
I know it must've been difficult for you

430
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:19,089
to come to this decision, Ms. Jeon.

431
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,261
Thank you for telling us.

432
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:56,251
Ms. Kang, these are
your computer log-in records.

433
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:02,049
We need to prove you weren't here
when your computer was accessed.

434
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:06,386
Someone logged into your computer
when you weren't at work.

435
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,180
That's what we need to prove.

436
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,059
Wait, this day…

437
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:16,354
Right. This was the day
we went to Gorangae Village.

438
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:21,068
Let me see. Hey, it's simple then.

439
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:23,028
We just need to check
when she arrived and left work.

440
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,738
Did we put in
a business trip request that day?

441
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:26,907
We were in a hurry, so…

442
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,161
We're so close, but we're stuck again.

443
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,749
Let's see…

444
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,504
The photo.

445
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:42,214
The photo.

446
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,466
The continuation ceremony photo.

447
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,136
That's right. We took a photo
at the continuation ceremony that day.

448
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,847
-Do you have it?
-I'll call Woong-sik.

449
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:51,932
Hurry.

450
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:57,813
It's me. Can you send the photo
from the continuation ceremony right now?

451
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,191
Okay.

452
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:03,819
Hurry up.

453
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,822
It's here.

454
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,201
-Check the date.
-It's the same date!

455
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,036
It says the 27th!

456
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,497
Oh, thank heavens.

457
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,459
What a relief.

458
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:21,169
Now what do we do?

459
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,298
This man.

460
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:30,178
We need to find out the relationship
between this man and the vice president.

461
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,763
-What?
-Let me see.

462
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:33,765
Hold on, this is…

463
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,809
-This is…
-Excuse me.

464
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,811
Hey, old man. I mean, Mr. Na.

465
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,230
-You punk.
-I called him Mr. Na.

466
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,941
-You can just turn the tablet around.
-My apologies, ma'am.

467
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,484
Let's see.

468
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:48,280
This pink shirt…

469
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,991
Isn't this Mr. Oh Jeong-do?

470
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,075
It is.

471
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,661
-He's been wearing nothing but pink.
-Right.

472
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,163
So then…

473
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:01,334
Mr. Jeong.

474
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,673
Good day, sir.

475
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,217
So that's why those two were…

476
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,178
But wouldn't they be in hiding by now?

477
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,346
No, that wouldn't do him any good.

478
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,431
Mr. Na?

479
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:22,606
You two go ahead. Trust me on this.

480
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,500
Do you know where Mr. Oh Jeong-do is?

481
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:43,585
I'm not sure, sir.

482
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,463
Why are you asking me that?

483
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,591
If you get in touch with him,
please have him contact me.

484
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:51,426
Okay.

485
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:55,513
-It's Unit 502, right?
-Yes.

486
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:56,723
There's laundry hanging outside.

487
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:58,934
Let's go.

488
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:05,732
-Excuse me…
-Who are you?

489
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:08,068
Is this Mr. Oh Jeong-do's residence?

490
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,194
No, it's not.

491
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,196
-Could we just…
-Hey.

492
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,199
-Mr. Na?
-What is it, Noh Ki-jun?

493
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,284
We got the wrong house.

494
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:17,953
Why that…

495
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:21,706
This address book is worth a billion won.

496
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,292
I have the names of judges,
prosecutors, and assemblymen here.

497
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:31,383
-This has to be it, right?
-Of course.

498
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,385
Jeez.

499
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:35,929
What? Mr. Oh?

500
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,391
Mr. Oh, where are you going?

501
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:40,767
-Where is he?
-Mr. Oh!

502
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,062
-You sure it's him? Mr. Oh?
-Yes, I am.

503
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,732
-Take the stairs.
-Right, the stairs.

504
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,027
Which way is it?

505
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,153
Over there.

506
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,614
-It's not that way!
-Damn it.

507
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,199
Watch your steps.

508
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,076
What floor is it?

509
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,541
Mr. Oh!

510
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,293
Hey!

511
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:08,628
Mr. Oh!

512
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:09,713
Catch him!

513
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:17,387
Damn it, Mr. Oh!

514
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,057
Mr. Oh!

515
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:22,934
Mr. Oh, wait!

516
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,239
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

517
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:37,699
Just give up, Mr. Oh!

518
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,410
Stop!

519
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,467
DAILY WEATHER CAFETERIA

520
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:08,104
I dedicated my youth to the company.

521
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:10,940
Of course, sir. We know that.

522
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:13,401
We've known each other for a while now.

523
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,488
So please just hand over the evidence.

524
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,616
We heard you remarried recently.

525
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,002
Do you promise not to get me in trouble?

526
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,923
Yes, of course.
How many times must we tell you?

527
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,383
To heck with it.

528
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,390
PRESIDENT LEE JEONG-SIN

529
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,281
Well, this is a surprise.

530
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,266
Please have your drink.

531
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,353
I'll get straight to the point.

532
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:33,773
I suggest you back off
from the divorce insurance.

533
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:41,614
This is exactly why
this product is so tempting.

534
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:44,159
What a shame.

535
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,079
If you found it so tempting,
you should've been more thorough.

536
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:53,626
It seems one of our employees
sent you a personal email.

537
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,212
What are you talking about?

538
00:45:56,296 --> 00:45:57,964
I wondered what the reason was…

539
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,558
I just met with President Lee Jeong-sin
of Best General Insurance.

540
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:11,519
Send the divorce insurance data
to the email address I gave you.

541
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:14,606
Don't you dare get caught
by anyone from the task force team.

542
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,566
Or it'll be both our necks.

543
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,693
CALL RECORDING
VICE PRESIDENT JEONG JEONG-CHI

544
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,946
Jeong Jeong-chi, that bastard,
will be audited.

545
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,491
This dirty business will spill over
to Best General Insurance.

546
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,326
How are you going to handle it?

547
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:29,287
Intellectual property infringement,
violation of the Unfair Competition Act,

548
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,664
violation of the Protection
of Industrial Technology Act…

549
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:33,708
Goodness, there are so many.

550
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:40,298
If you're smart, you should know

551
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:44,010
that I'm giving you a chance right now.

552
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,320
Ms. Jeon?

553
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,292
SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR
JEON NA-RAE

554
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:34,435
Goodness, you're here early.

555
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,360
Hello, Mr. Jeong.

556
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:48,032
Ms. Jeon, why are you here?

557
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,245
Ms. Lee, let me explain--

558
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,038
Didn't I tell you

559
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,874
not to leave any loose ends?

560
00:47:58,084 --> 00:47:59,127
Yes, ma'am.

561
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:02,964
Our deal never happened.

562
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,759
Ms. Lee?

563
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:09,637
Ms. Lee!

564
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:19,856
Jeon Na-rae.

565
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:25,194
Do you really think doing this
will make you a hero?

566
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:29,532
Do you think I'll go down alone for this?

567
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,370
I was crazy.

568
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:39,417
Ms. Jeon.

569
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:43,713
Ms. Jeon, let this slide just this once.

570
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,090
Just one time, please.

571
00:48:46,174 --> 00:48:50,511
I'll make all that business
with the China branch disappear.

572
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:52,930
So please help me just this once.

573
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,474
-Please?
-You're going down alone.

574
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,561
At the very least,

575
00:48:58,645 --> 00:49:00,730
I'm not going to
make things any worse for myself.

576
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:07,945
Jeon Na-rae.

577
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:09,072
Jeon Na-rae!

578
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:14,744
Shit.

579
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:17,455
Who are you people?

580
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:21,376
Let go of me. Don't you know who I am?

581
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,462
Vice President Jeong Jeong-chi,
we're from the audit team.

582
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:25,713
We expect your cooperation.

583
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,148
I was worried.

584
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,029
I couldn't reach you,
and you weren't anywhere in the building.

585
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:34,949
I've been very busy

586
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:38,828
both today and yesterday.

587
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,381
Well done for pulling through.

588
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:56,554
You must have felt so alone.

589
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:01,976
I said I've been busy.

590
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,229
But I suppose

591
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,816
I'll really be alone starting tomorrow.

592
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:20,721
Hey, An Jeon-man. Get over here!

593
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,224
Hey!

594
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,726
Darn it.

595
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:29,188
Our team is back in business.

596
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:30,815
The president approved it.

597
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,275
That's good to hear.

598
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,321
See? I told you
there's always a way to survive.

599
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:38,531
Exactly.

600
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,784
There was no problem
with our project to begin with.

601
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:43,661
Aside from having
a bit too many obstacles.

602
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:46,455
Good work, everyone.

603
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:49,417
Goodness. You too, Ms. Kang.

604
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,043
You did good.

605
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:52,962
On that note, shall we clock out?

606
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:57,049
Everything has been taken care of, so…

607
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:59,176
-No look out!
-What?

608
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,637
Don't even look back and just clock out!

609
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,185
Let's go!

610
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:10,980
-Let's head out!
-Let's go home, everyone.

611
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,773
Goodness.

612
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,821
Every day has felt like
an eternity these days.

613
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:22,783
I'm so relieved
everything turned out okay.

614
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,035
It's thanks to Ms. Jeon.

615
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,205
I'm sure she did everything she could,
considering how sincere she was.

616
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:34,337
You should cut her some slack.

617
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,465
If it hadn't been for her,
I might not even be here.

618
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:39,884
Okay.

619
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,307
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

620
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,271
-Aren't you hungry?
-Well…

621
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:57,443
How did you know?

622
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,320
Let's go have something good to eat.

623
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,446
Okay.

624
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:10,790
Off we go.

625
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:21,008
Since when has this place
become known for good food?

626
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:22,677
Didn't you know?

627
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:24,637
You'll see when we get there.

628
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:30,559
Welcome.

629
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:33,062
Seriously, what's going on?

630
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,563
Come in. It's cold.

631
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:49,787
What's all this?

632
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,288
Just a second.

633
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,421
Ta-da!

634
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,385
What do you think?
It doesn't feel empty, right?

635
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,095
It's so pretty

636
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,681
and cozy.

637
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,066
This looks fluffy and delicious.

638
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:37,376
Done!

639
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:45,801
There weren't many ingredients,
so I just used what I had to cook this.

640
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:48,179
Try it.

641
00:55:58,189 --> 00:55:59,190
What do you think?

642
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:03,861
This place definitely has good food.

643
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,654
I knew it.

644
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:11,494
Thank you.

645
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,120
Don't mention it.

646
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:23,756
What is it? Do you want something else?

647
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,425
No. It's about that day…

648
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,135
That day?

649
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,054
The day you took me to my parent's house.

650
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,390
My mom caught you off guard, right?

651
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:34,725
I bet it was quite a shock.

652
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:40,439
I had no idea
you'd have to see that side of me.

653
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:42,733
No, it was fine.

654
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,861
To be honest,
my parents are still embarrassed…

655
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:50,366
that their daughter got divorced.

656
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,034
I see.

657
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,996
I'm familiar with that kind of situation.

658
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:02,878
My parents have been
in a loveless marriage for a long time.

659
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:05,631
As if it's a lifelong habit of theirs.

660
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:08,551
It's strange, isn't it?

661
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:12,471
Many married couples live that way.

662
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:16,809
You should convince them
to get divorce insurance.

663
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:20,271
My parents? I can't possibly do that.

664
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,398
I told my brother-in-law to do it.

665
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:24,692
Your brother-in-law?

666
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,777
Yes.

667
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:30,573
When you get down to it,
it's just an insurance policy.

668
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:32,491
I see.

669
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:37,288
I also think having these experiences

670
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:40,332
helps to minimize the margin of error.

671
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:43,085
What do you think?
Doesn't it feel like we've gotten closer?

672
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:49,049
Enough thinking.
Let's eat before it gets cold.

673
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,343
Okay. This looks great.

674
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:58,100
This is so good.

675
00:57:58,184 --> 00:57:59,435
How's the seasoning?

676
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:00,561
It's perfect.

677
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:11,447
Pizza should be okay, right?

678
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,324
Of course. I enjoyed it last time.

679
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:14,950
Hey, you remembered.

680
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:17,161
How could I forget
the once-in-a-century celestial event?

681
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:20,206
It'd be nice to see
another celestial event, right?

682
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,124
Your order is ready.

683
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,250
Yes, sir.

684
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:31,258
All right. Here's to divorce insurance!

685
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:32,593
-We got this!
-We got this!

686
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,804
One rejected case taken care of,
and now on to the official launch!

687
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:38,057
We cleared a big hurdle,
so it's smooth sailing now, right?

688
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,851
Yes, of course.
Let's just enjoy this moment now.

689
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,269
Sounds good.

690
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:46,941
-Han-deul, this is so good.
-It's so delicious.

691
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,817
Look. It's so soft

692
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,362
that it just melts in your mouth.

693
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:53,280
Mr. Na, I just got a good feeling.

694
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:55,449
I think divorce insurance
is going to be a hit.

695
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:59,119
-We got all the bad luck out of the way.
-You're right.

696
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:02,998
What happens to Ms. Jeon now?

697
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:14,760
But I suppose I'll really be alone

698
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:17,096
starting tomorrow.

699
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:23,310
She was a bit uncomfortable to be around,

700
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,646
but she really helped us out.

701
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:28,649
I know. I'm worried about her.

702
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:30,609
I'm sure she'll be fine.

703
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:33,237
But it feels strange
not having her around.

704
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,197
Usually, she'd show up right about now

705
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:37,491
and enter the room like this.

706
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:41,704
And then she'd say,
"Is this really the time to eat pizza?"

707
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:44,081
I'm sorry, ma'am…
You sound exactly like her.

708
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:48,836
Who are you?

709
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,050
Mr. Kim?

710
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,970
-Do you know him, Mr. Noh?
-Yes.

711
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:00,681
We met regarding the FSS complaint.

712
01:00:01,557 --> 01:00:02,933
I wonder what brings him here.

713
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:06,812
I…

714
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,189
I want a divorce.

715
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,197
We really are back in business.

716
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,661
You're done, right?

717
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:30,002
Can you please tell me
about your situation?

718
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,719
Take your time, sir.

719
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:45,434
We're in a sham marriage.

720
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:48,395
"A sham marriage"?

721
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,238
Han Yeo-reum? It can't be…

722
01:00:58,322 --> 01:00:59,573
Do you know her, Ms. Joh?

723
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,991
Why? What is it?

724
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:04,411
She has the same name
as an influencer I follow.

725
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:06,914
-People often share the same name.
-I suppose so.

726
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,500
But that couple
is head-over-heels in love.

727
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,543
They live in an amazing house,

728
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:14,588
and the way the wife supports
her husband is no joke.

729
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,299
-They're just bursting with love.
-Really?

730
01:01:17,383 --> 01:01:18,550
DIVORCE INSURANCE INFORMATION

731
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:20,969
I can't remember what the husband does.

732
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:22,346
He's not in insurance, is he?

733
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:23,722
No, of course not.

734
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:25,474
I'll go and meet Ms. Han Yeo-reum.

735
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,768
Ms. Joh, grab the application form
and come with me.

736
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:30,062
Excuse me?

737
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:31,814
-What?
-Okay, see you later.

738
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:34,525
Oh, right.

739
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,318
Go now. Do you have the application form?

740
01:01:36,402 --> 01:01:37,528
Yes, sir. I'll see you later.

741
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,280
-Take care and good luck!
-I'll see you later.

742
01:01:42,074 --> 01:01:44,827
What man would refuse his wife's support?

743
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:47,746
-Unless he's crazy, that is.
-You never know with married couples.

744
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:48,914
Do you think so?

745
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,711
I'm determined to get divorced.

746
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:02,386
I'm sure others won't understand.

747
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:07,307
And my wife has tried very hard
on her own.

748
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:11,353
I'm sure she's stressed
because things haven't gone her way.

749
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:15,983
But there's no hope in sight for us,

750
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:19,695
so it's worse to force ourselves
to stay together.

751
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:30,581
I can't believe what time it is.

752
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:34,585
I hope I didn't take up
too much of your time.

753
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,463
It's okay, sir. It's part of the process.

754
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,675
In any case, I trust you'll handle this.

755
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:44,094
Yes, sir. I'll contact you soon.

756
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,236
Where is Mr. Noh?

757
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,362
He's almost there.

758
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:05,449
We did a continuation ceremony
and helped with moving.

759
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,367
I wonder what's next.

760
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,870
It was hard, but the results were good.

761
01:03:10,913 --> 01:03:11,955
Don't you agree, Ms. Kang?

762
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,418
Yes, sir. You're right.

763
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:22,090
-I'm back.
-Good job.

764
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,051
Something amazing just happened.

765
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:27,179
Remember the couple
who is head-over-heels in love? It's them.

766
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,848
Really?

767
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:32,267
See? You never know
when it comes to married couples.

768
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:34,728
So did it go well?

769
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,481
No contract obligations were breached,

770
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:38,899
and it's not a sham divorce.

771
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:42,110
More importantly, Ms. Han Yeo-reum
really doesn't want a divorce.

772
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:43,195
Is that so?

773
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:47,866
If they were on good terms before,

774
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:50,911
this could be easily resolved
as long as they find common ground.

775
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:53,288
But finding common ground won't be easy.

776
01:03:53,372 --> 01:03:54,373
Jeez.

777
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:58,293
We'll try everything possible.
This divorce--

778
01:03:58,377 --> 01:03:59,461
Can't be stopped.

779
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:06,301
What did you just say, Ms. Kang?

780
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:08,011
I said we can't stop this divorce.

781
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:12,224
Mr. Kim Seon-man and Ms. Han Yeo-reum
must get divorced.

782
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,149
By the way, why did you invite me over?

783
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,233
The divorce insurance product.

784
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:05,736
How about we finish it together
until its official launch?

785
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,112
I thought of you and bought it.

786
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:08,614
Go return it.

787
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:11,825
This is all because of
the divorce insurance.

788
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,452
I'm not getting divorced.

789
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:15,829
-Hi, my Summers!
-Do you have to post this on social media?

790
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,707
You're so focused on what others think
that you don't even see me.

791
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,167
They must get divorced.

792
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,294
Our goal is to reduce
the number of rejected cases.

793
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:23,378
Everyone, that's enough.

794
01:05:23,462 --> 01:05:24,463
We don't have time for this.

795
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:27,799
Shouldn't we think about why we made
divorce insurance in the first place?

796
