EPISODE 8

4
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,759
Did you come to get something?

5
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,348
Actually, I didn't come to get anything.

6
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:40,226
Then what is it?

7
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,228
I came to apologize.

8
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,066
Ms. Kang, please sit.

9
00:01:57,368 --> 00:02:01,622
I was just worried
that I had hurt your feelings earlier.

10
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,292
I couldn't forget that look on your face.

11
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,297
I was just…

12
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,551
looking for an answer.

13
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:18,931
Why did I feel hurt?

14
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,853
It was just work,
but why did I feel that way?

15
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,272
If it had been Mr. An

16
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,731
or Ah-young instead,

17
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:30,651
would I have felt the same?

18
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:36,907
It's because it was you.

19
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,460
I can't stay in the gray zone.

20
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:50,671
No.

21
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,298
I don't want to.

22
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,347
Well, I…

23
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:54,985
The interior looks okay, right?

24
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:56,820
Yes.

25
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,866
Look at the time. I have to go.

26
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,534
-Okay.
-Don't see me out. It's cold outside.

27
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:03,744
Okay.

28
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,251
-Good night, Ms. Kang.
-Okay.

29
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:33,941
MOM
MAKE TIME TO ATTEND OUR FAMILY GATHERING

30
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,002
What's this? Are you going somewhere?

31
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,715
What brings you here at this hour?

32
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,343
I need to check something. Let's head up.

33
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:02,511
Hold on.

34
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,810
This isn't my house anymore.

35
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,355
Let's talk outside.

36
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,409
House swapping?

37
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,411
Yes.

38
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,707
By the way, what did you want to check?

39
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,337
Are you and Ms. Kang dating?

40
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,422
Since when?

41
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,260
It's not like that.

42
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,849
Then you two are just swapping houses?

43
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,234
Did he leave something behind?

44
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,905
Did you leave something…

45
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:16,877
Thank you.

46
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,300
You two swapped houses?

47
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,677
Yes.

48
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,348
But Ki-jun's belongings are still here.

49
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,934
We just agreed to swap houses,

50
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,393
not officially move in.

51
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,439
What's going on between you two?

52
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,026
I'm sorry.

53
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:45,614
It seems unlikely that colleagues
would swap houses casually.

54
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,994
Mr. Noh kindly made me this offer.

55
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,663
"Kindly"?

56
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,416
I'd been living in the same house
since I got divorced.

57
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,172
Then, by any chance, did the two of you…

58
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,466
The two of us?

59
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,553
We're like the square root of two.

60
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:12,850
An irrational number.

61
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,103
A number that can't be written
as the ratio of two integers.

62
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,647
As an investor, I hate it.

63
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:23,110
It never follows a pattern
because it's a non-repeating decimal.

64
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,695
Yes, it's geometric.

65
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,446
But it's also infinite.

66
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,407
That's why errors occur.

67
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,285
Because it's not the actual value
but an approximate value.

68
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,369
You're right.

69
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:37,124
But the actual value
aims to identify the error,

70
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,960
while the approximate value
seeks to minimize it.

71
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,549
Just as I thought.

72
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,468
We never stood a chance.

73
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,097
You knew this already.

74
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,185
I just wanted to confirm it.

75
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,024
Just so you know, there's no going back.

76
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,110
Okay.

77
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:09,239
The green one is now sold out.

78
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,826
Never mind.

79
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,874
What's the wine for?
I assume you didn't bring it to share.

80
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,961
That's right. It's for someone else.

81
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:24,504
See you later.

82
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,349
Did you two have a financial transaction?

83
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,391
Excuse me?

84
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,476
No, not at all.

85
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,021
We just decided to swap houses,
nothing more.

86
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,108
Why do you ask?

87
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,988
The Noh Ki-jun I know
isn't kind just to anyone.

88
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,075
-Really?
-Yes.

89
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,118
People tend to think the opposite of him

90
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,037
since he's been divorced three times.

91
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,331
Right, I'm sure there's some bias…

92
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,876
But it's not because he's thoughtless.

93
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,503
It's because he's overly responsible.

94
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,839
He's afraid the other person
might be unhappy because of him.

95
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,008
Or that they'll become unhappy.

96
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:14,846
That became his standard,
which is why he has none, like his name.

97
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,644
He puts up walls
because he's aware of this.

98
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,812
But look at this punk now.

99
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,108
Anyway, welcome.

100
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,402
-You two really are best friends.
-Yes, we are.

101
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,741
That's pretty hot.

102
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,576
Are you okay?

103
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,166
I'll get going now so that you can rest.

104
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,253
Oh, and this is a welcome gift.

105
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:49,631
-Here.
-Thank you.

106
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,550
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

107
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,093
-Take care.
-Don't see me out.

108
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,770
I can't stay in the gray zone.

109
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:04,938
No.

110
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,440
I don't want to.

111
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,113
ONSAEM KOREAN MEDICINE CLINIC

112
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,702
Jeez, you scared me.

113
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,080
Why are you standing there like a ghost
and scaring people?

114
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,752
I'm hungry. Hurry up and give me dinner.

115
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,386
Why are you so slow?

116
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,221
Hurry up and come upstairs!

117
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,350
Goodness, just go ahead.

118
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,669
I didn't expect to see you here.

119
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,467
Neither did I.

120
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,803
Were you here to see Mr. Noh?

121
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,305
Yes. What about you, Ms. Jeon?

122
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,476
In a way, I came to wipe the slate clean.

123
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,856
Did you resolve everything?

124
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,193
Yes, completely.

125
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,612
That's good.

126
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,368
Would you like to drink this together?

127
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,038
Or maybe not
because I didn't give a 24-hour notice.

128
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:45,956
No.

129
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,209
You're welcome anytime, 24 hours a day.

130
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,090
I feel so relieved to hear you say that.

131
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:57,592
Shall we go?

132
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,658
Why is the soup so salty?

133
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,416
And why is this so bland?

134
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,877
Are you listening to me?

135
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,880
I am.

136
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,548
Then why won't you answer?

137
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,346
Because we're divorced now.

138
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:52,647
From now on, season your own food

139
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,692
and make sure to chew thoroughly.

140
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,997
There she goes again.

141
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,633
Aprons…

142
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,595
One apron.

143
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,848
Two aprons.

144
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,148
Three aprons.

145
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,903
Four aprons.

146
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,698
Five aprons.

147
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,661
Six aprons.

148
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,665
Seven aprons.

149
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,914
ACTUARY NOH KI-JUN
ARE YOU SLEEPING?

150
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:36,876
NOT YET, I JUST GOT IN BED

151
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,628
MR. AN WAS…

152
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:42,090
ACTUARY NOH KI-JUN

153
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,800
Hello?

154
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,552
I didn't wake you, did I?

155
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,262
No, not at all.

156
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,722
What can I do for you?

157
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,976
I just wanted to know
if the bed was comfortable.

158
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,230
It's very comfortable.

159
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,238
-I was wondering…
-I was wondering…

160
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,872
You go first, Ms. Kang.

161
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,045
You asked if you were a coward
regarding Ms. Woo's case.

162
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,674
If you're a coward,
then I'm an even bigger one.

163
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,134
What made you think that?

164
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,221
Facing the truth is too difficult,

165
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,433
so I've always tried to avoid it.

166
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,810
The same goes for Ms. Woo's case.

167
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,440
I guess I wanted to avoid it again

168
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,109
because I didn't want to worry about her.

169
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,154
It's natural to think that way.

170
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,241
As long as your feelings are genuine,

171
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,036
that's all that matters.

172
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,538
Then…

173
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,171
When you said you don't want to be
in the gray zone…

174
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:12,722
Can I assume that our relationship
is now closer to four than three?

175
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:14,974
Because I'd like that very much.

176
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,231
Me too.

177
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,781
I aim to minimize the margin of error
going forward.

178
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,827
"The margin of error"?
How do you plan on doing that?

179
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,789
I'll have to collect more data

180
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,791
on Kang Han-deul.

181
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,176
Ms. Kang?

182
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,846
That's the kind of response
a skilled actuary would give.

183
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,518
Right.

184
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:03,273
So what do you want
on your toast tomorrow?

185
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,191
Whatever you want, Ms. Kang.

186
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,796
They might as well just date.

187
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,923
What are they even playing at,
acting like some kids?

188
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,429
They're being more careful
because they're not some kids.

189
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,390
Is that it?

190
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,017
To be honest, I was confused.

191
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,352
I wanted to check and make sure.

192
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,146
That's why I kept asking.

193
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,272
Ask what?

194
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:48,151
"What is this residual feeling I have?"

195
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,280
But it turned out to be spite.

196
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,908
Not regret or lingering feelings.

197
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,538
I see.

198
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,301
I'm being serious.

199
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,471
Don't tell me you're being nice
because I'm your boss.

200
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,642
Don't tell me you thought
I was showing good social skills.

201
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,646
No.

202
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,148
Not at all.

203
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,448
Hold onto this

204
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,075
so that we can drink it whenever.

205
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,962
Shall we get going?

206
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,296
After we listen to a song.

207
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,484
Noh Ki-jun and An Jeon-man
will tail the husband.

208
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,071
-Yes, sir.
-And you two go see Ms. Woo again.

209
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,657
She might give you a clue.

210
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,866
-Yes, sir.
-Wait.

211
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,660
I have a meeting with a partner company.

212
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,619
You do?

213
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,579
I'll go and see her by myself.

214
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,414
Okay, you do that.

215
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,294
Remember, we're doing this
to develop a good product.

216
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,171
So believe in yourselves

217
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,548
and say, "I can do it!"

218
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,427
I am strong!

219
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,558
I am valuable simply because I exist.

220
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:08,810
I…

221
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,312
Darn it.

222
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,278
-Let's split up now.
-Okay.

223
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:20,905
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

224
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,367
-Han-deul.
-Yes?

225
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,246
Mr. Park must have an affair
for us to accomplish our mission, right?

226
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,248
Don't you think that's weird?

227
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,666
Yes, it's weird.

228
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,211
But we're not tricking him into an affair
to accomplish our mission.

229
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,880
And if he really did have an affair,

230
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:38,965
they should get divorced.

231
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,341
But what if he didn't?

232
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,885
Then he fulfilled
his bare minimum duty as a husband,

233
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,887
so we need to persuade Ms. Woo.

234
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,141
It's not easy for someone her age
to get divorced

235
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,642
and start over.

236
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:53,646
But being married isn't just about
fulfilling bare minimum duties.

237
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,731
Right.

238
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,067
But there are many married couples
who can't even do that much.

239
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,823
In any case,
if he really did have an affair,

240
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,950
regardless of accomplishing our mission,

241
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,326
let's help them get divorced.

242
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,828
Sounds good.

243
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,914
-Now calm down, and let's get going.
-Okay.

244
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,335
I'll see you later, Han-deul.

245
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,628
Okay, see you.

246
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,097
Ms. Woo?

247
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,683
Ma'am?

248
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:32,894
Ma'am!

249
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:37,023
Ma'am, we met before.
I told you about your insurance policy.

250
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,403
You're the Insurance Lady!

251
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:43,571
That's right.

252
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,408
I'm so glad I ran into you!

253
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,410
What brings you here, ma'am?

254
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:53,122
Oh, I…

255
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,126
I have a favor to ask.

256
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,880
VICE PRESIDENT

257
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:17,897
-Where are you, sir?
-What do you mean? I have a lunch meeting.

258
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,565
Why? What is it?

259
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,526
Corporate approval from China, sir.

260
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,944
It's taking longer than I expected.

261
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,279
Don't you know that no news is good news?

262
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,532
We should still check on it.

263
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,827
We'll talk after lunch, okay?

264
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,453
Yes, sir. I'll see you later.

265
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:34,122
Okay, enjoy your lunch.

266
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,589
Shall we finish our conversation?

267
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,829
This will warm you up.

268
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,582
Thank you, Insurance Lady.

269
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,919
Have you eaten yet?

270
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,504
Yes, I have.

271
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,091
You should've called me.

272
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:28,593
I would've gone to pick you up.

273
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,636
I was in a rush.

274
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,890
I was afraid I might forget again.

275
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,519
Can you tell me what this is about?

276
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,858
Actually…

277
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,696
The reason why I want a divorce…

278
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,115
Is he really having an affair?

279
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,783
Considering how infidelity

280
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,161
plays a major role
in the cause of gray divorces…

281
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:58,122
Mr. Na saw something, and so did we.

282
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,333
Well, Dr. Park certainly seems to be
in great shape.

283
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,752
Let's go in.

284
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:17,391
Hey!

285
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:18,809
-Okay, then.
-Damn it!

286
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:23,773
Why are you going up there?

287
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,859
Damn it.

288
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,239
Hey, he's going somewhere.

289
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:32,323
Isn't it still clinic hours?

290
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,992
It is. This is what he did last time.

291
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:37,411
Something is definitely up.

292
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,622
-Why aren't you following him?
-Look at what you're doing!

293
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,957
-Just move.
-My bad.

294
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,167
-This seat cushion is great, by the way.
-It is, isn't it?

295
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,170
But what if we actually
catch him red-handed?

296
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:48,756
What do we tell him?
That he shouldn't act this way?

297
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,133
I don't know.
We'll figure it out when we get there.

298
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,013
Hey.

299
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,310
Stop. I'll do it.

300
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,562
That did nothing.

301
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,856
Get a new car already!

302
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:17,201
Why did he have to go and have an affair?

303
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:29,797
It can't be…

304
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:41,017
SO-JEONG, PRINCESS, MA'AM

305
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,226
I should've known.

306
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:46,981
She's making me so anxious
that I'm digging through her account.

307
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,279
PARTNER COMPANY CONTRACT

308
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:56,324
Right.

309
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,952
There's no guarantee that I'm safe.

310
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:07,043
SO-JEONG
SHALL WE GO ON A TRIP DURING THE HOLIDAY?

311
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,670
IS THERE ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO GO?

312
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,422
Let's see here.

313
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:13,632
Jeju…

314
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,053
THREE-DAY HEALING EXPERIENCE
ON JEJU ISLAND

315
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,560
WHAT DID YOU DO THIS TIME?
I'M BUSY, SO TELL ME RIGHT NOW

316
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,437
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG
WHAT ABOUT JEJU ISLAND?

317
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,356
WE CAN CHAT
WHILE WALKING THE OLLE TRAIL

318
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,572
I'M ON JEJU ISLAND RIGHT NOW

319
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:39,825
Damn it.

320
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:42,078
HONEY, I'M SORRY
IT SLIPPED MY MIND

321
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,163
ARE YOU ON THE ROAD RIGHT NOW?

322
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:47,083
ARE YOU ON THE ROAD RIGHT NOW?

323
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,209
Why?

324
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,419
Why won't you read these?

325
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,512
I'm an idiot.

326
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,555
I'm such an imbecile.

327
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,573
I thought I could dance however I felt,
but this is hard.

328
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,075
How old are these married couples?

329
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:24,453
The most urgent couple in need
is in their 70s.

330
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,248
Then the waltz is perfect for them.

331
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,458
-The waltz?
-Yes.

332
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,419
It's easy for the elderly to learn.

333
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:34,338
One, two, three.

334
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:38,050
Something about this three-beat rhythm
makes people happy.

335
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,344
Would you like to see?

336
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,972
No, I don't want to see.

337
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,730
The floor is hard.

338
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:55,693
I have rocks for brains,
so it's probably heavy.

339
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:59,071
But not as heavy as
the burden on your shoulders.

340
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:09,248
I can't figure out what happiness is.

341
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,586
They say getting married
doubles your happiness.

342
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,380
But working this job

343
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,466
has only made me more certain
that's not the case.

344
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,051
By the way…

345
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:22,845
"By the way"?

346
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,723
When I say I choose not to get married,

347
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:29,143
people are eager to tell me
that I'll be unhappy.

348
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,438
And that I'll end up alone
with no one by my side.

349
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,940
That's rude.

350
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,362
But sometimes, I can't help
but let those words get to me.

351
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,242
Because I'm afraid
I might really end up unhappy.

352
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,875
Is it necessary to be happy, though?

353
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,462
I thought I had to dance to be happy.

354
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,008
But guess what? That wasn't true.

355
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:05,137
Harvesting napa cabbage,
becoming the village head,

356
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:06,805
and getting to know you

357
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,519
helped me realize there are
other important emotions as well.

358
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,083
How about someone you can vent to
when things at work don't go well?

359
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,046
Or someone who will take your side
when you bad-mouth your boss?

360
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:44,635
Or someone who will be the first
to call an ambulance when you're sick?

361
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:47,596
What do you think?

362
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,938
-You're such a player.
-What?

363
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,399
You flirt as effortlessly as you breathe.

364
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,401
You'd even flirt
with a random old lady on the street.

365
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,198
I don't want you to like me.

366
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:12,955
I don't know how to do that.

367
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,709
If you know how, then tell me.

368
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:21,589
That was so cheesy.

369
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,048
What do you mean?

370
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:47,740
Love itself…

371
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,744
is about being childish.

372
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,886
Where in the world are you going?

373
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,110
-Just how far is he going?
-Follow him.

374
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:26,779
LEFT TURN SIGNAL
PEDESTRIAN SIGNAL

375
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,282
What's he doing?

376
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:32,076
-Hey!
-Stop!

377
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,410
Why?

378
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,539
Jeez, why would he…

379
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,292
Hey!

380
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:46,965
-He's moving again.
-He's moving.

381
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,884
Let's go.

382
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:36,515
-Hello, Ms. Choi.
-Welcome.

383
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,267
-Hey.
-What?

384
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,561
You got here so quickly.

385
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,062
I just couldn't wait.

386
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,689
-Please come in.
-Okay.

387
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,364
Jeez.

388
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,367
I guess he really is having an affair.

389
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,674
Why isn't he coming out?

390
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,470
Let's go in.

391
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,522
Why are you going up there?

392
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:28,650
Damn it.

393
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,195
We can't go in, so now what?

394
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:38,911
-Oh, my.
-What is it?

395
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,622
Dr. Park, what about your back?

396
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,917
It'll be fine. This is nothing.

397
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,879
-Don't overdo it.
-One…

398
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,214
-Can you see him from there?
-I can't.

399
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,595
-My back…
-What happened?

400
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,889
-Let's go inside.
-Goodness, my back…

401
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,892
-Hey!
-Are you okay?

402
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:04,812
Are you okay, sir?

403
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,981
My sewing machine. Good, it's okay.

404
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,192
Thank you so much.

405
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,028
By the way,

406
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,197
who are you?

407
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,831
-Have some tea.
-Thank you.

408
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,417
Thank you.

409
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:31,004
Ms. Choi, I'm sorry
for inconveniencing you.

410
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:34,424
No, not at all.
You came to make a transaction.

411
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,387
And you wasted a few trips
because the wrong item came.

412
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,348
-I'll leave you to chat.
-Thank you.

413
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,936
-You said it was an affair.
-Who knew it was a secondhand transaction?

414
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,856
Tell me again.
You're from the insurance company?

415
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:54,486
Yes, we work for the insurance company
where Ms. Woo Seon-hee got her policy.

416
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,698
That darn woman took out
another insurance policy?

417
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:00,868
Then tell me why

418
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:05,289
my wife's insurance company
is seeking me out.

419
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,295
Did something happen to my wife?

420
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:14,339
No, that's not it at all.

421
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:15,382
It's not?

422
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:17,968
So my wife is fine?

423
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:21,054
Yes, of course.
We're not here because of that.

424
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:25,267
Then why are you trying
to give me a heart attack?

425
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,352
-I'm sorry, sir.
-I'm sorry, sir.

426
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:33,483
Forget it. What type of insurance
brought you to see me?

427
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,488
-Why don't you tell him as a team lead?
-No, you go ahead.

428
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,282
-But you developed it.
-I'll enjoy my tea… I did?

429
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,450
You made it, so you should--

430
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,243
Just tell me what kind of insurance it is!

431
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:48,540
-Divorce insurance.
-Divorce insurance.

432
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:52,961
What? I didn't hear you. Speak up.

433
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:58,967
It's divorce insurance, sir.

434
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,428
Divorce insurance?

435
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,891
That darn wife of mine…

436
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,852
Has she lost her mind completely?

437
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,857
I can't believe she took out
a divorce insurance policy!

438
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,651
I can't believe it.

439
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:19,863
I can't…

440
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:24,576
I told you not to make such a product
because it wouldn't work, Dr. An.

441
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,244
Why did you develop such a useless thing?

442
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,997
Aren't you the one
who convinced me to do this?

443
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,002
That's why you want a divorce?

444
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:40,676
I can't believe it.
How could you possibly think that?

445
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,262
I don't want to be a burden on my husband.

446
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,181
But still…

447
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:50,102
You've seen my husband,
so you already know

448
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:53,730
that he's still full of energy, unlike me.

449
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:54,898
Ma'am…

450
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:57,776
He might look respectable right now,

451
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:02,990
but he was born into a poor family
and spent his life supporting his siblings

452
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,158
and taking care of his sick parents.

453
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,160
He's been through a lot.

454
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:10,247
Now, he's free of his burdens
and can finally breathe.

455
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,376
So I can't have him go through
hardships again because of me.

456
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,670
But even so, ma'am…

457
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,339
Miss, you're still young,

458
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:21,675
so you probably don't understand
what I'm saying.

459
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:28,348
But married couples don't always break up
just because they've fallen out of love.

460
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:33,270
I want to put my affairs in order
while my mind is still clear.

461
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,231
So please, Insurance Lady.

462
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,567
Please don't forget

463
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:41,570
to give my husband the insurance payout

464
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,574
that I'll be receiving after 90 days.

465
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:47,701
No, ma'am.

466
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,120
It made no sense in the first place,

467
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,205
but the payout is yours,
so you should use it.

468
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:54,583
Why give it to your husband?
That's not right.

469
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:58,712
Take it as a favor for an old woman.

470
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:05,052
Ma'am, if you get divorced,

471
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,514
you and your husband
will no longer be family.

472
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,391
Not only will you have to live separately,

473
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:14,102
but you two will also become
complete strangers.

474
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:17,814
When you go to a hospital,
you're no longer each other's guardians.

475
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:19,441
If you get into an accident,

476
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:23,111
neither one of you will be contacted.

477
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,908
You're leaving
for the sake of your family,

478
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,412
but you won't be a family anymore.

479
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,085
Do you understand?

480
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,768
My Seon-hee has dementia.

481
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:58,772
I see.

482
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,607
I'm a traditional Korean medicine doctor.

483
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:03,610
So how could I not know?

484
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,737
Of course you did, sir.

485
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:11,409
When Seon-hee started acting disoriented,

486
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:13,453
she kept looking for her sewing machine.

487
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,581
I should've found it sooner.

488
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,416
It's been…

489
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:22,045
a full 50 years…

490
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:30,470
since I vowed to find her sewing machine
after becoming a doctor.

491
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:37,227
She sold her mother's keepsake
so that I could continue my studies.

492
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:43,150
This is my debt to Seon-hee.

493
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,070
Do you think it's too late…

494
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,032
to repay my debt?

495
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,202
-No, sir.
-Of course not, sir.

496
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,209
I'm trying to do right by her now…

497
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,505
and have written everything down.

498
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,803
OPTIONS FOR NEW HOME

499
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:14,389
THINGS TO DO FOR SEON-HEE

500
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:19,394
It's not too late to do this for her.

501
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,521
You even found her sewing machine.

502
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,525
At my age,
it's always one thing after another.

503
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,738
I'm not sure how we can move.

504
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:33,742
There's a place I've had in mind,

505
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:38,580
but I hardly ever have time for anything
after working at the clinic.

506
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,916
What about your children?

507
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,417
They all live in the US.

508
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:45,462
Goodness.

509
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,005
Seriously.

510
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:52,093
My house is worse than an antique shop
when it comes to things to get rid of.

511
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:55,680
And moving isn't easy
for old people like us.

512
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,015
I can't even bring myself to try.

513
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,808
But there are moving companies.

514
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,353
These professionals
know what they're doing.

515
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,814
-Professionals know what they're doing.
-Yes.

516
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:07,442
-Why don't you act the same way?
-Okay.

517
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:12,197
All I ever did was give her a hard time.

518
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,201
Don't cry, sir. Here.

519
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,882
Excuse me, but can you help me out?

520
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,717
You're both young men.

521
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:36,096
Excuse me?

522
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:38,723
What does he mean?

523
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:40,183
Do you mean moving, sir?

524
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,689
Yes, of course.

525
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,733
That's no problem.
We'll help you with that.

526
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,068
We will?

527
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,653
Is this guy here…

528
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,739
No, this guy here is Dr. An,
a moving professional.

529
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,783
-He's a total pro when it comes to moving.
-Yes.

530
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,368
I majored in moving.

531
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,829
I'll ensure the move goes smoothly.

532
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,085
What? Ms. Woo has dementia?

533
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,297
Yes, she started showing symptoms
some time ago.

534
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,092
That's why she wanted to get divorced.

535
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,635
She didn't want to be a burden.

536
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,470
Goodness.

537
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:20,223
She signed up for divorce insurance
and filed divorce papers

538
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:22,684
while her mind was still clear.

539
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:26,938
She kept going back and forth
when she was in a disoriented state.

540
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:29,441
And her husband wasn't having an affair.

541
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,776
He was going around
looking for her belongings.

542
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,737
What? Her belongings?

543
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,072
She used to own a sewing machine,

544
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:38,450
but she sold it to pay for his tuition.

545
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,703
She's been looking for it
ever since her dementia started.

546
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,663
My word.

547
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,999
This is the saddest story ever.

548
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:49,002
It's more heartbreaking than
The Gift of the Magi by O. Henry.

549
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:51,588
Goodness.

550
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:55,175
So he definitely wasn't having an affair.

551
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,093
That's right.

552
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,056
What's more important is that
he never wanted to get a divorce.

553
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,142
He only gave in and filed the papers

554
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,019
because she kept insisting.

555
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:10,023
If we'd met with him in the first place,
this would've been resolved.

556
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,107
What?

557
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,901
Wait a minute.

558
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:17,113
Nam Chang-hee, that punk. I'm going to--

559
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:18,656
Let go of me!

560
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,450
-Hold him back.
-Let go!

561
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:21,826
-Hold him back.
-Calm down, sir.

562
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,162
-I said let go!
-Don't fly off the handle.

563
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,043
In any case,

564
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:34,089
did we accomplish our mission, then?

565
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,799
Well, the thing is…

566
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:37,759
Not yet.

567
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,552
-Not yet?
-Yes, sir.

568
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:41,846
Why not? They're not getting divorced.

569
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:47,560
We have a real mission to deal with now.

570
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:49,729
A mission?

571
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,432
I can't believe
we're helping people move now.

572
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:28,685
We're doing this
to develop a good product, sir.

573
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:29,936
What?

574
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,565
All right. Let's go.

575
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,992
This room here…

576
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,368
Jeez, there's so much dust.

577
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:47,370
Dr. Park, what about the washing machine?

578
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:48,455
-Throw it away.
-Okay.

579
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:49,914
I can't thank you enough.

580
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:52,667
Don't mention it, sir.
Go see your patients.

581
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,794
You can head straight
to your new home after work.

582
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,171
Thank you.

583
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,715
Ms. Woo, all you need to do today

584
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,050
is go to your singing class
and sing your heart out.

585
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,511
Thank you, Insurance Lady.

586
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:05,930
Hurry and go.

587
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,183
Farewell.

588
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:11,936
Why open the door and let in all the dust?

589
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,897
-Is this all going in the trash?
-Yes, all of it.

590
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,316
Sir, can I get acupuncture for my back?

591
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:18,693
Drop by again,
and I'll give you stronger acupuncture.

592
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,278
Would that be okay?

593
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,446
Have a good day.

594
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:24,741
I thought we might need more help,
so I called Woong-sik.

595
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,701
Woong-sik at your service!

596
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:36,252
Put that down and help us move, please.

597
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,561
What are you doing, old man? We're all--

598
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:55,605
Hey, you punk. Stop calling him old man.

599
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:58,149
-I'm sorry, sir.
-This old man's back hurts.

600
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:00,568
Wait a minute. How should I lift this?

601
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:05,073
-Let's lift it together.
-Thank you.

602
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,741
-Be careful behind you.
-Okay.

603
00:47:07,784 --> 00:47:08,993
Let's lift this together.

604
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:11,162
I can do it myself.
Go sweep the floor instead.

605
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:12,205
Let's do it together.

606
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,588
-Here.
-We got this!

607
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,216
Why is this so heavy?

608
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,310
Take it down, please.

609
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,703
It's a hotel-quality bed set.

610
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:52,829
It looks new.

611
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,998
You're right. It looks pretty high-end.

612
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,874
It doesn't seem to go with this house,

613
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,918
considering all the old items here.

614
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:02,505
Old houses like this
always have long-forgotten belongings.

615
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:04,257
Right, my mom's house is the same way.

616
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:09,429
But she says I'm the oldest item at home,

617
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,557
and if I get married and move out,
she'll feel a huge sense of relief.

618
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:14,350
She's ridiculous.

619
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:21,274
Han-deul, is this something
we should throw out?

620
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,120
What is it?

621
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:40,209
What are these?

622
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:42,879
We found them
while cleaning Ms. Woo's room.

623
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:44,839
Please take a look.

637
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:44,565
Why is she so foolish?

638
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,510
Where are we?

639
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:14,512
Where do you think?

640
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:16,639
This is our home.

641
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:18,975
Our home?

642
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:25,815
Hold on.

643
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:27,567
We're on the first floor.

644
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:30,027
-The first floor?
-Yes, the first floor.

645
00:50:35,158 --> 00:50:37,493
It's been hard
going up the stairs, hasn't it?

646
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:38,828
Now you can get around easily.

647
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,290
It'll be easy to use a wheelchair here.

648
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:45,334
It has to be easy
because I'll be the one pushing it.

649
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,378
Yes, of course.

650
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:51,466
Come on. Let's go inside.

651
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:55,553
This is it.

652
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:56,721
Let's go inside.

It'll be easy to clean.

656
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:19,744
-Where's the kitchen?
-The kitchen? Right over here.

657
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,454
Here it is.

658
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:27,376
It's so modern.

659
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:32,215
And it opens up
straight into the living room.

660
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,091
It feels so satisfying.

661
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:40,056
But I don't know how to use such things.

662
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:43,434
Don't be silly. You just need to learn.

663
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:45,728
Come here.

664
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:47,772
Come over here.

665
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:05,540
Oh, my.

666
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,208
-I can't believe it.
-You've been looking for this, right?

667
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,752
Yes, of course.

668
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:13,881
I was so worried, thinking I'd lost it.

669
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:21,556
I want to try it out.

670
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,442
PERSEVERANCE IS BITTER
BUT THE FRUIT IS SWEET!

671
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,117
Just focus on your studies.

672
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,369
And don't worry about a thing.

673
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,705
It's hard, isn't it?

674
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,498
Studying can't be easy either.

675
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,461
Just watching you study gives me strength.

676
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:38,633
I already feel like the wife
of a traditional Korean medicine doctor.

677
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:41,844
Honey.

678
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,560
I'm sure my mom will understand.

679
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:53,606
So make sure to pay me back
when you're successful.

680
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,400
And pay me back with interest.

681
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,864
I promise to get it back for you soon.

682
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:06,786
And I promise you'll want for nothing.

683
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,579
Promise?

684
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,758
Watch your hands.

685
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:24,261
Goodness, I can do this
with my eyes closed.

686
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:28,015
See? I made it in no time.

687
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,936
-Let me see it.
-What do you want with an apron?

688
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:37,191
Goodness, a man shouldn't wear an apron!

689
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:42,571
They say if a person changes, they'll die.

690
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,324
But it seems like
you have a long life ahead of you.

691
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:48,577
I don't care about anything else,
so don't even think about going anywhere.

692
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:50,788
Just stay here and live with me.

693
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:55,209
Two strangers coming together
and sharing the good and the bad

694
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:57,712
is what makes a family.

695
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:01,257
Let's do that.

696
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:04,010
Whoever collapses first

697
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:06,595
has to call 911, okay?

698
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:09,056
No ignoring me, got it?

699
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:12,101
Just don't leave me behind.

700
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,562
Wait just a minute.

701
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,313
What are you up to?

702
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:18,274

like tailing people and moving…

708
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:04,088
Oh, come on. There was a tiger last time.

709
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,924
-That's right. Ms. Kang and I saw it.
-I believe you.

710
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,765
All right, then.
Let's have a real BBQ feast this time.

711
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,433
-Invite Woong-sik, too!
-Really, sir?

712
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:20,938
-Tenderloin!
-Beef!

713
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,565
Who cares, as long as it's beef?

714
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:25,526
Yes, finally!

715
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:29,530
-But I really saw one.
-I said I believe you.

716
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,538
This looks great.

717
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:38,873
-Jeez.
-I'm starving!

718
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:42,293
We finally resolved this case too.

719
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:45,963
Here's to a good-good-good road
ahead of us!

720
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,965
-Good-good-good!
-Good-good-good!

721
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,884
Good communication, good luck,

722
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,386
-and good outcomes!
-Good outcomes!

723
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,471
Let's do this!

724
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,265
For our country, for our families,

725
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:59,643
-and for ourselves!
-For ourselves!

726
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:02,688
To these jeans we wear!
May youthful fires flare!

727
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,441
We did it! Cheers, everyone!

728
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,527
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

729
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:11,030
-Cheers, sir.
-Drink up, everyone.

730
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:19,163
Noh Ki-jun, you did it again.

731
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,789
Gosh, you're the best.

732
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:22,541
Let me pour you a drink, Mr. Na.

733
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,710
This isn't big enough.

734
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:26,712
Bring me a bucket
so I can mix all the alcohol.

735
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:27,796
Slow down, sir.

736
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,381
By the way, where's Ms. Jeon?

737
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:31,508
Ms. Jeon? She should be on her way.

738
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:34,261
-She had to take care of something first.
-I see.

739
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:39,099
We couldn't have done it without you, sir.

740
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:40,684
Here you go.

741
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:42,394
This is cooked to perfection.

742
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:46,982
It's cooked. Eat up.

743
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,615
This is good. Eat up.

744
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:58,369
Come on.

745
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,747
You only eat tenderloin.

746
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:02,790
I like beef ribs too.

747
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:09,129
Then how about
another serving of jumbo ribs

748
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:11,465
and one more serving of thin beef skirt?

749
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,716
Order whatever you want.

750
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,677
Just one serving? Order more, Ms. Joh.

751
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,720
-Yes!
-Take your time eating.

752
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:19,723
Give me that.

753
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:26,397
You can't stand seeing me eat BBQ…

754
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,817
Forget it. Enjoy.

755
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,694
Everybody should take turns
grilling and eating.

756
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,112
Here, let me grill it.

757
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:34,905
I'm sorry.
I should've grilled from the start.

758
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:36,949
-He's good at grilling.
-I am.

759
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,701
Thank you.

760
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:42,621
Hey, for the second round,

761
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:44,915
let's go to a karaoke bar!

762
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:46,709
-I'm down!
-I'm down!

763
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:49,253
I need to belt one out tonight.
What should I sing?

764
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,171
-"Shintobuli"!
-"Shintobuli"!

765
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:53,257
Hey, I scored a perfect 100 last time.

766
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,217
Let's go right now.

767
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:56,468
-Hurry up.
-How about bowling?

768
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:58,387
All of you seem to have
nothing better to do.

769
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,014
-Hey!
-Ms. Jeon!

770
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,349
Hello, Ms. Jeon. Please sit here.

771
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:04,393
-Can you set up one more place here?
-You should sit here.

772
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:06,770
Please sit here. I'll just--

773
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:08,772
We'll have to end the team dinner here.

774
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:12,776
Everyone, please go home.

775
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,111
Excuse me?

776
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:18,657
If it's because we ordered
too many beef ribs,

777
01:00:19,325 --> 01:00:20,492
we'll go Dutch.

778
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:22,036
-Go Dutch.
-Pay up 20,000 won each.

779
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,620
That's not it.

780
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:31,628
As of today, the task force

781
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:33,172
will be dissolved.

782
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,569
SPECIAL THANKS TO PARK YOUNG-KYU AND
CHA MI-KYEONG FOR THEIR GUEST APPEARANCES

783
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,226
I'm from the audit team.

784
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,395
There are signs of a data leak
from Ms. Kang's computer.

785
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:31,855
-What?
-Han-deul leaking data?

786
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:33,649
That makes absolutely no sense.

787
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:36,944
Stop wasting time
and get ready to return to your teams.

788
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,987
So we're just supposed to sit
and do nothing?

789
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:41,824
The fate of divorce insurance
and the task force is at stake.

790
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:42,950
Damn it.

791
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,701
I wonder if the task force members know

792
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:48,539
what the great Jeon Na-rae
has been up to behind the scenes.

793
01:01:49,415 --> 01:01:52,835
I hope the choice you make
doesn't lead to something worse.

794
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,342
