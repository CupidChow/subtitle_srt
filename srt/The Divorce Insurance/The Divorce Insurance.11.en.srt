00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,711
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:58,601
Awesome. Great timing.

4
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,566
Here we go.

5
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,244
Lucky timing!

6
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:19,997
All right.

7
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:22,833
-Is this the line?
-Yes.

8
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:23,918
I see.

9
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,838
Here's your order, sir.

10
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,465
-Thank you.
-Oh, I'm running late.

11
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,592
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

12
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,344
Here you go.

13
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,971
-Next, please.
-Yes! Score!

14
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,890
I'd like to order…

15
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,017
Six iced Americanos,
perfect for this freezing weather.

16
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,733
Gosh, check out my skin.

17
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,444
My hair looks nice and full too.

18
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,406
EPISODE 11

19
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,782
Did you sleep well last night?

20
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,243
I slept like a baby.

21
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,165
I can tell. It looks like
you finally got some good sleep.

22
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,670
-Is my face puffy?
-No, I meant you look pretty.

23
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,759
If divorce insurance launches
without any problems,

24
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,344
I bet I'll sleep well
even on the concrete.

25
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,597
Right, that's the toughest part.

26
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,307
We haven't heard from Mr. Kim yet, right?

27
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,270
No, but they say
no news is good news, right?

28
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,947
PLUS GENERAL INSURANCE

29
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,370
-Good morning.
-Yes, it is.

30
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,297
Good morning.

31
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,347
Director Choi Ji-young's new movie
comes out today.

32
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,556
-Yes?
-Do you have plans tonight?

33
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,016
I'll be working.

34
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,851
Me too.

35
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,740
Doors closing.

36
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,242
Wait a second, please.

37
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,411
Excuse me.

38
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,963
Doors closing.

39
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:28,560
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

40
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:29,645
What's with the coffee?

41
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,022
Go ahead and take one. It's on me.

42
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:35,567
What's the occasion?
You always drink break room coffee.

43
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,696
It's not every day
you can get premium beans.

44
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,280
Thank you for the coffee.

45
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,326
-Is something the matter?
-No.

46
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,287
-Did you get some good news?
-Did you win fourth place in the lottery?

47
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,372
The thing is…

48
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,334
I had a satisfying dump
for the first time in a week.

49
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,795
But that's not all.

50
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,714
I always miss the bus,
but I made it on time today.

51
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,008
There were lots of seats,
and we didn't hit a single red light.

52
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,759
And the line at the café was really long,

53
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:04,555
but everyone suddenly melted away.

54
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,058
I have a good feeling about today.

55
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,811
Oh, my!

56
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,730
Goodness. Are you okay, Ms. Kang?

57
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,024
-That's a bad sign.
-Why would you say that?

58
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,692
Ms. Kang, take this coffee.

59
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,405
There are five cups of coffee
and four task force members.

60
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,574
The last one is obviously for Ms. Jeon.

61
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,826
But Ms. Kang spilled her coffee.

62
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,995
-Let go.
-You let go.

63
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:34,334
Why are those two
always at each other's throats?

64
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,504
-What are they, kids?
-You are right.

65
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,758
What do you mean, "You are right"?

66
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,884
Exactly.

67
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,058
-Give it.
-That's enough!

68
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,642
Hello.

69
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,568
-What brings you two here without a call?
-Hello.

70
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,445
We thought we should tell you right away.

71
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:03,781
We've made a decision.

72
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,450
Really? Thank you for coming.

73
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,329
So what have you decided to do?

74
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,627
-We've decided…
-To end things well.

75
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,216
Right.

76
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,347
POLICY TERMINATION AGREEMENT

77
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,355
Thank you for understanding
the company's position.

78
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,606
Not at all.

79
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,149
We should be the ones thanking you.

80
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:42,194
He's right. Thanks to you,
we got our happy ending.

81
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,737
"Happy ending"?

82
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:44,822
Yes.

83
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,782
A happy ending.

84
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,214
Today's therapy session
was good too, right?

85
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,758
Yes. It feels like
a weight has been lifted.

86
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,012
I'm exhausted.

87
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,097
Get some rest.

88
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,390
Okay, you too.

89
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,271
That's when I realized

90
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,608
that we were already prepared
to live separate lives

91
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,778
and that we'd gotten used to it.

92
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,740
It just took some time
to come to terms with it.

93
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:38,000
We decided to part ways
to live better lives.

94
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,002
That's why it's a happy ending.

95
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,128
Right.

96
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,465
Divorce insurance
helped us to get to this point.

97
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,847
I'm sorry for accusing you
of encouraging divorces.

98
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,557
That's okay, ma'am.

99
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,185
It could've ended really badly for us.

100
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:58,896
We see it as catching a problem early on

101
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,231
before it could turn into something worse.

102
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,984
Some couples might discover it sooner
and make a full recovery.

103
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,652
Right?

104
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,990
It might be a headache for a while,

105
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,284
but it's not something we can't handle.

106
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,246
-We'll take our leave, then.
-Of course.

107
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,041
Congratulations

108
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,377
on your happy ending.

109
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,599
-Well, then…
-All right.

110
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,185
-Thank you to you both.
-Thank you.

111
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:40,646
-Let's go.
-Okay.

112
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:56,453
Ms. Kang, can you help me out?

113
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,996
Help you with what?

114
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,334
Remember when we were at a café
and you were knitting while I slept?

115
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:07,256
I mentioned there was
an unfinished knitting piece at home.

116
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,799
Right. You said it was green.

117
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,425
Yes.

118
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:16,974
Actually, my sister started knitting it
but never finished.

119
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,725
I want to complete it.

120
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,063
Okay. I'll teach you then.

121
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,775
Thank you. Let's go.

122
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,740
We got more rejected cases.

123
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,451
WIFEY'S FLIGHT ARRIVAL DATE

124
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,623
She's coming back today?

125
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,169
I knew it. Today's my lucky day.

126
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,341
It's not over until it's over.

127
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,428
A zero percent divorce rate
doesn't mean we can let our guard down.

128
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,222
And please resolve
the two new rejection cases.

129
00:09:57,306 --> 00:10:00,100
Just leave it to us, ma'am.

130
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,520
You might not be aware of this,
but I used to be--

131
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,980
The top insurance agent in Ssangmun-dong.

132
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,857
Yes, I already know that.

133
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:08,775
I see.

134
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,571
That concludes today's meeting.

135
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:13,822
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

136
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:14,906
Ms. Jeon.

137
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,075
Take your coffee.

138
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,537
I'm cutting down on coffee.

139
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,456
Goodbye, ma'am.

140
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:30,422
I'll do what I can
about the rejected cases,

141
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,924
so the rest of you
wrap up the others, okay?

142
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,719
-Yes, sir.
-We'll have to figure it out.

143
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,517
SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR
JEON NA-RAE

MOVIE BOX
ADVANCE TICKETING INFORMATION

145
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:47,856
Hey.

146
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,526
If you know any couples joined at the hip
or soon-to-be married couples,

147
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,028
try and convince them to sign up.

148
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,198
I owe you one. Let me treat you sometime.

149
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,242
And don't forget
to eat your meals on time.

150
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,619
Okay. Bye.

151
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,955
Goodness, one case down.

152
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,833
SO-JEONG
YOU ARRIVE TODAY, RIGHT?

153
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,878
JUST YOU WAIT.
WE'LL HAVE HANWOO TONIGHT

154
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,129
Hanwoo.

155
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,298
Let's see here…

156
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,426
He and his wife split
after she had an affair…

157
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,261
Wait, Ju-hyeon?

158
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:23,433
It might be possible with Ju-hyeon.

159
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,521
Hey, Ju-hyeon. It's me, Dae-bok.

160
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,773
So I was just wondering…

161
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,316
Hello?

162
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,736
What a punk.

163
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,279
How are you doing these days?

164
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,324
Me? I'm still in insurance.

165
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:41,743
Hello?

166
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,496
Hey, Mi-jin. It's me, Dae-bok.

167
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,999
There's this new insurance that's perfect
for people like you getting remarried.

168
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,084
It's me, Dae-bok.

169
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,252
Hello?

170
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,587
Hello…

171
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,383
Come on.

172
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,637
Forget it.

173
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,814
STRANGER
JUST YOU WAIT. WE'LL HAVE HANWOO TONIGHT

174
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:32,210
We see this as a second chance at life
and promise to be happy.

175
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:35,255
We both promise to live well. Thank you!

176
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,467
You said it before, Mr. Noh.

177
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,678
The purpose of divorce
is to find happiness.

178
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,599
Mr. Kim and Ms. Han demonstrated this.

179
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,350
You're right.

180
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:52,981
"The prince and princess got married
and lived happily ever after."

181
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,902
But seeing how there are other kinds
of happy endings beyond this

182
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,279
makes you think
life really is worth living, right?

183
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,077
Yes, right.

184
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,662
This is it.

185
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,998
Gosh, this is amazing.

186
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,461
-I look forward to learning, Ms. Kang.
-I look forward to teaching, Mr. Noh.

187
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,713
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

188
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,432
-All of the colors are pretty.
-Yes.

189
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:30,894
I think you need to
practice first, Mr. Noh.

190
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,020
Right.

191
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,856
Since the knitting at home is green…

192
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,526
No, I want this one.

193
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,945
It might stand out
if the colors change suddenly.

194
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,738
As long as I like it, who cares?

195
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,406
You like red, too, right?

196
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:45,867
Okay, then.

197
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,412
-On my left hand…
-Take that yarn and…

198
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,622
-Right here?
-Yes.

199
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,459
It's frustrating, isn't it?

200
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,504
Yes. Maybe I don't have
a knack for making things.

201
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,422
This just makes me feel anxious.

202
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,591
I felt the same way at first too.

203
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,552
Getting started is the hardest part.

204
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,512
If you made it this far,
you're basically done.

205
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,723
"Getting started is the hardest part."
That's a good saying.

206
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:09,933
I feel encouraged now.

207
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,686
Wrap it around…

208
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,688
Oh, this is how…

209
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,358
-Slip it through here.
-Okay.

210
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,485
Then yarn over.

211
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,238
Slip the original loop off…

212
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,828
It's time for serious training, so focus.

213
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,914
Yes, ma'am. Focus.

214
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,042
-So do it like this…
-And slip it through…

215
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,711
Then off the original loop…

216
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,046
Slip it off the original loop
and finish the stitch.

217
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,693
Should I buy a lottery ticket?

218
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,655
Honey!

219
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,658
Honey, did you have a good trip?

220
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:09,826
You're not leaving again, right?

221
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,078
Good. I don't see a suitcase.

222
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:15,165
Why haven't you changed yet?
I said we're having hanwoo tonight.

223
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,167
Why are you just watching TV?

224
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,753
Honey, let's have hanwoo!

225
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,171
Hanwoo!

226
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,215
Do you know what tomorrow is?

227
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,300
Tomorrow?

228
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,554
I'm not sure. Isn't this around the time
of your father's death anniversary?

229
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,181
It's our wedding anniversary.

230
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,265
What?

231
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,853
It's the wedding anniversary
of Lee So-jeong and Na Dae-bok.

232
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:43,151
That's all the more reason to have hanwoo!

233
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,486
Hurry up and let's go.

234
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:47,822
What is it? Are you mad?

235
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:52,702
Come on. What's so important
about an anniversary?

236
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,330
After all, we've been together
for over 20 years.

237
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,750
If that's not important,
then why did we get married?

238
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,001
What?

239
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,795
Do you know anything?

240
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,380
Do you know what grade the kids are in?

241
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,173
Or their graduation dates?

242
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,633
Or which schools they attend?

243
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,469
Do you know what they like to study?

244
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,722
Do I have to know all that?

245
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,226
I come home late because of team dinners.

246
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,061
Then I go to work
first thing in the morning.

247
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,188
If the higher-ups go hiking
on the weekend,

248
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,190
I have to force myself to go.

249
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,733
So how am I supposed to know all that?

250
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,277
What kind of father are you?

251
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,696
Or husband for that matter?

252
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,824
I think I've heard enough from you.

253
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,992
I work my fingers to the bone
to pay for overseas tuition

254
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,704
and give you living expenses
while holding back on what I want.

255
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,038
What more do you want from me?

256
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,456
Right.

257
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,750
I don't want anything from you anymore.

258
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:41,876
So…

259
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,844
APPLICATION ON THE CONFIRMATION
OF DIVORCE BY CONSENT

260
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,679
HUSBAND: NA DAE-BOK
WIFE: LEE SO-JEONG

261
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,013
Let's get divorced.

262
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:57,851
Not this again.

263
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,020
Aren't you sick of bringing up divorce?

264
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:05,108
Do you think I'm just throwing a tantrum?

265
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,487
Since the kids
will go to college in the US,

266
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,115
-I'm going to move there.
-But honey--

267
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,201
My sister and brother-in-law said
they'd find a house for me.

268
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,081
Are you being serious?

269
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:26,671
There hasn't been a single time
I wasn't serious.

270
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,966
You've worked your fingers to the bone
to support our family

271
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,801
and have carried a heavy load.

272
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,429
So let's not drag this out

273
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,389
and end things now.

274
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,233
Fine, I got it.

275
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,569
Don't you dare regret this!

276
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,121
I even picked up money off the ground
because we were having beef.

277
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,209
What's this?

278
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,919
RIPOLE BITCOIN
IS ALL WELL WITH YOUR FAMILY AT HOME?

279
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,378
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL WITH MONEY!

280
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,967
It figures. I knew my luck
was too good to be true today.

281
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,723
Slip the loop off…

282
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,727
Okay.

283
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:26,523
By the way,
why do you have your sister's knitting?

284
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,158
Do you want to know why
I got divorced three times?

285
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,083
It was an ordinary day.

286
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,835
Just a normal, uneventful day.

287
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,381
And my sister said…

288
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,260
"I'm not happy anymore."

289
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,262
"I want to get divorced."

290
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,390
But I…

291
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,686
I just interpreted what she said

292
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,312
as whining and complaining.

293
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:09,941
I even criticized her.

294
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,903
"Everyone lives like that.
Just deal with it."

295
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:18,157
Not long after that,
my sister passed away.

296
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,873
If only I hadn't let her go…

297
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,003
When I accepted the fact
that my sister was gone,

298
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,254
I made a decision.

299
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,175
If I ever fall in love and get married…

300
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,972
I'll always be prepared to end things

301
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,391
for both my sake and theirs.

302
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,646
After all, parting ways
or getting divorced

303
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,524
doesn't mean I've failed at life.

304
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,822
It could actually be a new beginning.

305
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,784
As a result, I am who I am today

306
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,787
and doing my sister's knitting.

307
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,999
It must've been so hard.

308
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,420
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,506
I came here to learn,
but instead, I brought us down.

310
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,051
Hey, hold on.

311
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,804
Did I drop a stitch here?

312
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,140
I think I need to unravel it.

313
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,646
Did you know

314
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,692
unraveling everything and starting over
isn't always the right answer?

315
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:36,486
Then what do I do?

316
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,405
That dropped stitch

317
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,493
might be something
only I know and only I can see.

318
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:48,039
It's like how everyone
has their own wounds and flaws.

319
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,043
But they're still a part of who I am.

320
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,423
You just need to continue on
with the next stitch.

321
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,261
You don't have to regret it.

322
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:03,888
Thank you.

323
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,687
-Shall we start again?
-Yes, Ms. Kang.

324
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,690
-You try, Mr. Noh.
-Okay.

325
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,026
-Like this…
-Like that.

326
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,654
WOONG-SIK

327
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:41,342
YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING YOUR PHONE
ARE YOU BUSY?

328
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,977
Damn it, it's really bothering me.

329
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:20,548
Hey, Seok-gi.

330
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,051
Why don't you come out for a drink?

331
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,303
What? A family dinner?

332
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,015
Really? I see.

333
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,850
Okay, let's catch up later.

334
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,356
Who can come out and hang with me?

335
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,900
Come on.

336
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:45,615
At this moment,

337
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,910
I really need you here.

338
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,006
Here we go.

339
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,228
KI-JUN, WORKING HARD AS ALWAYS

340
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,687
PROMISE WE'LL GO ON A DATE
TOMORROW? PLEASE!

341
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:26,739
Hey, Ah-young.

342
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,617
-Han-deul, are you at home?
-Yes.

343
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,911
I'm outside your apartment right now.

344
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,704
-I'm heading up.
-Okay.

345
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,173
Oh, no.

346
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,301
No.

347
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:03,860
Why won't you answer?

348
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,157
Ah-young!

349
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:11,826
-I thought you were home?
-What?

350
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,786
Let's go out and talk.

351
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,706
-It's cold outside.
-No, it's gotten warm.

352
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,921
Why are you coming out of there, Mr. Noh?

353
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,349
PERSONNEL APPOINTMENT LETTER

354
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:38,769
FROM SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR TO CEO
FROM THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA TO SINGAPORE

355
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:47,320
KEY RESPONSIBILITIES

356
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,283
CEO?

357
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:55,745
That's good.

358
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,542
Ah-young, that's not beer.

359
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:02,752
Whatever.

360
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,633
So you and Mr. Noh are a thing now?

361
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:12,720
You're now a true smiley nutcase.

362
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,555
Didn't you tell me to be one?

363
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,850
It figures.

364
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,895
Something has been going on with you two
since the last team dinner.

365
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,271
Totally called it.

366
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,655
We can enjoy drinks comfortably at home.

367
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,156
The home of some random guy…

368
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,661
I mean, I can't go to your guy's place.

369
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,246
That would be uncomfortable.

370
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,039
You had no problem sleeping over before.

371
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,832
Whatever.

372
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,877
Ms. Joh Ah-young.

373
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,964
There's a reason why
you're being difficult.

374
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:50,132
What is it? What happened?

375
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,886
I don't know. I'm just annoyed.

376
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,224
Is it because of Woong-sik?

377
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:00,893
How did you know?

378
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,354
Totally called it.

379
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,232
One more, please.

380
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,713
-You too?
-Yes, me too.

381
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:29,797
Your plans?

382
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,465
They got canceled.

383
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:35,261
I can't believe I'm spending time
with my boss after hours.

384
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,014
But weren't those other plans
with another boss anyway?

385
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,309
Hey, just hypnotize yourself.

386
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,978
"That's not Mr. Na."

387
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,105
"That's not Mr. Na."

388
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,691
Wait up.

389
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:52,820
Jeez.

390
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,538
Stop, sir.

391
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,622
Come on, sir.

392
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,416
That's enough, sir.

393
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,962
Noh Ki-jun, you punk.

394
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,508
Unless you want to be
the first one in line at family court,

395
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,635
take it easy, sir.

396
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:19,722
It figures. I knew my luck
was too good to be true today.

397
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:25,353
How did you guys
get through your divorces?

398
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,104
And you've done it multiple times.

399
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,441
It's not like we welcomed it
with open arms.

400
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,110
We accepted it
since nothing was going to change.

401
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,866
Why does your wife want to get divorced?

402
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,537
She said…

403
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,167
I'm neither a husband nor a father.

404
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:58,469
I thought all I had to do was make money.

405
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,596
Why work so hard to the point

406
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,516
where my digestive system is ruined
and my knees are shot?

407
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,810
My family won't acknowledge
my effort anyway.

408
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:11,107
It's all for nothing.

409
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,691
All of it.

410
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:13,984
-Come on, sir.
-Come on, sir.

411
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:16,904
-Give it back!
-What's going on with you today?

412
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,824
You were a legendary insurance agent.

413
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,660
Going from insurance sales
to team leader at HQ isn't easy.

414
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,578
-He's right.
-Exactly.

415
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,038
Not everyone can be
a top insurance agent.

416
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:27,123
Exactly.

417
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,917
Top insurance agent, my foot.

418
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,379
Stop yelling and blaming yourself, sir.

419
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,132
Think about why this happened.

420
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,634
When you look back on it,
you'll find the answer.

421
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:43,639
You've met a lot of couples
while developing divorce insurance.

422
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,558
So you should know.

423
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:00,114
Hello.

424
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,700
One adult and two kids, please.

425
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,500
BOYS OVER THE AGE OF 3
MUST USE THE MEN'S BATHING AREA

426
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,131
Can you two wash up on your own?

427
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,763
Let's go.

428
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:32,480
MEN'S BATHING AREA ENTRANCE

429
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,691
Let's go.

430
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,420
Why is it so quiet?

431
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,757
My goodness.

432
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,551
When did you fall asleep?
Let's go into the bedroom.

433
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:08,432
You look adorable even when you're asleep.

434
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,186
Yong-gi, let me just…

435
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,188
Yong-gi, I'm home!

436
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,314
Great timing.

437
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,652
Come in and carry Yong-gi
into the bedroom--

438
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,278
-Honey.
-What?

439
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:25,449
-What are you--
-I scored the top performance bonus.

440
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,701
Why are you lying down?

441
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,620
You should be more careful.
Get up right now.

442
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,623
-Get up!
-No…

443
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,461
Kids, let's go! You too, honey.

444
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,800
What a surprise.
You came right out when I called you.

445
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,052
The vice president's mother
passed away this morning.

446
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,303
I have to go to Tongyeong.

447
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:47,555
What about our family portrait?

448
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,765
We'll do it next time.
We see each other every day anyway.

449
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,100
I'll see you later.

450
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:56,772
Mr. Na.

451
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,783
Have you two had a serious conversation?

452
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:11,203
Of course we had a conversation.

453
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:14,498
Was it an actual conversation
or a one-sided one?

454
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:17,418
A conversation isn't a big deal.
It's just the same old thing.

455
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,378
It's that "same old thing"

456
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,672
people can't or won't do

457
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,048
that leads to divorce.

458
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:27,386
That's my conclusion after three divorces.

459
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:33,309
Well, aren't you special?

460
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,603
-Noh Ki-jun is special!
-We're all special!

461
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,314
-We're all special.
-You're the most special, Mr. Na.

462
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,328
This is what Park Woong-sik is.

463
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,621
A pinky finger?

464
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:58,709
No, look at the hangnail right here.

465
00:31:58,792 --> 00:31:59,793
What?

466
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,467
I'm scared it'll hurt and get infected,
so I don't touch it.

467
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,094
But it really gets on my nerves
to leave it alone.

468
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:12,389
What do I do in this case?

469
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:14,141
Go to a nail salon.

470
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:18,729
I'm being serious here.

471
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:23,317
It's not like he's asking you
to get married, so what is it?

472
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,568
I just…

473
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,321
I just keep overthinking

474
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:30,616
about myself and Woong-sik…

475
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,787
because there's only one way this can end.

476
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,541
So what if that's the case?

477
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,251
Look at how I turned out.

478
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:45,923
Just because that relationship ends
doesn't mean your life will end too.

479
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,467
So don't beat yourself up.

480
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,177
It won't do you any good.

481
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:54,348
Then how do you feel, Han-deul?

482
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,808
What?

483
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,393
About you and Mr. Noh.

484
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,062
Of all the times I've seen you,

485
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,523
you've never looked so happy
as you do lately.

486
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,650
You smile a lot too.

487
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,906
To be honest, I was afraid.

488
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,786
I didn't know
if I could pick myself back up

489
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:19,498
and start over
after being betrayed like that.

490
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,333
But?

491
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:25,796
But…

492
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:29,800
I believe in love.

493
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,510
It's my conviction.

494
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,057
That's what gave me the courage.

495
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,395
You're so cool, smiley nutcase.

496
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:45,983
Courage?

497
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,655
Okay. Keep going.

498
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,828
Ah-young, are you okay?

499
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,749
Who are you?

500
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,959
Who am I?

501
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:17,681
You selfish idiot.

Are you feeling okay?

506
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,614
Han-deul, I'll wash this
before I give it back to you.

507
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,241
Sure, whatever you want.

508
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:18,325
Jeez, my head…

509
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:25,707
Good morning.

510
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:29,753
I'm sorry, and thank you
for your hospitality last night.

511
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,421
It's okay. Don't mention it.

512
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:42,099
Since Ms. Joh knows now,
we should've come to work together.

513
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,725
I didn't want her to feel uncomfortable.

514
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,728
I spoke to Ah-young,
so don't worry about her.

515
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,439
What's to worry about?
We're adults, after all.

516
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,777
By the way, why did Mr. Na
call you out last night?

517
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:55,904
Because of the rejected cases?

518
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:00,200
Well, there was a personal matter.

He's been like that all day.

522
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:30,856
All right.

523
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,942
We'll have to speed things up.

524
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,987
The final approval review
has been moved up.

525
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,864
It'll be in exactly two weeks.

526
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,247
That's sooner than I thought.

527
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,918
We'll be that much closer to introducing
divorce insurance to the world.

528
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,128
What's the status of the rejected cases?

529
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,796
Oh, right.

530
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,633
If you wait a bit longer,
it'll be resolved shortly.

531
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,011
Since we're near the end now,

532
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:04,264
the key is to figure out
how to improve what we have

533
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:06,183
instead of doing something new.

534
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,518
So I'm thinking

535
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:11,021
we should upgrade
the terms and conditions.

536
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,648
In what way, ma'am?

537
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,149
We've experienced divorce,

538
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,652
but we've also seen many divorce cases.

539
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,695
Let's think about why these people

540
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:20,489
got to the point of divorce.

541
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:24,534
We should review the AI-based underwriting
of the revised terms and conditions too.

542
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:27,079
Yes, and take another look
at the premium calculation method

543
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,206
and claims review process as well.

544
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,666
Right, Mr. Na.

545
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:32,709
Yes?

546
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,713
-Check the marketing team's progress.
-Yes, ma'am.

547
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:39,383
And Mr. An Jeon-man?

548
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:41,885
-Yes, ma'am?
-I'd like a word.

549
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,388
Yes, ma'am.

550
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:51,603
Mr. Na, what should we have for lunch?

551
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,524
There's a new gukbap restaurant nearby.

552
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,735
I don't have an appetite.

553
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:01,530
Let's just go to the cafeteria downstairs.

554
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,700
Okay, sir.

555
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,662
Come on, Mr. Na.
Let's go have a hot bowl of gukbap.

556
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,497
The day is cold, and so is your heart.

557
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,874
How would you know without
sticking a thermometer into my heart?

558
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,751
-I just know.
-Let's go out, Mr. Na.

559
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,503
She's right. Let's go, Mr. Na.

560
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,880
This feels weird.
Since when have you guys cared about me?

561
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,216
-Let's just go.
-Come on.

562
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,218
Let's get going.

563
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,262
-What about Mr. An?
-He can take care of himself.

564
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:27,014
-Let's go.
-It's cold outside, Mr. Na.

565
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,515
Let's eat something warm.

566
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,517
-What are we having again?
-Gukbap, sir.

567
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,685
I hear it's really good.

568
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,191
Have a seat.

569
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,491
How's your pet rock? Is it okay?

570
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:47,951
Of course it is.

571
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:50,454
Then what about Singapore?

572
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:52,914
Singapore?

573
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,545
Well, it's very safe,
so it's perfect for traveling.

574
00:38:58,628 --> 00:38:59,629
And it's clean.

575
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,717
You really live up to your name.

576
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,719
What's this about?

577
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,930
You're not the type
to beat around the bush.

FROM THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA TO SINGAPORE

579
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,336
What do you think?

580
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,176
I'll get straight to the point.

581
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:51,556
I need a skilled risk surveyor
to accompany me to the Singapore branch.

582
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:56,019
Checked baggage allowance
for business class is up to 30 kg,

583
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:57,479
so that should be more than enough.

584
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:04,820
Do you want to bring your pet rock
and come with me?

585
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,412
You can say no.

586
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,207
You don't have to come with me.

587
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,509
I'll think about it.

588
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:37,477
Okay.

589
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:40,272
But don't take too long.

590
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,483
They want me to join them
as soon as possible.

591
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:47,487
I understand.

592
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,593
You can return to work now.

593
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,567
Of all people…

594
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,741
Why are you making me this offer?

595
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:36,328
I told you.

596
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,413
I need a skilled person.

597
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,292
Do you need me?

598
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,137
Yes.

599
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:36,471
Mr. Na is getting divorced?

600
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:39,349
So that's why he called you last night.

601
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:42,769
I think his wife had reached her limit.

602
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:45,230
He said there were signs prior to this.

603
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,482
But it hasn't been confirmed yet.

604
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,901
He must be hurting a lot.

605
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:53,822
We both know it's more hellish
right before the divorce.

606
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:54,906
Right.

607
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,952
You never imagine
that it could happen to you.

608
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,328
I felt the same way.

609
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,665
Shall we have dinner after work today?

610
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:07,836
I'm sorry. I have a reinsurance meeting,
so I might be late.

611
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,924
I'll be okay, so why don't you go home
and get some rest?

612
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,509
You still need to recover from last night.

613
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:16,803
Right.

614
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,226
What is it? Do you recognize someone?

615
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,897
No, the lake caught my eye
because it's so pretty.

616
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:29,691
It's not as pretty as you, of course.

-Goodbye, sir.
-Mr. Na…

624
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:07,854
Something's going on with Mr. Na, right?

625
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,025
It's likely because of the rejected cases.

626
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:15,028
I've been so concerned
because he's been out of sorts all day

627
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,863
that I think I have indigestion now.

628
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,032
-Do you want a digestive aid?
-No, I have some.

629

Mind your own business.

633
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,855
Singapore? I'm jealous.

634
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:52,107
No, that's not it.

635
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:55,777
After this is over,
I want to go somewhere too.

636
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,240
Right. After this is over,
let's all go somewhere.

637
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,409
We're almost there, so let's keep going!

-We got this!

00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:35,567
You're here.

640
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:39,863
I ordered grilled hagfish you like.

641
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,239

00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:04,179
Another insurance policy?

645
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:07,891
Honey.

646
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:12,979
This will be the last product
before I retire.

647
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,192
So I have to--

648
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,610
Excuse me.

649
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,448
Well, ma'am…

650
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,633
You were right, honey.

651
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,805
After moving into a bigger house,
sending the kids to study overseas,

652
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:50,183
and seeing you go on trips,

653
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,684
I said to myself, "Right."

654
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:55,188
"Na Dae-bok, you did a good job
providing for your family."

655
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:56,731
That's what I thought.

656
00:46:57,899 --> 00:46:59,692
So I thought I had done my part.

657
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,279
Making sacrifices for the family?

658
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:06,366
That was just an excuse.

659
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:08,576
Top insurance agent in Ssangmun-dong?

660
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:11,204
Who cares about that?

661
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,916
What do you mean? You were proud of that.

662
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,590
I've been selfish
because I was afraid of falling behind.

663
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:25,635
And I didn't want to feel small
as the head of our family.

664
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:35,019
At least I got to focus on myself
outside our home.

665
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,610
But you never did.

666
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:48,241
You took care of the kids and our home,

667
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:50,201
and that took a lot of effort.

668
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:52,537
Maybe I pretended not to know

669
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,124
out of my own selfish desires.

670
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,418
But when it came to selling insurance,

671
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:02,880
you were so understanding
of complete strangers.

672
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:03,965
Right?

673
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:07,343
Right.

674
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:12,473
I'm sorry, honey.

675
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:15,977
You were the one

676
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:18,938
who went through a lot.

677
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,670
This damn grilled hagfish.

678
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,797
I got married because of it.

679
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:51,554
You struggled so much
because you were broke…

680
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,100
but you always bought me grilled hagfish

681
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:57,727
because I loved it so much.

682
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,815
That's why I fell for you.

683
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:06,402
I knew you'd provide for me somehow.

684
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,910
I swear on this last insurance product.

685
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:17,664
Just give me a hundred days.

686
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,501
I'll do my best and be good to you

687
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:24,671
to make sure this policy
doesn't get canceled.

688
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:48,277
You also…

689
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,698
went through a lot.

690
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:58,746
How could I possibly not know that?

691
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:04,711
Give me some time.

692
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:10,466
This isn't an easy decision for me either.

693
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:14,804
So-jeong…

694
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:24,814
I'll improve by 1% every day…

695
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,861
and I'll change 100% for the better.

696
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:33,114
I promise…

697
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:38,494
I promise I'll change.

698
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:42,790

00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:47,587

00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:18,534
The next stop is…

702
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,902
How did you know?

703
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,946
How could I not know? We're neighbors.

704
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,823
But how did you know when I'd arrive…

705
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:01,619
Have you been waiting this whole time?

706
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:03,996
You should've called.

707
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,624
I was afraid you'd be in a meeting.
I haven't been here long.

708
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:10,127
It was nice to hear the sound of rain.

709
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:13,381
Let's get going.
There's a gift waiting at home.

710
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,299
-Really?
-Yes.

711
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,427
-Aren't you cold?
-I'm okay.

712
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:28,187
I guess my mom came by earlier.

713
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:31,065
I'm glad we missed each other,
or she would've been shocked.

714
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:32,942
Right.

715
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:37,321
You haven't called her
since that day, right?

716
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:46,205
I'll just grab a few books and take off.

717
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:20,573
Mom.

718
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,454
Thank you for the side dishes.

719
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,665
Your wrists are sore.
Why did you make so much?

720
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:31,792
Yes.

721
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:33,794
Of course I ate.

722
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:35,838
What about you?

723
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:11,499
Okay.

724
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,084
Goodbye.

725
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:15,336
Was that your mom?

726
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,965
She told me to eat well,
especially since I'm on my own.

727
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:21,884
That's how all parents are.

728
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:24,637
I told her I'd visit her at home soon.

729
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:29,934
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't bothered by that day.

730
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,394
But I have no regrets because

731
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:32,979
it was my choice
to muster up my courage.

732
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:34,063
Right.

733
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:37,566
I'm sorry.

734
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:40,611
I didn't mean to see it.

735
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:43,239
It's okay.

736
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,032
It could happen.
We switched houses, after all.

737
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:46,951
I'm the one who should apologize
for making you see this.

738
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,119
No, not at all.

739
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,747
My ex-wife took this photo.

740
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,210
Weren't you curious?

741
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,712
Of course I was.

742
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:02,216
But that relationship is over now.

743
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,051
Right.

744
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,429
It's over now because of me.

745
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:12,184
That's why I kept this one photo.

746
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:13,811
To remind myself of how I was back then.

747
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:17,815
It just looks like you're working hard.

748
00:55:19,108 --> 00:55:23,487
Back then, all I wanted was a stable life.

749
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:29,035
I always told her, "Next time…"

750
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,666
Then one day, she said to me

751
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,502
that we have different views on life.

752
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,255
While I was waiting for the rain to stop,

753
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,800
she wanted to stand in the rain together.

754
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:48,512
By the time I came to my senses,

755
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:50,014
there was no next time.

756
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:52,099
That was it. The end.

757
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:57,313
Love always fades in the blink of an eye.

758
00:55:58,731 --> 00:55:59,732
Exactly.

759
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,734
Amazingly, though,

760
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,487
I saw her at the park earlier.

761
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:28,010
At that moment,
only one thought crossed my mind.

762
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:30,638
"I'm so relieved."

763
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:32,640
"I'm so relieved."

764
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,852
If she had seen me,
she would've thought the same

765
00:56:36,936 --> 00:56:38,729
since you were next to me, right?

766
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,446
Your photo…

767
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,158
This memory is enough for me.

768
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:52,993
It's time to make new ones.

769
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,582
Good. Make them with me.

770
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:04,839
It's pretty late. I'll get going now.

771
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:08,425
Hold on.

772
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:13,180
I think we can return
to our respective homes now.

773
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:14,890
Are you afraid your mom will find out?

774
00:57:14,974 --> 00:57:16,392
No, it's not that.

775
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:20,229
I think I can sleep comfortably
at home now.

776
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:23,274
If that's the case, then I'm a bit worried

777
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:26,068
because I've already settled in your home.

778
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:34,368
In that case,

779
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,079
since it's raining a lot outside…

780
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:42,042
and to see if we've adapted or not…

781
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:49,884
Do you want to stay the night here?

782
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:01,270
With me?

783
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:34,590
Jin-ju.

784
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:02,826
Jin-ju.

785
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:10,584
I'm sorry.

786
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:12,961
I'm sorry.

787
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,464
Did you sleep well?

788
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,426
Good morning.

789
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:52,019
The rejected cases have been resolved!

790
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,729
Don't get too excited just yet.

791
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,607
If we don't resolve this,
we can't launch the divorce insurance.

792
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,734
Don't struggle on your own.

793
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,569
How did it go? What did the FSS say?

794
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:04,031
-It's late, but thank you for the gift.
-What's going on with you two?

795
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,909
There's a place
that can rekindle your love.

796
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:08,827
I'm going back to Singapore.

797
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,579
You haven't told her yet?

798
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:12,748
Do you enjoy making a fool out of me?

799
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:14,166
Can I ask you something?

800
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:16,084
What was your question
during the tarot reading?

801
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:18,420
Because I knew from the beginning.

802
