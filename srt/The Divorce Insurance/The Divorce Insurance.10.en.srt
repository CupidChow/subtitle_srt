AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,887
EPISODE 10

4
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:58,517
Who is it?

5
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,604
We're from Plus General Insurance.

6
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:04,899
-Hello.
-Hello.

7
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,195
-Please come in.
-Thank you.

8
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,697
Thank you.

9
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,911
If you have time, can you please help me?

10
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:19,413
-Yes.
-Yes.

11
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,717
I'm making a video,
but I can't get the framing right.

12
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,302
It'll only take a moment.

13
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,470
That's okay, right?

14
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,305
Yes, of course.

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,267
Just adjust the focus
to capture the inside of the fridge.

16
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,644
-Okay.
-I'll take that.

17
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,688
Tell me when you're ready.

18
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,065
-I'm ready.
-Okay.

19
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:48,776
Hi, my Summers!

20
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,153
Today, I'm deep-cleaning my refrigerator!

21
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,699
Damn it. Cut.

22
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,368
Your clapping got picked up.

23
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,995
I'm sorry. You were so good
that I didn't even realize I was…

24
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,456
-Go sit down.
-Okay.

25
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,833
Let's start over.

26
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:08,170
We have to be fair
and listen to both sides of the story.

27
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,464
I see.

28
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,760
Let me go over the disclosures first.

29
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:17,638
Is it true you met through an introduction
and got married in four months?

30
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,223
Yes.

31
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,393
Did you think he was the one
when you first saw him?

32
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,521
We were each other's ideal type.

33
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,481
Love at first sight and all that.

34
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:30,442
Both of our parents also encouraged us
to get married quickly.

35
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,863
This might sound rude,

36
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,949
but shouldn't you have spent more time
getting to know each other?

37
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:42,538
We thought we could do that
while living together.

38
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:46,417
More than anything,
everyone said we were the perfect match

39
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,168
and often envied us.

40
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:54,383
Then what was the problem between you two?

41
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,303
Problem?

42
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,313
Problem…

43
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,734
"A sham marriage"?

44
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,820
We might've looked happy to others,

45
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,655
but we never saw eye to eye.

46
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,538
There we go.

47
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,797
Perfect.

48
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,591
Isn't this too much?

49
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,468
A full table makes a better photo.

50
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:42,056
By the way, you have to eat extra for me.

51
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,140
Why?

52
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,352
I'm managing my diet, remember?

53
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,647
Move. You're in the way.

54
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,691
Move farther. Get out of the way.

55
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,195
This came out great.

56
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,863
Goodness, look at the time.

57
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:58,948
Come here.

58
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,826
This is a bit…

59
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,246
Didn't I tell you to get a new razor?

60
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:09,291
I like what I'm using now,
so I'll stick with it longer.

61
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,085
You're so stubborn.

62
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,795
Your clothes…

63
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,254
It's fine.

64
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,259
Speaking of your razor…

65
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,761
Goodness, they're here already.

66
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:21,887
Do I look okay?

67
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,056
Coming!

68
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:33,524
This is too good to be a home-cooked meal.

69
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,068
Mr. Kim, this is worth paying for.

70
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,655
You're too kind, sir.
Please help yourself.

71
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,156
You must eat like this often.

72
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,033
Didn't you have eel a few days ago?

73
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,035
How did you know?

74
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:48,455
I'm a fan of Ms. Yeo-reum.
I saw it on her social media.

75
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,917
What an honor, ma'am.

76
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,919
You're the ultimate wife.

77
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:56,338
Mr. Kim, you're lucky to have her.

78
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:57,423
Of course, sir.

79
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,136
I'm the lucky one
for having such a good husband.

80
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,306
He barely has time to breathe
because of his job at FSS,

81
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,850
so this is the least I can do.

82
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,437
Please let my husband breathe a bit, sir.

83
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,355
If anything, that's what I want to say.

84
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,442
Do you know how shocked I was
when you collapsed?

85
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:21,572
He collapsed, sir?

86
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,283
Goodness, you didn't know?

87
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:34,501
You kept it from me
so that I wouldn't worry, right?

88
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,046
Yes, of course.

89
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,548
I just collapsed from overwork,
so I didn't want to worry you.

90
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,302
He always puts me first like this.

91
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,846
You two are such a loving couple.

92
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,639
You should have children soon.

93
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,851
He's right. A child is
what truly completes a marriage.

94
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,521
We're both too busy for that.

95
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,776
Right. And we're still happy
with just each other.

96
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:00,861
Oh, my.

97
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,322
I'm so clumsy.

98
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,283
You might want to clean that off
in the bathroom.

99
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,827
-The bathroom is--
-This way, right?

100
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,287
I saw it on her social media.

101
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:14,458
You must've seen the home tour video.
Please go ahead.

102
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,421
Goodness, is this the sofa
you ordered from France?

103
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:23,550
-Isn't the design pretty?
-Yes, it's pretty.

104
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:25,886
But it's just pretty.

105
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,931
All that matters is that it's pretty.
Shall I take a photo?

106
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,474
The natural light is great for photos.

107
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,726
-Sir, join her.
-Me too?

108
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,646
It'll turn out really well in this spot.
Let me take one for you.

109
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,315
-Hurry and come over.
-Okay.

110
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,400
I'll make sure it turns out well.

111
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,778
Here we go. One, two…

112
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,113
Gosh, you look so pretty!

113
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,032
Let's do this pose too.

114
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:50,160
Take care, sir. I'll be in touch with you.

115
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,584
THE ULTIMATE WIFE IS HERE

116
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,088
THAT LOOKS PERFECT

117
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,923
I ENVY YOU
WHAT IS YOUR SECRET?

118
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,218
Hold on. This just arrived.

119
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,178
I wish it had come in the morning instead.

120
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,264
Use this from now on.

121
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,560
I told you mine is easier to use.

122
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,436
This is much better and expensive.

123
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,899
Do you have to post this
on social media too?

124
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:23,569
What?

125
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,571
Why do you live with me?

126
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,702
Do you live with me
because you want to show others

127
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,246
who you live with, what you buy,

128
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,290
what you do, and what you eat?

129
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:39,501
What a ridiculous thing to say
to someone who got you a razor.

130
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:42,462
Why do strangers know
where our bathroom is?

131
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,301
Why not go ahead and post
how many spoons and chopsticks we have?

132
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:53,390
I worked hard for your sake this morning,
and this is the thanks I get?

133
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,019
For my sake? You did it for me?

134
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,354
Who else would it be for?

135
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,898
Yourself!

136
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:02,983
You did it for yourself!

137
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,986
It was for Han Yeo-reum,
whom her followers envy.

138
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,365
It's why you insisted
that we move into this house, right?

139
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,159
What about it?

140
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,369
Didn't you see how jealous
the general manager's wife was?

141
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:20,584
You're so focused on what others think
that you don't even see me.

142
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,632
What about you?

143
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,260
Did you really keep it from me
just to spare my feelings?

144
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,680
You just didn't want to talk to me, right?

145
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,519
Do you know how privileged
you sound right now?

146
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,021
So just stop.

147
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,370
I don't know if we're living together

148
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,538
because we're a married couple

149
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:00,916
or to keep up appearances.

150
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,461
You're exhausting.

151
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,885
Can't we do something about that sofa?

152
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,514
I can't stand how uncomfortable it is.

153
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,018
How am I any different from that sofa?

154
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,899
It's suffocating.

155
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,652
You're suffocating me to death.

156
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,323
Are you done talking?

157
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,327
Yes.

158
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:39,746
So…

159
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,045
Let's get a divorce.

160
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,805
You're so irresponsible.

161
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,810
Think whatever you want.

162
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,604
I can't take this anymore.

163
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,999
Can I ask you something?

164
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,296
Why did you create divorce insurance?

165
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,761
Because a disaster
requires preventive measures.

166
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,179
A disaster?

167
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,850
What if it's a minor incident?

168
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,978
Once it passes, it's nothing.

169
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,355
That's why

170
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,107
I'm not getting divorced.

171
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,692
I'm determined to get divorced.

172
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,778
I'm sure others won't understand.

173
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,157
And my wife has tried very hard
on her own.

174
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,577
I'm sure she's stressed

175
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,080
because things haven't gone her way.

176
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,668
But there's no hope in sight for us,

177
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,129
so it's worse to force ourselves
to stay together.

178
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,799
I see.

179
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,592
I need to start living.

180
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,388
Not because of someone else
but for myself.

181
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,937
People don't criticize
those in pain or in suffering.

182
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,272
But they criticize those
who get divorced

183
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,067
even though we do it
because we're in pain.

184
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,447
That's why many people
give up on living a life

185
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,241
that reflects who they are.

186
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,371
Holding it in will only hurt you more.

187
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:55,006
Mr. Kim Seon-man and Ms. Han Yeo-reum
must get divorced.

188
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,762
Ms. Kang, what do you mean
we can't stop the divorce?

189
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,598
We need to respect Mr. Kim's choice.

190
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:06,101
Then what about Ms. Han's choice?

191
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,520
Our goal is to reduce
the number of rejected cases.

192
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,480
Right. We're almost there now.

193
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,065
But think about it.

194
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,401
What if we force them to stay together
for the official launch

195
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,236
and then things go wrong later?

196
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,115
Shouldn't we think about why we made
divorce insurance in the first place?

197
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,867
Ms. Kang.

198
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,661
Ms. Joh, I've been meaning
to say this to you--

199
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,996
Everyone, that's enough.

200
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,710
We don't have time for this.

201
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,550
What are the odds that divorce insurance

202
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,719
will launch and succeed?

203
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,054
It's 1 in 500,000.

204
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,641
The same odds as
a pure white albino raccoon being born.

205
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,018
Right.

206
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,813
Most people would call that impossible.

207
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,191
This goes to show how amazing we are.

208
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,444
We beat those incredible odds
and got this far.

209
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,821
I admit, it hasn't been easy.

210
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,825
I've seen what it took for all of you
to get to this point.

211
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,835
So long as they are not
currently having an affair,

212
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,545
anyone may purchase divorce insurance…

213
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,132
-What?
-Are you crazy?

214
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,397
Here.

215
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,982
Is it heavy?

216
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,527
-Here we go.
-Be careful.

217
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,822
Darn it.

218
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,330
I'm sorry, Mr. Na.

219
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,833
No need to apologize, Ms. Kang.

220
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,796
I understand how you feel.

221
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,340
If anything,
I feel even more sorry and grateful.

222
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:06,304
The way I see it, those
creating this insurance must be happy

223
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,765
for those benefiting from the insurance

224
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,434
to be satisfied and happy as well.

225
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,478
Ms. Jeon is currently suspended,

226
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:17,440
so the five of us have to
push each other and give it our all.

227
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:21,361
At the very least,
we shouldn't take sides and fight.

228
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,405
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

229
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,073
Sorry, sir.

230
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,242
Okay.

231
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,583
How about giving that couple
some time to make a choice?

232
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,167
You're talking about
couples therapy, right?

233
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,129
Yes. There's a lot we can offer.

234
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,881
I think it could be quite helpful.

235
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:43,675
I agree, sir.

236
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,759
Me too.

237
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,929
Think of Ms. Gu Mi-rae
and Ms. Woo Seon-hee.

238
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,973
If it hadn't been
for the choices they made,

239
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,642
it wouldn't have mattered what we did.

240
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,728
That's right.

241
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,564
True.

242
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,191
You're right.

243
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:04,195
I'm going to meet with Mr. Kim

244
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,447
and try to persuade him.

245
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,700
-Good luck.
-See you later.

246
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,828
I'll go see Ms. Han.

247
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,288
Okay, sounds good.

248
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,333
Good luck.

249
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,135
-See you at our next meeting.
-Yes, sir.

250
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:29,679
Mr. Kim.

251
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,307
-Go on ahead.
-Yes, sir.

252
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,933
-Good night, sir.
-Good night, sir.

253
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,938
I'm sorry. I ended up
coming back here after all.

254
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,523
Did you work overtime?

255
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,651
I already said my piece at your office.

256
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,155
Please don't say something like,
"Don't get divorced for the payout."

257
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,365
Just a moment.

258
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,914
Actually, I've been divorced three times.

259
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,380
How about talking
to a multi-divorced person?

260
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,841
How did you end up
getting divorced three times?

261
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,970
We were never on the same page.

262
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,558
Things don't always
turn out the way we hope.

263
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,977
My wife and I are the same way.

264
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,272
As our differences grew, our marriage
is a shell of what it once was.

265
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,858
I met Ms. Han earlier.

266
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,195
She doesn't want a divorce, right?

267
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:28,822
Right.

268
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,702
She knows very well
that the two of you are different.

269
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,287
It's good to hear that she knows.

270
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,250
Divorce is the answer…

271
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,170
because I'm no longer happy.

272
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:47,966
I…

273
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,843
I'm not happy.

274
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,054
I said I'm not happy.

275
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,946
It wasn't easy…

276
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,242
to get pregnant.

277
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,288
It must've been so hard for you.

278
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,249
Looking at other people's babies…

279
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,918
It was too much to bear.

280
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,923
I guess my husband knew

281
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,343
because he put in for long-term leave
and said we should go on a trip.

282
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,182
I laughed a lot on that trip…

283
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,478
thanks to my husband.

284
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,817
Was that when you started
your social media journey?

285
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,445
Pretty much, yes.

286
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,990
It was just an account
with a single photo at first.

287
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,619
After what happened,
my husband suggested something.

288
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,621
He said that instead of baby photos,

289
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,834
maybe I could upload
happy photos of us on a regular basis.

290
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,213
When people said they were envious

291
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,215
and that we looked happy…

292
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,385
I started feeling better…

293
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,055
strangely enough.

294
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:21,184
It must have felt
rewarding for you in a way.

295
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:23,853
That's right.

296
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,109
It was rather enjoyable

297
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,696
even if my reality wasn't.

298
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,243
You met with my husband, right?

299
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,038
Yes.

300
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,376
I'm not sure how to put this,

301
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,838
but he was very firm about his decision.

302
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,556
I've put up with a lot too.

303
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,726
He disapproved of my social media so much
that he wouldn't talk to me.

304
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,896
And we've been sleeping separately
for months now.

305
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,111
I know what's going on too.

306
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,115
Here.

307
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,746
This is all because of
the divorce insurance.

308
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,791
You say divorce is a disaster.

309
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,752
You're right. It's a disaster.

310
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,882
If this divorce insurance
hadn't encouraged divorce…

311
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,178
I know that this disaster…

312
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,640
wouldn't have happened to me.

313
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,026
If divorce insurance is the reason,

314
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,778
why not use it as a chance
to reflect on your relationship

315
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:00,074
and give your husband some time?

316
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,789
Couples therapy?

317
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:10,251
Yes, it's a program
provided by divorce insurance.

318
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,045
It won't change your answer,

319
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,589
but it should help you
understand each other.

320
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,052
If we're getting divorced anyway,
why put in that effort?

321
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,639
To end things well.

322
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,392
End things well?

323
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,316
It won't be easy,

324
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,778
but why don't you think of it
as a divorce mediation period?

325
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,957
MOM

326
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,552
MOM
ARE YOU REALLY NOT COMING?

327
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,388
DO YOU HAVE TO
BRING SUCH SHAME TO YOUR PARENTS?

328
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,604
I didn't see that move coming.

329
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,024
Then I think I will…

330
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,363
Is Su-in having a hard time at work?

331
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,950
He's lost more weight.

332
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,245
He wolfed down
the whole chicken soup earlier.

333
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,289
I'll pack some side dishes for you,
so make sure he eats well.

334
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:35,795
Mom.

335
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,340
-I'm getting divorced--
-Deal with it.

336
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:43,386
You need to deal with things
once you're married.

337
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,555
Do you think it's always been
a bed of roses for me?

338
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,640
If you get divorced,

339
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,601
your father and I won't be able to
show our faces in public.

340
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,273
Hold on a second.

341
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,649
No, sir.

342
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,568
Go easy on me.

343
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,571
-Okay, sir, then place it here.
-I didn't see that one.

344
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,204
AH-YOUNG

345
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,582
Hey, what's up?

346
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,125
So did the talk go well?

347
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,837
He seemed to be mulling it over.
We'll have to wait and see.

348
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,422
Yes, I suppose so.

349
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,508
Anyway, I wonder
if Ms. Kang's talk went well.

350
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,593
Ms. Kang?

351
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,429
She went to see Ms. Han
after you had left.

352
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,681
In any case, good work today.

353
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:31,309
-Let's talk tomorrow.
-Yes, sir.

354
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:41,778
UNDERWRITER KANG HAN-DEUL

355
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,989
The customer is on another call.
Please leave a message after the beep.

356
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,074
Yes.

357
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,743
Did it go well?

358
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:52,789
I'm almost home.

359
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:55,750
Okay, see you tomorrow.

360
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:22,485
Coming!

361
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:29,992
I already have wine.

362
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,453
Then hold onto it.

363
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,385
Hey, you bought a new chair.

364
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:49,512
Was it because of me?

365
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,473
Is it mine?

366
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,016
It felt a bit empty with just one.

367
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,191
It's my chair.

368
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:05,278
Still, it feels like my personal chair.

369
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,406
You're making tomato-based pasta.

370
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,242
Yes, I thought it'd pair well
with the Sangiovese.

371
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:14,537
Like makgeolli and pajeon.

372
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,205
Or soju and chicken gizzard.

373
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,625
As expected, we're on the same wavelength.

374
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,479
Please try it.

375
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:58,956
This is delicious.

376
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,628
I might crave it from time to time.

377
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,796
Let me know when you do.

378
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:11,427
By the way, why did you invite me over?

379
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,933
Well…

380
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,856
Let's talk tomorrow. Okay.

381
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,800
I'm hungry, but I don't have an appetite.

382
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:52,969
What is it?

383
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:03,479
"Hotel staycation"?

384
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,732
HOTEL STAYCATION, FREE WIFE
FRIENDSHIP FOREVER, GETTING DRUNK TODAY

385
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,581
Why isn't he answering?
Is it too early over there?

386
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,377
-Hey there, son.
-What is it, Dad?

387
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,631
Can't a father call his son
for no particular reason?

388
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,384
It's the first time you've called me.

389
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,719
Is that so?

390
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,138
How's Mom?

391
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,764
She went to the hospital
because of a cold.

392
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,350
Your mom is fine.

393
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,602
She's all better now.

394
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,063
So she's off somewhere with her friends.

395
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:48,566
Really? That's a relief.

396
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,278
So is your graduation in March?

397
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,530
It's in mid-May. Mom's supposed to come.

398
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,615
-I see.
-You didn't know?

399
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,618
That's right. I remember hearing that.

400
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:02,830
I'm so busy these days
that it slipped my mind.

401
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:07,126
It's my son's graduation,
so I should be there.

402
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,587
If you're busy,
you'll have difficulty with jet lag.

403
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,963
It's okay if only Mom comes.

404
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,507
Oh, I see.

405
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,925
Aunt is calling me.

406
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:18,262
-I have to go now.
-Hey, let me know if you need anything.

407
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,640
And be careful who you trust.
Do you understand…

408
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,517
Hello?

409
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,358
The little punk hung up on me.

410
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,034
2010 HIGHEST EXCELLENCE AWARD
NA DAE-BOK

411
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:45,664
The divorce insurance product.

412
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,459
Since we all worked hard on it,

413
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:52,254
how about we finish it together
until its official launch?

414
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:02,390
Today, a policyholder came,
saying he wanted a divorce.

415
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,309
That damn divorce insurance.

416
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,354
Nothing is easy about it.

417
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,189
Because it's a product of great value.

418
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:14,402
Look, Mr. An Jeon-man.

419
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,198
-I'm suspended right now.
-I know.

420
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,535
But the person who recognized
its value was you, Ms…

421
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:25,955
It was you, Na-rae.

422
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,591
I know it won't be easy.

423
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,852
I'll at least try…

424
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,981
before I regret it even more.

425
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,152
That's good to hear.

426
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,238
By the way…

427
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:03,617
You don't seem to be
bothered at all, Mr. An.

428
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:04,702
About what?

429
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:06,328
About me.

430
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,082
You've seen all of my flaws.

431
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,464
And I've also seen your courageous side.

432
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,512
So there's no reason to feel bothered.

433
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,987
Is it good?

434
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,448
Yes, it turned out great.

435
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,999
The best way to end things well?

436
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:53,876
Yes.

437
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,921
There are many different ways
to end a relationship.

438
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,839
They say there's no such thing
as a good breakup.

439
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,092
But for my sake,
it's better to end things on good terms.

440
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,096
How did it go with Ms. Han?

441
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,306
I had a similar experience.

442
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:12,728
I proposed giving her husband
a grace period through couples therapy

443
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,482
since Ms. Han
wanted to work things out with him.

444
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,318
Jeez, they're in the same situation
but have different goals.

445
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,365
It's possible

446
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:28,285
that we were also in the same situation
but had different goals.

447
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,083
I think I got too caught up
in my own emotions earlier.

448
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,377
I'm sorry.

449
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,296
No, I understand.
You were just looking out for your client.

450
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:43,133
I was too focused on
expressing my opinion. I'm sorry.

451
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,722
But let's not forget
that our ultimate goal is happiness.

452
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:50,140
How could I possibly forget?

453
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,477
Mr. Kim and Ms. Han
desperately want happiness.

454
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:55,437
Let's be the ones to find it for them.

455
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:56,647
Sounds good.

456
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,950
If divorce insurance is the reason,

457
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:53,037
why not use it as a chance
to reflect on your relationship

458
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,123
and give your husband some time?

459
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:13,349
If we're getting divorced anyway,
why put in that effort?

460
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,685
To end things well.

461
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,913
They say there's no such thing
as a good breakup.

462
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:39,291
But for my sake,
it's better to end things well.

463
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,797
End things well.

464
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,840
End it well.

465
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,019
You're still at home, right?

466
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,064
I'm sorry. I'm at work.

467
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:06,777
-Already?
-I forgot to tell you sooner.

468
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,861
Is it urgent?

469
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,489
No, not at all. Let's talk at work.

470
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,033
Okay.

471
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,016
Can we…

472
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:41,645
talk for a moment?

473
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,203
Do you want to fight me?

474
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,955
Thank you for this.

475
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:07,504
Cheers.

476
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,009
Why did you come so early?

477
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,969
Just because. I couldn't sleep.

478
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,721
Because of couples therapy?

479
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:20,350
That and some other things.
I reviewed the terms and conditions too.

480
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:23,353
There was a lot to consider
regarding this case.

481
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:25,773
Don't worry about it.

482
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,232
What about you, Ms. Kang?

483
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,319
You said yesterday

484
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,905
that I have to
end things well for my sake.

485
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:36,450
-Right.
-So I'm going to try and end things well.

486
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,618
What do you mean?

487
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,537
I have a family gathering in a few days.

488
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,624
I wasn't planning on going at first.

489
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,876
I was upset with my parents
who are ashamed of me.

490
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,629
And I regretted
letting things get to this point.

491
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,214
I just wanted to avoid it.

492
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:53,509
But the thing is,

493
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,595
I thought I'd really regret it

494
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,264
if I didn't end things here.

495
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,849
It's easy to have regrets.

496
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,977
That's why I continue to have regrets--

497
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,854
And keep going in circles.

498
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,024
I know how you feel.

499
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,111
I'm still the same way.

500
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,113
Excuse me?

501
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:18,784
Never mind.

502
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,537
So how are you going to end things well?

503
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:25,082
I'm looking for something.

504
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,752
So I wanted to ask you for a favor,
but you were already at work.

505
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,088
Ask away. What is it?

506
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,967
The thing I'm looking for is very small.

507
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,719
-It's small.
-Yes, it's about…

508
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,013
Hold on a second.

509
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,515
Who are you?

510
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,985
Where did Mr. Noh and Ms. Kang go?

511
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,321
Maybe they're talking about their meetings
with Mr. Kim and his wife.

512
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:59,283
Exactly. It's not like
they'd be fighting, right?

513
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:03,078
Hurry up and call them.
We need to have a meeting.

514
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,454
Yes, sir.

515
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:10,377
Here they are.

516
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,088
Where on earth have you two been?

517
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,673
We had to discuss something.

518
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:18,594
We have a meeting in ten minutes
about Mr. Kim and his wife.

519
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,096
No, sir. Let's begin now.

520
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,598
What?

521
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:27,477
Ta-da.

522
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,937
FSS MANAGER KIM SEON-MAN
WE'LL RECEIVE COUPLES THERAPY

523
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,232
-Seriously?
-Why? What is it?

524
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:35,444
Mr. Kim Seon-man and Ms. Han Yeo-reum
will receive couples therapy.

525
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:37,738
-Awesome!
-Really?

526
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,326
My gosh.

527
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,536
-We did it.
-Holy cow.

528
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,338
Hello, thank you for coming.

529
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,134
Shall we go, then?

530
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:41,134
Shall we write down
what we want from each other?

531
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,351
WHAT I'D LIKE FROM MY WIFE

532
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:15,377
GO TO A COZY CAFE TOGETHER

533
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,464
SPENDING A DAY TOGETHER
WITHOUT PHONES

534
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,508
KIM SEON-MAN, HAN YEO-REUM

535
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:22,884
Okay.

536
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,262
Which should we do first?

537
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:34,896
Let's start with Mr. Kim's.
That one sentence says it all.

538
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:39,192
-Let's do that.
-Sounds good.

539
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,318
Okay.

540
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:48,785
SPENDING A DAY TOGETHER
WITHOUT PHONES

541
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:52,539
Enjoy your meal.

542
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:55,917
This looks good, right?

543
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,505
-We haven't eaten out in a while.
-Yes.

544
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:02,966
Oh, right. I don't have my phone.

545
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,968
I forgot. I'm sorry.

546
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:07,262
Let's just take it all in
with our eyes for today.

547
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,472
Okay.

548
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,328
They seem to be doing well.

549
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,123
Honey, open wide.

550
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,125
I'll eat it myself.

551
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,587
But why? I want to feed you.

552
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:44,549
Right, you don't like shrimp.
I'll take it out for you.

553
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,718
-Yeo-reum.
-Yes?

554
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:51,848
Open wide.

555
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:58,271
It's important to share a meal together.

556
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:02,442
Yes. They say the way to someone's heart
is through their stomach.

557
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,530
You like salmon too.

558
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:07,781
Open wide.

559
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:21,545
What's wrong? Are you okay?

560
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,549
-I have to use the restroom.
-What?

561
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:29,553
Honey?

562
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:33,974
-Hold on, Ms. Kang.
-What?

563
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,059
Let them handle things today.

564
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:56,955
Are you okay?

565
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:00,750
I shouldn't have given you shrimp.

566
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:01,960
It's okay.

567
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,263
PLUS GENERAL INSURANCE DIVORCE INSURANCE
BUSINESS PRACTICES MANUAL

568
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,287
This is Jeon Na-rae.

569
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,248
May I meet with the president?

570
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,752
Let's get into position.

571
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,212
Please stand close to each other.

572
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,006
A bit closer.

573
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:54,054
Good. Your feet and knees must be close.

574
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,348
Straighten your back and find your center.

575
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,099
And please clasp your hands together.

576
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,728
Oh, just this hand.

577
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,314
Wonderful. And now…

578
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:08,026
Mr. Kim, wrap your right hand around
your wife's shoulder blade.

579
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:13,865
Ms. Han, place your left arm
above your husband's shoulder.

580
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:17,077
Who knew it would be so hard
to eat and take dance lessons?

581
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,287
I know, right? Nothing comes easy.

582
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:22,249
Okay. Now, let's begin on my count.

583
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:25,418
One, two, three. Two, two, three.

584
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:29,047
One, two, three.

585
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,968
One, two, three.

586
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,844
One, two, three.

587
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:38,807
One, two, three.

588
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,269
One, two, three.

589
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:46,064
One, two, three.

590
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:49,401
-One, two, three.
-Goodness!

591
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,697
-Are you okay?
-My back…

592
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,824
-Are you sure?
-I'm okay. Jeez, my back…

593
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:56,950
Goodness, Ms. Han…

594
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,619
Honey.

595
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:03,456
Remember how we fell while skating
when we first got married?

596
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,708
What are you doing? Get up.

597
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,418
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay, sir.

598
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:09,004
Back then, you were…

599
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,547
Everyone's looking. Get up.

600
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:14,759
-All right.
-Oh, okay.

601
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,929
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

602
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:22,434
I'm sorry, but why are you
making such a big deal?

603
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,227
What?

604
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:29,190
Am I wrong?
It's not as if I fell on purpose.

605
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,694
You didn't even ask
if I was okay after falling.

606
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:38,450
What's the problem this time?

607
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:39,659
Didn't you say we should try?

608
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:41,494
But it's not going well.

609
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:43,330
Is this why you acted that way earlier?

610
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,166
What is it? Does the sight of my face

611
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,752
make you lose your appetite and vomit?

612
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:49,836
That's not true.

613
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:50,920
Yes, it is!

614
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,172
Han Yeo-reum!

615
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:56,426
If you keep this up, I'll…

616
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:58,720
I really feel like dying.

617
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:03,767
Then you should've purchased
life insurance and funeral plan too.

618
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:04,851
How could you say that?

619
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,062
Then what do you want from me?

620
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,481
This is why I took out
a divorce insurance policy!

621
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,650
Because my feelings
don't matter to you at all!

622
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:14,486
Then what about you?

623
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,155
Can't you see that I'm dying inside?

624
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:23,578
Forget it. Let's just end this.

625
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,749
-Do you mean that?
-Yes.

626
00:44:31,044 --> 00:44:33,004
Fine. Let's end it, then.

627
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:34,464
But…

628
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,261
Mr. Kim.

629
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:10,834
We went skating when we first got married.

630
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:13,628
We fell down together
while holding hands, just like today.

631
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:19,759
Every time we looked at each other,
we would just laugh.

632
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:26,641
We laughed until we had tears in our eyes.

633
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,485
I think I've been holding onto my husband

634
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:42,157
even though he had already moved on.

635
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:45,034
I'm sure that's not true, Ms. Han.

636
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:47,537
No matter how hard I try,
everything goes wrong.

637
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,956
Look at what happened at the restaurant.

638
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,750
It's all about trial and error.

639
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,627
Other people think

640
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:57,672
that we're actually happy together.

641
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,841
Now what am I supposed to do?

642
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:04,012
Who cares what others think?
This is about your happiness.

643
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,540
There are plenty of couples

644
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:34,918
who are happily married
despite not being in love.

645
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,087
What's wrong with us?

646
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,216
If you didn't love each other,

647
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,635
you wouldn't expect anything
from the other person.

648
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,553
I said I'd try.

649
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:50,808
Did I not try hard enough?

650
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,355
Try harder.

651
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,691
Some things can't be done,
no matter how hard you try.

652
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,278
Did you try hard enough?

653
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,831
No, sir.

654
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:15,166
You did more than enough.

655
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:31,474
Ms. Ah-young!

656
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:36,980
Over here.

657
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:38,314
Stop waving your hand.

658
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:40,608
I'm just happy to see you.

659
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,404
What is it? Is it about dance therapy?

660
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:45,863
No.

661
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:51,578
-It's a gift.
-A gift?

662
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,496
Is it spinach this time?

663
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:02,213
It's a sologamy wedding kit.
Why did you get this?

664
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:03,923
It's just a gift.

665
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:05,633
I thought of you and bought it.

666
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,471
Do you already have one?

667
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,141
No.

668
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,310
Then hurry and open it up.

669
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,359
Go return it.

670
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,030
Is it because I bought it
without telling you?

671
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,364
It's not that.

672
00:48:28,448 --> 00:48:31,451
I don't think I should receive this
from another person.

673
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:34,787
Especially from you.

674
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:36,956
It hasn't been opened yet,
so you can return it.

675
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,794
-What are you doing?
-I can't return it anymore.

676
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,173
What's wrong with getting this from me?

677
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:49,677
I congratulate and support people
whether they get married or divorced.

678
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:52,930
I bought this for the same reason.

679
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:00,021
I HAVE DECIDED TO BE TRUE TO MYSELF

680
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,656
Lift it up a bit more.

681
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:12,909
Yes, right there.

682
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,748
-You did that on purpose.
-No, I didn't.

683
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:27,965
I didn't get divorce insurance
because I planned on getting divorced.

684
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:29,217
I know.

685
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:34,263
People get insurance in the hopes
that nothing bad happens.

686
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:38,351
But here we are now.

687
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:41,062
How did we get to this point?

688
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,983
Maybe I shouldn't have
gotten into social media.

689
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:48,236
Well, I made excuses about being busy.

690
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,823
That's what ate away at us.

691
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,199
Maybe it's because

692
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:59,414
we got married
without really knowing each other.

693
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:02,125
Do you remember that day?

694
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:04,168
It was as cold as today.

695
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:08,089
We were holding hands and walking
when I proposed to you right about here.

696
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:11,759
Of course I do.

697
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:14,846
Oh, about that ring…

698
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,306
It didn't rust and looks just fine.

699
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,643
They say happy memories don't last long,

700
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,895
but I'm glad you still remember that.

701
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:29,819
Were you ever happy?

702
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,322
Yes.

703
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,533
Because I loved you.

704
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:41,205
Yeo-reum,
I've never once regretted our marriage.

705
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:44,876
Me neither.

706
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:49,380
So let's give it our best,
regardless of what choice we make.

707
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,676
Okay, I'll try my best.

708
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,140
It's cold. Let's go.

709
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,498
Darn it.

710
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,807
I treated myself to something else today
instead of gomtang soup.

711
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:52,193
Ms. Jeon.

712
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:57,365
How have all of you been?

713
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:59,617
What's going on?

714
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:03,246
I'm on my way back
from meeting the president.

715
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,873
As long as it's okay with you,

716
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:11,254
I'll join in until the official launch
of divorce insurance is complete.

717
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:23,057
I vote yes.

718
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:24,809
Me too.

719
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,352
It's good that you came.

720
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:30,857
Me too. I need your approval
on some things anyway.

721
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:36,153
This means our task force is back at 100%.

722
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:40,741
That's right. Our team has been restored.

723
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:44,996
Ms. Jeon, we're going to concentrate again

724
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,540
and keep going until the official launch!

725
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,543
Good. Let's make this happen.

726
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,044
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

727
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:54,171
All right! Let's get to work!

728
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:19,530
SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

729
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:34,712
You can go now.

730
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,380
It's good that you returned.

731
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:38,925
What's this?

732
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:44,347
You're back where you belong. I mean it.

733
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,477
I devoted my time and effort to it,

734
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,145
so I have to see how it turns out.

735
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:54,815
Yes, of course.

736
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,443
If you'll excuse me, Ms. Jeon.

737
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:17,588
Were you waiting for me?

738
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:19,298
How about some makgeolli and pajeon?

739
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:20,967
We had wine and pasta last time, so…

740
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,511
I'm in. Let's go.

741
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,645
The first rule of investment.

742
00:54:33,396 --> 00:54:34,647
Diversification.

743
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:38,401
Going all-in on one person is too risky

744
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,403
since we live in an era
where people live to be 100.

745
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:43,114
That's the safest bet, but…

746
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:45,533
But?

747
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,619
But we can't diversify our feelings
however we want, right?

748
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:51,038
Even if you care for everyone,
there's always someone who matters more.

749
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:52,498
"Someone who matters more"?

750
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:55,376
If it's a sure thing,
investing in one area

751
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,877
could lead to higher profits.

752
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:23,779
I didn't want you to get hurt.

753
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:24,864
Let's go.

754
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:27,366
Are you going home right now?

755
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:31,787
Well…

756
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:35,875
Are you good at games?

757
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:40,004
I'm hopeless with my hands.

758
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,507
I'll teach you. Let's go.

759
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,772
Hey, I won. Did you see that?

760
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:06,614
I won!

761
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:08,199
You said you were not good?

762
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,577
I just really hate losing. One more round?

763
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,828
I'm in.

764
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:16,165
Are you hot?

765
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:19,668
No. I'll go with my usual character, then.

766
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,838
-I want the character I played before.
-Okay.

767
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:24,048
Here you go.

768
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:26,550
-This isn't it.
-No, it's the same one.

769
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:29,011
-But this is an old man.
-Your character aged.

770
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:30,888
Fake hitting high, then go low!

771
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,765
Fake hitting low, then go high!

772
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:33,849
Can't do a thing, can you?

773
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:35,935
-This is different…
-Can't get up, can you?

774
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:38,395
-This is different than before.
-Fake a kick, then punch!

775
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:40,981
-Mr. An?
-Grab and rip apart!

776
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,365
Mr. An, are you a cheap player?

777
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,743
-What?
-Hold on.

778
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,080
So this is how you want to play, Mr. An?

779
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,124
Grab and twist!

780
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:06,757
Straight punch!

781
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:09,844
Get up and punch!

782
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:14,682
I'm thinking about
going all-in on you, Mr. An.

783
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,350
What do you think?

784
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:19,728
Would that be a safe bet?

785
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:20,938
Okay.

786
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,615
Yes! I won again!

787
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:36,829
-I'm really good, aren't I?
-Yes.

788
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,929
Are you worried?

789
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:56,974
A little bit.

790
00:57:57,558 --> 00:58:00,686
I might've turned back had I come alone.

791
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,521
There's no need to worry.

792
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:04,481
After all, your name means "strong."

793
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,569
-I'll be back.
-Just a second.

794
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,196
You forgot something important.

795
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:12,656
Give me your hand.

796
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:15,659
Here.

797
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:18,078
Hey, you found it.

798
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,667
Good luck. I'll be waiting for you.

799
00:58:26,337 --> 00:58:27,963
I'll be right back.

800
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,916
Goodness, you have such a good son-in-law.

801
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:07,086
He's so good to you. He's just like a son.

802
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,088
-Han-deul.
-Hello.

803
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,924
There you are. Why are you so late?
Come sit over here.

804
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,133
Have you been well?

805
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,843
You look even prettier
since getting married.

806
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:19,598
I'm surprised you asked me
to come to your family gathering.

807
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:22,643
Does this mean
you'll give me a break on what I owe?

808
00:59:24,687 --> 00:59:25,854
It's a little late,

809
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:29,191
but I came here to tell you something.

810
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:34,822
I got divorced.

811
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:37,408
Han-deul!

812
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,160
I'm sorry for not telling you sooner.

813
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:42,830
Let me explain.

814
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,581
-What happened was--
-The reason for the divorce…

815
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:48,961
There are so many
that I don't know where to start.

816
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,758
This man had multiple affairs.

817
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:58,262
There was no end to the women he met.

818
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,722
-Why you--
-You…

819
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:01,181
How dare you, Su-in?

820
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:03,934
Oh, my goodness.

821
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:07,646
All of you attended our wedding.

822
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:10,107
You wished me a happy life
after getting married,

823
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:13,110
so I wanted to tell you
I'll live well after getting divorced too.

824
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,071
I'll be just fine.

825
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:27,124
This is a product
that my company is about to launch.

826
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,459
-What is that?
-What is it?

827
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:31,754
Think about it and let me know
if you're interested in signing up.

828
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,425
-What is that?
-Goodness.

829
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:44,725
-Excuse me.
-What in the world?

830
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,483
Have you lost your mind?

831
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,068
Is this why you wanted me here?

832
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,070
No, I wanted you here for this.

833
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:02,785
Damn it.

834
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:05,829
There's your bidet screw.
Take it and get lost.

835
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:08,165
"Get lost"? I ought to just--

836
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,584
Oh, my. I think he's hitting her.

837
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,756
I think the man is hitting the woman.

838
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,133
How can someone be like that?

839
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:19,968
What's the matter with him?

840
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:23,097
-What is he doing in public?
-Shouldn't we say something?

841
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,057
Take a picture of him.

842
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:34,066
Great job, Kang Han-deul!

843
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:38,278
Let's have a good life, Kang Han-deul!

844
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,077
Do you feel better?

845
01:01:45,661 --> 01:01:48,539
Totally. I don't even notice the cold.

846
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:55,003
It reminds me
of the night sky from that day.

847
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:56,672
The day of the meteor shower.

848
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:13,647
What are you thinking about?

849
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,486
This moment is worth treasuring,

850
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,530
so I just want to take everything in.

851
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:24,533
I should do the same

852
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:27,035
since today won't come back
once tomorrow arrives.

853
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:32,374
Is there anything else you want to do?

854
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,378
I'm happy with things
just the way they are.

855
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,610
We haven't heard from Mr. Kim yet, right?

856
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:05,902
Hello.

857
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:09,281
So what have you decided to do?

858
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,951
The final approval review
has been moved up.

859
01:05:13,035 --> 01:05:14,286
What's the status of the rejected cases?

860
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:16,079
-Yes?
-Something's going on with Mr. Na, right?

861
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:18,415
Let's not drag this out and get divorced.

862
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:21,793
CEO? What do you think?

863
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,338
Let's get going.
There's a gift waiting at home.

864
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,507
Since it's raining a lot outside…

865
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:30,093
Do you want to spend the night here?

866
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,851
