1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,711
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,464
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,210
I'm still not used to this office.

4
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:28,714
My stomach was hurting. I'm sorry.

5
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:34,261
Shall we begin the meeting, ma'am?

6
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,807
Ms. Jeon, please feel free to start
whenever you'd like.

7
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,602
Let's begin.

8
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,897
I'd like to develop a big-data based
divorce prediction model.

9
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,566
Big data analysis is
already being used in various fields

10
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,195
to predict traffic accidents, diseases,
and even criminal activity.

11
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,697
As I'm sure you're aware,

12
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:57,326
effectively analyzing data will be
a key factor in determining success.

13
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,871
In order to achieve this,
we need to collect big data.

14
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,248
But…

15
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,505
Unlike traffic accidents and diseases,

16
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,216
we can't consider divorce
as a random event.

17
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,718
If we need to secure support
from relevant departments,

18
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:18,389
shouldn't we first convince people
that divorce is a type of risk

19
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,932
that requires coverage?

20
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:24,728
So you're saying we should come up
with justification for perceiving divorce

21
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,897
-as something requiring insurance?
-No, not at all.

22
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,817
Yes, I think that must take place first

23
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,570
before we start collecting any data.

24
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,029
I like your approach.

25
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,287
We'll establish any justification we need

26
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,747
and focus on collecting
as much data as possible

27
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,708
to help strengthen our rationale.

28
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,877
No, let's establish
the major premise first.

29
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,422
Do we need to establish the major premise
about divorce being insurable

30
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,756
because you're not confident?

31
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,551
Of course, I'm confident.
But it's not visible.

32
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,261
It's why I'm being questioned right now.

33
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,388
That's why I think we need to establish

34
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:03,017
solid justification first
as a way to demonstrate our confidence.

35
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,228
Will you stop already?

36
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,938
We can do that last and still be okay.

37
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:11,859
-We'll focus on expanding our data first.
-Yes, ma'am.

38
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,032
Whether we go with inductive reasoning
or deductive reasoning, it's all the same.

39
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,784
And they're both necessary.

40
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,411
So let's use both methods together.

41
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,121
How does that sound?

42
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,884
First, we need to collect data…

43
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,720
-Oh, my god.
-I'm sorry, ma'am.

44
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,014
I have stomach issues.

45
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:44,808
I'm so sorry!

46
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,521
I'm very sorry.

47
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,858
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
My stomach has been a mess

48
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,444
for the past 35 years
because I worked in sales.

49
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,404
I'll take care of the bad air here.

50
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,781
Let's continue.

51
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,867
We should do both tasks

52
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:04,286
since the details
will be included in the BPPR.

53
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,622
Then let's split into two teams
and carry them out.

54
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,542
Justification is important to you both,
so go and find it.

55
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:14,838
The rest of you will strengthen the data
within your respective roles.

56
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,632
Okay.

57
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,634
-Let's move together.
-Sounds good.

58
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,766
This is the first insurance of its kind,
so we'll probably face legal issues.

59
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,143
-Please go over the legal aspects.
-Yes, ma'am.

60
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:32,106
Like you said, this is
the first insurance policy of its kind,

61
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,150
so the contract law stipulated
by presidential decree may not apply.

62
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,486
Should we request
a legal amendment from the FSC?

63
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,406
No, that will take too long.

64
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:44,451
Please find out if we can qualify
for the financial regulatory sandbox.

65
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,577
Yes, ma'am.

66
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,788
As for risk-related data,

67
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,708
we should determine to what extent
economic losses can be attributed to--

68
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,959
To divorce.

69
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,086
As the risk surveyor,
I'll conduct risk rate verification.

70
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,798
As the quant, you should calculate
insurable interest risk rate suitability.

71
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,761
Then from now on,
you and I will work together.

72
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,555
I didn't mean
that we should work together--

73
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,683
Since we've sorted out the basics,
let's stop here for the day.

74
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,936
-Yes, ma'am.
-Understood.

75
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,646
-Good work.
-Thank you.

76
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,231
ANYONE CAN SIGN UP!
CALL FOR A CONSULTATION RIGHT NOW

77
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,566
Hello, viewers.

78
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:19,611
It must be very confusing
to see all these technical terms.

79
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,073
BPPR is an acronym that stands for

80
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,034
business practices manual,

81
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,161
policy terms and conditions,

82
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,289
premium calculation manual,
and reserve calculation manual,

83
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:33,709
which are all basic insurance documents.

84
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,379
The financial regulatory sandbox

85
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,965
is a system that temporarily exempts

86
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:43,510
or suspends existing regulations

87
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,430
when companies launch
new products and services

88
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,599
in emerging industries
and technology fields.

89
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:52,144
Jeez, my stomach is killing me.

90
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,194
Is it too much to ask
that you be comfortable around me?

91
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,116
It's not like you'll do as I ask anyway.

92
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,161
I was supposed to go to China
as a corporate expat,

93
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,871
but the company setup timeline
got messed up.

94
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,499
I'm heading over there
once I'm done with this project.

95
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,084
That's a relief.

96
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,878
So use your skills
and finish this project quickly.

97
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,421
Then I'll be out of your hair.

98
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,258
Don't worry.
I'll do my best to get it done quickly.

99
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:24,885
Don't tell me

100
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,346
that I make you uncomfortable.

101
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,975
After all this time?
We've been over for so long.

102
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,648
Is that so?

103
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,818
I guess that's a relief.

104
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,195
If you'll excuse me, Ms. Jeon.

105
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,699
Can you ask Mr. An
to meet me in the lobby?

106
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:48,951
Okay.

107
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,670
Jeez, do you feel that chill over there?

108
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,048
What do you think they're talking about?
Are they fighting?

109
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,675
Come on, they're both adults.

110
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,928
Besides, isn't an ex-ex-ex-wife
better than an ex-wife?

111
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,638
It's different, not better.

112
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:11,431
Different? How so?

113
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,393
They're both crap,
but they're different shades of crap.

114
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,107
Oh, that's one brilliant
piece of crap description.

115
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,400
-Perfect, right?
-Yes.

116
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,526
Get in already.

117
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,405
He heard all of that?

118
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,823
He's got really sharp ears.

119
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,118
Hey! Don't touch the button.

120
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,081
I think I was traumatized earlier.

121
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,710
You have workers' comp, right?

122
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,045
Based on a thorough
and objective assessment

123
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,672
of his workload, working conditions,

124
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,383
physical exertion, mental stress,
and other factors,

125
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,010
he wouldn't qualify for coverage.

126
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,262
No, you can establish a causal link
between work and illness

127
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,264
not only through
medical or scientific proof

128
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:56,018
but also through
significant legal and normative causation,

129
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:56,977
so there's a chance.

130
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,522
Then you should know better
than to scare me like that!

131
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:03,692
I didn't know either, sir.
I want to file for workers' comp myself.

132
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,111
You punk. You always have a comeback.

133
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,323
It's not even your ex-wife.

134
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,117
How can your ex-ex-ex-wife be
the senior managing director?

135
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,620
And her name is Jeon Na-rae!
It makes me so nervous.

136
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,414
You're going to drive me
to an early grave.

137
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,208
You have life insurance, right?

138
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,544
Hey.

139
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,340
Is this an opportunity or a crisis?

140
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,633
-A crisis.
-A crisis.

141
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,928
Noh Ki-jun, you listen to me.

142
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,014
This project is a matter of life or death
for our team.

143
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,726
Don't you dare let any weird feelings
get in the way and upset Ms. Jeon, okay?

144
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,853
He's stronger than that. Right, Mr. Noh?

145
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:40,938
Of course, I am.

146
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,149
Ms. Kang, wait at the entrance.
I'll bring the car around.

147
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:45,234
Okay.

148
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,694
It pays to be an actuary, doesn't it?

149
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,447
Top 1% salary, right? You must be rich.

150
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,367
Of course, he is. He's only broke
because he had to pay alimony three times.

151
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:00,916
Meet her in the lobby.

152
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,584
-Meet who?
-Your partner.

153
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,211
-My partner?
-The colorful crap.

154
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,922
It looks like you're the one
who really stepped in the crap, Mr. An.

155
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,006
Hey, what's that?

156
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,258
You bowed to me. Good job.

157
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,468
Watch out. You might slip.

158
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,472
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

159
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,196
Ms. Kang, over here.

160
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:33,615
I'm coming.

161
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,543
It's awesome, right?

162
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,086
It's a novel for sure.

163
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,922
I had a camping expert modify the car
so that I could go camping

164
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,299
whenever I want.

165
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,927
Right. You can show off your car later.

166
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,138
Where should we start first?

167
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,348
Shall we find focus group participants?

168
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,601
There's nothing better
to help us understand client needs

169
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,603
than focus group interviews.

170
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,064
For divorce-related focus groups,

171
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,607
maybe we should go to family court.

172
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,360
Or we could meet a divorce attorney.

173
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,237
We could even see
a couples therapy expert.

174
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,031
Where should we start?

175
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,574
Let's start at a restaurant.

176
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:19,536
We can't think on an empty stomach,
so let's eat first.

177
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,628
Let's go.

178
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,725
Okay. Just leveled up.

179
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,435
I'm done.

180
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,940
Have you been trying
to level up this whole time?

181
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,025
Yes.

182
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,402
Oh, is that so?

183
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,737
Yes.

184
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,659
Then let's check out
what level you're at in terms of work.

185
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:03,080
Take me to the best place
in Korea to collect data.

186
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:05,916
Let's go then.

187
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,093
This parking lot is amazing, right?

188
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,261
We didn't have to come all the way here.

189
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,681
-Do you see an empty spot?
-We'll find one.

190
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,309
Please.

191
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,228
Hey, there's one.

192
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,813
Nice.

193
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,822
That jerk. I got here first.

194
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,532
I got here first!

195
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,158
No, I did.

196
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,119
-Please stop.
-Give me a second.

197
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,704
What are you talking about?
I saw this spot from over there.

198
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,958
This is why you're a failure.

199
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,632
-Why you…
-You say something?

200
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,302
Let's settle this
with rock, paper, scissors.

201
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,472
Deal.

202
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,601
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

203
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,020
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

204
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,525
Did you see that? I won.

205
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,318
Enjoy your meal!

206
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:16,945
Damn it.

207
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,797
Yours first, Ms. Kang.

208
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,383
Thank you.

209
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,802
Do you want green onions?

210
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,101
I hope it's okay I brought you here
to have gomtang soup.

211
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,107
Is there something not okay about it?

212
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,569
Feel free to tell me next time.

213
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,321
Be honest about
what you like or don't like.

214
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,078
From now on, I'd like to avoid
going out when there are crowds.

215
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,247
Got it. What else?

216
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,166
We can adjust things as we go.

217
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,753
It's easy to say
we can adjust things as we go.

218
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,630
But it's better
to establish ground rules first.

219
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,840
Then, I'll let you make
most of the decisions.

220
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,342
I'll just follow along.

221
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,261
All right, then. Now let's eat.

222
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,853
Thank you for winning.

223
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:34,564
You're thankful for that?

224
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,276
That was my ex-husband.

225
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,876
Do you think you can be one in this state?

226
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,506
A smiley nutcase.

227
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,805
"A nutcase who says
whatever she wants with a big smile."

228
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,642
I've come across a few in my time.

229
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,060
But that's not you, Ms. Kang.

230
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,979
But I bet on you earlier.

231
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,565
If you win, I'll succeed.
If you lose, I'll fail.

232
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,192
-Succeed in what?
-Smiley nutcase.

233
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,661
I'm glad I didn't lose, or else…

234
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
I'd have killed you.

235
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,836
It went up my nose.

236
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:45,677
This is the place?

237
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,970
SEUNGJAE PC

238
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,472
Yes.

239
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,531
Not only are there
top-of-the-line computers…

240
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,241
500-MILLION-WON CPU
SUPERCOMPUTER

241
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,457
…you can get coffee for sure.

242
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,209
PREMIUM ITALIAN COFFEE

243
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,922
Enjoy instant noodles…

244
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:26,468
CHEF-PREPARED ASSORTED DISHES

245
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,473
…as well as premium massage chairs.

246
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,643
TRADITIONAL THAI MASSAGE CHAIR

247
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,538
Let's have instant noodles first.

248
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,588
Mr. An, please place an order.
I'll do it next time.

249
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,673
It's reasonable that way.

250
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,598
Where are we going first?

251
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,642
A courthouse? A law firm?

252
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,686
How about if we meet
a psychology professor?

253
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,063
Let's have some coffee first.

254
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,398
Having coffee after a meal is a given.

255
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,316
Aren't we going to work?

256
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,568
Of course, we will.
We'll drink coffee and work.

257
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,112
Is there a place like that?

258
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,782
It's a bit far away
because it's famous for its coffee.

259
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:31,908
And it's pretty quiet.

260
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,578
Let's get going.

261
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,957
-This place was good, right?
-Yes, it was.

262
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,667
NAMJANG TEMPLE
NOAK MOUNTAIN

263
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,585
This is the place.

264
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,588
We're going to drink coffee and work here?

265
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,298
-Yes.
-Are you kidding me?

266
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,482
It's fine.

267
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,124
Hello, Venerable.

268
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,585
We want coffee.

269
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,798
Welcome.

270
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,187
One of our temple members
brought coffee beans.

271
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,272
I hope you like Mandheling.

272
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,357
Yes, I like it.

273
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,943
I low-key dragged her here
because this coffee's the bomb.

274
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,613
It's okay.

275
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:55,200
I even see people chant sutras
as if they're rapping these days.

276
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,371
You two must have been friends.

277
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,333
We were married.

278
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,256
-We've been spitting out all day.
-Right.

279
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,800
May Buddha's compassion be with you.

280
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,596
Now go ahead and tell me.

281
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,348
Why did you come to see me?

282
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,644
She's the wisest person I know.

283
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,063
So what?

284
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,941
She's better
than most psychology professors.

285
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,025
Ask her some questions.

286
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,699
Then give us some space.

287
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,285
She'll feel uncomfortable
talking in front of you.

288
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,291
Goodness,
I have to visit the lavatory.

289
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,180
Venerable, I'm sorry to ask you
such questions.

290
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:02,016
But our team is trying
to create a new insurance product.

291
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,481
That is, a divorce insurance product.

292
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,442
I see.

293
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:14,571
We're looking for justification
to create divorce insurance,

294
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,991
such as why divorce deserves coverage.

295
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,246
-I'm a bit taken aback.
-I'm sure you are.

296
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,009
In my case, fortunately,

297
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,636
my marriage was never unhappy.

298
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,389
-Then why did you--
-Get a divorce?

299
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:49,272
Ever since I was a child,
my views on life have been different.

300
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:53,443
I wanted to leave ordinary society
and pursue a spiritual life.

301
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,447
But I couldn't tell my parents

302
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,407
and I felt conscious
about how others viewed me.

303
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,285
So I ended up giving up
on the life I wanted,

304
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,370
followed a normal career path,

305
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,040
and started a family like everyone else.

306
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,000
Then one day,

307
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:13,129
Ki-jun and I watched a movie
while drinking coffee I made like today.

308
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:19,135
It was a movie called
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.

309
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,804
There's a scene
where Captain Mike tells Benjamin

310
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,932
to live the life he wants

311
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,851
and to live a life that makes him happy.

312
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,023
And Ki-jun told me the same thing.

313
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,025
You see, he already knew.

314
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,403
He knew I wanted a different kind of life.

315
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,533
That's how I decided
to leave ordinary society

316
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,077
and proceeded to get divorced.

317
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,247
So you gained a type of courage in a way.

318
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:50,667
I suppose so.

319
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,294
I gained the courage to face criticism.

320
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,966
People don't criticize
those in pain or in suffering.

321
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,301
But they criticize those who get divorced

322
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,096
even though we do it
because we're in pain.

323
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,101
That's why many people
give up on living a life

324
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,894
that reflects who they are.

325
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,314
And I used to be one of them.

326
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,069
You'll probably face severe criticism

327
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,612
with your divorce insurance.

328
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,241
I'm already aware of that.

329
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,201
But the good thing is,

330
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:30,248
if people are willing to risk criticism
to live true to themselves,

331
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,750
it'll be worth helping them.

332
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,378
Even if it means you'll get criticized.

333
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,223
Hello, is anyone here?

334
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:53,938
Hello, ma'am.

335
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:57,608
I hear you sell sologamy wedding kits.

336
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:02,780
It's called a "I Have Decided
to Be True to Myself" kit.

337
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,157
Did I come to the right place?

338
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,081
Is this it? What's included in the kit?

339
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:15,626
A self-consent form,
a declaration of non-marriage, and a ring.

340
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,713
Great. It's a three-piece set.

341
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:19,839
I'll take it.

342
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,841
-You're holding a sologamy?
-Yes.

343
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,843
Why? You don't have a man to marry?

344
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,431
-Excuse me?
-You can't get married or you won't?

345
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,519
Ma'am, I don't have to tell you that.

346
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,396
I'm not selling it.

347
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,608
-What?
-Your reaction tells me

348
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,901
that you're not ready yet.

349
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,695
But…

350
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,405
I have a conscience, you know.

351
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:47,200
At my age,
I don't sell these kits for the money.

352
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,036
If you just want to get back
wedding gift money, forget it.

353
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,455
Wedding gift money isn't a loan.

354
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,082
It's a form of congratulations.

355
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,753
Ma'am, I don't need this
to hold a sologamy wedding.

356
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,421
Okay then.

357
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:18,189
What the heck?
Why bother selling those kits then?

358
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,112
I REGISTERED YOU WITH A MARRIAGE AGENCY
ANSWER CALLS FROM UNKNOWN NUMBERS

359
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,531
Why are people making a fuss
about my marriage?

360
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,874
We'll be going then.

361
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,793
Thank you for today, Venerable.

362
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,711
I enjoyed our time as well.

363
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:45,466
By the way,
do either of you have plans tonight?

364
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,469
What? Why?

365
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:49,595
No, I don't.

366
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,306
If you don't, stay and watch
the shooting stars before you go.

367
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,559
There's supposed to be
a meteor shower tonight.

368
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,353
It's been 100 years
since the last celestial event.

369
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,899
-What about you, Venerable?
-I don't think so.

370
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:05,528
Unfortunately, I have to attend
an evening prayer service.

371
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,156
Shall we watch it?

372
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,329
The way you hesitate
makes me think that you want to.

373
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,125
Let's watch it, then.

374
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,755
Then I pray that both of you
will stay happy and healthy

375
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,757
and enjoy a life without hardships.

376
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:27,925
Thank you, Venerable.

377
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:31,470
Enjoy partaking in meals,
relieve yourself with ease,

378
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,723
-and rest well.
-Thank you.

379
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:35,808
Goodbye.

380
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:37,977
Let's go.

381
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,038
Are you mad at me?

382
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,627
I'm sorry I didn't tell you beforehand,
but don't take it the wrong way.

383
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,378
This is the first place I visit

384
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,464
before I start any type of project.

385
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,382
She's like a mentor to me.

386
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,176
Your ex-wife is your mentor?

387
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,011
She's my ex-ex-wife.

388
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,391
I'm sure it's difficult to understand.

389
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,393
No.

390
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,522
It's more difficult
because I think I do understand.

391
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,734
What did you two talk about without me?

392
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,328
We'll be working overtime tonight here.

393
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,166
"We will"?

394
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:45,503
What is it?

395
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,172
I'll let it slide this time.

396
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:54,178
But from now on, please ask me
at least 24 business hours in advance.

397
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,473
That sounds reasonable.

398
00:25:58,891 --> 00:25:59,934
Do you approve?

399
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:01,769
I do.

400
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,450
They say lying down is the best way
to watch meteor showers

401
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:19,120
because meteors tend to fall
at different times.

402
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,621
-Really?
-That's what they say.

403
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,456
But I don't know
because I've only heard about it.

404
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,929
We came here on a whim,
so what should we eat?

405
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:38,347
Right.

406
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,353
Did anyone order pizza?

407
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,397
When did you order pizza?

408
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,898
We have this, so…

409
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:54,947
Here you go.

410
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,743
The basil smells amazing.

411
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,995
-I like basil too.
-You do?

412
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,542
-This is pretty good.
-It is.

413
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:46,040
I'm still getting over jet lag.

414
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,750
Let's go get some fresh air.

415
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,508
When was the last time you were in Korea?

416
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,427
I left right after getting divorced,

417
00:27:58,511 --> 00:27:59,720
so it's been a while.

418
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,891
Are you friends with Ki-jun?

419
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,309
We went to elementary school together.

420
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,479
But I don't think I've seen you before.

421
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,732
You probably never saw me
other than at the wedding.

422
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,943
-You never met anyone?
-That's right.

423
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:17,405
This is the first time
I've met any of Ki-jun's friends

424
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,240
other than at the wedding.

425
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,118
But you two were married.

426
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:23,869
Yes.

427
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,872
-But I'm the first friend you've met?
-Yes.

428
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,624
-How is that possible?
-Tell me about it.

429
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,585
But there wasn't any time to meet friends

430
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,839
because we got married after three months
but then got divorced.

431
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:37,258
You two were busy.

432
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:41,220
We got married, but we didn't have time
to register the marriage,

433
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,264
so the divorce was easy.

434
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,849
That's good.

435
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,394
What about you, Mr. An? Are you divorced?

436
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,397
What was the final straw?

437
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,315
It's a long story.

438
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,277
What was the final straw for you?

439
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,403
For me…

440
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,574
-His words.
-"Wolves"?

441
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,492
The ones that howl like this?

442
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,580
Have you heard of The Funeral of Words?

443
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,747
"The Funeral of Wolves"?

444
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,500
It's a children's poem.

445
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:15,129
One day, an insurance agent showed up
to the funeral of dead words.

446
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,007
It must have been an awesome wolf

447
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,010
seeing how it had
insurance coverage and a funeral.

448
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:24,680
I didn't say "wolves" I said "words."

449
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,311
"The word insurance policy
you have taken out

450
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,646
provides a daily allocation of words
that you may use."

451
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,608
"Per the contract, you are allowed
to say exactly ten words."

452
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,861
"However, you are free
to choose the words you wish to say."

453
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,113
-This is a children's poem?
-Yes.

454
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:42,698
That's really creative.

455
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,991
I know, right?

456
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:47,411
Actually, it's why I asked the company
to set up a New Product Development Team.

457
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:50,206
I wanted to create
a unique insurance product,

458
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,832
like word insurance.

459
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:55,085
-It was a turning point in a way.
-I guess so.

460
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:57,421
You must've been hurt by words often.

461
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,131
Or maybe you hurt others.

462
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:05,387
When you think about it,
we didn't register our marriage,

463
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,598
so we just ended everything with words.

464
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,183
Oh, you said "words," not "wolves."

465
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,561
Words are scarier than you think.

466
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,272
They're capable of hurting people

467
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:16,649
or even killing them.

468
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,151
On the other hand,
they can also provide comfort.

469
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:22,029
Ms. Kang, what kind of unique insurance

470
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,948
would you like to create?

471
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,079
I'd like to see an insurance policy

472
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,664
that compensates you with nice words

473
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,958
in case you get injured by bad ones.

474
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,627
If you want a large payout,

475
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,963
you'd have to deposit
plenty of kind words in advance.

476
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,050
Tell me what kind of insurance
you'd like to see.

477
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,094
Pride insurance.

478
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,303
"Pride insurance"?

479
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:50,266
I'll get compensated
if my pride gets hurt or destroyed.

480
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,018
Oh, I see. That's creative.

481
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,228
I want compensation…

482
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,731
in the form of self-esteem.

483
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,199
I want space travel SOS insurance.

484
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:11,537
What's so funny?

485
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,290
It just seems so silly.

486
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,500
What do you mean silly?

487
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,504
Hey, it's almost time. Let's head up.

488
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:21,547
What? Where?

489
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,638
-Please hand me that blanket.
-What?

490
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,391
You said we could see better lying down.

491
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,517
Right.

492
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,603
The green one, please.

493
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,563
I like green.

494
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,847
Do you see the brightest star
way out there?

495
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,977
-Where?
-Way over there.

496
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,065
Over there?

497
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:24,652
Over there.

498
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,118
I see it.

499
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:34,536
Canis Major is there,

500
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,331
and it contains Sirius.

501
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,334
I think of it as Laika,
the dog who wandered in space.

502
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,502
Laika?

503
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:44,963
Laika flew aboard Sputnik 2
and went into orbit,

504
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,758
but she never returned to Earth.

505
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:51,929
Right. You're talking about that Laika.

506
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,806
Even dogs get into accidents in space.

507
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,933
Where's the guarantee that humans won't?

508
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,726
Do you still think
this insurance is silly?

509
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,977
You're right.

510
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,729
You have a point.

511
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,449
We vowed never to cross paths again,

512
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,536
yet here we are eating pizza
and waiting for a meteor shower.

513
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,039
Life is really unpredictable.

514
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,333
It's because life is like a tunnel,
not a cave.

515
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,463
I thought I was hiding inside a cave,

516
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,716
but I eventually found my way out.

517
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,552
It turns out, I was in a tunnel.

518
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:35,347
What's funny is that I thought
I escaped the tunnel

519
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,183
but ended up in another one.

520
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:39,768
What should you do, then?

521
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:41,645
What do you mean?

522
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,357
I mean, when you're in a tunnel.

523
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:51,071
Here's a tip from someone
who escaped three tunnels.

524
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,034
You have to go in first
in order to come out.

525
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,127
Hey, it's starting!

526
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,295
-Lie down.
-Okay.

527
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:15,179
-Look over there.
-I see it now.

528
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,514
It's so pretty.

529
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:20,142
You know, we seem to lie down quite often.

530
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,226
I know, right?

531

DIVORCE INSURANCE
POLICY TERMS AND CONDITIONS (DRAFT 1)

535
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,412
Hello.

536
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:25,374
Oh, my goodness!

537
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,001
We must be totally in sync,
running into each other here at this hour.

538
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,169
I think so too.

539
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,340
If you're here alone
to watch this movie at this hour,

540
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,634
nothing else needs to be said.

541
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:36,802
What are your plans after this?

542
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,641
I thought about going
to the workshop after the movie.

543
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:43,767
Workshop?

544
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,438
I'm free after this.

545
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:50,649
-Mind if I tag along?
-Sorry?

546
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,952
I have old-fashioned taste in things…

547
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:05,747
No, not at all.
I'm actually quite surprised.

548
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:09,001
I didn't know there were
so many cool things we could knit.

549
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,378
That's good to hear.

550
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:15,424
They teach you how to knit
if you buy knitting products from here,

551
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,009
so I'm going to knit a sweater.

552
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,552
A sweater?

553
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,263
For whom? Your boyfriend?

554
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,724
No, it's for me.

555
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,392
For yourself?

556
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:28,604
Knitting is about making clothes
for one special person.

557
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,733
That's why the first thing I knit
will be for myself.

558
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:43,327
I like this one.

559
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:45,913
Do you like green?

560
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,540
-No.
-Then why…

561
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,585
The person I want to knit for likes green.

562
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,631
Green, please. I like green.

563
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,060
I messed up a stitch.

564
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,395
That's the good thing about knitting.

565
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,814
If you make a mistake,
you can unravel it and start over.

566
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,983
I'm glad I caught it early on.

567
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,402
It'd be a disaster
to find a mistake later on.

568
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:20,238
If you think it's waste
to start over and continue to knit,

569
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,782
you'll end up regretting it.

570
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:22,866
So don't dwell on it.

571
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,160
If you find a mistake,
unravel it and start over right away.

572
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,830
It's similar to love, isn't it?

573
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:32,709
Instead of admitting
you made a mistake right away,

574
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,378
you don't and then you regret it.

575
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,008
-You're right.
-If I could knit a whole new life,

576
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,511
I'd choose Ki-jun again.

577
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,432
You still have feelings for Mr. Noh?

578
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:49,309
Yes, I do.

579
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:53,772
But I also know there's almost no chance
of us getting back together.

580
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:57,776
That doesn't mean
I'll get rid of any lingering feelings.

581
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,737
My feelings for Ki-jun
are still showing an upward curve.

582
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,740
You talk about it like it's an investment.

583
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:06,576
There's no reason to cut ties with Ki-jun.

584
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,370
If anything, he's worth investing in.

585
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,415
This is fascinating.

586
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:14,209
Most couples harbor bad feelings
after getting divorced.

587
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,920
That's called having
an inferiority complex.

588
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:23,343
You think I laughed at you?
That's called being insecure.

589
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,599
And don't misinterpret things.

590
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,853
That's called being self-critical.

591
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,322
This looks good.

592
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:47,576
The basic documents
for the product are nearly ready,

593
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,536
so let's present them
at the next executive meeting.

594
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,787
However,

595
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:53,081
to prevent this from being dropped
during the process,

596
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:54,750
we should have safeguards in place.

597
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,544
The compliance team
will probably push back hard

598
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,546
and ask how we can stop divorces
from occurring.

599
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,423
It won't just be the compliance team.

600
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,884
We'll get questions
from all relevant departments.

601
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:07,345
The key issue is
how to lower the divorce rate.

602
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,599
There's a way.

603
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,393
We can provide divorce prevention services
based on the subscription period.

604
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,356
For example, we can give away
free national holiday massages,

605
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,650
housekeeping service coupons,
and couples' retreat packages

606
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,695
based on subscription period
to help ease the divorce rate.

607
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,156
You have a point.

608
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,909
If we help couples
work through their issues,

609
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,619
we can lower the divorce rate.

610
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,120
You're a genius.

611
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:34,289
Nice.

612
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,625
And supporting married couples' hobbies

613
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,001
could be a good idea too.

614
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:41,213
How about providing
couples' counseling services?

615
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,965
Right. There's also
child education consulting.

616
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,550
Many couples split
over kid-related issues.

617
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,511
-That's right.
-Good.

618
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:48,762
Then we'll need Dr. Oh Eun-young.

619
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:55,602
We can't. She's too busy.

620
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:59,773
There are more ways to prevent divorce
than I expected.

621
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,274
Many couples aren't aware of them.

622
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:04,861
Good. Then let's break down
the causes of divorce

623
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:07,989
and include tailored solutions
as policy term services

624
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,617
-or as special provisions.
-Yes, ma'am.

625
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,577
There's still another problem.

626
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,331
How are we going to find
the scammers and gold diggers?

627
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,793
Are we talking about extortion schemes?

628
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,796
Right. What if it's a sham marriage
for an insurance payout?

629
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,841
Or what if one person
takes advantage of the other financially?

630
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,259
Then we'll need a profiler too.

631
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:32,222
Not even accident insurance
can screen for extortion schemes.

632
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,057
It's impossible to predict them.

633
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:36,017
How about if we hire a shaman instead?

634
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,102
Jeez.

635
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,021
If necessary,

636
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:43,733
we'll bring in profilers, shamans,
and even fortune tellers.

637
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,695
To get over all the hurdles
before the product launch,

638
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:50,282
we'll use every possible means
to put safeguards in place for approval

639
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,701
regardless of whether we use them or not.

640
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,077
-Okay.
-Yes, ma'am.

641
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:55,162
All right then.

642
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,497
We'll hire people once we finalize

643
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,207
the reasons for divorce and safeguards.

644
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,750
Now then.

645
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,005
Shall we end today's meeting here, ma'am?

646
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,386
-Mr. Na.
-Yes, Ms. Jeon?

647
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:15,098
Shouldn't our team…

648
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:22,022
have a team dinner sometime?

649
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:31,281
This place is too popular
to make a reservation.

650
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,491
Your skills of persuasion
are amazing, Mr. Na.

651
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:36,620
I was the top insurance agent
in Ssangmun branch.

652
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:37,787
You're the best.

653
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,167
Hey, part-timer kid. Set up the lane

654
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,668
like the way I'm used to.

655
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,088
-Palms up or backs down!
-Palms up or backs down!

656
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,757
-Tilt or turn, form a team!
-Tilt or turn, form a team!

657
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,926
Okay! We're going to win.

658
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,387
Ms. Jeon, don't worry. We've already won.

659
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:55,680
Seriously?

660
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:58,600
-Losing team pays for round two.
-Of course.

661
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,352
Hey, Joh Ah-young.
I hear you're pretty good.

662
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,520
I'm good at everything
except for marriage.

663
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,731
You won't win today.

664
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,234
I'm playing for real today.

665
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:10,320
Go ahead. I know your real bowling skills.

666
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,322
I'm sorry, but it's my first time bowling.

667
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,491
-Really?
-It's my first time too.

668
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,535
Who cares? It's just for fun.

669
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,330
I'll teach you.
You'll pick it up in no time.

670
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,456
Okay.

671
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,960
Ms. Kang, this is
a good ball weight for you.

672
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,086
Come over here.

673
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:35,011
Line up your feet nice and straight.

674
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:36,680
-See these here?
-Yes.

675
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:38,890
-Use these three fingers.
-Three fingers.

676
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:41,559
Put them in, flip the ball over,
and support it.

677
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,020
As you step forward,
swing your right arm back,

678
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:46,773
spread your left arm out,
and follow through.

679
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,233
Through.

680
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,734
Hey, you're doing well.

681
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,612
-What do you think? It's easy, right?
-Yes.

682
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:53,738
What about me?

683
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,619
Ms. Jeon, put your fingers in
like this too.

684
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:02,372
Swing your right arm back,
spread out the left one,

685
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,417
keep your swing straight,
and follow through.

686
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:07,877
This takes me back.

687
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:11,965
Like this?

688
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,343
-Just like this.
-Like this?

689
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:19,222
Is it just me, or are you also picking up
some weird vibes from them?

690
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:22,225
What do you mean? He's just teaching them.

691
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:23,727
This is why people call you old.

692
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,562
Just looking that way
makes me uncomfortable.

693
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:27,897
Why don't you two try throwing now?

694
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:31,234
Spread out your left arm
and follow through.

695
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:37,991
-Aim for the middle.
-With both feet.

696
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,743
Step forward.

697
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,620
Swing your arm back
and then follow through.

698
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:46,708
Holy cow! What was that?

699
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,045
Hey, you're good at this! Awesome!

700
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,381
You're really good! That was a strike!

701
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:55,967
Let's get started!

702
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:59,763
-We got this.
-Good luck.

703
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:00,847
We got this!

704
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,571
Ready.

705
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,739
Go!

706
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:33,838
Nice!

707
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:37,967
-Gosh.
-Yes!

708
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,262
-Let's go!
-Go!

709
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,186
Hey.

710
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,813
-My bad.
-Hey!

711
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,565
Damn it.

712
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,486
I was so close.

713
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:01,157
Why you!

714
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,460
Nice.

715
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:21,803
Excellent.

716
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,313
I knew it!

717
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:35,191
Ms. Jeon, why do you do this?

718
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,904
Ms. Jeon, you've got this!

719
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,242
-Go, Ms. Kang!
-Last one!

720
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:51,791
Let's go!

721
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,899
Hey, didn't we win?

722
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,235
-We won!
-Did you see that?

723
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:20,695
Did you see that?

724
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,157
Great job!

725
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,452
I knew we could do it!

726
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,705
Ms. Jeon.

727
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:34,167
I'm so happy our team lost.

728
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:37,462
Hey, everything's on me tonight!

729
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,838
Drink up!

730
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:45,136
-You began to treat me indifferently
-I know this song.

731
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:49,474
Someone forced their way into my heart
where you used to be

732
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,519
It was hard back then, and I cried a lot

733
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:53,853
It was hard back then

734
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:56,481
Why are they singing a depressing song?

735
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,317
Listen to me, Mr. Na.

736
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,780
What? I can't hear you!

737
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:06,449
I heard that some companies

738
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:08,618
give their employees
who don't believe in marriage

739
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:11,287
a guaranteed base salary

740
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:15,416
and give them five days off too.

741
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,086
Did you say number 105?

742
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:21,548
-It makes me cry
-It makes me cry

743
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:23,633
Number 105!

744
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,343
What did you say?

745
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:26,970
Number 105!

746
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:29,305
The singer's name?

747
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:31,683
No!

748
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,060
Number one hundred

749
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,603
and five!

750
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,438
Okay, I got it!

751
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,734
It's so unfair.

752
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:43,528
When people get married,
they get days off

753
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,697
and wedding gift money as well.

754
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,490
Did you say you want to play soccer?

755
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:49,450
Do you want to sing a wedding song?

756
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:50,660
She wants a wedding song.

757
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:51,828
I found one!

758
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,288
Reserve it if you want to sing.

759
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:54,372
You think I stink?

760
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,873
You stink!

761
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,166
You want me to sing?

762
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,301
Nice, Ms. Kang.

763
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,512
-Hey, who turned it off?
-Damn it!

764
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:11,472
I'm so sorry!

765
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,100
I was trying to get the next song ready.

766
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,727
SHINTOBULI

767
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,186
Hey, that's my go-to karaoke song!

768
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,855
How did you know?

769
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,231
Did you turn it off, old man?

770
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:22,609
Hey, you punk!
You can't call our team leader "old man"!

771
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:25,361
-I'm sorry, sir!
-No, you're right. I'm an old man.

772
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:26,779
I'm sorry, Mr. Na--

773
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:29,157
-Stop screaming in my ear, you bastard!
-I'm sorry, sir!

774
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,491
Stop yelling in my ear!

775
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:32,744
-I need encouragement too!
-Ms. Joh?

776
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,954
You want some encouragement?

777
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:37,373
-I want it too!
-I'll give you encouragement!

778
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:42,045
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

779
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:45,423
-Who am I?
-Who am I?

780
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,595
I sang way too much.

781
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:53,723
-My throat is killing me.
-Let's go another round.

782
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:57,810
We need to drink more.

783
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,313
I have to catch the subway now,

784
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:01,939
so if you'll excuse me…

785
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:03,399
-Okay.
-See you.

786
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:04,776
Get home safely. Bye!

787
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:11,574
Is it coming or not?

788
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:14,702
Ms. Jeon, your car is here.

789
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,875
-It's almost here.
-Thank you.

790
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:24,337
Goodbye, Ms. Jeon.

791
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,630
Mr. An, ride in my car.

792
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:30,051
I'll drop you off.
We're going the same way, right?

793
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,512
Yes, I guess so.

794
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:38,351
Go ahead. Ms. Kang and I will take a taxi.

795
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,520
Okay, then.

796
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,690
Take care and don't be late tomorrow.

797
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:45,441
Take care, Ms. Jeon!

798
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:48,111
Driver, take her to Sinsa-dong!

799
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,779
-She's a lady who lives in Sinsa-dong!
-Be careful.

800
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:51,447
Jeez.

801
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:54,242
It should be here any minute now.

802
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:59,747
-There it is. That's our taxi.
-Right.

803
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,083
Did you call this taxi?

804
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,334
-Yes. Get in, Ms. Kang.
-Okay.

805
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,628
Are you two leaving together?

806
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:07,338
We live in the same apartment complex.

807
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:13,136
Mr. Na, I heard today
is our company's Married Couples' Day.

808
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,680
-We have a day like that?
-Yes.

809
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:19,684
So make sure to buy something
on your way home.

810
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:23,646
The company should give out
gift certificates, then!

811
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,899
Don't become
the first divorce insurance beneficiary.

812
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:29,569
-Be good to your wife.
-Why, damn it.

813
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,112
Aren't you tired of eating gomtang soup?

814
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,030
It doesn't have to be special.

815
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,074
I'm sure she'll love it.

816
00:50:35,158 --> 00:50:37,034
Okay, I'll get her something.

817
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:38,828
-Go home now.
-Goodbye, sir.

818
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:40,413
-Goodbye, sir.
-Goodbye.

819
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:43,458
Driver, take them to Ichon-dong.

820
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:44,834
-Take care, sir.
-Okay.

821
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,377
Off you go!

822
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:55,762
Honey?

823
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:58,014
Are you home?

824
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:01,726
You didn't get as tanned as I thought.

825
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,519
How was your trip to Africa?

826
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:04,896
Did you drink?

827
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,606
Just a tiny bit.

828
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:09,650
We had a team dinner tonight.

829
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,027
Did you pay for it?

830
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,490
Right. This is for you.

831
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:21,037
Tofu?

832
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,248
They say today is

833
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:28,002
Marinated Tofu Day.

834
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:38,679
What's wrong?

835
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,974
The tofu is fine.

836
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:45,353
Honey, I ate all the gomtang soup!

837
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:51,567
Ladies and gentlemen,
the key part to focus on

838
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:53,027
is right here!

839
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,863
Compared to last year,
the number of marriages

840
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:58,908
have increased by 1%,
which is about 2,000 cases!

841
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:01,118
Now let's take a look
at the divorce rate.

842
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:04,539
It has decreased by 0.9%,
which is around 800 cases.

843
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,458
This graph shows marriage
and divorce rates in our country.

844
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:09,126
Do you think they'll approve it?

845
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,379
If it gets rejected here,
we'll have to start over

846
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,130
and take a different approach, right?

847
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:14,799
It's better to drop it
if that's the case.

848
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,095
Mr. An, about this claim…

849
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:21,639
We're not dropping anything.

850
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,976
I'm sure Ms. Jeon
will make something happen.

851
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,477
For four years…

852
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:28,271
Thank you for listening.

853
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:32,608
This concludes our presentation
on divorce insurance products.

854
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:33,776
Thank you.

855
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:37,780
We just need a little support from you.

856
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:40,324
Take care and thank you!

857
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:42,076
Please help us this once!

858
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,371
Take care and thank you!

859
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,999
-My throat is killing me.
-How did it go?

860
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,293
-Jeez, my throat.
-Here's some water.

861
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:53,713
-Good job, old man.
-Don't use a rag, you idiot.

862
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,553
It technically got approved.

863
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:04,140
-But it received conditional approval.
-What?

864
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:07,518
After we run a six-month pilot case,
and if the conditions are met,

865
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:09,854
we'll refine it
before officially launching it.

866
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,272
What are the conditions?

867
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:15,192
Do I really have to report
every detail to my subordinates?

868
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:19,614
We can't work if we don't know.

869
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,365
I'm exhausted.

870
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:22,658
I'll tell you.

871
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:25,411
Ms. Jeon, please sit here.

872
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:28,289
Thirty policies must be purchased
within three days.

873
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,918
And the divorce rate
during the six-month contract term

874
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:33,878
must be zero percent.

875
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:40,635
-But…
-Look.

876
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:44,764
They want to see how feasible
the divorce prevention measures are.

877
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:47,725
Those are the conditions?
And not the goal?

878
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:52,229
Talk about zero feasibility.

879
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:54,523
They're implying we won't get approval.

880
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:55,608
I agree.

881
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,777
Everyone needs to stop being so negative.

882
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,197
The company probably wants to apply
to the FSS for approval

883
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,158
to sell it under those conditions
for a limited time.

884
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,203
The part about selling 30 policies
in 3 days won't be easy.

885
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,163
You'd have to be a top insurance agent.

886
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,416
It's the only way
we can officially launch it.

887
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,709
You're right.

888
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,631
Now what, Mr. Noh?

889
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,174
Do you think we can do this?

890
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:23,260
If it doesn't work out, we're all screwed…

891
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,098
I'm sorry.

892
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,643
We're all doomed.

893
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,854
I don't know. Do you want to drop it now
while the damage is minimal?

894
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:36,941
No, sir.

895
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:39,610
We can do this. I know we can!

896
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:41,696
Okay.

897
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,614
We can do this, right?

898
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:45,157
Just a moment, Ms. Jeon!

899
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:47,243
Ms. Jeon!

900
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,079
-What was that?
-I don't know.

901
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,332
SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

902
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,379
How did it go? How's everyone looking?

903
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:02,049
Mr. Noh is always full of energy,
so I'm sure he'll pull it off.

904
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:05,469
It's good news for us if he does.

905
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:08,347
Or is it good news for you, Ms. Jeon?

906
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:10,850
The executive vice president
of Plus General Insurance China

907
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:13,602
who launched
the first-ever divorce insurance,

908
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:15,187
Ms. Jeon Na-rae.

909
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:17,606
How does that title sound?

910
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,483
It sounds good.

911
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,570
Be meticulous until the very end

912
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:25,865
and make sure to start off well
in China, okay?

913
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,033
Of course, sir.

914
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,706
No. If we go there,
it'll increase the divorce rate.

915
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,876
Contract rates and divorce rates.
Let's think about this.

916
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,046
Somewhere that boosts the contract rate
but lowers the divorce rate.

917
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:41,422
We need to find a place like that.

918
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,508
Hey, Mr. Actuary.

919
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:46,385
Don't you see the dilemma here?

920
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:49,180
If the contract rate goes up,
so will the divorce rate.

921
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:51,015
I know that.

922
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:54,185
Hey, Noh Ki-jun.

923
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:56,270
Hey, Noh Ki-jun.

924
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,856
Will you sit down already?
You're driving me crazy.

925
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:01,776
I thought you had a plan.

926
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,152
Where could it be?

927
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,280
Where is it?

928
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:08,741
Where?

929
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:12,995
Damn it, you punk!

930
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:17,666
There's only one place…

931
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:21,545
that can solve this dilemma.

932
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:30,137
BEST WEDDING FAIR

933
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:34,892
You're insane.

934
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,311
Are we really selling
divorce insurance here?

935
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:41,398
Why not a wedding hall instead?

936
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:42,817
The contract rate is too low.

937
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,985
Then what about family court?

938
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,404
It'll increase the divorce rate.

939
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:49,406
Then why did you choose a wedding fair?

940
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:53,160
Everyone experiences pre-wedding jitters
while preparing for a wedding.

941
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:55,663
It's the anxious feeling you get
as you wonder if this marriage

942
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:56,956
is really right for you.

943
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:00,167
We're targeting those mixed feelings.

944
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:01,919
It's like selling
refrigerators at the North Pole.

945
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:04,088
Refrigerators are
a must-have at the North Pole.

946
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,298
If you leave food outside,
it'll freeze completely.

947
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:09,593
You need a refrigerator
to keep something refrigerated.

948
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:15,266
Get rid of the notion that refrigerators
are useless at the North Pole.

949
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:17,685
Let's go.

950
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:41,041
This policy covers both living expenses
and court-mandated alimony payments

951
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,918
after the divorce.

952
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:44,628
-Are you crazy?
-How can you say that?

953
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:51,886
Excuse me!

954
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:56,682
I'm here to talk about divorce insurance.

955
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:02,521
I couldn't ask earlier
because there were too many people.

956
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:10,237
You said wedding prep and divorce prep
go hand in hand, right?

957
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:14,575
It sounds like you're saying that marriage
ultimately leads to unhappiness.

958
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,076
-Right?
-No.

959
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,203
No?

960
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:19,663
I meant the exact opposite.

961
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:20,831
Come on.

962
00:58:20,915 --> 00:58:23,834
Don't you mean that marriage and divorce
are exact opposites?

963
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:26,045
No. Marriage and divorce are the same.

964
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:30,049
They're the same?

965
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:33,177
The purpose of both marriage and divorce
is to find happiness.

966
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:38,724
Can I sign up
for divorce insurance right now?

967
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:40,267
-Yes.
-Of course.

968
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:42,061
-Please come this way.
-It's good you came.

969
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:43,646
Shall we?

970
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,147
Take your time and read it.

971
00:58:45,231 --> 00:58:49,235
As long as you're not having an affair,
you can sign up at any time.

972
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:50,402
See?

973
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:55,157
Let's go out there one more time.

974
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,701
Excuse me.

975
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,454
Can I get a consult?

976
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,207
Yes, of course. Right this way.

977
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,458
-Thank you.
-Of course.

978
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,709
Please drink this.

979
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,712
-Thank you.
-Here's the basic information.

980
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:15,928
My daughter is getting married soon,

981
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:19,181
but I know from experience
that it isn't easy.

982
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:20,266
Yes, of course.

983
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:22,977
I know I shouldn't say this as a mother,

984
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,230
but I want take out
a divorce insurance policy for her.

985
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,940
I can do that, right?

986
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:29,900
-Yes, of course.
-Please sit here.

987
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:31,652
-Can you explain it to me?
-Yes.

988
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,779
You want to take out
a divorce insurance policy for your son?

989
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:37,533
My son is getting married soon and…

990
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:41,578
-You!
-You!

991
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:46,542
-"You"?
-"You"?

992
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:50,963
-They are in-laws?
-They are in-laws?

993
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:59,972
SPECIAL THANKS TO PARK YOUNG-KYU
AND CHO BO-AH FOR THEIR GUEST APPEARANCES

994
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:28,709
So let's hear it.

995
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,211
Did Mr. Noh's
pre-wedding jitters strategy work?

996
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:32,379
On hold?

997
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:35,466
A high contract rate
doesn't guarantee a high profit rate.

998
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,885
So how do you plan to boost

999
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,636
both the contract rate and profit rate?

1000
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,598
Just don't leave me on unread.
It drives me insane.

1001
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,308
Early morning calls mean it's a woman.

1002
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:46,143
What is it? Why are you nervous?

1003
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:50,481
I'm worried we meddled with people
who were doing just fine.

1004
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:52,358
Would you like to go with me?
To the wedding.

1005
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:55,194
We need to make sure
it goes off without a hitch.

1006
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:01,116
