00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,753
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,505
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,221
Wait a second.

00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,656
EPISODE 3

5
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,046
Good morning!

6
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,557
ALARM QUESTION

7
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,160
Why are you here, you filth?

8
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,787
I could ask you the same thing!

9
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:44,123
This is my bed, Wuss-man!

10
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,875
I offered to take the sofa,
but you said to sleep here

11
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,793
to avoid making the ladies uncomfortable!

12
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,507
Do you remember now?

13
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,969
After putting on
that whole gentleman act…

14
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,599
Hey, you said you'd sleep on the floor!

15
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,393
-I was sleeping on the floor, but…
-But?

16
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,644
It was too hard.

17
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,521
-What do you mean it was hard?
-I couldn't help it.

18
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:08,981
What's going on?

19
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:09,940
Oh, my.

20
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,362
Hey.

21
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:16,530
Noh Ki-jun…

22
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:25,164
-What is he doing?
-I don't know.

23
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,543
I have to guess the correct answer
to turn off the alarm.

24
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,587
Without this alarm setting,
I'll sleep through it.

25
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,340
Jeez, look at that.

26
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,258
He has to calculate
the exponential mortality APV.

27
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:37,468
How impressive.

28
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,428
EXPECTED PRESENT VALUE
OF FUTURE INSURANCE BENEFITS

29
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,096
CALCULATED ASSUMING MORTALITY
FOLLOWS EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION

30
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,181
Hurry up, please.

31
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,223
22 MILLION WON

32
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,391
Got it!

33
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,978
Damn it. You actually strangled me?

34
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,149
You actually strangled me?

35
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,300
Ki-jun, what happened yesterday?

36
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,678
I'll tell you in there.

37
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,596
Don't worry.
We came up with a countermeasure.

38
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,057
What countermeasure? Ms. Kang!

39
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:30,604
Did they stay up all night together?

40
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:31,772
We didn't stay up. We slept.

41
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,816
-In the same bed at that.
-The same bed?

42
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:49,415
Why would they come up
with a countermeasure in the same bed?

43
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,961
APPLICATION FORM

44
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,755
Ms. Jeon,
it seems like our idea was a homerun.

45
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,299
This is amazing.

46
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,468
Look how many contracts there are!

47
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:12,896
Wait a minute.

48
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,067
Why are all of these on hold?

49
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,403
ON HOLD

50
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,238
-Well?
-Excuse me?

51
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,531
That can't be right.

52
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,785
You're right. They're all on hold.

53
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,371
Why are they on hold?

54
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,290
Tell me why!

55
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,668
There's a valid reason.

56
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,253
I suggested it.

57
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,631
-You, Ms. Kang?
-Yes, sir.

58
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,925
It was my idea to put them on hold.

59
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,012
We need every contract we can get.

60
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,638
Why are they on hold?

61
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:47,973
Please explain yourself.

62
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,600
Or should I say

63
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,269
please justify yourself?

64
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,651
I want to take out
a divorce insurance policy for her.

65
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,612
I can do that as her mother, right?

66
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,405
-Yes, of course.
-Please sit here.

67
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:05,032
-Can you explain it to me?
-Yes.

68
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,201
You want to take out
a divorce insurance policy for your son?

69
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,996
My son is getting married soon and…

70
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,250
-You!
-You!

71
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,795
How could you do this
when the wedding is only a week away?

72
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,129
Divorce insurance?

73
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,341
Excuse me, ma'am,
I'm not the only one here, am I?

74
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,677
You actually came here before I did.

75
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,640
I'm only here because I heard
there was a sale on massage chairs

76
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,100
in case they needed more household goods.

77
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,270
I was trying to provide more for them.

78
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,397
I came here to look
at bridal jewelry myself

79
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,442
because I thought
my dear daughter-in-law needed more!

80
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,947
If you care so much about my daughter,

81
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,074
why are you taking out divorce insurance?

82
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,536
Would you rather have her
bury her bones in our home?

83
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,871
The world has changed too much
for such notions.

84
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:53,997
That's my point.

85
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,999
Sometimes, life leads to divorce.

86
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,168
Marriage shouldn't feel like shackles.

87
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,839
You're so right, ma'am.

88
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,763
You can't live with someone
if you're not compatible with them.

89
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,348
That's what I'm saying.

90
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,600
You never know what might happen.

91
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,894
Exactly.

92
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,397
So let's take out this insurance policy.

93
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,649
Yes, let's do that.

94
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,734
Let's take a seat, then.

95
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,157
Please make sure

96
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,367
the contract terms are exactly the same

97
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,786
for both of our children.

98
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,955
They'll pay the same amount
and get the same payout.

99
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,750
If the terms are the same for both,
that's definitely possible.

100
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,087
Did you hear that?
The terms just need to be the same.

101
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:45,048
Yes, I heard. Please go ahead and proceed.

102
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,385
We'll have to ask a few questions
to confirm the terms.

103
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,513
Do you want them to visit during holidays?

104
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,639
-No.
-Yes.

105
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,228
-What did you say?
-What did you say?

106
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,397
-Please, don't…
-Are you serious?

107
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,442
Please come quickly.

108
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,032
What are you doing here? Tell me.

109
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,450
This line is for divorce insurance.

110
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,785
-Then why are you here?
-I followed you here.

111
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,205
Did you come to get divorce insurance
instead of wedding invitations?

112
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,206
What about you?

113
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,708
If you want to get married,
we're getting divorce insurance first.

114
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,793
I guess this was a success at any rate.

115
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,129
Yes, it's starting to pick up now.

116
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,173
Mission accomplished.

117
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,967
No, this isn't right.

118
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,135
It's not right at all.

119
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,055
It'll end up in divorce.

120
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,557
Even if they sign up,
it'll result in a loss.

121
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:36,725
You're right.

122
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,311
A divorce means
we have to provide a payout.

123
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,104
By the look of things,
everyone will get divorced.

124
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,899
But if we don't do this,
how will we meet our quota?

125
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,692
But if we do, it'll result in a loss.

126
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,736
What should we do?

127
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,157
We need to put
all of these people on hold.

128
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,912
We have to determine their eligibility
after thoroughly vetting them.

129
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,330
Otherwise…

130
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,377
this insurance will fail even if it sells.

131
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,128
We don't have enough time.

132
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,006
It's impossible to create
underwriting provisions within three days.

133
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,803
Can we do this in three days?

134
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,722
We can't.

135
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:25,357
Just don't get married at all.

136
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,776
What?

137
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,487
Why bother getting married
if you don't trust each other?

138
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,241
Are all of you scheming
to get married for the payout?

139
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,617
-Scheming?
-How dare you say that?

140
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,453
Hold on a second.

141
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,206
-Did I upset you?
-Yes.

142
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,835
Then come and get assessed.

143
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,587
We need to know
how unfit you are for marriage.

144
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,672
What nonsense is that?

145
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,134
-Jerk.
-Seriously?

146
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,677
Are you kidding me?

147
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,304
Get out of here.

148
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,306
How many teddy bears did they give out,
damn it!

149
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,515
Is he insane?

150
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,476
-Seriously?
-What are you talking about?

151
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,729
So you decided to put
everything on hold instead?

152
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,731
You should've gotten them
to sign up first.

153
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,692
Will you take responsibility
if this project fails, Ms. Kang?

154
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,569
That's a bit much, Mr. Na.

155
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,322
A high contract rate
doesn't guarantee a high profit rate.

156
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,906
I already know that!

157
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,201
Where do you get off trying to lecture me?

158
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,121
I was a top insurance agent.
Didn't you tell her?

159
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,039
Of course, I did.

160
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,249
Don't tell a chef how to cook,
and listen to me.

161
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,377
We need to meet the contract rate first

162
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,796
before we can do anything else.

163
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,089
Do you understand?

164
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,634
But Ms. Kang isn't wrong.

165
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,973
Contracts with high divorce probability
cause losses for us.

166
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,189
You're so right, Ms. Jeon.

167
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,025
But then

168
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,236
how do you plan to boost

169
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,530
both the contract rate and profit rate?

170
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:59,076
We'll calculate the divorce risk rate
through vetting prior to sign-up.

171
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,744
Based on the divorce risk rate,

172
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,247
we'll assess and apply a surcharge
to the premium and minimize our losses.

173
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,666
I understand your intent.

174
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,584
However,

175
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:12,297
we don't have enough skilled underwriters
who can review and evaluate

176
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:15,425
such complicated
and extensive terms and conditions.

177
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,887
We'll need to supplement that pool
for a single insurance product.

178
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,472
But is that the right thing to do?

179
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:22,933
Of course not.

180
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,562
Then what do you propose?

181
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,907
We'll conduct AI-based pre-underwriting.

182
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,995
If we use an AI tool

183
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,372
to analyze the first round
of underwriting,

184
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,706
we have enough people here

185
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,708
to conduct in-person interviews afterward.

186
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,503
When did you plan all this?

187
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,297
We handed over
parsing data to tech support.

188
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,091
And the test is this afternoon.

189
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,093
You need to be there, Mr. Na.

190
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,177
Why?

191
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,139
Because you're the only married person
in our group.

192
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,434
Jeez.

193
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,227
Okay then.

194
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,939
A unique insurance product
along with innovative underwriters.

195
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,608
It's a solid concept.

196
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,111
I look forward to it.

197
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,201
Will you be joining the test, Ms. Jeon?

198
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,705
No, I think we have more than enough
divorcés for the sample tests.

199
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,797
I'm not just a divorced person.
I'm a multi-divorced person.

200
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,467
Good for you.

201
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,510
This concludes our meeting.

202
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,526
Han-deul, you were amazing today.

203
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,905
I just said what I had to say, that's all.

204
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,532
That's not easy to do.

205
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,243
Most people would back out
the moment responsibility comes into play.

206
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,080
To be honest, I was really nervous.

207
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,420
By the way, why did we sleep at his place
when your house was closer?

208
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,505
That was so weird.

209
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,512
Done!

210
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,891
I sent all the underwriting documents.

211
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,395
Now let's figure out what to include
in the special provisions.

212
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,480
Right now?

213
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,606
Yes.

214
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,150
It's midnight. How about a break first?

215
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,153
Let's do that then.

216
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,072
-Is anyone hungry?
-Yes.

217
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,493
Hey, you ate two boxes of these.

218
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,537
Are you training for competitive eating?

219
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:51,915
What do we have to eat?

220
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,753
-Can I have this?
-Of course.

221
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,754
King Shrimp.

222
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,130
-Do you have a plate?
-I like that one.

223
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,674
Yes, of course.

224
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,350
Han-deul, can I crash at your place
and go to work from there?

225
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:11,935
You don't mind, right?

226
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,773
Oh, the thing is…

227
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,444
Is something going on at home?

228
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,780
No.

229
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,992
Obviously there is, seeing how you were
dragging a mattress out late at night.

230
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,289
I have a guest room,
so let's have a drink after the meeting.

231
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,748
I can just stay with Han-deul.

232
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,375
Her place, my place, same difference.

233
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,002
How about some chicken and beer? Who's in?

234
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,253
-I'm in.
-I'm in.

235
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,504
Sounds good.

236
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:48,179
By the way, I saw Mr. Noh
when I was heading to the bathroom.

237
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,347
But guess what?

238
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,850
Please take it easy on the drinks,

239
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,226
or at least eat food with them.

240
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,395
Oh, and please check your texts.

241
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,273
Just don't leave me on unread.
It drives me insane.

242
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,983
Seriously.

243
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,903
And don't skip
your hair appointment this weekend.

244
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,947
Okay? I'll take drastic measures

245
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,991
if you don't go again.

246
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,912
Now stop drinking and go to sleep, okay?

247
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,124
Early morning calls
mean it's a woman, right?

248
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,084
I'm not sure.

249
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,628
I'm sure he has a girlfriend.

250
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,880
He's both talented
and good-looking, right?

251
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:23,923
You're right.

252
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,635
In any case, he's pretty amazing.

253
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,562
This looks good.

254
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,074
You have to take big bites like me
to really taste the cheese.

255
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,409
There's so much cheese
that it's good however you eat it.

256
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,290
Right, I almost forgot.

257
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,502
I forgot to download this app.

258
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,839
-What app?
-An ovulation tracking app.

259
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,885
-"Ovulation"?
-It'll be a special provision.

260
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,387
Are you sure it's not a new girlfriend?

261
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,223
Regardless of whether you want kids,

262
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,226
it's important for a couple
to keep track of ovulation days.

263
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,437
But wait a minute…

264
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,232
Do you know anyone's menstrual cycle?

265
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,067
Of course not. You?

266
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,653
Just give me a random date.

267
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,906
November 23rd.

268
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,032
What day is that?

269
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,575
My monthly sneaker-washing day.

270
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,416
It's as important to me
as a married couple wanting kids.

271
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,340
This is why they say you shouldn't try
to mend fences with ex-friends.

272
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,384
-Who said that?
-Schopenhauer.

273
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,096
They say you can tell what kind of person
someone is by their shoes.

274
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,055
Who said that?

275
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,223
Cleantopia.

276
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,731
Hey, what the heck was that?

277
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,692
Well, it's just an app notification.

278
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,783
Goodness, AI-based underwriting?

279
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,745
Why am I so nervous about this?

280
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,414
I know. I've heard about it
but never done it myself before.

281
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,252
That's so cute.

282
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,129
It's adorable.

283
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,840
-So this thing talks?
-Yes.

284
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:29,799
That's amazing.

285
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,553
So this is what this AI thing looks like.

286
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,847
-They say it's really smart.
-Yes, of course.

287
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,100
What's 25,483,529 times 3.7 trillion?

288
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,852
-Hi there.
-Answer me.

289
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:41,811
Say something.

290
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,104
"Hello."

291
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,899
It's just for show.
I brought it to make things less awkward.

292
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,526
The real deal is this right here.

293
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,154
It's nice all the same. Go to sleep now.

294
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,447
Just talk into the mic.

295
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,782
When you answer a question,

296
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:58,453
the premium amount changes on the monitor,
and the data will save automatically.

297
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,038
Ultimately,

298
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,957
we can determine if the person
is a good fit for the insurance policy.

299
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,377
Good. This looks impressive.

300
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:09,923
We'll now begin taking
type-based tests one person at a time.

301
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,716
Mr. Na is our married person.

302
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,926
Ms. Joh is our single person.

303
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,594
Mr. An is our divorced person.

304
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,931
And Mr. Noh can take
the multi-divorced person test.

305
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:18,848
-Got it.
-Got it.

306
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,100
Wait, then what about remarried people?

307
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:25,104
Mr. Oh Jeong-do from Development Team 1
will take the test in writing.

308
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,689
Oh Jeong-do? That jerk?

309
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,274
I don't know who told him,

310
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,235
but he heard about this
and offered to help.

311
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:34,155
He's as selfish as Scrooge.
What's gotten into him?

312
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,615
But don't trust everything he says.

313
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,535
He's never once genuinely helped anyone.

314
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,578
Do you know why his name is Oh Jeong-do?

315
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,872
Like his name,
he only helps five out of ten times.

316
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,457
-You're right.
-It's never ten.

317
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,800
In any case, he's quite happy now that
he's in a rosy marriage.

318
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:54,926
He even wears pink shirts.

319
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,971
That's embarrassing.
Who wears pink at our age?

320
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,431
-He talks differently too.
-Really?

321
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,892
-He's very sweet now.
-Seriously?

322
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,229
This is the first round of underwriting
based on the policyholder's conditions,

323
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:11,025
so I ask that you answer every question
without opting out.

324
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,443
-Got it.
-Okay.

325
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,445
Who wants to start?

326
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:21,744
I'll go first.

327
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,498
All right. Let's start!

328
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,252
On average, how often do you
and your spouse have sexual relations?

329
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,421
Jeez, this is pretty tough from the start.

330
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,549
ON AVERAGE, HOW OFTEN DO YOU
AND YOUR SPOUSE HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS?

331
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:38,511
(1) DAILY (2) WEEKLY (3) MONTHLY
(4) YEARLY (5) NONE

332
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:39,762
Number five.

333
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,222
(5) NONE

334
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,308
MARRIED PERSON TYPE

335
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:47,979
How many times have you dined
with your spouse in the past month?

336
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,233
(4) MORE THAN ONE MEAL A MONTH
(5) DON'T REMEMBER

337
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,068
Number five.

338
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:59,240
Which of the following is
the biggest reason for divorce?

339
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,200
Number five.

340
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,411
(5) NO REASON

341
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,123
Five…

342
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,876
Number five!

343
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,544
Number five!

344
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,587
Number five!

345
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,340
Please choose your view on remarriage.

346
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,633
(1) DEFINITELY WILL
(2) DOESN'T MATTER

347
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,717
(3) WON'T
(4) DEFINITELY WON'T

348
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,635
Number two.

349
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:20,970
Number four.

350
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,180
(4) DEFINITELY WON'T

351
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,264
I mean…

352
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,100
(5) I WILL LEAVE IT TO FATE

353
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,604
DIVORCED PERSON TYPE

354
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,191
Please fill in the blanks.
"I choose OO over marriage."

355
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,233
I choose

356
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,861
freedom, of course. Number three.

357
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:37,987
WHY DIDN'T YOU GET MARRIED?

358
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,405
(4) I WANT MY OWN PERSONAL LIFE AND CAREER

359
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,990
DIVORCED PERSON TYPE

360
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,285
Which of the following
has improved the most after divorce?

361
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,040
(1) EMOTIONAL INDEPENDENCE
(2) SECURING PERSONAL TIME

362
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,793
(3) PARENTING (4) FINANCIAL SITUATION
(5) NEW RELATIONSHIPS

363
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,503
(2) SECURING PERSONAL TIME

364
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,590
If you were to get married or remarried,
why would you?

365
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,258
(5) FOR STABILITY

366
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,678
Number five. No, wait.

367
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,305
(1) BECAUSE I'VE FOUND SOMEONE I LOVE

368
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,640
(4) TO HAVE CHILDREN

369
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,727
(3) BECAUSE I FEEL LONELY AT NIGHT

370
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,729
WARNING
HIGH-RISK GROUP

371
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,606
My fatty liver score is at high risk!

372
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,400
I'm at high risk for diabetes too!

373
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,444
How am I at high risk for divorce
on top of that?

374
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:19,612
Let's get up.

375
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,031
It's okay.

376
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,326
What is the hardest part
of being a multi-divorced person?

377
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,537
(4) FEAR OF MEETING PEOPLE
(5) DIVORCE PROCESS

378
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,663
Number four.

379
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,791
Would you divorce again after remarriage?

380
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,001
(3) YES, IF MY PARTNER WANTS TO

381
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:33,918
Number three.

382
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:38,840
If you were to remarry,
what would you look for in a partner?

383
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,342
(5) LIFESTYLE

384
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,811
WHAT DO YOU THINK LED YOU
TO BECOME A MULTI-DIVORCED PERSON?

385
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,312
(1) CARELESS CHOICES (2) IMPATIENCE
(3) TRAUMA

386
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,148
(4) FINANCES
(5) PERSONALITY DIFFERENCES

387
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,170
Jin-ju?

388
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,338
When did you get here?

389
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,264
Why didn't you wake me up?

390
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,726
It's the weekend,
so I wanted you to sleep in.

391
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,812
I have the nicest sister.

392
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,774
-Where's Un-hyeong?
-At home.

393
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:41,027
He should've come. I bought a new game.

394
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,944
Give me your phone.

395
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,408
What? You don't want to wake him up?

396
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,869
He worked late last night,
so he's probably tired.

397
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,538
Tell him to come by this evening then.

398
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,668
Should I get divorced?

399
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,342
What?

400
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:06,803
I want to get divorced.

401
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,351
Where is this divorce talk coming from?

402
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,563
What is it?
Is he in trouble or something?

403
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,402
-I…
-Yes?

404
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,571
I'm not happy.

405
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:28,449
-What?
-I said I'm not happy.

406
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:30,576
Oh, come on.

407
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,705
Jeez, I thought
something serious had happened.

408
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:37,458
How many people in the world
do you think are happily married?

409
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,460
You had me worried for a second.

410
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,300
As far as I know,
Un-hyeong is hardworking and responsible.

411
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:47,218
Am I wrong?

412
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,636
No, you're right.

413
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,888
Isn't that enough? What more do you want?

414
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,267
Small things.

415
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,060
"Small things"?

416
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,938
Trivial things. Simple things.

417
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,691
Little things you do for love.

418
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:05,820
Those are things that you do for yourself.

419
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:09,282
You expect too much.
That's why you feel unhappy.

420
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,492
Then why get married?

421
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,244
Because you loved them.

422
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,746
"Loved them"? Not "love them"?

423
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,962
If you say it in the present tense,

424
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,131
then love would've been enough.

425
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,966
But because it's in the past tense,

426
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,428
you two need something more than love
to stay connected.

427
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,932
If that's the case,
then I really don't want to live this way.

428
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:38,436
There are many more reasons
to stay together than just love.

429
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:44,650
Love has to be one of those many reasons.

430
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,280
Lots of people get married
without being in love.

431
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,783
Regardless of whether that one thing
is or was a part of it,

432
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,036
once two people get married, that's it.

433
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,662
Try harder.

434
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,590
Some things can't be done,
no matter how hard you try.

435
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,509
Did you try hard enough?

436
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,307
Jeez, I can't focus on the paper.

437
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,825
What is it? Where are you going?

438
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,330
Are you leaving?

439
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,165
Tell Un-hyeong to come over.

440
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,000
What the heck?

441
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,169
Hey, Jin-ju.

442
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,843
Hey.

443
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:29,672
Jin-ju.

444
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:08,294
ARE YOU HAPPY RIGHT NOW?

445
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,556
PLUS GENERAL INSURANCE

446
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,119
Hello, sir.

447
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,120
Good morning.

448
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,543
Now then.

449
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:52,213
The divorce insurance underwriting process
takes place today?

450
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,131
Yes, sir.

451
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:56,842
Do you think people will come?

452
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,303
Why would they want to go through
a divorce assessment?

453
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,139
I'm not sure, sir.

454
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:04,308
Right. I bet people will just flock here.

455
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,394
I vote that nobody shows up.

456
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,497
All of them actually came.

457
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,542
They want to verify
their love for each other.

458
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,253
Isn't love something you know
rather than something you need to verify?

459
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,671
You watch too much TV.

460
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:37,341
Will their show end in romance or horror?

461
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:38,551
Let's go find out.

462
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,932
What made you decide to get married?

463
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,392
(3) I WANTED TO LIVE
WITH THE ONE I LOVE

464
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,601
-Number three.
-Number three.

465
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,437
That was so cute!

466
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,021
-Number one.
-Number four.

467
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:52,106
-You idiot!
-Hey!

468
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,190
-Number three.
-Number three.

469
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:56,610
We're meant for each other.

470
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,822
We fight all the time.

471
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,907
But I don't want to fight.

472
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,159
Number four.

473
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,161
Are you kidding me?

474
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,038
What are your thoughts on
having personal time?

475
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,668
What are you doing?

476
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,961
Please come out.

477
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,635
He's over there.

478
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,888
-Hello.
-Hello.

479
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,556
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

480
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:26,849
How are you?

481
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,685
They told us to come here
when we were in the lobby.

482
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,853
Are we in the right place?

483
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:34,523
Since the policyholder and insured differ,
we need an in-person assessment.

484
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:35,774
-It's good that you came.
-Okay.

485
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:39,445
Did you reach a compromise on the issues
you couldn't resolve before?

486
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,448
Of course.

487
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:45,117
We even brought a checklist.

488
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:46,744
That's great. Please follow me.

489
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:47,828
-Okay.
-Okay.

490
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,664
This place is nice.

491
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,791
May we see the documents you brought?

492
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,126
-Here.
-Thank you.

493
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,255
-Mr. An, please review these.
-Will do.

494
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:01,800
We talked and came up
with the exact same checklist.

495
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:04,512
That means the premiums
and payouts will be the same, right?

496
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,014
Yes, you two will be on equal footing.

497
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,892
Did you settle on the holiday matter?

498
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,644
They'll visit my house
on even-numbered years

499
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,187
and her house on odd-numbered years.

500
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,815
And we'll carry out ancestral rites
just until I'm gone.

501
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:20,110
I might not be able to pass down property
to my daughter-in-law,

502
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:22,112
but I shouldn't pass down ancestral rites.

503
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,616
You two are the nicest people ever.

504
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,329
This is actually better
than I thought it would be.

505
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,165
Getting everything out in the open
before the wedding

506
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,292
-is more suitable.
-Of course.

507
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:39,046
Exactly. How can we bring up these things
before the wedding otherwise?

508
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:42,049
These are things that must be addressed,

509
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:45,261
but you avoid it because it's awkward,
and then something bad happens.

510
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,887
You're so right.

511
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:49,640
I'm telling all of my friends these days

512
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,559
about getting divorce insurance.

513
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,978
-Same here!
-Goodness.

514
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,689
I'm a divorce insurance promoter too!

515
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,817
Goodness, Ms. Promoter.

516
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,610
Everything is set now.

517
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:04,488
I'll set the contract effective date
as the marriage registration date.

518
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:08,450
-Why not the wedding date?
-What?

519
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,578
It's because many weddings
get called off on the day of.

520
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,247
And sometimes, things fall apart
right after the wedding.

521
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,707
What?

522
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,918
We're just trying to be thorough

523
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,212
since this is a contract.

524
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,757
Why didn't you say that to begin with?

525
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:26,468
Why would you bring up
called-off weddings of all things?

526
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,636
That's what I'm saying.

527
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,307
Is that something common enough
to use as an example?

528
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,017
Should we really sign this?

529
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,811
It's not common, but--

530
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,187
Just be quiet.

531
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:41,233
It's me.

532
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,862
It happened to me.

533
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:48,198
I'm the jerk whose marriage ended
right after the wedding.

534
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,159
I'm the reason behind this provision.

535
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,328
So ladies, please don't be angry.

536
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,372
-Oh, my.
-What in the world?

537
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,084
But you seem to be fine on the outside.

538
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,086
It must've been so upsetting.

539
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,380
I'm sure

540
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:07,926
good things will happen as time passes.

541
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,345
It'll be okay.

542
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,313
-Was that okay?
-Yes.

543
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,981
-Thank you for everything.
-You too.

544
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,441
Oh, I almost forgot.

545
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,360
This is for you.

546
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,987
Oh, the wedding invitation. Thank you.

547
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,280
Please come.

548
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:31,784
My daughter's friends are really pretty.

549
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,244
Then I'll really have to go.

550
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,624
You're so good-looking
and have such a warm personality.

551
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,250
What went wrong?

552
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,796
I would've made my move on you
had I been 30 years younger.

553
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,008
Ma'am, if you keep saying such things…

554
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,887
I'll have to call you "Miss" instead!

555
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,724
Oh, my!

556
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,603
-He's so charming!
-What a shame.

557
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:01,438
I'll walk you out.

558
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,651
Mr. Noh resembles
a middle-aged woman in a way.

559
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,112
That's part of his charm.

560
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:12,282
I see.

561
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,332
SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

562
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:24,920
How do you plan to pass the documents
to the China branch?

563
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,506
I have something in mind,

564
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,175
but accessing the intranet
has been an issue.

565
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,802
If something were to happen,

566
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:35,097
it'll be a headache
for both of us, Ms. Jeon.

567
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,646
How about we use a computer
allocated to the task force?

568
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,526
The divorce insurance product
belongs to our task force,

569
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,487
so it'll be more natural
if it's launched through us.

570
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,702
That makes perfect sense.

571
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,204
Fine. Let's do it that way.

572
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,543
It'll be too risky
if we get directly involved.

573
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:05,919
How should we proceed?

574
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:07,671
Don't worry about that.

575
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:09,423
I have someone perfect for the job.

576
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:19,975
Ki-jun!

577
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:23,061
What happened? Did you meet the quota?

578
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,396
Ta-da!

579
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:26,690
Holy cow!

580
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,067
Look at all these contracts.

581
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,864
Good job.

582
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,784
Everyone did a good job.

583
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,494
I love you.

584
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,871
What can I treat you to?
Sliced beef belly?

585
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,289
No, sir. Tenderloin.

586
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,959
I have important plans tonight,
so treat me next time.

587
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:48,504
What's more important than tenderloin?

588
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,631
Stop prying. It's none of your business.

589
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,508
See? I told you he has a girlfriend.

590
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,012
It's fine. It can't be helped.

591
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,598
I'll give this to Ms. Jeon myself,

592
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,725
-so go ahead and clock out.
-Yes, sir.

593
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,936
-Give it to me, sir.
-No, I don't have any money!

594
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,689
I was talking about the documents!
I can give them to her on my way.

595
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,901
You meant the documents?
I thought you meant wanting tenderloin.

596
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,445
No, I'll do it myself. I'll see you later.

597
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:18,659
Ms. Jeon!

598
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,285
Why did you offer?

599
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,247
If the option expiration date is T,
the strike price is K,

600
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,040
and the profit volatility is S,

601
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,501
determine the prices
for both European call and put options.

602
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,336
What?

603
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,462
It's tomorrow's alarm question.

604
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:33,340
Wait. There's no way to turn it off, then!

605
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,509
Get back here!

606
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,973
He used the Black-Scholes formula
to set the alarm. How impressive.

607
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,057
THE BLACK-SCHOLES FORMULA

608
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,350
USED TO CALCULATE
EUROPEAN-STYLE OPTIONS

609
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,560
A BASIC THEORY
OF DERIVATIVES PRICING

610
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,374
Oh, Ms. Kang.

611
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,882
What about your important plans?

612
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,551
If I miss it even once,

613
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,470
I'll have to live
with two weeks worth of trash.

614
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,806
So is there anything
more important than this?

615
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:25,142
I guess you're right.

616
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,521
Why do they only collect recyclables
once a week?

617
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:34,610
If it makes you uncomfortable,
let's set up a time to take out our trash.

618
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:38,989
It's hard enough
taking out the trash once a week.

619
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,116
I can't do that on a timetable.

620
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:45,120
Then the next time we run into each other,

621
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,664
I'll just ignore you.

622
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:50,208
Gosh, I couldn't be more grateful.

623
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,350
It rarely happens…

624
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,479
but I often get nervous.

625
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,733
Is it closer to "rarely" or "often"?

626
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,071
If I knew that,
I wouldn't have said "rarely but often."

627
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:23,200
Try sorting that out on a scale of 1 to 5.

628
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:24,910
Seriously?

629
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,371
What is it? Why are you nervous?

630
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,666
This one's an open-ended question.

631
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,296
It's just that

632
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,133
all this talk about happiness and trust

633
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:42,427
makes me wonder if I went too far.

634
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,973
I'm worried we meddled with people

635
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,935
who were doing just fine.

636
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,897
And I'm worried I didn't try hard enough.

637
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:59,027
Just think of it as an umbrella.

638
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,615
Hold onto it for them until it rains
and then give it back.

639
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:09,079
We can't do anything about the rain,
no matter how hard we try.

640
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,797
Some things can't be done,
no matter how hard you try.

641
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,132
Did you try hard enough?

642
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:40,068
So I guess it had rained that day.

643
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:09,973
Would you like to go with me?

644
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:12,726
To the wedding.

645
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,022
We need to make sure
it goes off without a hitch.

646
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,774
Your outfit is lovely.

647
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:03,985
The bride's friends are all pretty,
so I have to keep up appearances.

648
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,572
You look pretty good yourself, Mr. Noh.

649
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:10,784
I dressed carefully for the client
as part of customer management.

650
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:12,577
The subway is okay, right?

651
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,412
Of course. Besides, the weather is clear.

652
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,364
The weather is nice.

653
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,032
I know, right?

654
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:24,608
I'm sorry I couldn't give you
the wedding invitation.

655
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:25,859
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

656
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,111
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

657
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:29,905
Thank you for coming.

658
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,581
Congratulations.

659
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,339
Shall we stand over there?

660
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,930
Let's leave once it begins.

661
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,348
What about lunch?

662
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,225
To be honest, I'm allergic to weddings.

663
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,693
Where are they?

664
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,492
Shouldn't it have started by now?

665
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,913
It's past time. Why isn't it starting?

666
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,461
-Where is she?
-She won't answer my calls.

667
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,171
-She won't?
-No, ma'am.

668
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:29,923
Where in the world is she?

669
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,595
-Is Tae-hyun not answering his phone?
-No, ma'am.

670
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,144
They are not in the bride's room either.

671
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,854
-What shall we do?
-Did you check the restrooms?

672
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,899
He's not in there.

673
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,277
Jung-min!

674
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,737
-What should we do?
-He won't answer his phone.

675
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:56,866
Oh, goodness.

676
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,078
-Have you heard from Do-i?
-She's gone and won't answer the phone.

677
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,371
Tae-hyun too.

678
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,415
-My goodness.
-What on earth is going on?

679
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,126
They're really running late.

680
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:10,880
Don't worry. I'm sure everything is okay.

681
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:15,760
Hey, Yoon Tae-hyun!

682
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:18,430
Where are you and your bride?

683
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:19,556
Is that him?

684
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,891
The ceremony was
supposed to start ages ago!

685
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:24,394
-You jerk, come back this instant!
-What?

686
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:25,854
Was there an accident?

687
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:28,982
What did you say?

688
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,073
Look over there.

689
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:43,079
-They're about to start.
-See? I told you not to worry.

690
00:43:43,163 --> 00:43:44,789
-What a relief.
-First, I'd like to apologize

691
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:47,542
to all of our guests for the delay.

692
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,502
We will now begin the wedding ceremony

693
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:53,673
of the groom, Yoon Tae-hyun,
and the bride, Kim Do-i.

694
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,366
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello, everyone.

695
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,618
-I'm the groom, Yoon Tae-hyun.
-And I'm the bride, Kim Do-i.

696
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,120
-And we're going on our honeymoon.
-And we're going on our honeymoon.

697
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:27,791
To be honest,
we never wanted a wedding ceremony.

698
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,125
We're both introverts

699
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:31,669
and don't like being around many people.

700
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,255
Mom. Ma'am.

701
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,549
You took out divorce insurance policies
without telling us.

702
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,468
We got a follow-up call from them.

703
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,595
-You chose to pull something secretly…
-Divorce insurance?

704
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,972
-…so we did the same.
-What's that?

705
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:44,724
But we promise to live happily,

706
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:46,851
so there'll be no need
to receive a payout.

707
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:49,270
-Mother.
-Ma'am.

708
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,398
-We're thankful, and we're sorry.
-And we're sorry.

709
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,066
-And we love you!
-And we love you!

710
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:01,533
Ms. Kang, what do we do now?

711
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,118
I don't know.

712
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,872
One, two, three!

713
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:16,131
Will the mothers of the bride and groom
please enter?

714
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:43,533
I'd like to thank everyone
for taking the time to attend.

715
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:45,368
I apologize deeply for what happened.

716
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,287
Had we known about this,

717
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,665
we would've informed you ahead of time
and asked for your understanding.

718
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:54,169
But as you can see,
we were ambushed as well.

719
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:58,339
If we had respected
their wishes to begin with,

720
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,383
this likely wouldn't have happened.

721
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:04,512
It seems that the ones
who wanted a wedding were the parents.

722
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:08,266
Therefore, we've decided to hold a wedding

723
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,978
between the parents
with all of you in attendance.

724
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:23,490
As Kim Do-i's mother…

725
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:26,743
As Yoon Tae-hyun's mother…

726
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,786
I will accept Yoon Tae-hyun
as my son-in-law…

727
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,039
I will accept Kim Do-i
as my daughter-in-law…

728
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:35,418
-…and promise to love and cherish him…
-…and promise to love and cherish her…

729
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:38,838
-…for the rest of our lives.
-…for the rest of our lives.

730
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:10,995
Thank you.

731
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:14,374
Congratulations!

732
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:49,367
The ocean isn't affected by the rain.

733
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,536
We worried over nothing.

734
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:55,999
Excuse me. Please wait!

735
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:58,960
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you so much.

736
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,254
Congratulations on your own wedding.

737
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,422
Congratulations.

738
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,631
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

739
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:06,801
This was the most genuine wedding
I've ever attended.

740
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,679
And they were the happiest couple
I've ever seen.

741
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:13,474
If they looked happy,
then that's all that matters.

742
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:17,520
As a parent, I feel better about this now.

743
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,316
We don't want this to go to waste,

744
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,735
so why don't you take it home
and clear your minds?

745
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,614
What?

746
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,366
It'll be a shame not to use it.

747
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,076
We can't get a refund either.

748
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,245
-No, it's really okay.
-It's okay, ma'am.

749
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:35,663
If you keep refusing,

750
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:37,832
-we'll cancel our policies!
-We'll cancel our policies!

751
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:50,762
-Take care.
-Take care.

752
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,221
Thank you.

753
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,698
Care for some daytime drinking?

754
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:14,327
I can't handle this sober,
so I'll take a glass.

755
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:31,302
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

756
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:54,909
Maybe there's a traffic jam ahead.

757
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:57,662
Move your car!

758
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:09,215
SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR
JEON NA-RAE

759
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:19,350
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

760
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,185
Please tell Mr. Noh…

761
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,690
that five contracts in total
have been rejected.

762
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:28,609
-What?
-Tell him to prepare a business plan.

763
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,656
TODAY IS YOUR OVULATION DAY
SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 23

764
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:36,909
What's that sound?

765
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:39,829
It's ovulation day.
We'll talk business on a business day.

766
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,001
What are you doing?

767
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:47,754
-Let's get out.
-Here?

768
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,797
Yes. Otherwise, we'll be trapped here.

769
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,799
What are you doing?
Are you pulling a stunt?

770
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:53,843
-Move your car!
-Please move your car!

771
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,803
They might beat us up.

772
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:57,930
Keep hiding here if you're scared.

773
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:00,892
Move your car!

774
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:04,187
-Move your car first!
-What's the matter with you?

775
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:05,521
Come on.

776
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,316
Move it already!

777
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,067
Hurry.

778
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:31,047
-Move your car!
-Come on!

779
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:34,634
-Why aren't you moving?
-Get out of the way.

780
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,428
Move already!

781
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,388
Let's go.

782
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:43,559
-Where are you going?
-You can't just leave your car!

783
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:46,312
I said move your car!

784
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,653
You're a smiley nutcase,
so put on a good smile.

785
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:11,003
I'm sorry, everyone.

786
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:14,340
You can't leave your car like that!

787
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:16,425
-I'm sorry.
-Jeez.

788
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:26,412
I haven't laughed that hard in a while.

789
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,414
How did it feel
to be a true smiley nutcase?

790
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,583
-Good, thanks to you.
-Don't mention it.

791
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:32,960
Just a second.

792
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:38,966
YOUR HAIR APPOINTMENT
HAS BEEN CANCELED

793
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,092
It got canceled again.

794
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:43,554
Do I have to go there myself?

795
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,602
Ms. Kang, we'll have to part ways here.

796
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:50,645
Here?

797
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,647
Yes, I have to go see someone.

798
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:54,941
I'll have to head out first.

799
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,734
-Okay.
-Taxi!

800
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,922
HOW FAST DOES SANTA DELIVER
GIFTS TO KIDS AROUND THE WORLD?

801
00:54:22,802 --> 00:54:24,637
TRAVESTY

802
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:27,890
Hang up now.

803
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:29,266
Why? You just picked up.

804
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:31,394
-I have to read an article.
-What article?

805
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:34,897
It's a statistics article about how Santa
has to travel at 8.18 million km per hour

806
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:38,401
to deliver gifts to every kid in the world
on Christmas Eve.

807
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:41,195
Really? Then tell him I don't need one.

808
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,698
Seriously? You're not even on the list.

809
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:44,699
That's a shame.

810
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:49,495
I wanted to help him,
even if it's just 1 in 8.18 million.

811
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,205
So what do you want?

812
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,416
-Five contracts were rejected.
-What?

813
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:55,001
If you're done washing your sneakers,

814
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:58,421
run at 8.18 million km per second
and get some contracts signed.

815
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:05,261
He changed it from per hour to per second.

816
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,013
That fraud.

817
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:13,769
But how did he know
I was washing my sneakers?

818
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:22,778
SEOUL MUSEUM OF HISTORY

819
00:55:22,862 --> 00:55:24,822
MY TREASURE
MY HERITAGE

820
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:29,577
-Oink, oink.
-Oink, oink.

821
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,246
-Sparrows say?
-Chirp, chirp.

822
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,415
-Puppies say?
-Woof, woof.

823
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:37,001
-Pigs say?
-Oink, oink.

824
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,628
-Chicks say?
-Cheep, cheep.

825
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:42,214
-Rabbits go?
-Hop, hop.

826
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:44,467
-Pigs say?
-Oink, oink.

827
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,339
This is authentic, right?

828
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:24,757
Yes, it's authentic.

829
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:29,220
They're by Kim Dae-jin,
Toegye Yi Hwang's academic successor.

830
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:32,515
The 416 woodblocks
of Jeongwaseonsaeng's Collected Works.

831
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,392
It's hard to believe this large collection
was the work of a single author.

832
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:36,519
You're here.

833
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,314
How could I not come after seeing this?

834
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:43,317
Then why don't you

835
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:45,861
take a good photo for me?

836
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:06,132
Why did you come here?

837
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:08,676
I'm here on business.

838
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,096
Please purchase a policy from me.

839
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:15,516
Un-hyeong.

840
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,941
-What's this?
-What's this?

841
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:14,742
What? Five contracts?

842
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,202
Where can we get contracts right now?

843
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:18,287
Can you take out a policy for me?
It's for divorce insurance.

844
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,080
Ms. Ah-young, dinner is on me tonight.

845
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,332
We need a divorce rate of zero.

846
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,125
How are you going to meet this condition?

847
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:24,335
Korean astrology, physiognomy,
and profiling.

848
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:26,795
We'll use every means possible
to filter them out.

849
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:28,047
Let's move in teams then.

850
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,465
Stop!

851
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,967
You're doomed.
You don't expect me to help, do you?

852
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:34,428
Not many people
have weird obsessions like this.

853
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,512
-Fascinating.
-Fascinating.

854
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:36,472
Mr. Noh?

855
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:39,516
Do you want to go and clear our heads?

856
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,352
Hey, are you stalking me?

857
