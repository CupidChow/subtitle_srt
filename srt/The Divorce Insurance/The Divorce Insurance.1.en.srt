Everything you need

Please take a free teddy bear.

Sign a contract
and enjoy our wedding car service.

00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,036
It's a limo service!

12
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,079
Reserve our wedding package
and get limo service.

13
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:22,291
Honey, we've been here
for nine and a half hours.

14
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,335
Come on. Let's do one final check.

15
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,337
We're done. What else is there to check?

16
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,297
-We did absolutely everything!
-Geez!

17
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,383
It doesn't feel right.
Something's missing.

18
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,760
What do you mean?

19
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:36,138
There's something else we need
when it comes to wedding preparations.

20
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:39,642
That'd be divorce prep.

23
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,487
I said divorce preparations.

24
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,161
Everyone says

25
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:02,289
to accept your fate
and to love your partner.

26
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:03,374
However…

27
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:07,878
Tell them to cut the crap.

28
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,421
-Is he crazy?
-What in the world?

29
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:10,965
Can you believe what he said?

30
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,758
It's easier said than done.

31
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:16,428
In case you're faced
with an unexpected divorce,

32
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,390
Plus General Insurance has developed
an innovative insurance product

39
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,330
Any Korean citizen

40
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:46,458
may purchase divorce insurance
regardless of their marital status.

41
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,461
So long as they are
not currently having an affair,

42
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,171
they can be single,
married, re-married, or divorced.

43
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,257
This policy will cover
both living expenses

44
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,594
and court-mandated alimony payments

45
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,304
after the divorce.

46
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,266
Are you crazy? You're suggesting divorce
to couples who are about to get married?

-How can you say that?
-He's crazy.

50
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,069
Does life insurance encourage one's death?

51
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:17,239
Does auto accident injury insurance
encourage car accidents?

I get it because I felt the same way.

61
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,108
But if you've never paid alimony,
you can't possibly understand.

62
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,693
You become broke overnight.

63
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,822
And that's not all.
All your efforts are gone in an instant.

64
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:02,201
Do you know how much it costs
to rebuild your life?

65
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,410
Divorce costs just as much…

66
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,329
No, divorce costs more than marriage.

67
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,414
Divorce is more complicated
than marriage too.

68
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,959
Divorce is far more distressing

69
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,461
than any illness or accident.

70
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,756

How dare you?

76
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,062

EPISODE 1

79
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,439
We tried to sell divorce insurance
at a wedding fair.

80
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,150
I think we made a mistake.

81
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,985
People were afraid to admit it.

82
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,071
I bet they all secretly wanted
to take out a policy.

83
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,448
You need more sense knocked into you.

84
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,324
In any case, it's all our fault.

85
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,951
Technically, it's not "our" fault.

86
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:27,911
It's "someone's" fault.

87
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,247
Didn't I warn you?

88
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,375
Didn't I say a worst-case risk scenario
would happen?

89
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,630
It's not like we didn't
expect this at all.

90
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:39,673
Sir.

91
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:42,676
We had to push hard
to prove the lowest risk

92
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,511
in a worst-case scenario.

93
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,431
But there's such a thing
as safety standards.

94
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,141
Mr. Noh Ki-jun, the actuary.

95
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,352
Your obsession with safety
is why we never get anywhere.

96
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,688
Mr. An Wuss-man, the risk surveyor.

97
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,190
Stop calling me Wuss-man.

98
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,735
I can't call a wuss Mr. Brave-man, can I?

99
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,153
Hey!

100
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,408
You're not an actuary. You're a travesty.

101
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:09,453
You're not a risk surveyor.
You have risk-phobia.

102
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,665
I'm rubber, you're glue.

103
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:14,750
-What? I can't hear you.
-I'm rubber, you're glue.

104
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,918
Excuse me!

105
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,173
I'm here to talk about divorce insurance.

106
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,012
I couldn't ask earlier
because there were too many people.

107
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,307
So…

108
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,728
You said wedding prep and divorce prep
go hand in hand, right?

109
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:37,773
It sounds like you're saying that marriage

110
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,483
ultimately leads to unhappiness, right?

111
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,567
No.

112
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:41,693
No?

113
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,154
I meant the exact opposite.

114
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,322
Come on.

115
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,325
Don't you mean that marriage and divorce
are exact opposites?

116
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,536
No. Marriage and divorce are the same.

117
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:54,540
They're the same?

118
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,084
The purpose of both marriage and divorce…

119
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:00,796
is to find happiness.

125
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,458
I said stick to selling
our current products.

126
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,003
Why did you have to create
an "innovative" product?

127
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,130
Why?

128
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:47,634
As long as the world's greatest actuary,
Noh Ki-jun, is still here,

129
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,220
the New Product Development Team
will survive!

130
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,348
Every product you create
ends up in the red and is discontinued!

131
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,435
How will you save us
when everything has failed?

132
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,270
There's something out there!

133
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:02,065
I'll create an insurance product
that's never been seen before!

134
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,192
Why? To fail again?

135
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,401
I won't fail anymore.

136
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,446
I'm telling you, I can do this!

137
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,616
What happened to the successful Noh Ki-jun

138
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,035
who used to create
one hit product after another?

139
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,787
Now he's just after
some innovative product…

140
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,122
I can't do this anymore.

141
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,291
Let's just die together.

142
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,751

00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,354
Aren't you already a subscriber?

181
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,690
Right, I meant to say Go TV.

182
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,525
It's about a contract.

183
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,570
Oh, you idiot.
You took out another policy, didn't you?

184
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,988
-No, I--
-What is it this time?

185
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,740
Honey, the thing is…

186
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,034
Remember when I was an agent
at the Ssangmun branch

187
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,869
and worked with a guy named Chang-hee?

188
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:01,953
So Chang-hee--

189
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,206
Will you take out loans
to pay your premiums now?

190
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,874
Do you know your entire salary
goes into that?

191
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:06,958
Of course, I do.

192
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:10,087
But, honey, you know how insurance works.

193
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,548
-If we get sick later--
-Let's get a divorce.

194
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,133
What? A divorce?

195
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,551
Hello?

196
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,848
Hey, what's gotten into you
all of a sudden?

197
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,267
I left you some gomguk soup
on the dining table

198
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,811
as well as divorce papers.

199
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:29,147
-I'm leaving.
-Honey?

200
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,483
So-jeong? Lee So-jeong?

201
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,990
APPLICATION ON THE CONFIRMATION
OF DIVORCE BY CONSENT

202
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,742
Hello? Honey?

203
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,285
Honey?

204
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,125
Did you hang up?

205
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,969
You made curry for me, too, right?

206
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,972
Mr. Na!

207
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,730
-Divorce, sir.
-What?

208
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,899
Let's create divorce insurance.

209
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,277
What's that? I have no idea what you mean.

210
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,699
Nothing poses a bigger risk
these days than divorce.

211
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,077
Remember the rock-tripping insurance
and nosedive insurance you created?

212
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,705
Don't you remember how they failed?
Do you want to repeat that?

213
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,499
We're the only two left in this team.

214
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,042
What can the two of us do?

215
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:34,045
If we fail again, we'll get fired.
We'll be done for.

216
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,755
Right. Okay.

217
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,092
Mr. Na, imagine that you got divorced.

218
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,594
Is that supposed to be funny?

219
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,095
Oh, wait.

220
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,892
Okay. Now just imagine this.

221
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,021
I got divorced.

222
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,856
"I got divorced."

223
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,357
I got divorced.

224
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,901
"I got divorced."

225
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,027
I got

226
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,696
divorced.

227
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,448
Geez!

228
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,575
DIVORCE REGISTRATION FORM

229
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,410

230
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,496

HAPPINESS ALWAYS REALTOR

233
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,342

236
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,104
No!

237
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,570
You get it, right?

238
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,781
Divorce is an actual disaster.

239
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,744
But…

240
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,081
Can we actually calculate
the risk of divorce?

241
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,505
They do it for death.
Think of life insurance.

242
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,757
You're right, but…

243
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,718
Okay, look.

244
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,513
We can calculate the insurance rates

245
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:10,100
based on the presence of rational factors
that indicate a lasting marriage

246
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,019
or irrational factors leading
to a failed marriage.

247
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,403
Can you have the calculations ready
by the next meeting?

248
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,245
Divorce can be covered by insurance, sir!

249
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,293
Make it happen.

250
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,344
Make it happen.

251
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,176
I'm sorry. I forgot that I'm single now.

252
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,303
I'm sorry.

253
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,763
I'm so sorry.

254
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,938
I'm divorced now.

255
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,163
Tuna…

256
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:57,666
Tuna…

257
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,264
This goes here.

258
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,069
KING SHRIMP

259
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,220
Ma'am, we're closing the register soon.

260
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,888
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,773
Is this it?

262
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:04,858
Excuse me?

263
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:10,655
Yes.

264
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,054
EXCEPTIONS FOR INSURANCE AGENTS

265
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,074

INSURANCE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
TO BOOST Q1 SHORT-TERM PROFITS

267
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,074
These are the annual disaster cases
based on last year's data.

268
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,660
If you take a look
at the bottom of this list,

269
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:42,413
this disaster alone
accounts for 92,400 cases.

270
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,790
What do you think it is?

271
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,000
Aren't fires
the most common accident type?

272
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:49,379
But fire cases are already listed.
What could it be then?

273
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,923
The answer is…

274
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,050
NUMBER OF DIVORCE CASES

275
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,593
…divorce.

276
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,308
Isn't it a bit much
to classify divorce as a disaster?

277
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,144
Unexpected catastrophes and hardships

278
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,105
are what we call disasters.

279
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,942
These are the changes
that appear post-divorce.

280
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,819
You suddenly experience
financial difficulty.

281
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,863
Your living environment suddenly changes.

282
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,282
Your relationships change drastically.

283
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,784
And your mental health suffers.

284
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:23,413
How are any of these things
different from disasters?

285
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,749
Then I suppose divorce is a disaster
that could never happen to me

286
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,586
because I don't believe
in marriage to begin with.

287
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,007
Being single doesn't mean
you're not affected.

288
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,133
Your parents' divorce.

289
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,968
Your siblings' divorces.

290
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,094
Your children's divorces.

291
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,179
Even your friends' divorces.

292
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,516
There are divorces all around you
that can impact your life.

293
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,394
I have to admit it was hard
dealing with my parents' divorce.

294
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,688
My daughter got divorced recently

295
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,566
and moved back home with the kids,
so it's been stressful.

296
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,320
If we create a model assessing
financial and emotional damages

297
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,030
following a divorce,

298
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,824
we can break down
the various damages, including alimony,

299
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,368
and calculate the coverage amount.

300
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,086
Divorce happens by choice, not by chance.

301
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,757
Therefore, it doesn't qualify
for insurance coverage.

302
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,301
I think you're referring
to the issue of moral hazard.

303
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,511
By adjusting the premiums
based on the policy period,

304
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,055
we can prevent incurring losses.

305
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,015
To determine whether any losses may occur,

306
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,935
we'll need to conduct sample testing
to verify the accuracy

307
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,479
of the calculation model
and value liabilities

308
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,065
to confirm whether or not it is safe.

309
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,320
I think you're saying we need to review

310
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,239
the solvency adequacy model
to determine whether this is good or bad.

311
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,116
If that's what you need, I'll set it up.

312
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,162
Please assemble a task force.

313
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,544
-What is he talking about?
-Seriously?

314
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,096
You told me to make it happen!

315
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,022
How long will you eat gomguk soup?

316
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,526
Just how long will you keep eating curry?

317
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,445
Namaste.

318
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,491
Please, sir.

319
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,795
Assemble a task force.

320
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,755
-I'll take full responsibility.
-Yes!

321
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,888
THANK YOU

322
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,098
Thank you.

323
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,412
I bet we were a married couple
in a past life.

324
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,663
You annoying bastard.

325
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:12,749
Really?

326
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,958
Then we must've gotten divorced.

327
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,758
Be honest with me.
You're into the divorce insurance idea.

328
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,718
What? Get out of my way.

329
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,516
Look at the back of his head twitching.

330
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,018
He's definitely interested.

331
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,272
CLEANING SUPPLY BOX

332
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,000
Get that out of my face.

333
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,296
Just come clean.

334
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,048
You don't speak up in meetings.

335
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,633
But you did today,
so you're 100% interested.

336
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,926
-You're wrong.
-Why?

337
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,469
Jumping in the deep end isn't safe.

338
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,847
You really do live up
to your name, An Jeon-man.

339
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,891
And you live up to your own
by having no standards.

340
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,647
Just think about it.
You and I both did it.

341
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,773
I even did it three times.

342
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,942
That's four divorces between us two,
which equals a 200% chance.

343
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,902
You're betting on a 200% probability.

344
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,779
There's no safer bet than this,
An Jeon-man.

345
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,239
Hey, Noh Ki-jun.

346
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,241
Why did you get married three times?

347
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,700
Why create a 200% probability?

348
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:31,369
Why?

349
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:33,538
I…

350
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,711
can't do one-night stands.

351
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,765
I'm going to create

352
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,725
divorce insurance.

353
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,271
Does that mean…

354
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,524
You only slept with three women?

355
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,486
If you're recruiting me,
treat me to hanwoo BBQ!

356
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,114
I want tenderloin!

357
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,287
This goes to the ladder truck.

358
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:02,210
-Just wait a bit until we're done.
-Okay.

359
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,545
This goes to the ladder truck.
One, two, three!

360
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,219
I'm sorry, but we have to move the sofa.

361
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,932
Over here. Please grab the sofa.

362
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,725
On three.

363
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,227
One, two, three!

364
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,234
Why is this covered?

365
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,403
I told them to just scratch up the floor.

366
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,114
Hey, be careful with that. It's expensive.

367
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,910
-Here we go.
-Hey!

368
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,870
Just leave that here.

369
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:39,413
-I took the frame already.
-Just leave it?

370
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:40,623
It's heavy. Throw it away.

371
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,875
Let's wrap it up.

372
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,211
I took that too.

373
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,756
Hey.

374
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,051
I lost a screw while removing the bidet.

375
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,470
Make sure to find it
and send it to me, okay?

376
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:58,474
Are you deaf? Did you hear what I said?

377
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,143
What about this house?

378
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:03,271
Keep it as alimony.

379
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:06,190
It's under your name anyway.

380
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,234
All that's left of this house is debt.

381
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,237
We took out high-interest loans
to open your café.

382
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,282
I know that's why the house
was put under my name.

383
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:17,368
Why are you coming after me
about your loans?

384
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:21,372
-What?
-You bitched about wanting a divorce.

385
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,207
Damn it, this is ridiculous.

386
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:32,717
Whatever. Just pay back the money
you borrowed from my mom.

387
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,593
What money? I don't have any.

388
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,470
What?

389
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:39,307
You said to pay it back whenever I could.

390
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,477
Geez. Going back on your word
runs in your family.

391
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,603
-Right?
-What?

392
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:47,148
I'll pay you back later.

393
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,607
We're good now, right?

394
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,818
Don't act all invasive later.

395
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:51,902
I'm warning you.

396
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,196
Damn it.

397
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,206
It's "evasive."

398
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,460
It's evasive, not invasive.

399
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:11,088
It comes from "to evade" or "to escape."

400
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:13,341
It's "evasive."

401
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,680
This is why you're a failure.

402
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:22,433
Who cares if it's invasive or evasive?

403
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,393
Why is an idiot like you so nitpicky?

404
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,062
Just find the screw and send it to me!

405
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,147
I can't use this bidet without it.

406
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,989
NOH KI-JUN

407
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,829
Come on. Let's focus.

408
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,999
I'm a genius actuary.

409
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,405
I can do this.

410
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:04,577
STOCK PRICE

411
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:17,465
Let's go eat.

412
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,182
FIERY HOT BBQ RIBS

413
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:35,774
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

414
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,987
I got you tenderloin, so you're in, okay?

415
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,364
Tenderloin won't be enough.

416
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,367
What else do you want
other than tenderloin?

417
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,077
-I need to be informed.
-What?

418
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,830
-Inform me.
-About what?

419
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:53,459
-About why you got divorced.
-Geez, way to ruin the mood.

420
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:56,879
I need details
on a high-risk case like you

421
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:00,174
to decide whether or not
I should join this project.

422
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,848
This project is doomed
if you try to trick me into it.

423
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,063
I'm an old friend,
but you still hide this from me.

424
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,899
So why would anyone open up
about this stuff to you?

425
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,025
Just forget it.

426
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,403
If I tell you, you're joining.

427
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,322
Sure thing.

428
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,032
Start me off.

429
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,659
First wife.

430
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,578
We had different views on marriage.

431
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:30,788
Second wife.

432
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:33,791
We had different worldviews.

433
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,834
Third wife.

434
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:37,962
We had different views on life.

435
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,717
Views on marriage, worldviews,
and views on life?

436
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:46,053
-Are you trying to crack me up?
-No, I'm cracking open soju.

437
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,223
Don't be ridiculous.

438
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,933
How were your marriage views different?

439
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,893
Did she want an open marriage
or something?

440
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:54,395
Yes.

441
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:05,239
Geez. What is this, Hollywood?

442
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,952
-Now it's your turn.
-What do you mean?

443
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,620
The reason why you got divorced.

444
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:14,748
I have nothing to divulge
because I'm not buying divorce insurance.

445
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,208
I'm asking you as a friend.

446
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,169
We're best friends, after all.

447
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,596
I was just curious.

448
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,515
Why would a responsible guy
like you get divorced?

449
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,569
My wife was an interior design fanatic.

450
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,654
And?

451
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,198
One day, she told me something was
ruining the look of her place.

452
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,658
Like what?

453
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,411
Me.

454
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,167
So what did you do?

455
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,918
I left the house.

456
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:02,379
Geez, you're such a fool.

457
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:04,423
All you do is run away
instead of fighting back.

458
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:07,635
You haven't changed a bit
since you were a kid.

459
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,345
You're the bigger fool.

460
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:13,432
If you're so smart,
how come you paid alimony three times?

461
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:17,936
Forget it.

462
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,253
Han-deul!

463
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,006
Hey, Ah-young!

464
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,467
Over here, Ah-young!

465
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:52,638
This won't do.

466
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,308
-Han-deul.
-Yes?

467
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,018
-I'm holding a sologamy.
-A sologamy?

468
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:00,187
Yes. I have no intention
of getting married.

469
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:03,565
If you don't want to get married,
then just don't.

470
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:04,692
Why hold a sologamy?

471
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:08,153
I gave out so much wedding gift money.
I need to make it all back.

472
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:09,279
I see.

473
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:18,789
Wedding gift money is
legally considered a gift.

474
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,874
I'm under no obligation to return a gift

475
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,251
even if the other party requests it.

476
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,796
So I'm going to hold a sologamy
and get my wedding gift money back.

477
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,340
Spoken like a true loss adjuster.

478
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:30,718
I'm always taking a loss because
I worry about what others think.

479
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,766
Maybe I aim under
because I'm an underwriter.

480
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:55,701
Geez, that scared me.

481
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,120
That hurts.

482
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:07,129
So not only did that bastard cheat on you,
he took the bidet too?

483
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,422
What were you doing all this time?

484
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,218
Forget it. Let him have it.

485
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:16,180
What do you mean forget it?
You're too nice for your own good.

486
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,307
That's why you keep taking losses.

487
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:22,269
Geez, I'm so pissed.

488
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,153
-Han-deul.
-What?

489
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,155
You're starting work
at my company next week, right?

490
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,699
-Yes.
-And I'm the only one you know there?

491
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,409
Yes, I guess so.

492
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,204
Then how about you do this?

493
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:41,288
Do what?

494
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,124
Now that you're switching jobs,
get rid of your nice image

495
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,542
and start fresh as a smiley nutcase

496
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:46,960
A smiley nutcase?

497
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:49,671
A nutcase who says whatever they want
with a big smile!

498
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,967
A NUTCASE WHO SAYS WHATEVER
THEY WANT WITH A BIG SMILE

499
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:04,645
I like it!

500
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,482
But how do I become one?

501
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,568
I'll spread some rumors for you at work.

502
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:14,863
The new Joeun Fire Insurance underwriter
is a smiley nutcase.

503
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:16,114
Have you heard?

504
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,616
The new underwriter

505
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,077
is supposedly a smiley nutcase.

506
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,787
Smiley nutcase.

507
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,247
What do you think?

508
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,708
So I should just start off
as a smiley nutcase?

509
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,169
Exactly. Then nobody will mess with you.

510
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,173
I love it.

511
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,634
You're a genius!

512
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,097
Trust me. I'll turn you
into a real smiley nutcase.

513
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:41,932
Thanks, Ah-young!

514
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:46,311
Look, fire!

515
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,482
I'm a smiley nutcase!

516
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,401
I'm a smiley nutcase!

517
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:58,156
-Behold, at the foot of Cheonma Mountain
-Behold, at the foot of Cheonma Mountain

518
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,869
-Our high aspirations!
-Aspirations!

519
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:06,290
-Open up to a bright future!
-Open up!

520
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:10,377
-With courage and wisdom
-With courage and wisdom

521
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,506
-We'll face this harsh world head on!
-We'll face this harsh world head on!

522
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,344
-Let's move that.
-Okay.

523
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,930
-Goodness.
-Look at all this.

524
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:09,603
We'll shine on together forever

525
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,713
Oh, my!

526
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,057
What the heck?

527
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,772
-Hey, who are you?
-What are you doing?

528
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,408
Oh, my goodness. What are they doing?

529
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,661
-Hey, stop that!
-Who are you?

530
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,091
FAIR AND HONEST POLICE
SERVING THE PEOPLE

531
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,426
Come on now.

532
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:07,304
It's late, and you two seem
like respectable people.

533
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,556
The neighborhood is in an uproar.

534
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,767
Make peace with each other.

535
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,186
I was on my way home from work when…

536
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,646
Geez, my finger hurts.

537
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:21,485
So on my way home,
I saw a mattress moving along by itself.

538
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,320
Imagine how weird that must have looked.

539
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,655
So I approached it to get a better look

540
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,491
when this woman popped out from under it.

541
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:30,202
She grabbed my finger,
and we both fell over.

542
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,496
So naturally, my body followed
in that direction.

543
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:33,663
That's why…

544
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,875
Geez, that's how it happened.

545
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,419
Sir, that's not what happened.

546
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:42,506
I was just trying to throw away a mattress

547
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,966
when this man suddenly appeared.

548
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,636
He pounced on me
and then on top of the mattress,

549
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,179
-he did this thing--
-That's not true!

550
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,931
I didn't pounce on you!

551
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,891
You grabbed my finger and pulled me down.

552
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,268
I couldn't help but fall down with it.
Don't you agree?

553
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,938
It just happened naturally,
so it couldn't be helped.

554
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:00,148
Who are you accusing of pouncing on you?

555
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,984
Do you have any idea how badly
my molar and jaw hurt right now?

556
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,486
Your molar?

557
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,905
Excuse me, do you think
molars crack that easily?

558
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,365
Your front teeth might,

559
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,951
but molars don't crack that easily.

560
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,620
Take a look.

561
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,289
Look. Do you see it?

562
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:17,374
You can't see it, can you?

563
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:20,627
Even dentists can't tell
if a tooth is cracked just by looking.

564
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,255
I didn't see any cracks,
but I saw plenty of cavities.

565
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,506
You should brush your teeth well.

566
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,968
You two are about to start again.
Please stop fighting.

567
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:31,805
Let's make this simple
and have your insurance take care of it.

568
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:35,267
Insurance doesn't cover things like this.

569
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,351
Why not?

570
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,311
My finger hurts as well as my jaw.

571
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:39,604
And my molar. Everything hurts.

572
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:43,275
Neither SO2.5 nor S62 apply in this case.

573
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:48,947
Wait. How do you know
all the diagnosis codes?

574
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,076
Are you a dentist?

575
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,584
What's your occupation?

576
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,712
I'm not a dentist.

577
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:07,716
Don't be so invasive when you answer.

578
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:08,842
Hold on.

579
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:12,762
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but it's "evasive," not "invasive."

580
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:18,560
It comes from "to evade" or "to escape,"

581
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,604
as in how one's thoughts can evade them.

582
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:23,273
The correct term is "evasive."

583
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,944
"Evasive."

584
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:30,488
-You're really nitpicky, sir.
-I know.

585
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:31,656
Thank you.

586
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:36,745
Why? What is it?

587
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,289
It's nothing.

588
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:10,987
Is she going to buy it or not?

589
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,616
I really want to eat that.

590
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:17,911
Excuse me.

591
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,681
Ma'am, we're closing the register soon.

592
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,225
I'm sorry.

593
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,477
I'm sorry.

594
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,945
She's just like someone I know.

595
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:09,587
Why? What is it?

596
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,589
It's nothing.

597
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:23,393
I'd like to apologize.

598
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,521
I apologize as your fellow neighbor.

599
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,523
I didn't mean to block your way.

600
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,774
Peace?

601
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:30,984
All of a sudden?

602
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,902
Let's just make up.

603
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,740
We made peace, so can we go now?

604
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,283
Let's pretend this never happened.

605
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:41,411
-What?
-Can we go?

606
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,497
-Come on, let's go.
-Wait a minute.

607
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:47,959
Why are you two leaving just like that?

608
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,673
Why does she remind me of someone?
It's messing with my head.

609
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:56,176
You should let go of my hand.

610
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,848
You're the one who suggested
we forget about this, okay?

611
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,268
I know. Just don't change your tune later.

612
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:06,728
Change my tune?

613
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,065
Whatever. Let's never cross paths again.

614
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:12,942
Again…

615
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,445
There's a higher probability of seeing

616
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,490
an albino raccoon
than running into you again.

617
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:20,825
Right.

618
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,243
Let's part ways now.

619
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,913
-Fine. Let's do that.
-Okay.

620
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,295
Damn it! We live in the same direction.

621
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:37,592
RECRUITMENT NOTICE

622
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,469
RECRUITMENT NOTICE

623
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:42,680
What is this for?

624
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,350
Are you going to do it?

625
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,018
How can anyone apply for this?

626
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:49,145
-Read this.
-This is crazy.

627
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:50,688
When are they recruiting?

628
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,402
What is this?

629
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,195
It says "divorce."

630
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,405
Hey.

631
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:00,448
Look at the preferred qualifications.
"At least one divorce."

632
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:01,825
QUALIFICATIONS
AT LEAST ONE DIVORCE EXPERIENCE

633
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,701
-Don't you qualify?
-You should try out.

634
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:06,454
Noh Ki-jun!

635
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:10,458
Damn. This office is huge.

636
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:16,047
Hey, this must have cost a pretty penny.

637
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:20,343
Where's my desk? Where do I sit?

638
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,011
Look carefully.

639
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,807
It's way…

640
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,019
Way over there.

641
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:36,443
-Your call cannot be connected.
-Damn, I got sent to voicemail again.

642
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,991
The applicants…

643
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:46,870
The company put their trust in you
and assembled a task force.

644
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:50,290
They even gave us this huge office.

645
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:53,209
If this tanks, we're all doomed.

646
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:54,711
Do you hear me?

647
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,212
The applicants!

648
00:45:56,296 --> 00:45:57,422
What about the applicants?

649
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,924
Were you here the whole time?
Why didn't you answer?

650
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:02,051
What is it? What about the applicants?

651
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,078
DIVORCE INSURANCE TASK FORCE
INTERVIEW IN PROGRESS

652
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:30,455
What is your reason for applying?

653
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,625
I got divorced last year
but haven't been able to pay alimony yet.

654
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:37,378
-Can it apply retroactively?
-You've been married for ten years,

655
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:39,047
but you're interested
in divorce insurance.

656
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,758
I have a boyfriend, not a husband.

657
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,010
I want to get divorce insurance
before divorcing him.

658
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:46,846
Even if it was a common-law marriage,

659
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,057
it still counts as a divorce
if we split up, right?

660
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,559
We'll have to review those situations too.

661
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:57,398
Good job. Thank you for coming.

662
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:58,650
Next.

663
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:00,485
Just go.

664
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,611
Next, please.

665
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:04,614
-Thank you.
-Sure.

666
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:07,408
Next, please.

667
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:09,160
Next, please.

668
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:12,455
Hello.

669
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:13,581
Hello.

670
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:18,878
Ms. Joh Ah-young.

671
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:22,298
If I remember correctly,
didn't you say you were against marriage?

672
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:23,508
That's right, sir.

673
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,635
So why do you want
divorce insurance coverage?

674
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:26,719
Oh, right.

675
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,975
It's because I can divorce myself.

676
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,940
DIVORCE INSURANCE TASK FORCE
INTERVIEW IN PROGRESS

677
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,318
I'm not the only nutcase out there.

678
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:47,323
Yes, come in.

679
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:49,200
Hello.

680
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:51,578
Come on in…

681
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:53,788
Ma'am?

682
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:03,756
Great outfit.

683
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:06,467
RESUME, KANG HAN-DEUL

684
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,689
I see you worked as an underwriter.

685
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,608
I thought you were a dentist.

686
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:25,653
You got divorced most recently
out of all of today's applicants.

687
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:28,489
So that's why…

688
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,117
That's why you were
throwing away that mattress.

689
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,911
I totally understand.

690
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,122
I've been divorced three times myself.

691
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:38,750
Why are you telling me that?

692
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:42,086
It's a sensitive topic,
so I wanted to put you at ease.

693
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:49,093
Right. Insurance is a sensitive topic.

694
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:50,428
The coverage might be the same,

695
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,805
but it needs to be tailored
to each country's system.

696
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:54,557
Pet insurance has taken off in Europe,

697
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:57,185
but not in our country
where there are ten million pet owners.

698
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,395
Insurance policies read like legal text.

699
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:01,773
And who knows how it will change
in this economic climate?

700
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,484
Mr. Actuary, what do you think
the chances are

701
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,152
of divorce insurance succeeding?

702
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:10,782
What do you think, Ms. Underwriter?

703
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,077
They're as high as
a pure-white albino raccoon being born.

704
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:18,956
To pull off this 1 in 500,000 chance,

705
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,668
you'll need a skilled underwriter
like me on board.

706
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:44,691
Welcome to the team.

707
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,326
I don't know if you've heard,

708
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:58,371
but I'm a smiley nutcase.

709
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,707
-What?
-If you'll excuse me…

710
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,838
Be careful!

711
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:17,557
Ki-jun!

712
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,642
Ki-jun.

713
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:22,061
What the…

714
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:24,147
Hey, Ki-jun.

715
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,987
-Something big came up.
-What is it?

716
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,656
The quant assigned
to the Singapore branch.

717
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,199
What about the quant?

718
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:38,494
They're joining this project
with executive vice president status.

719
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,625
Why is a quant in Singapore coming here
instead of going to Wall Street?

720
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,169
That's what I want to know.

721
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:52,258
The CEO's daughter is getting divorced.

722
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,927
-What?
-So he says it's urgent.

723
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,013
His daughter is about to fall apart.

724
00:50:58,723 --> 00:50:59,724
Damn it.

725
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,976
Hey, you can do this, right?

726
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,644
No, make it happen no matter what.

727
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:05,897
Our lives are at stake here.

728
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,067
Let's do this.

729
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:41,432
DIVORCE INSURANCE TASK FORCE

730
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:42,850
USE DATA TO MAKE SMART CHOICES

731
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:50,983
All it took was one workshop,
and now you're all close.

732
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:53,027
People might think you guys are a family.

733
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:59,116
I can't believe we have five team members.

734
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,912
It'll be six members
once the executive vice president arrives.

735
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:06,207
Six members! Can you believe it?

736
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:13,923
Let's take a group photo at a studio
and hang it on the wall.

737
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:21,097
Hey, Ms. Kang.

738
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,141
You must be nervous
about your first project at our company.

739
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,476
Don't you worry.

740
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,813
We got your back, Ms. Kang.

741
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,651
Mr. Na, Ms. Kang isn't a newbie.

742
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,153
On top of that, she's a smiley nutcase.

743
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:40,283
-Oh, my.
-Right.

744
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:43,077
You didn't know?
Everyone in the company knows.

745
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:44,954
What does that mean?

746
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:47,665
A nutcase who says
whatever they want with a big smile.

747
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,304
You should have hurried and got on.

748
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:06,559
But is that something to be happy about?

749
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:08,019
Yes, sir.

750
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:11,939
Okay. In any case, let's give it our best.

751
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:13,190
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

752
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:16,527
This isn't a big deal. Why am I nervous?

753
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:18,446
What about the quant from Singapore?

754
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,282
The executive vice president?
They're coming today.

755
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,076
They flew in over the weekend
to join the project from the start.

756
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:26,454
-They sat in business class.
-I see.

757
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:30,291
Isn't a quant an investment analyst

758
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,002
who completely disregards human judgment

759
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:36,297
and relies 100%
on quantitative computer analysis?

760
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,924
Am I right?

761
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:39,425
You know it.

762
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:42,345
But isn't a bit much to have a quant
in insurance product development?

763
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,103
That's what I'm saying.

764
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,862
It won't be long until computers
create insurance products.

765
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:01,489
At this rate, people will marry AI.

766
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:02,657
And get divorced from it.

767
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:16,128
Isn't this elevator a little weird?

768
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:18,673
-What?
-Why aren't we at the 12th floor yet?

769
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,301
Stick to the walls!

770
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:25,513
-Please stop!
-Don't move!

771
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,515
Someone help us!

772
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,308
Be quiet and calm down.

773
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:35,231
Did you just…

774
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:37,400
Damn it. What the heck?

775
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:41,696
Damn it!

776
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,280
Did you pass gas, mister?

777
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,076
Don't call him mister.
He's still our team leader.

778
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,494
I'm so sorry.

779
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,454
I get gassy when I'm nervous.

780
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:52,123
-I'm sorry.
-Don't come near me.

781
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,431
It's an elevator demon!

782
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,942
-Geez, my heart.
-The elevator stopped, so how did it open?

783
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,239
Oh, damn it.

784
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,284
We're on the first floor.

785
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,745
Nobody pressed the button?

786
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,913
You were right there!
Why didn't you press it?

787
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,750
-Why?
-I thought somebody else did.

788
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:42,631
Let's start off by pulling a list
based on profit projections and ROE.

789
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:45,009
Let's have the quanty pull the data,

790
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:48,095
and please put together a file
with standardized scores for analysis.

791
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,264
When it comes to factors,
the more, the better.

792
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,392
A greater number of factors
leads to more possible strategies.

793
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,482
I'm sorry, but who are you?

794
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,485
I'm Jeon Na-rae.

795
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:06,864
Jeon Na-rae?

796
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:14,080
You're the new executive vice president?

797
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:16,832
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

798
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,709
Hello.

799
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:28,469
Do you two know each other?

800
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:32,765
I'm Mr. Noh Ki-jun's ex-wife.

801
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:33,933
What?

802
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,020
No, she's not.

803
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,147
She's not my ex-wife.

804
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,193
She's my ex-ex-ex wife.

805
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:51,575
-The one who flew in business class.
-Right.

SPECIAL THANKS TO PARK YOUNG-GYU
FOR HIS GUEST APPEARANCE

819
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:15,951
I'd like to develop a big-data based
divorce prediction model.

820
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:17,786
But shouldn't we first convince people

821
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,372
that divorce is a type of risk

822
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:22,374
that requires coverage?

823
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:25,419
Is it just me,
or do you also feel some weird vibes?

824
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,422
If I could knit
a whole new life for myself,

825
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,007
I'd choose Ki-jun again.

826
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:32,468
Will this get approved in the meeting?

827
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,428
It received conditional approval.

828
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,931
That's the condition? And not the goal?

829
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,849
Isn't that basically a safety net?

830
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:40,893
Do you think we can do this?
