DIVORCE PROTECTION INSURANCE

6
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:20,080
Is this the promo flyer
you used at the wedding fair?

7
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,874
-Yes.
-Yes.

8
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:26,629
We received a complaint.

9
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,005
-What?
-What?

10
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,675
The flyer contains information
that violates insurance regulations.

11
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,014
A complaint, sir?

12
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,517
This isn't a contract
or terms and conditions.

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,353
We just made a small batch
for promotion purposes.

14
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,355
We've secured pre-approval

15
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,398
and included all required notices.

16
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:48,901
I'm aware of that,
but that isn't the issue.

17
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,487
"During the execution and solicitation
of insurance contracts,

18
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,616
items exceeding 30,000 won
may not be provided to consumers."

19
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,910
This is the provision
you allegedly violated.

20
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,703
-But…
-Jeez.

21
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,458
We only handed out wet wipes
and tissues that day.

22
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:07,419
They might've cost 3,000 won,
but certainly not over 30,000 won.

23
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,965
Maybe they confused the promo gift
with another company's?

24
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,349
DIVORCE CEREMONY

25
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,851
This part right here.

26
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:25,229
Can you host a divorce ceremony
for less than 30,000 won?

27
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,149
A divorce ceremony…

28
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,818
My understanding is that

29
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,904
the insurance law was recently updated.

30
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,198
The new regulation sets a limit
of 200,000 won per product

31
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:38,993
or 10% of the annual premium.

32
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,202
Exactly.

33
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,037
That's right. You're well-informed.

34
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,247
Then what's the issue?

35
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,373
The part that says,

36
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:48,669
"However, this applies solely to items
that reduce the risk of an accident."

37
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:50,296
A divorce ceremony

38
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,382
does not qualify as an item
that reduces the risk of an accident,

39
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,677
meaning it does not lower
the divorce rate for policyholders.

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,720
This is the issue.

41
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,894
The person who filed the complaint
pointed out this violation,

42
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,353
which even we had overlooked.

43
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,024
Yes, it seems so.

44
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,193
This person's skill
matches that of an underwriter.

45
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:14,862
I know.

46
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,031
Then I'll take that

47
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,533
as you admitting to it.

48
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:22,369
-But…
-Excuse me!

49
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,414
We didn't violate anything.

50
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,917
He's right. We haven't hosted
a divorce ceremony yet.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,001
Maybe not now,

52
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,503
but you will later, right?

53
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,673
No, sir. We won't provide
any divorce ceremonies.

54
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,177
Then was that false advertisement?

55
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,512
Would you rather face
the harsher penalty of that provision?

56
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,557
No, sir. It definitely wasn't
a false advertisement.

57
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,100
Look here, Mr. Noh Ki-jun.

58
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,435
I mean…

59
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,104
It'll be fine as long as

60
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,106
none of the first ten people
who signed up get divorced.

61
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,653
How does that even make sense?

62
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,780
We'll provide divorce prevention
management until the contract term ends.

63
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,907
Just like the health management services.

64
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,883
If that's what you're willing to do, fine.

65
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:21,804
However,

66
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,807
if you end up hosting a divorce ceremony,

67
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,725
you will be held fully accountable,
including today's issue,

68
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,103
which means no limited-time sales.

69
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,938
And of course, no official launch.

70
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:32,898
Are we clear?

71
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,483
Yes, sir.

72
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,195
Yes, sir. Understood.

73
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:40,364
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

74
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,991
-Your bag.
-Oh, my.

75
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,200
Get your bag.

76
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,911
-Hurry.
-Goodbye, sir!

77
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:57,255
DIRECTOR OH MI-YEONG

78
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,882
DIRECTOR OH MI-YEONG

79
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,260
MARRIAGE COUNSELING CENTER

80
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,354
This is my guess
based on the material you provided.

81
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:13,439
Thank you.

82
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,484
You know it's unreasonable
to make judgments based on this, right?

83
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,652
Yes, of course.

84
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:23,032
It's unreasonable for anyone to judge
others' marital issues in the first place.

85
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,707
We appreciate that you responded
to our unreasonable request.

86
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,837
Please consider this a type of
multidimensional data collection analysis.

87
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,297
Of course.

88
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,058
This is unexpected, though.

89
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,392
This policyholder came up top?

90
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:54,229
The questionnaire showed
no signs of marital conflict.

91
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,774
They even put down zero number of fights.

92
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,442
You're right.

93
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,530
Is there a married couple in this world
without any conflicts?

94
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,615
No.

95
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,533
Almost none, probably.

96
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,494
That's right.

97
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:12,456
Conflict among people
is both natural and unavoidable.

98
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,043
Claiming there's no conflict
actually suggests there's a problem.

99
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,630
This person is doing everything possible
to avoid conflict.

100
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,802
Confronting the truth doesn't mean
it will resolve everything,

101
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,763
but avoiding it will
certainly change nothing.

102
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,681
It means there's no room for improvement.

103
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,850
So that's why…

104
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:35,145
Now, do you understand
why this person was my top pick?

105
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,438
-Yes.
-Yes.

106
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,612
I thought if a married couple
baked cookies or a cake together,

107
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,156
it could help mend their relationship.

108
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,867
So I'd like to arrange
some couples baking classes.

109
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,452
If that's the case, I'm not sure.

110
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:54,206
Baking requires much more focus
and effort than you'd expect.

111
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,083
It's one thing if they're on good terms.

112
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,253
But if they're not,
it could end up causing more frustration.

113
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,131
There are actually many couples
who end up fighting and leave.

114
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,011
Jeez, what the heck?

115
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,930
It's you.

116
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:12,724
Do you know him?

117
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,768
No.

118
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,563
His father owns this place.

119
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:18,939
He's just full of energy.

120
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,943
He handles the building maintenance here

121
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,571
and teaches at a dance studio.

122
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,908
Actually, I think dancing
will help you more.

123
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,910
There's more physical interaction
in dancing.

124
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,417
We meet again.

125
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,501
Oh, my.

126
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,753
So you do know him.

127
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,299
I'll go bake a nice cake for you.

128
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,850
-This must be fate.
-No.

129
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:55,934
It's just a coincidence.

130
00:07:56,018 --> 00:08:00,147
I asked the couples manager for
your number because I wanted to see you,

131
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,858
but you didn't ask for a second date.

132
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,569
There were privacy issues, so--

133
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,112
I want you to teach dance lessons.

134
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,034
You're very proactive.

135
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,330
If that's what you want, Ms. Ah-young.

136
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,414
No.

137
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,583
This is a business proposition.

138
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,212
I want you to teach married policyholders
who are at risk of divorce

139
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,546
how to dance.

140
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,258
Okay.

141
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:34,681
Thank you for becoming a partner
of our divorce prevention program.

142
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,767
Excuse me?

143
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,645
What's this…

144
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,396
But, wait…

145
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,817
FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY SERVICE

146
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,657
Management until the contract term ends?

147
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,575
What made you say something so outrageous?

148
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,536
Well, our goal was
to have a divorce rate of zero.

149
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,539
But that was for a six-month term,
not the end of a contract term.

150
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,625
Yes, but we still don't lose out on this.

151
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,254
It's bad enough we have to meet
the company's conditions, but now this?

152
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,422
There are too many things to consider.

153
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,592
We just have to think of it
as people showing interest.

154
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,427
Right.

155
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,430
Ms. Ah-young!

156
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,933
If you dance on the street again,
I'll call the cops on you.

157
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,476
Will we continue to see each other?

158
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,603
Not on a personal level.

159
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,606
-Why not?
-I told you I don't believe in marriage.

160
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,608
But you can still date, right?

161
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,528
Just as there are
different types of vegans,

162
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,655
it's the same for people
who don't believe in marriage.

163
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,865
-I'm the type who doesn't even date.
-Why?

164
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,493
Because I refuse to waste time and energy
on something useless.

165
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,869
Then what do you do in your free time?

166
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,121
I don't have any free time.

167
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,622
Come on.

168
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,542
If I have free time,
I learn something new or pursue a hobby.

169
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,127
I invest that time in myself.

170
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,921
You sure keep yourself busy.

171
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,007
On that note, I got you a gift.

172
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,341
Please don't.

173
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,847
It's napa cabbage from my farm.

174
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,059
Actually, I'm a farmer.

175
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,604
I thought your father owned this building.

176
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,440
That's right.

177
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,484
But I gave up my parents'
financial support to pursue dancing.

178
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,780
So I looked for a job I could do
alongside dancing,

179
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,074
and I ended up finding this part-time job
harvesting napa cabbage.

180
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,370
Then I took a liking to farming
and became a farmer.

181
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,459
Make a wrap and eat it.

182
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,044
It's sweet and tasty.

183
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,595
Fine, then.

184
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,974
Being nonchalant
is what makes you attractive.

185
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,478
Stop, unless you want to
get slapped by this cabbage.

186
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,604
I'll be off now.

187
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,566
Goodbye, Ms. Ah-young!

188
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,650
Take care!

189
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,368
What the hell are you talking about?

190
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,203
Say that again.

191
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,080
Do what until the term ends?

192
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,044
Why are there more obstacles to overcome?

193
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,046
We already have more than enough
challenges to prevent as it is!

194
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,465
Here are more special management cases
we have to prevent.

195
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,175
What's the matter with you?

196
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,259
Damn it.

197
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,845
DR. OH'S LIST

198
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:19,846
Ten people?

199
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,681
Ten more on top of
the first ten who signed up?

200
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,519
There's this list too.

201
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,062
Hey, Ms. Kang.

202
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:31,441
We can look at that later.
Why bring it up now?

203
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,111
What's this? Ten more people?

204
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,531
How many are there in total? Thirty?

205
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,157
Damn it.

206
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,701
We're not
a divorce prevention management team!

207
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,832
It's not 30 people, sir.

208
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,545
It's not?

209
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:55,549
But Ms. Kang, you're never wrong.

210
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,135
Is there something else, then?

211
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,095
The experts' lists are almost the same.

212
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,471
Take a look, sir.

213
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:04,266
No way.

214
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,227
DR. OH'S LIST
PROFESSOR KIM'S LIST

215
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,606
So experts' views
are the same across the board?

216
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:13,692
It seems so, sir.

217
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,319
There's a shorter list
of people to manage now.

218
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,448
-Which means a higher risk.
-Why would you bring that up?

219
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,658
Don't you know logical conjunction?

220
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,827
Intersecting entity characteristics
combine multiplicatively.

221
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,247
But the number of entities
in the union has decreased.

222
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,500
When two or more entities
have corresponding input values--

223
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:31,751
Hey!

224
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,545
Yes, sir.

225
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,298
Take your arguing outside, damn it.

226
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,841
Read the room, will you?

227
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,885
What's even more shocking is that

228
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,179
the top pick is the same.

229
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,681
What?

230
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,434
What do you mean by that?

231
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,229
According to the experts, this person
is most likely to get divorced.

232
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,734
And this person is on the list
of the first ten people who signed up.

233
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,823
NUMBER 1, GU MI-RAE

234
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,116
What does this mean?

235
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,913
Am I the only one who doesn't get it?

236
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,582
Can someone explain this to me?

237
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,293
Anyone? Hello?

238
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,712
Excuse me. Hello?

239
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,755
Excuse me?

240
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,092
Let's see here.

241
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,472
If the experts chose the same person
as their number one pick,

242
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,433
that means their chance of divorce
is that much higher.

243
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:32,187
But if they're also on the list
of the first ten applicants,

244
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,730
that means…

245
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,652
Oh, damn it.

246
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,405
-Mr. Na!
-Mr. Na!

247
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,490
Are you okay, old man?

248
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,534
Hey, you jerk.
Don't call our team leader an old man!

249
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,994
-I'm sorry, Mr. Na!
-His eyes!

250
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,246
-We need to do CPR!
-Do CPR!

251
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,042
PRESIDENT LEE JEONG-SIN

252
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,170
This will hit them pretty hard.

253
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,466
Let's see how they handle it.

254
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,346
DIVORCE PROTECTION INSURANCE

255
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,726
Ms. Jeon.

256
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,811
Hello, sir.

257
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,980
What on earth happened?

258
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,898
Someone filed a complaint to the FSS?

259
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:18,984
Please take a seat.

260
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,530
We made a mistake
with one of the provisions on the flyer.

261
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:27,367
-What?
-I'm sorry. I should've been thorough.

262
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,703
This product must be launched
without any issues.

263
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,704
You know that.

264
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,872
I'll pay closer attention, sir.

265
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,958
Damn it.

266
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,169
However,

267
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,922
it's strange how they knew
such a provision.

268
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:44,301
This could be the job of an insider,
so I'll meet with the security manager.

269
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,719
What?

270
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,471
No, there's no way
it was someone from the inside.

271
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:52,851
We should also be more careful
when sending material to the China branch.

272
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,811
Yes, we should.

273
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,104
Don't worry about that.

274
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,897
I'll monitor things.

275
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,691
Damn it.

276
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,746
Hey, we need to tighten security
from now on,

277
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,539
so that no one suspects anything.

278
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,624
Yes.

279
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,792
Make sure to be discreet.

280
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:19,794
Okay.

281
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,888
Get out!

282
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,556
Get out, now!

283
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,600
Get out and take care of it.

284
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,394
Don't you dare come back
before solving this issue!

285
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,441
Beg as much as you want,

286
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,486
but I'm not opening this door!

287
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,113
Mr. Na is the one
trapped in there, not us.

288
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,371
Gu Mi-rae…

289
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,122
Gu Mi-rae?

290
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,751
This is the person I consulted
at the wedding fair.

291
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:00,835
I remember her name.

292
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,629
Do you remember anything else?

293
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,882
I think her outfit was a bit unusual.

294
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,803
I was all over the place that day,
so I don't remember.

295
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,180
Okay. What's the address?

296
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,598
Yangsam-dong.

297
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,017
Let's head to the scene for now.

298
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,019
We need to go to the scene to investigate.

299
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,104
"Investigate"?

300
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,147
Are you a detective?
What do you plan to do there?

301
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,400
Let's just go, Detective Kang.
I mean, Ms. Kang.

302
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,110
What? Right now?

303
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,113
We have to find signs of divorce.

304
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,408
If there are warning signs of divorce,
we must handle it within the golden hour.

305
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,702
-You sound like a doctor.
-Scalpel. Never mind.

306
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,954
Wait, we should call her first.

307
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,256
<i>Hello?</i>

308
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,758
Hello, is this Ms. Gu Mi-rae?

309
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,677
<i>Yes, it is. Who am I speaking with?</i>

310
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,722
Oh, I'm…

311
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,308
We met before at the wedding fair.

312
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,227
The thing is…

313
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,106
I'm not sure if you remember,

314
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,649
but you and I…

315
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,984
<i>Did I consult with you?</i>

316
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,570
Yes, that's right.

317
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,489
<i>I see. How can I help you?</i>

318
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,867
The thing is…

319
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,162
If it's okay with you,

320
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,247
may I visit your place

321
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:23,001
and speak with you…

322
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,295
<i>Are you asking for</i>
<i>a site-visit consultation?</i>

323
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,505
Yes, that's right.
A site-visit consultation.

324
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,717
<i>-When would you like to come?</i>
-Excuse me?

325
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,762
<i>How about today?</i>
<i>I happen to have some free time.</i>

326
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,930
Yes, we'll head out now.

327
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,725
<i>I'll see you later, then.</i>

328
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,018
Yes, thank you.

329
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,317
She sounded way too happy to invite me.

330
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,736
-Really?
-Yes.

331
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,446
-Then we should go right away. Come on.
-Okay.

332
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:54,193
FIRST TO SIGN UP LIST, DR. OH'S LIST

333
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:55,325
FIRST TO SIGN UP LIST, DR. OH'S LIST

334
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,791
I never violated
the promotional gift regulation

335
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,126
even when I was the top insurance agent
in Ssangmun-dong.

336
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,550
But you'd have to be an expert

337
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,011
to know such regulations.

338
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,849
No, there's no way someone would…

339
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,852
There must've been a lawyer
at the wedding fair that day.

340
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,563
APPROVAL DENIED

341
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,107
I forgot about these rejected cases.

342
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:32,821
Jeez. We have to prevent divorces
and secure contracts.

343
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,155
When will we get these done?

344
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,705
Do we need to recruit more staff?

345
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,211
<i>You'll rise up, you'll rise up</i>

346
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,548
<i>You'll rise up, you'll rise up</i>

347
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,217
<i>If you keep working hard</i>

348
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,512
<i>It'll become a reality</i>

349
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,807
<i>You'll rise up, you'll rise up</i>

350
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,477
<i>You'll rise up, you'll rise up</i>

351
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,813
<i>Even if you're not good at anything</i>

352
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,316
<i>One of these days</i>

353
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:16,322
<i>I know you'll rise like the sun</i>

354
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,452
Very good!

355
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,706
Ladies, did you have a good time today?

356
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,249
-Yes!
-Yes!

357
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:31,296
To keep being happy like today
for the rest of your lives,

358
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:35,174
I prepared a premium dementia
insurance policy!

359
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,138
Okay, ladies.

360
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,347
Here we go.

361
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,182
It's premium insurance.

362
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,059
That's right.

363
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,854
You can't trust your kids,
but you can trust this.

364
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,606
Yes, that's right.

365
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:54,068
-It's a premium policy.
-Okay.

366
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,779
Do I have to fill out this part too?

367
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,406
Write 5 kg less than your actual weight.

368
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,782
Really? Can I do that?

369
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,409
Okay, looks good.

370
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,829
NA DAE-BOK

371
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,205
It's my respected senior colleague.

372
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:08,917
Hello, Mr. Na.

373
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,084
<i>Chang-hee, are you busy?</i>

374
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,295
I'm in the middle of a consultation.

375
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,379
A consultation?

376
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,089
I shouldn't interrupt, then. I'll hang up.

377
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,091
I'll visit you shortly.

378
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,384
Okay, goodbye.

379
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,764
Ma'am, just fill it out.

380
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,182
-Did I get it right?
-Yes, you did.

381
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,225
Look at this kid.

382
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,811
He reminds me of myself back in the day.

383
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,191
It's great how he's working hard.

384
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,861
Some employees were on their computer
outside of working hours.

385
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,740
Is that so?

386
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:44,452
As requested, I checked the system
activity from the last six months,

387
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,579
and there was no sign of hacking.

388
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,082
But there were employees
who used their computer

389
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,000
outside of working hours.

390
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,252
Who was it?

391
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:57,256
Mr. Noh Ki-jun and Ms. Kang Han-deul
of the New Product Development Team.

392
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,557
Is it possible
that an outsider accessed it?

393
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,934
No, that's impossible.

394
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,561
Outsiders are prohibited
from entering after business hours,

395
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,355
and company computers are securely locked.

396
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:16,484
Unless they stole an employee ID number,
it's impossible to use a computer.

397
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,568
Understood.

398
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,862
Please continue to check the system.

399
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,906
I'll report to you on a regular basis.

400
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,621
If it wasn't a hacker,

401
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,707
who could it have been?

402
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:39,590
Yes?

403
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,181
You're here.

404
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,933
Yes, ma'am. How may I help you?

405
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,810
-Sir.
-Yes?

406
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,063
Let's launch a new product soon.

407
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,736
DIVORCE INSURANCE
POLICY TERMS & CONDITIONS

408
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,487
Divorce insurance?

409
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:05,658
Adding benefits to existing products
is rather boring now,

410
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,076
don't you think?

411
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,289
I think our perspective
on what a crisis is needs to change.

412
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,916
But would this be commercially viable?

413
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,920
I'm suggesting a new paradigm
in the existing insurance industry.

414
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,882
This product will definitely
question societal trends

415
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,259
and create waves.

416
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,179
On that note,

417
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,016
I'd like to see the official launch
of divorce insurance…

418
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,103
by Best General Insurance.

419
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,991
I think it's around here.

420
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,705
This is it.

421
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,139
-Welcome.
-Hello.

422
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,519
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

423
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,313
Thank you.

424
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,616
The atmosphere here is rather unusual.

425
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,409
It looks pretty.

426
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,129
Thank you for making time for us.

427
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,047
I should be thanking you.

428
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,009
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

429
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,806
Shall we begin now?

430
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:52,932
-Excuse me?
-Excuse me?

431
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,308
Yes, of course.

432
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,644
Ms. Kang, do you want to explain?

433
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,854
-Me?
-Shall I do it?

434
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,606
-Oh, right.
-Ms. Kang, if you can explain…

435
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,568
Or shall I begin?

436
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,375
What's this?

437
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,515
So you're here because of insurance,
not a tarot reading?

438
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,351
-Yes.
-Yes.

439
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:40,813
I think there was a misunderstanding
during the explanation.

440
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,357
You sounded so welcoming on the phone

441
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,401
that I misunderstood.

442
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,237
I ran a tarot reading booth
at the wedding fair.

443
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,281
That's when I signed up for the insurance.

444
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:53,159
-I see.
-So that's why…

445
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,536
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

446
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,497
I thought you came
for a follow-up reading.

447
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,374
It's hard enough as it is
since I decided to get divorced.

448
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,043
-What?
-What?

449
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:03,836
Please leave.

450
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,963
Wait a minute, let's--

451
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:08,257
-Let's talk for a moment.
-It'll just take a second.

452
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,717
Please leave.

453
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,011
Are you sure we can't talk?

454
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:16,933
I want a divorce ceremony.

455
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,434
I'll contact you once I choose a date.

456
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,770
-But…
-Ma'am!

457
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,897
Ma'am?

458
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,620
Choosing a divorce date, huh?

459
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,623
I guess people
set divorce dates these days.

460
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,960
If they want a divorce,
they might as well do it on a good date.

461
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,044
I suppose so.

462
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,090
When you think about it, a divorce date
is more important than a wedding date.

463
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,841
Do you think this gate will open again?

464
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,352
What are you doing?

465
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,480
I don't think it's the right time.

466
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,316
Jeez.

467
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,319
We're here for a tarot reading.

468
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,824
Can we get a tarot consultation?

469
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,492
That's right. A tarot reading.

470
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,340
I guess it opened up again.

471
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:40,141
The tea has gone cold.
Let me brew a fresh pot for you.

472
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,225
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

473
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,564
What do you plan on doing?

474
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:47,857
I'm going to ask the tarot cards.

475
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,901
-Were you being serious?
-Yes.

476
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,538
Just a fair warning.
Tarot should not be taken lightly.

477
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,748
Yes, ma'am.

478
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:11,714
Please ask a question.

479
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:17,970
Will I be able to successfully carry out
the task assigned to me?

480
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,437
Please select three cards.

481
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,278
What about this one?

482
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:35,321
This one?

483
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,739
Or whatever you want.

484
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,074
Right.

485
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,158
This one.

486
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:44,121
-And this one.
-Yes, that one.

487
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,515
The cards say you'll eventually succeed

488
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,100
though the process may be difficult.

489
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,184
Really?

490
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,854
This card specifically indicates success.

491
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,273
Does this mean our project will succeed?

492
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,446
What is it that makes you so happy?

493
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:22,243
It's about helping you live happily
and not get divorced.

494
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,286
Excuse me?

495
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,548
So for the tarot reading to be true,
I can't get divorced.

496
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,967
If I get divorced,
the tarot reading will be false.

497
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:40,511
Is that it?

498
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,681
This is a dilemma.

499
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,726
Maybe this is a sign from above
that you should reconsider things.

500
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,689
"A sign from above"?

501
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,197
We first met while walking
the Camino de Santiago.

502
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,911
<i>One day, I experienced severe burnout.</i>

503
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:09,582
<i>So I quit my job</i>
<i>and got plane tickets on a whim.</i>

504
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:16,964
Safe travels.

505
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,051
<i>The person who held out his hand</i>
<i>while I was on the ground</i>

506
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,887
<i>was my current husband.</i>

507
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,141
<i>When we learned each other's names,</i>
<i>we were fascinated</i>

508
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,726
<i>because my name means "future"</i>

509
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,144
<i>while his name, Hyeon-jae,</i>
<i>means "present."</i>

510
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:36,859
<i>And that's how</i>
<i>we just started walking together.</i>

511
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,672
-Don't your legs hurt?
-It's okay. We're going downhill.

512
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,433
<i>When we saw 0 km on the Fisterra marker,</i>

513
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,020
<i>we hugged each other and cried.</i>

514
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,022
-We need photos!
-Yes!

515
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,908
-Did you know?
-What?

516
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,451
<i>When he shaved his beard,</i>

517
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:31,080
<i>I was shocked at how good-looking he was.</i>

518
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,709
They say the Camino de Santiago
and Jeju Olle Trail

519
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,294
established a friendship pact.

520
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,547
Really?

521
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:44,009
Yes, so if you complete both trails,

522
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,844
you can get a dual completion certificate.

523
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:49,473
It's as if the end
of the Camino de Santiago

524
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:51,767
meets the beginning
of the Jeju Olle Trail.

525
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,186
It's a meaningful meeting.

526
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,396
You're right.

527
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,439
So…

528
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,609
Would you like to walk

529
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,030
the Jeju Olle Trail with me later?

530
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,704
<i>That was his proposal.</i>

531
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:16,667
<i>We registered our marriage</i>
<i>as soon as we returned to Korea.</i>

532
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,022
My husband is a documentary photographer.

533
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:40,065
He travels the world
to take photos of animals.

534
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,735
He's away for at least 3,500 hours
on each assignment.

535
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,906
We've never once gotten into a fight.

536
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,452
I'd rather that we fight all the time
like other married couples do.

537
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,537
I've spent more time alone
after getting married

538
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,623
than I have with him.

539
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:56,749
Actually, no.

540
00:31:56,832 --> 00:32:00,127
I've always been alone.

541
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:08,385
I don't even know if he's dead or alive.

542
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:09,928
Now he's trying to photograph
Korean tigers.

543
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,764
That damn tiger!

544
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,483
I want to have a baby

545
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:26,111
and talk and laugh
as we watch them grow up.

546
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:28,739
That's the future I envisioned.

547
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,367
But he's only focused on the present,

548
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,868
just like his name.

549
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:35,913
I see.

550
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,417
I'm sure he's staying true to the present
to provide a better future.

551
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,046
If you still have feelings
for your husband…

552
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,009
You two should find a solution together.

553
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,683
Try and find one if you can.

554
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,850
If you do,

555
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,978
I'll take it as a sign from above.

556
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,651
Do you have any idea
where your husband might be?

557
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:07,695
No, not really.

558
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,615
But he tends to upload photos
of where he stays

559
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,409
as his profile pictures…

560
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,706
It's just green.

561
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,090
I'm just asking out of curiosity,

562
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,800
but do tigers really exist in our country?

563
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,643
They say they've gone extinct, sir.

564
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:42,271
But according to my husband,

565
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,399
they definitely exist
based on consistent witness accounts.

566
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:48,235
He got a tip from a hiker
who claimed he saw a tiger

567
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,404
at Balwangsan Mountain
in Gangwon Province last winter.

568
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,322
So he took photos
of footprints in the snow.

569
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,869
So it's possible they exist…

570
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:57,995
I'm sorry.

571
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:06,295
He drives an off-road car with antennas
that look like insect feelers.

572
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,714
If you see a man with a long beard
like a Puritan,

573
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,674
that'll be my husband.

574
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:13,260
Please let me know if you find him,

575
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:14,845
and I'll go there.

576
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,930
We'll find him and contact you.

577
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:19,141
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

578
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:24,897
Let's go.

579
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,441
Long antennas and a beard…

580
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,817
Has a Puritan beard…

581
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,659
What place looks that green
at this time of year?

582
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,411
I'll do an image search.

583
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:40,496
Okay.

584
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,295
I think this is the place.

585
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,507
"Gorangae."

586
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,050
This is it, right?

587
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,135
Yes, I think so.

588
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,345
What's the address?

589
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,932
It's Gorangae Village, Daegiri,
Gangwon Province.

590
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,017
-Gorangae Village?
-Yes.

591
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:04,853
Let's get going.

592
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,980
What? Right now?

593
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:11,026
"If there are warning signs of divorce,
we must handle it within the golden hour."

594
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,653
Isn't that what you said?

595
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:17,950
Let's go.

596
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:23,247
You memorized it verbatim. Let's go, then.

597
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:35,801
PLUS GENERAL INSURANCE

598
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,685
CLEANING SUPPLIES BOX

599
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,578
A toy that uses inertia
and centrifugal force.

600
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,581
It's a thing of beauty.

601
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:09,543
It originally comes from
an indigenous weapon called a "<i>bola.</i>"

602
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,670
There are many other theories,
but that's the most plausible one.

603
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:13,463
And yo-yo means

604
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,924
"to come back" in the Filipino language.

605
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:17,843
Let me see it.

606
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,928
Do you know how to yo-yo?

607
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,097
No.

608
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,601
I just need to put my finger in it
and throw it, right?

609
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,687
No, you'll get hurt.
You said yourself it's a weapon.

610
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,024
And this model isn't
exactly for beginners.

611
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,783
Watch carefully.

612
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,495
Slip the ring on the yo-yo's string

613
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:46,663
onto your middle finger.

614
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,832
And you can't just wind the string
any way you like.

615
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,418
Use your left index finger
and wind it once first.

616
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,505
Then the rest of your fingers
go like this.

617
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,049
Think of them as support.

618
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,806
Okay, I got it.

619
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,564
-Slip it on your finger.
-Like this?

620
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:13,649
No.

621
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,610
-Like this?
-The direction is…

622
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,571
You have to…

623
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,699
Like this.

624
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:25,494
Right, just like this.

625
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,745
Then the rest of your fingers

626
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:30,040
go like this.

627
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,334
Move this here…

628
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,462
And then the rest of your fingers

629
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,048
act as support.

630
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:43,428
Once you grip the yo-yo,
raise it to shoulder level,

631
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,806
then extend your arm and release it.

632
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,183
Extend and release.

633
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,523
No, not like that.

634
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,817
Release it at the last second.

635
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,028
It goes in this direction.

636
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:03,156
Release at the last second.

637
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,117
-Release at…
-Release at the last second.

638
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,665
Your palm should face up.

639
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,167
Hold the yo-yo

640
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:16,920
in this direction.

641
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:20,465
And raise your arm to shoulder level.

642
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:21,883
Release at the count of three.

643
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,136
One, two, three. Release.

644
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,641
Hey, it's spinning.

645
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:34,980
Eyes forward.

646
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,983
It won't come back up if it's crooked.

647
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,570
Now, give it a tug.

648
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,544
Damn it.

649
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:58,879
TRAVESTY

650
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,637
What in the world? He wants to video chat?

651
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:08,722
Jeez.

652
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,223
AN WUSS-MAN

653
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:12,309
<i>-No, don't do it like that from behind.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

654
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,394
<i>Don't touch me there.</i>

655
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,688
<i>I'm sorry. I'm just a bit flustered.</i>

656
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,315
<i>-Mr. An, calm down.</i>
<i>-I didn't mean to hug you.</i>

657
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,233
<i>-Just do it calmly.</i>
<i>-Is that okay?</i>

658
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,819
<i>Wait, hold on.</i>

659
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,780
<i>-Are you okay?</i>
<i>-Mr. An!</i>

660
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,282
<i>Just calm down and do it slowly.</i>

661
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,700
<i>-Just a moment.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

662
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,536
<i>Please wait.</i>

663
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,080
<i>-Damn it.</i>
<i>-Did it get on you?</i>

664
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,629
-Not that side. This side.
-I'm sorry.

665
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:41,838
Grab my arm, please.

666
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:45,884
-I'm sorry.
-Seriously?

667
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,761
Who was it that made you panic?

668
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:51,723
Damn it, I'm screwed.

669
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,517
VIDEO CALL ENDED

670
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,772
It was probably nothing.

671
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,482
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.

672
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,983
Like our intimate mattress scene?

673
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,008
Exactly. This is nothing
compared to what we did.

674
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,472
Where's Ms. Joh right now?

675
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:34,850
She says she's almost here.

676
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:36,810
Here she is.

677
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,353
There you are, Ah-young.

678
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,814
-You're here.
-You made it.

679
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,734
Isn't this too much?

680
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:46,862
Why are we being asked to find someone?

681
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,072
Think of it as going camping
where there's a nice view.

682
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:51,408
You said it was a countryside village.

683
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:52,534
There's nothing to see.

684
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,580
Still, let's get going.

685
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:02,204
TRAVESTY
GO TO GORANGAE VILLAGE RIGHT NOW

686
00:41:02,204 --> 00:41:04,713
TRAVESTY
GO TO GORANGAE VILLAGE RIGHT NOW

687
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:05,714
Holy cow.

688
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,090
What is it now?

689
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:08,758
He said to go
to Gorangae Village right now.

690
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,261
Gorangae Village?

691
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,265
Mr. Na!

692
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:16,600
Hey, Nam Chang-hee!

693
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,313
You look like you're doing great.

694
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:24,191
Why are you so early?
I came down early myself.

695
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:25,942
"Always arrive 30 minutes prior."

696
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:28,236
It's one of the Ten Commandments of Sales
you taught me.

697
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,321
Jeez.

698
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,114
But my revered mentor called me,

699
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:33,033
so I came one hour early.

700
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:36,077
You can do anything you set your mind to.

701
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,038
Come on.
I'll treat you to some great coffee.

702
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,122
Thank you, sir.

703
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:43,293
-Amazing, right?
-Yes, sir.

704
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,921
This coffee is for executives only.

705
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,089
The crema that forms on top is amazing.

706
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:50,217
-It's only for executives?
-Yes.

707
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,135
There's a senior managing director
on my team.

708
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,970
She's my direct superior.

709
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,766
I'm her right-hand man.

710
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,979
I'm amazed you started as an agent
and became a team leader.

711
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:04,856
If you keep this up,
you might become an executive.

712
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,818
No, that's only possible for those
from prestigious backgrounds.

713
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,072
I actually made more money back then.

714
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,866
Then why did you…

715
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,495
I was caught up in making sales.

716
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,538
I didn't get a chance
to watch the kids grow up.

717
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,875
There were days when I had ten meals
because I had to meet clients.

718
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:26,836
But on some days, if the timing was off,

719
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,880
I'd starve the whole day.

720
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:32,634
Then I'd have to entertain clients
and drink all night long.

721
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:38,223
That's why I always have
digestive issues now.

722
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,267
Hey, it's ready.

723
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,145
Now then.

724
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,315
The 11th Commandment of Sales.

725
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,526
"Eat your meals on time."

726
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,737
Yes, sir.

727
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,156
Let's go.

728
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,868
So how is it?
Selling insurance must be tough.

729
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:02,038
I still like making sales
since you earn as much as you work.

730
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:07,168
That sounds about right

731
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,337
since you don't have a wife or kids yet.

732
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:10,630
You're still in your prime.

733
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:12,090
On that note…

734
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,343
Do you want to work with me?

735
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,512
-Excuse me?
-I need you to make sales for me.

736
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,097
But I'm already doing that.

737
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,599
No, not for existing insurance.
It's for a new one.

738
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:24,728
My team has developed
a new insurance product.

739
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:25,937
Divorce insurance.

740
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:27,230
Divorce insurance?

741
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:30,317
-Yes, it's this right here.
-Yes, sir.

742
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,987
We're still in the testing stage
and need to meet some goals,

743
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,032
but two contracts got rejected.

744
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,366
Can you take care of them?

745
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,702
Do you think you can do it?

746
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:41,995
That's not that many cases.

747
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:45,457
Yes, but this insurance
is unlike any other, so it won't be easy.

748
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,167
Still, I know the ropes.

749
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,376
I'll take care of it right away.

750
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:53,006
Jeez. Baby Chang-hee is all grown up now.

751
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,968
It's still nothing
compared to your level of passion.

752
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,554
I suppose so.

753
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,349
I was really something back then.

754
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:09,189
It's Carrot Man!

755
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,483
Hey there, kids!

756
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,069
Kids, what color balloon do you want?

757
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,403
Red for you. Bye now!

758
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,988
Purple. Orange.

759
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,031
Give this to your mom.

760
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,699
Bye!

761
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,326
Ma'am!

762
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,205
Your child will ride a bike
on their own one day, right?

763
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,332
If you want your kid
to ride their bike worry-free,

764
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,917
even if they bump into a luxury car,

765
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,461
please sign up
for Child Accident Protection insurance.

766
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,880
Now, please take your child to school!

767
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,508
Get the coverage you need
with Child Accident Protection.

768
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,009
Sir, please take one!

769
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,260
Please take one.

770
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,595
I miss it.

771
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,350
I was pretty passionate back then.

772
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,147
I'll introduce you to my team members

773
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:53,691
once they come back
from their business trip,

774
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,318
so can you help me out until then?

775
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,738
If we get through the testing stage
and officially launch this product,

776
00:44:58,822 --> 00:45:00,615
I'll make you the executive distributor.

777
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,952
Don't you worry about a thing, sir.

778
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,830
Hey, have some lunch before you go.

779
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,540
I'm sorry. I have to go meet a client.

780
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:12,293
Come on. Didn't I say
to eat your meals on time?

781
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,254
It's okay.
I'll drink something healthy there.

782
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,841
You have a coffee machine at home, right?

783
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,050
Wait a minute.

784
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,351
-Take these.
-But they're expensive.

785
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:29,519
Just take them.

786
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,646
It's okay. Take them.

787
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,274
Thank you.

788
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,775
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

789
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,051
GORANGAE VILLAGE

790
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,640
You said there's nothing to see
in the countryside.

791
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,434
The view is beautiful.

792
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,894
I'm glad we came.

793
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,902
Farmers these days
seem to have a totally new vibe.

794
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:20,612
They really are.

795
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,739
Gosh, nice moves.

796
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:25,116
Why does that guy look so familiar?

797
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:37,921
Why did you follow me here?

798
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,589
You followed me, Ms. Ah-young.

799
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:40,840
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

800
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,177
This is my field, by the way.

801
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,096
What?

802
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,307
I told you I was a farmer.

803
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,520
I'm the head of this village.

804
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:00,944
It's napa cabbage from my farm.

805
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:03,363
I thought your father owned this building.

806
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,282
Actually, I'm a farmer.

807
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:07,951
You're the village head?

808
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,245
I can't believe we met again.
This must be fate.

809
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:14,666
-No, it's not.
-We met on a blind date, we're partnering,

810
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,126
and now we've met again,
so what else can it be but fate?

811
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,336
They went on a blind date?

812
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,754
And they're partnering?

813
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,422
No, that's not it.

814
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:22,840
It must be fate.

815
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,509
It really is.

816
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,890
Nice to meet you.

817
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,977
-He's impressive.
-Hush, Han-deul.

818
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,521
You're the head of this village?

819
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,731
-Yes.
-Please help us.

820
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:40,567
Excuse me?

821
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,450
GORANGAE COMMUNITY CENTER

822
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,542
Hey, insect feelers. It's this car, right?

823
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,044
-Yes, it is.
-That's right.

824
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:02,297
There's footage of it coming in
but not leaving.

825
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,048
That means it's still in the village.

826
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:05,842
Yes.

827
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:09,429
There are only two ways to handle
food and accommodation in this village.

828
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,431
Either stay at a guesthouse
or camp in your car.

829
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:14,642
There are 32 households in the village

830
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:16,477
but only two places for car camping.

831
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:19,606
The first Resting Area
and second Resting Area near Windy Hill.

832
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:22,400
But some people make their way
up to Deulmeori Forest.

833
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:24,444
Okay, then let's split into two groups.

834
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:26,279
Ms. Ah-young and I
will search the village.

835
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:28,406
I don't want to.

836
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,824
It's a long way to the resting area.

837
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,201
It'll be easier
if you search the village with me.

838
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:35,330
We'll let the elderly
go on the long journey.

839
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:39,334
-All right, then.
-"Elderly"?

840
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:44,047
That's fine. The elders will go
on the long journey.

841
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:50,303
I almost forgot.
Have you chosen your accommodations?

842
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,263
Accommodations?

843
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,142
I can just sleep in my car, but…

844
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:58,019
I didn't think that far ahead.

845
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,896
We can drive home later tonight
if necessary.

846
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,731
Will you come back
if you don't find him today?

847
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:06,319
I know a farmhouse where you can stay.
I'll talk to the owner.

848
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,112
There are lots of rooms there,

849
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:10,740
and my dear Ms. Ah-young needs to sleep.

850
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:12,617
"My dear Ah-young"?

851
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:17,372
It's the house way over there
with the red windmill.

852
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,041
Please come down before sunset.

853
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,167
It's a high-altitude area,

854
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,461
so the weather is fickle,
and it can get dark quickly.

855
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,129
-Okay.
-Okay, see you later.

856
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:26,923
Okay. Oh, by the way…

857
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,258
Please be careful.

858
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:31,135
It's easy to get lost
with all the winding paths.

859
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:34,931
Don't worry about a thing.
I'm a human GPS.

860
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,266
-Then we'll see you two later.
-Okay.

861
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,434
Watch your step.

862
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:40,228
Just make sure you get back soon.

863
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:42,355
Shall we go, elder?

864
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,690
Yes.

865
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:46,943
Let's go to that village first.

866
00:49:58,871 --> 00:49:59,872
-Look.
-What?

867
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:01,165
WINDY HILL
GARDEN OF HEALING

868
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:03,000
-It's this way.
-Let's go.

869
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:05,336
Let's go.

870
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:21,853
This must be the place.

871
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:25,648
But it's not here.

872
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,609
-Let's go up farther.
-Okay.

873
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,173
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

874
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:10,359
Just take my hand.
It's steeper than we thought.

875
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:20,620
I'm coming. Jeez, you're in great shape.

876
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,829
-We're almost there.
-Right.

877
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,122
Ms. Kang.

878
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,375
-Can we slow down a bit, please?
-It's over there.

879
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:27,752
Man, I'm dying.

880
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:31,380
-How on earth are you so fit?
-We're here.

881
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:42,266
Insect feelers.

882
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,478
It's the insect feeler car.

883
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,523
-Let's check it out.
-Insect feeler car.

884
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,859
-Those are feelers, right?
-Yes.

885
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,451
-It's a camera!
-It is!

886
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:02,537
-We found him!
-Nice job.

887
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:11,462
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

888
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,217
I guess it's not him.

889
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,218
Right.

890
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,972
Let's go up and look for him some more.

891
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,320
Be careful. It's slippery.

892
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:39,282
Watch your step.

893
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:41,742
Be careful.

894
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,538
Come down slowly. Watch your step.

895
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,457
-It's slippery.
-Right.

896
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,961
Thank you.

897
00:52:58,759 --> 00:52:59,760
Watch your step.

898
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,847
Be careful and climb up slowly.

899
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:06,934
-Hurry. Is it…
-Where?

900
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:09,228
Is it supposed to be like this?

901
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:11,522
Let's go this way for now.

902
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:23,951
There's nothing here.

903
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:25,995
Hold on.

904
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,372
It's already gotten this late.

905
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:29,957
The sun is about to set.

906
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:32,126
-We should head back. It's dangerous.
-Right.

907
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:36,255
-Where are we going?
-Let's go this way.

908
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,885
Ms. Kang, you'll die
if you fall asleep here.

909
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,553
-I won't die.
-Yes, you will.

910
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:45,848
I think the sun is setting.

911
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,518
-Watch your step here.
-What?

912
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:54,565
It all looks the same,
so I can't tell where we are.

913
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,694
I know, right?
Why does everything look the same?

914
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:00,363
I think we've been here before.

915
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:03,032
Does your GPS not work?

916
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:08,788
GPS never works in places like this.

917
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,250
Where are we?

918
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,836
-You must be tired.
-I'm okay.

919
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,215
I'm sure if we go this way…

920
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:20,883
What's this?

921
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,177
It's raining.

922
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,389
-What should we do?
-Hey, it's raining.

923
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:43,340
Oh, jeez.

924
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,344
Are you okay? I'm okay too.

925
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:50,181
I think we're going deeper
into the mountain.

926
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,183
Are you sure GPS won't work here?

927
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,187
Actually,

928
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,814
my battery died a while ago.
What about yours?

929
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:02,026
If I still had any battery left,
I'd have called Ah-young ages ago.

930
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,028
I'm not using it because it's dead.

931
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:06,989
Yes, of course.

932
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:09,742
Don't worry about it.
We can find our way back.

933
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,328
All paths are connected to each other.

934
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,789
-This isn't the time for bravado.
-Because the Earth is round.

935
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:17,291
I'm afraid we'll come across
something scary here.

936
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,668
Seriously? Why would you say that?

937
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:54,203
SPECIAL THANKS TO HAN SEON-HWA AND
KWAK SI-YANG FOR THEIR GUEST APPEARANCES

938
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:39,999
<i>Right. I forgot I called you.</i>

939
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:41,250
<i>You forgot you called me?</i>

940
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:44,378
On what basis did you call
the team members here to Gangwon Province?

941
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,006
I didn't call you, Ms. Jeon.

942
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:49,300
<i>I'm asking as your ex-ex-ex-wife.</i>

943
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,343
<i>What's going on between you two?</i>

944
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:53,179
<i>Are you sure it's over?</i>

945
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:54,805
<i>We didn't even last a season.</i>

946
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,432
Does the other person think so too?

947
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,101
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

948
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:00,978
<i>You found my husband?</i>

949
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,646
<i>There's nothing we can do but wait.</i>

950
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,648
We'll just have to wait
and hope for the box to open.

951
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:07,735
What if it opens
and the outcome turns out to be a divorce?

952
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,778
<i>I think it's too late.</i>

953
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:12,323
<i>If I see Mi-rae right now,</i>
<i>I think we'll really get divorced.</i>

954
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,658
So we're just going to
let them get a divorce?

955
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,578
<i>Can we pull that off by today?</i>

956
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,246
<i>And for less than 30,000 won at that?</i>

957
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:23,250
<i>Do you like hanging out with Mr. Noh?</i>

958
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:24,752
You seem to be
in desperate need of escape.

959
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:27,213
Can you help me escape?

960
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:29,798
<i>If you want to make a confession,</i>
<i>go to a priest.</i>

961
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:32,885
<i>I haven't committed a sin yet,</i>
<i>so it's not a confession.</i>

962
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,595
<i>We're not a good match.</i>

963
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:38,974
It's too slow, rough, and uneven.

964
00:58:39,058 --> 00:58:40,517
<i>Then I'll take that as you giving up</i>

965
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:43,729
<i>and claim the green one for myself.</i>

966
