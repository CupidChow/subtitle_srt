1
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,440
You look just like your father.

2
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,880
Welcome!

3
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,560
Insolent birds.

4
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,760
How dare they poop on my shrine!

5
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,440
I'm older than your mother.

6
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,720
It’s the disrespect for me.

7
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,720
Call the police!

8
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,680
It’s literally been seconds.

9
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,760
Wait and see till
I level up my spiritual rank.

10
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,640
That’s when I’ll get you good.

11
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,840
You’re going down like the economy.

12
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,640
Next!

13
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,400
Aren’t felines supposed to like cleanliness?

14
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,280
What trashcan did you fall into?

15
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,480
You’re a walking dirtball.

16
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,720
Maybe bathe yourself a bit.

17
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,320
Did your

18
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,720
parents sign this already?

19
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,480
Don’t be shy.
I won’t bite.

20
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,680
Okay.

21
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,040
Welcome!

22
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,280
Can I see a little smile?

23
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,800
REGISTER
Next.

24
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,120
Come right up, don’t be scared.

25
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,600
Oh, you’re a ghost too.
My bad.

26
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,240
Who the heck do you think you are?

27
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,400
Here. They don’t let you wet yourself.

28
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,680
That’s not right.

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,320
They don’t let you wet the uniform.

30
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,080
Here. Dry your head.

31
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,600
The rules say you can’t be wet.

32
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
They won’t let you wet the uniform.

33
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,640
No?

34
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
There.

35
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,600
Have it.

36
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,640
They don’t allow your uniform to get wet.

37
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,120
Take it. My arm hurts.

38
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,440
You're Sun, right? I'm Nam.

39
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,880
Are you new here?

40
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
Me too.

41
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,480
So...

42
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,280
when did you start swimming?

43
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,960
Answer me, will you?

44
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,600
It’s like I’m talking to myself here.

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,040
I just like being in the water.

46
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,480
It's peaceful.

47
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,000
That’s deep.

48
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,360
Ok.

49
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,080
I won't disturb
your peace any longer then.

50
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,280
I'm off now. See you.

51
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,440
Oh.

52
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,720
and...

53
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,520
Let's swim together soon.

54
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,120
Aren't you swimming?

55
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,200
I can’t keep up,
you’re too fast.

56
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,480
One more time?

57
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,680
Sure.

58
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,480
Hey!

59
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,280
Sun!

60
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,880
Coach! Coach!

61
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,280
Coach! Coach!

62
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,120
Coach!

63
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,800
You should tell me
if you’re feeling tired.

64
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,720
Don’t just do everything
I ask of you.

65
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,680
That was a close call, my friend.

66
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,880
Yeah,

67
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,360
next time I'll tell you.

68
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,440
We're friends, right?

69
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,160
Obviously.

70
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,680
What a weird question.

71
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,720
Was I not your friend until now?

72
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,200
I didn’t say that.

73
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,960
But thanks a lot.

74
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,320
Just come practice swimming
with me more.

75
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,440
Okay.

76
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,360
Let’s stretch.

77
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,080
Feels tight.

78
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,640
You know,

79
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,520
outside of swimming,

80
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,960
I don't know what else I can do.

81
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,920
My parents have had me practice
swimming since I was little.

82
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,480
Actually, I do like it,

83
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,760
but sometimes I wonder

84
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,680
if I’d feel the same
if I could do something else instead.

85
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,560
My parents want
me to get the scholarship,

86
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,680
when they can easily pay
for me to go to school.

87
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,480
So I work really hard

88
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,440
to get the scholarship so
they can show off to their friends.

89
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Sun.

90
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,680
Can you lose the race for me?

91
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,720
Hey.

92
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,440
I’m just joking.

93
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,760
I’ll do it.

94
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,480
We’re friends, after all.

95
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,120
I can just leave.

96
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
You guys are
such wannabes.

97
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
What are you trying to do?

98
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,680
None of your business.

99
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,280
I’m telling you it’s my business.

100
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,280
When did you turn into
such a nice guy?

101
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,680
You really wanna be a nice guy?

102
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,880
Fine.

103
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,040
Here’s your trophy.

104
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,920
Take it.

105
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,320
Stop thinking too much.

106
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,240
I want him in another club.

107
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,760
So he won't take away
my scholarship.

108
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,160
Fine.

109
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,480
Let’s see if you keep your words.

110
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,520
Be better at pretending
to be his friend.

111
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,480
Don't let it slip up that
you’re scheming something.

112
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,000
I’m warning you.

113
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,040
Are you threatening me, Mr. Sun?

114
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,280
Don't be so uptight.

115
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Mr. Sun, perhaps you’re still...

116
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,400
hung up on something from the past?

117
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,920
[Junior] How about him?

118
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,720
APPLICATIONS ARE OPEN

119
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,560
Can you let him join?

120
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,400
That guy?

121
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,520
Can he act?

122
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,680
Maybe.

123
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,160
I really need your help.

124
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,880
If he can't really act,

125
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,120
why would I want him?

126
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,360
He likes performing.

127
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,080
Are you okay?

128
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,560
What happened?

129
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,680
Hey.

130
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,200
you're Junior, right?

131
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
I'm Jodd.

132
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,640
So you two have met.

133
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,960
Which club do
you want to be in?

134
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,360
Swimming club, like you.

135
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,720
I'm most suited for this club.

136
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,040
Where are you going now?
Come on.

137
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,480
Here we go again. Enough already!

138
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,680
You already know

139
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,920
how I am.

140
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,880
I can't let anyone take my scholarship.

141
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,560
I’m never gonna leave him be.

142
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,400
Damn you, Sun!

143
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,120
What are you doing? Stop it.

144
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,160
You bestie with Sun now?

145
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,440
Yeah, where’s your best friend, Nam?

146
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,240
Best friend?

147
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,880
When did I get close to him?

148
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,600
What, weren’t you guys close?

149
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,920
You’re swimming way faster now.

150
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,480
You’re locked in.

151
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,400
You were much faster than Sun.

152
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,680
Weren’t you two
always practicing together?

153
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,320
He kept following me around

154
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,200
acting like he had no friends.

155
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,960
He even asked me to
lose the race for him.

156
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,840
Say what?!

157
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,000
Damn, he’s so weird.

158
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,760
But he's already
the fastest swimmer.

159
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,640
Why would he ask you
to pretend to lose?

160
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
But I hear ya,

161
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,240
he’s so damn weird.

162
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,880
When did you guys get here?

163
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,960
I dozed off mid-shower.

164
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,520
You guys going somewhere after?

165
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,480
I think

166
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,760
I'm just gonna head back
to the dorm for a nap.

167
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,120
Nam?

168
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,840
Don’t overthink it.

169
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
I'm okay with you winning.

170
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,080
But we're still friends, right?

171
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,120
Friends?

172
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,880
You’re delusional.

173
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,720
Long time no see.

174
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,760
Were you spooked?

175
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,400
What's up?

176
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,240
You’ve been busy, I see.

177
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,800
I’m dying for a conversation.

178
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,080
My breath stinks from
keeping quiet for too long.

179
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,280
Hey,

180
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,960
I thought you came
all the way here to talk?

181
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,280
Actually, I’m not the one
who called you here.

182
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
Exactly,

183
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,040
someone lit an incense earlier.

184
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,000
but I can't talk face-to-face with humans.
You get me?

185
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,720
Enough with the brooding.

186
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,760
Tell me what’s on your mind.

187
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,120
Fine. I’m just gonna keep talking.

188
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,880
Lately, I don't know why,

189
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,200
no teachers come to pay
their respects to me.

190
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,000
Have you been giving out
made-up lotto numbers?

191
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,760
Who’d actually know
the winning lotto numbers?

192
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,680
All spirits just make up
random numbers to give away.

193
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,200
Now it’s your turn to speak.

194
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,920
I’m serious.

195
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,120
Spit. It. Out. Now.

196
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
Tell me what’s wrong.

197
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,960
Say it, or I’ll make you.

198
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,520
Something’s bothering me a bit.

199
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,120
Who did this to you?

200
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,080
Want me to possess ‘em?

201
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,040
Stop it, Grandma.

202
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,480
You'll be punished for
for another hundred years.

203
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,680
“Grandma” this,

204
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,680
“grandma” that.

205
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,400
Here's a tip from your grandma.

206
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,880
Just tell him the truth.

207
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,680
What’s the use of sulking and whining?

208
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,840
So you already know, Grandma.

209
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,160
I'm literally a ghost. I know everything
that happens at this school.

210
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,880
Come on, admit your feelings.

211
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
I’m not jealous.

212
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,680
I meant to say… I couldn’t care less.

213
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,960
Hmph!

214
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,000
Kids.

215
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,040
You can't fool a shipper.

216
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,840
Are you a shipper, sis?

217
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,480
Not really.

218
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,640
Maybe once I was on a ship.

219
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,920
A sinking ship.
That’s when I died, wow.

220
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,560
That morbid, sis.

221
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,400
Sorry.

222
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,120
Wow,

223
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,040
they’re here.

224
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,840
Wow!

225
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,720
The party’s getting started.

226
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,920
Umba, umba, umba, umba.

227
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,960
Shoot!

228
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,640
Welcome to our school’s sacred tradition,

229
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,720
passed down from
generation to generation.

230
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,400
Newbies, listen up!

231
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,080
Tonight, you’ll go through

232
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,200
our one of a kind ritual.

233
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,480
I guarantee

234
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,320
you’ll be traumatized

235
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
for the rest of your life.

236
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,480
Alright, alright.

237
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,160
Show me the newbie.

238
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,240
What's your name, newbie?

239
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,240
Junior.

240
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,560
Louder.

241
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,840
Junior.

242
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,680
Louder.

243
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,240
Junior!

244
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,640
As a newcomer,

245
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,400
you probably don't know
how important this tree is.

246
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,600
This tree

247
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,920
has been here before
this school was built.

248
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,800
I've said this much,

249
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,160
you should know
by now that this tree...

250
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,200
definitely...

251
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
is haunted...

252
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,560
If you don't want trouble,

253
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,920
don't look up.

254
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,880
And today,

255
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
you... Junior

256
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,720
you need to show your bravery

257
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,320
and go under that tree,

258
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,240
take some dirt

259
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,960
to smear below your eyes,

260
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,640
and stand there
for five minutes.

261
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,800
You think you can do it?

262
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,480
Why don’t you do it with me?

263
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,200
Do you understand what
a long-standing tradition is?

264
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,440
Just do what I say
and stop asking questions.

265
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,520
Or are you a chicken?!

266
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,840
Chicken. Chicken.

267
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,360
I’ll do it.

268
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,280
Careful, you might see a ghost.

269
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,240
Ghost?

270
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,200
Oh, ghost.

271
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,640
You’re not scared?

272
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,040
Good! Then go ahead.

273
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:25,760
Junior! Junior! Junior!

274
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,120
Look up there.

275
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
What do you see?

276
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,720
A ghost?

277
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,640
Where are you going?

278
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,960
I don't wanna do this anymore.

279
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,920
Scared?

280
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,640
I'm not.

281
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,840
Then just look up there!

282
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,120
Why are you quiet?

283
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,480
What do you see?

284
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,360
They said not to tell.

285
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,520
D*mn!!

286
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,040
D*mn!! That Junior is possessed!!

287
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,680
Don't smile, Junior.
No smiling!

288
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,760
“Good morning,”

289
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,800
“my children at Phanarak.”

290
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,240
“Don't forget that”

291
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,600
“students must become part of a club”

292
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,280
“if not, you will be marked down
for bad behavior”

293
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,240
Goddess, bless me!

294
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,520
Sathu.

295
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,400
“...if anyone still hasn't found a club...”

296
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,600
Hello!

297
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,640
Hello, my non-existing viewers.

298
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,480
It’s too early for internet.

299
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,080
That’s okay.

300
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,120
Someone once told me

301
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,720
to do what I love,

302
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,200
even if others don't like it.

303
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,360
I know you guys
want me to join your club,

304
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,680
but I have to apologize to you

305
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,440
because right now I've chosen

306
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,400
to be in the Buddhism club.

307
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,280
Come cheer me on!

308
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,840
A viewer has joined us!

309
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,560
Hello, viewer.

310
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,040
Oh he left a hate comment.

311
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,880
You, the one commenting,

312
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,000
are being disrespectful.

313
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,120
Let’s have a bet.

314
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,680
If the club accepts me,

315
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,200
you stream yourself
eating dog food.

316
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,440
How about it?

317
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,000
Do you dare to make a bet?

318
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,920
Who put a sticker here?

319
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,320
What the heck.

320
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,240
Ruining the board.

321
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,880
When is this attention-wh*re gonna stop?

322
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
He’s so cringe.

323
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,640
Can’t you just act normal?

324
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,720
How are you better than me?

325
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,080
You tore up my photo.

326
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,440
Yeah but you stuck your face
up on my club's board.

327
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,920
You have a point.

328
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,720
My bad, then.

329
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,840
I've apologized to you.

330
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,560
Now it’s your turn.

331
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,400
Can I join your club?

332
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,000
You’re delusional.
Get lost.

333
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,120
Oh.

334
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,640
So you're not gonna apologize?

335
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,560
No way. Do that again,
and we’ll tear up all of them.

336
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,360
Fine,

337
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,280
You said so yourself.

338
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,560
I’m not gonna apologize anymore.

339
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,320
Then I'll stick all
the pictures up.

340
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,440
Take them down I dare you.

341
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Damn you, Jodd.

342
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,200
What’re you gonna do about it?

343
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,200
Let me go.

344
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,440
Let go, please!

345
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,520
As you all know,

346
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,320
our club is

347
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,760
the oldest club in the school.

348
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,360
Members who graduated

349
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,360
became doctors,

350
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,240
professors,

351
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,240
or successful businessmen.

352
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,920
But to reach that point,

353
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,080
they all started from a small book club

354
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,920
this very club.

355
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,520
Do you all want to know
the secret formula for success?

356
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
If you want to know,

357
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,360
take a look at the books in the club.

358
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,760
This is so classic!

359
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,160
It's a legend,
and it’s not available online!

360
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,200
And this year,
we also have a new member!

361
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,880
A skilled programmer

362
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,080
who's gonna hack into the
school’s firewall system.

363
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,760
Soon our club will upgrade

364
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,800
from a love of reading

365
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,320
to a love of streaming!

366
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,280
Isn't this a book club?

367
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,120
Yeah, that's right.

368
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,480
Why?

369
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Reading adult magazines?

370
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,600
The reason we
established this club

371
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,640
is to give us experiences
to use in real life.

372
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,400
Whether you're straight,

373
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,800
gay, lesbian, bi, or transgender,

374
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,480
we have it all.

375
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,400
No discrimination.

376
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,080
What, you’re not into adult magazines?

377
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,520
I get that it's normal,

378
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,440
but this is a book club.

379
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,520
We are reading books.

380
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,600
Don't tell me...
you've never read it?

381
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,840
You should have told me.

382
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,440
I wasted my time here.

383
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,120
What now.

384
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,480
Let go.

385
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,760
What is it?

386
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,760
Don’t compete at the swimming race.

387
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,640
Why?

388
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,160
See?

389
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,920
You can't even give me a reason,

390
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,160
and you’re stopping me?

391
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,040
I don't want you to compete.

392
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,720
Why?

393
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,640
You already know
I’m great at swimming.

394
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,360
I know, but...

395
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,480
Don't follow me, okay?

396
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,360
You’re not allowed to follow me.

397
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,120
Stay there!

398
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,800
And no looking!

399
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,000
Don’t follow me, Sun.

400
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,360
Why did you bring me here, Nam?

401
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,560
They say that

402
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,440
those who haven’t competed before

403
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,080
will win the race if they come here.

404
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,560
That’s not necessary.
I'll win anyway.

405
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,040
Don’t you want to win?

406
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,480
Why bring me here?

407
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,600
Ouch!

408
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,960
Nam!

409
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,080
Junior!

410
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,960
Where are you?

411
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,080
Nam!

412
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,880
Open the door.

413
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,240
Open it!

414
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,360
Open the door!

415
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,760
Nam!

416
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,560
Open the door, Nam!

417
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,880
Nam! Open the door!

418
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,360
Open the door!

419
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,320
STORAGE ROOM

420
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,200
Aren’t you tired?

421
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,560
Tired?

422
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,120
Me? Tired?

423
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,920
Yeah,

424
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,440
I'm tired.

425
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,400
I want to win,
so I brought you here.

426
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,520
I took you to see a lot of clubs,

427
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,800
but you had to get in my way.

428
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,240
You’ve been getting the scholarships

429
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,040
because you made sure
nobody would go against you.

430
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,480
You keep challenging me.

431
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,280
You’ll sleep here tonight.
That should teach you.

432
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,640
Junior!

433
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,000
Are you feeling better now?

434
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,760
If making friends leads to this,

435
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,360
maybe you should be a loner like me.

436
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,080
Can we be loners together?

437
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,320
That’s not how being a loner works.

438
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,520
Let’s just be together, then?

439
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,800
Alright.

440
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,520
Not that I wanna be with you.

441
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,280
I'm just scared of letting you be alone.

442
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,320
You’re not looking at me.

443
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,240
Are you lying, Sun?

444
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,240
If we're gonna stay together,

445
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,360
we should trust each other.

446
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,120
Sun, can you do me a favor?

447
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,440
You wanna challenge me?

448
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,960
Why not?

449
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,720
Think you’re so tough?

450
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,600
Now that someone’s
covering your back?

451
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,520
Hey, Nam.

452
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,560
Losing means losing.

453
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,040
Let’s have some sportsmanship.

454
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,040
But this isn't fair, Coach.

455
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,680
No matter how fast he swam,

456
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,560
he missed the start.

457
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,440
You should disqualify
him from the competition.

458
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,520
Why were you late?

459
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,520
Nam was scared
of losing the scholarship,

460
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,120
so he locked me up
in the storage room.

461
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,880
If Sun didn’t come looking for me,

462
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,320
I could have died.

463
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,000
Funny, isn’t it?

464
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,120
Even after he cheated like that.
I still won.

465
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,520
Do you have any proof?

466
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,240
I don't.

467
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,960
But no worries.

468
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,320
I’m resigning.

469
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,800
This club doesn't seem fun at all.

470
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,080
Besides, I've already won.

471
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,120
Let’s talk it out first.

472
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,960
Hey, Nam!
You splashed then you crashed!

473
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,760
Nam-splashed, Nam-crashed!

474
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,400
Nam-splashed, Nam-crashed!

475
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,400
Enough, students.

476
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,560
Nam-splashed, Nam-crashed!

477
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,640
Sorry.

478
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Where I’m from,
that means thank you.
