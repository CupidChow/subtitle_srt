1
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,720
Is it a nightmare?

2
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
You scared me.

3
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,400
You showed up
without making a sound.

4
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
I thought it was a ghost

5
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,800
What's wrong with you?

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,600
Did anyone do something to you?
Tell me, and I'll take care of it.

7
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,080
So, what happened last night?

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,720
Who was it? Tell me.

9
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,000
If you don't say anything,
I'll ask Auntie Noi.

10
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,200
There's really nothing.

11
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,520
What do I have to say
for you to believe me?

12
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,200
If there's nothing,
why were you shaking?

13
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,040
I had a nightmare.

14
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,080
You looked like you saw a ghost.

15
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,120
I dreamt that
a ghost was chasing me.

16
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,600
Liar.

17
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,120
Are you scared of ghosts?

18
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Just because you're not scared
doesn't mean I'm not scared.

19
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,480
Let's go to class.

20
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,960
Something on your mind?
You’re not eating anything.

21
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,800
How did you get here, Son?

22
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,000
Anyway,

23
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,160
are you thinking about that guy?

24
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,960
How did you know
I was stressed about this?

25
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,240
Oh, I know...

26
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,120
because I raised you.

27
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,360
Do you remember?

28
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,640
You and Little
used to fight over fish,

29
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600
but when Little
shared the fish with you,

30
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,280
you stopped being mad.

31
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,720
I don't know what to do.

32
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
I want to make him happy.

33
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,640
If you want him to feel at ease,

34
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,880
try sharing something
you cherish with him.

35
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,200
He'll understand

36
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,760
how much you love him.

37
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,920
Something I cherish.

38
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,600
Ah, take this.

39
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,280
I can't give you the whole fish,
because I am hungry too.

40
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,840
Thanks.

41
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,080
You eat it.

42
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,120
I am full.

43
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,160
Just eat more.

44
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,760
I have half a fish.

45
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,880
You can have it.

46
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,280
You eat it.

47
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,240
I am full now.
No, you are not.
You haven't eaten anything yet.

48
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,200
Just have this fish, Sun.

49
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,640
If you want to grow tall, eat it.

50
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,040
I think this one is good for you.

51
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,520
I am full now. Bye.

52
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,320
I will go and have a look
again tonight.

53
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,400
Just take it out, right?

54
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,240
Meena.

55
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,320
Sis Meena.

56
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,720
Grandma.

57
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,640
Calling out often is a sin,
you know?

58
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,440
What happened to Sun last night?

59
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,400
I don't know.
There was nothing happened.

60
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,200
It definitely happened.

61
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,440
What did you just talk to Sun?

62
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,160
What will happen tonight?
Tell me now.

63
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,800
I really don't know.

64
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,000
Eh?

65
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,280
Don't lie to me.

66
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,640
I am not a fool.

67
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,920
Sun had a nightmare the whole night.

68
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,480
That's normal.

69
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,040
I am a ghost.

70
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,800
I also have a nightmare.

71
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,880
Maybe...

72
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,280
I dreamt about the time I was dead.

73
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,400
Do not change the subject.

74
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,440
Well, he might be

75
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,440
worrying about something.

76
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,640
And...

77
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,160
He might have something to think about.

78
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,200
What is that then?

79
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,120
That's all I know.

80
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,400
He is an introvert, you know?

81
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,280
I'll go now.

82
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,840
Being an introvert
is not his fault.

83
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,920
Hey!

84
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,240
What the heck?

85
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
I am a ghost.

86
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,240
Are you scared of ghosts?

87
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,040
If you see me more often,

88
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,160
you won't be scared of me anymore.

89
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,040
Are you okay?

90
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,760
Yah!

91
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,360
What are you doing?

92
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,080
You told me
you are scared of ghosts.

93
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,400
I want to help you overcome the fear.

94
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,600
By dressing like a ghost.

95
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,320
So, are you still scared of ghosts?

96
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,280
Just return that costume.

97
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,280
Why? I think this costume is...

98
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,520
quite scary.

99
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,080
Look at me. So you won’t be
scared of ghosts.

100
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,080
Just return the costume.

101
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,920
So, do you still fear ghosts?

102
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
I am not scared of you ghost.

103
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,920
Because I'm a cute ghost, right?

104
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,320
Now return the costume.

105
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,120
No.

106
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Before the owner
comes to strangle you.

107
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,720
You're just like Edward Snowden.

108
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,640
So, I can access any website
to play games, right?

109
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,400
Except for games using
the UDP protocol,

110
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,960
but if you want to play,

111
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,040
just let me know

112
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,520
and I'll try spoofing the
IP to trick the DNS server.

113
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,080
You are awesome. Let me kiss you.

114
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,800
Just move, move out.

115
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,080
What the heck?
Why did you sneak
in here without telling me?

116
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,400
I was forced.

117
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,480
Oh.

118
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
What are you doing here?

119
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,120
To find Sun.

120
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,800
He was not in his bed.

121
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,680
I think Sun has been

122
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,000
acting strange lately.
Do you feel it too?

123
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,200
That's just how it is with him.

124
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,440
Not many people
dare to mess with him

125
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,760
because he looks stressed and tense

126
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,600
like this.

127
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,080
Don't overthink it.

128
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,080
Or...

129
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,080
maybe he’s a murderer and is
destroying the evidence.

130
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,840
Have you been
watching too many movies?

131
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,480
And you...

132
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,480
Have you seen him
doing anything strange?

133
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,320
Anything strange?

134
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,720
I saw Sun wearing
something around his neck

135
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,880
that looks like a doll.

136
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,600
Some of them didn't have hair.

137
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,440
Like this one?

138
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,040
Where?

139
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,880
Just like that one.

140
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,240
I saw Sun wearing
that around his neck.

141
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,240
They call it a Buddha statue.

142
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,400
In simple terms,

143
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,120
a monk represents
the embodiment of Buddhism.

144
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,080
Religion is something
that humans hold onto,

145
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,600
it serves as an anchor for
the mind and refuge for the spirit.

146
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,080
Maybe Sun is so stressed that
he needs something for support.

147
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,480
A refuge for the spirit.

148
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,720
Does this really
help Sun relieve stress?

149
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,400
From what you've said,

150
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,400
it should help, right?

151
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,800
Where else can we find this?

152
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,360
I'll do it for you. Don't worry.

153
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,280
Sun, come here.

154
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,720
What are you doing?

155
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,880
Sit down.

156
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,440
Sit like this.

157
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,440
Follow my lead.

158
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,920
Shrink and...

159
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
expand.

160
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
Shrink and...

161
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,800
expand.

162
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,440
Our minds...

163
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,240
will be at peace.

164
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,880
Shrink and...

165
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,560
expand.

166
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,600
Why don't you do it?

167
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,640
What's wrong with you?

168
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,840
I don't know what's wrong with you.

169
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,600
You are scared of ghosts,

170
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,680
or stressed from school.

171
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,000
Or you are just being an introvert.

172
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,760
But...

173
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,800
I will help you
to relieve your stress.

174
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,720
Are you worried about me?

175
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,720
I am fine.

176
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,640
If it's really okay, why does Sun
keep so many Buddha statues?

177
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,560
Here.

178
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,520
You are not scared
of ghosts anymore.

179
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,040
Why do you
keep so many Buddha statues?

180
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,680
This is a refuge
for your spirit, right?

181
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,840
Who told you that?

182
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,920
Jodd and Jeng.

183
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,600
I don’t really understand why,

184
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,960
we have to chant and meditate

185
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,320
when we feel uneasy,

186
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,680
but if it helps
you reduce the anxiety,

187
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,040
then that’s good.

188
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,080
I will find a bigger Buddha statue.

189
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,760
You still
don't understand anything,

190
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,200
yet you brought me these statues?

191
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,280
Does it make you feel at ease?

192
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,760
I don't know,

193
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,800
but some people use...

194
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,760
Lie down here.

195
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,360
What did you just say?

196
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,440
I just said that

197
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,920
maybe I should try
practicing Buddhism.

198
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,720
It might help me
let go of some things.

199
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,240
Practicing Buddhism.

200
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,680
That sounds so difficult.

201
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,080
I can't feel either good...

202
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,080
or bad.

203
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,800
Will we become like those statues?

204
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
I like being able to feel hungry,

205
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,200
to be sad,

206
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,680
to be held,

207
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,040
and to love.

208
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,240
But wait,

209
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,920
so Sun doesn't practice Buddhism?

210
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,080
No,

211
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,160
you just understood
things your own way.

212
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,920
I shouldn't believe Jodd and Jeng.

213
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,680
But...

214
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,040
I think I'm like a monk.

215
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,200
I can be a source
of comfort for Sun.

216
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,160
You don't need
to chant or meditate.

217
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,760
Being with me

218
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,440
should make you feel at ease.

219
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,440
You don't really need
a source of comfort.

220
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,520
Having someone
to lean on is better.

221
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:43,880
Right?

222
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,160
Where did you
learn to talk like this?

223
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,120
Jodd taught you, didn't he?

224
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,840
Do I have to learn it?

225
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,240
You can return
the Buddha statue to him now.

226
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,040
I don’t want to. At first,
I had the energy, but now I'm tired.

227
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,320
I want to sleep.

228
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,360
Wealth will come and go.

229
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,520
You can find more
as long as you're alive.

230
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,240
In ten minutes, it will be ten PM.

231
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,840
Anyone who needs to use
the bathroom, hurry up!

232
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,000
Sun.

233
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,480
Sun.

234
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,080
Sun.

235
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,000
Sun.

236
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,120
Did you sneak out last night?

237
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,360
What did you do?

238
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,480
Oh, I already told you
that it's nothing.

239
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,680
I knew that.

240
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,240
But I mean,

241
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,280
did you sneak out
to do something fun alone?

242
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,240
If I find out you didn't take me with you,

243
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,520
I'll be upset.

244
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,360
Sun.

245
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,600
Just talk to me first.

246
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,640
Sun.

247
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,920
Sleep now.

248
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,120
Stop flirting.

249
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,240
We were just talking,
none of your business.

250
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,520
Sun.

251
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,640
Sun.

252
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,840
Have you actually seen a ghost?

253
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,880
Come on.

254
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,840
You talk sweetly with him.

255
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,280
That love is so boring.

256
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,560
I have seen one.

257
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,200
But I won't tell you.

258
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,800
Are you still awake?

259
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,520
What kind of ghost did you see?

260
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,400
She is just like us.

261
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,400
But she wears a weird dress.

262
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,120
But she doesn't look scary.

263
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,760
She looks kind.

264
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,920
But she gets a little annoyed
when being called grandma.

265
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,200
Have you seen her?

266
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,320
Never.

267
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,520
That ghost told me that

268
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,400
people can't see ghosts,

269
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,400
only those who are not
human can see them.

270
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,280
But I'm a special person

271
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,960
who can see ghosts. Right?

272
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,280
There are people like that.
What do they call it?

273
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,920
- Hidden sense.
- Sixth sense

274
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,040
That's right.

275
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,520
Sixth sense.

276
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,400
Get some sleep now.

277
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,760
Sun, don't sleep.

278
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,920
But...

279
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,640
This ghost is quite
cute and kind, Sun.

280
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,200
You are scared of ghosts, right?

281
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,280
I think

282
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,600
I will introduce you to that ghost.

283
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,280
Sun.

284
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,360
She is not scary at all.

285
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,720
She has a babyface.

286
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,880
Get some sleep.

287
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,520
I know, I am just
telling you a story.

288
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,240
I think you will
get along with her.

289
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,760
She looks...

290
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,240
like a smiling person.

291
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,160
Normally, the ghosts we see

292
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,560
look scary.

293
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,920
But this one is a cute ghost.

294
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,680
What the heck?

295
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,240
Who are you?

296
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,800
Why are you here?

297
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,480
Did you see anything?

298
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,520
Besides you,
I don't see anything else.

299
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,880
It’s so late.

300
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,960
What are you doing here?

301
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,280
I'm looking for a friend.

302
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,080
Have you seen a male student,

303
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,280
who is...

304
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,400
tall and handsome,
walking around here?

305
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,680
A handsome, tall male.

306
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,600
There is only one.

307
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,200
But he is not a student.

308
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,480
It's me.

309
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,200
Thank you.

310
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,440
Why are you running away from me?

311
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,680
Why did you run away?

312
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,880
Why did you chase me?

313
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,000
Oh.

314
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,560
I was afraid you would run away.

315
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,920
At this late hour,
what good kids would be out?

316
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,120
You look so familiar to me.

317
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,200
Ah...

318
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,600
Don't give me that face.

319
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,760
I won't tell your teacher.

320
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,360
I just need your help to lift
something for a moment.

321
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,240
Okay?

322
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,200
Where did you put it?

323
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,080
Where did you put it?

324
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,080
- Hmm..
- Ouch!

325
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,320
That kid...

326
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,320
What the heck?

327
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,960
Where are you?

328
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,920
Ah...

329
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,040
Hey.

330
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,040
What the heck?

331
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,280
Where is he?

332
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,600
Quiet now.

333
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,080
What are you doing here?

334
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,960
I'll tell you later.

335
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,880
Let's go now.

336
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,160
Don't lie to me.

337
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
I am not stupid.

338
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,480
We need to get out of here.

339
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,920
You told me
you are scared of ghosts.

340
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,360
So what was that just now?

341
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,400
Can I tell you later?

342
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,440
We have to go.

343
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,080
No.

344
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,480
Do you really care about me?

345
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,120
Tell me now.

346
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,160
What are you doing exactly?

347
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,200
How come you know
that kind of person?

348
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,160
Can I tell you later?

349
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,640
I want to know now.

350
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,200
This is not the right time.

351
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,360
Why not?

352
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,280
Why don't you tell me the truth?

353
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,840
If you cannot answer,

354
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,840
then stop talking with me.

355
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,560
I hate liars.

356
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,080
No, Junior. Don't.

357
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,720
Let go of me.

358
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,120
Hey.

359
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,160
Where are you going?

360
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,680
Let go of me.

361
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,960
Don’t go.

362
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,280
Believe me.

363
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,000
- Don't go.
- Why?

364
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,880
Let go of me.

365
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,960
Don't do this.

366
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,200
I hold you now.

367
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,720
I hold you now.

368
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,480
Don't stand in my way. Step aside.

369
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,120
Move.

370
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,640
No.

371
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,840
Move.

372
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,200
Sun. Move.

373
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,600
Little.

374
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,080
We have to go.

375
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,720
Haven’t you transformed
into a human like me?

376
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,240
We have to go now.

377
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,080
No.

378
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,000
Sun.

379
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,000
What's wrong?

380
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,120
What's wrong?

381
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,960
Sun.

382
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,680
You go now.

383
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,080
Come on, kid.

384
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,320
Who's that?

385
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,280
You took the Buddha
necklace off, right?

386
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,520
Kids,

387
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,200
what are you doing here?

388
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,520
It still has the amulet.

389
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,880
You run now.

390
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Go. Go now.

391
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,200
Can your amulet
protect you from this?

392
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,760
Son.

393
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
Go to help Little.

394
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,120
He has Little trapped in there.

395
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,720
Quick.

396
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,120
He locked Little inside the van.

397
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,400
Come on. Go to help Little.

398
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
How did you find out about this?

399
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,760
Is it you?

400
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
Where did you put the other one?

401
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,080
Hey, you! Talk now.

402
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,160
Because of you,

403
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,640
I have to sell them as a pair.

404
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,240
Where did you put the other one?

405
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,960
If you don't want to die,

406
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,040
then speak up.

407
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,400
Junior. Junior.

408
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,800
Junior.

409
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,080
Junior.

410
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,400
It's me.

411
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,000
Hey.

412
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,240
Wake up. Stop sleeping.

413
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,120
Your friend is going to die.

414
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,800
I'm sorry.

415
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,360
I didn't let Mina tell you herself.

416
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,600
I don't know what to do.

417
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,280
I'm sorry.
