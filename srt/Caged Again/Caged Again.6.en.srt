1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,360
Panthers do this, don't they?

2
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,160
I read about it from a book.

3
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,720
Now that you're feeling better,
let's go help your brother.

4
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,360
Those traffickers followed us
into the forest.

5
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,720
It's likely they parked the
truck nearby.

6
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,600
How is Sont doing?

7
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,120
I heard that

8
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,680
he needs money to pay off
his mother's debt.

9
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,960
And that he never

10
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,640
even liked his job at the zoo.

11
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,800
I'm sorry for being harsh
with you back then.

12
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,160
But I understand you.

13
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,240
You were hoping that
he wouldn't do this to you.

14
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,120
No,

15
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,760
I'm just thinking in my own favor.

16
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Even after what Sont did to me,

17
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,000
I still can't bring
myself to hate him.

18
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,560
It's probably because he raised me.

19
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,000
But I won't let him
to do anything to me again.

20
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,720
I got to live as a human

21
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,240
I'll live to the fullest.

22
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,800
But I'm kind of scared

23
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,160
that in the end,

24
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,840
my life will turn out like Sont's.

25
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,760
What do you think?

26
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,960
Should we ask him for help?

27
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,800
Are you crazy?

28
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,720
We need to find those kids!

29
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,240
Look at us, you idiot.

30
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,640
Hungry, phone battery is almost dead,

31
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,920
power bank is dead, too.

32
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,040
This forest is huge, we're not gonna make it out soon.

33
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,200
Let's ask him for help.

34
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,480
Same old, then.

35
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,200
Is he gonna fall for it?

36
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,080
Keep moaning.

37
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,120
I'll handle the rest.

38
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,960
Where're you going?
You gonna leave me...?

39
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,600
Babe, I found your Gigi.

40
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,360
Love you lots, babe. Kiss, kiss.

41
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
Mother of Moles.

42
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,760
I'm sorry.

43
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,720
Didn't mean to scare you.

44
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:03,960
Who are you?

45
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,360
You trying to rob me?

46
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,880
No, of course not.

47
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,760
The thing is...

48
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,600
we're kind of lost
and we need your help.

49
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,200
- Do you hear that?
- Ouch, it hurts!

50
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,600
My brother fell and hurt his leg
by the stream.

51
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,520
Please, we really have
no one else to ask.

52
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,440
Alright,

53
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,920
you can come rest
at my house first,

54
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,400
and then I'll send you off
tomorrow.

55
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,600
Thank you so much.

56
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,480
Actually, we drove here.

57
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,520
Should we just follow you?

58
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,400
How come you didn't just
drive out of here?

59
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,480
Well... the thing is,

60
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,160
we almost ran out of gas,

61
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
and we haven't eaten yet.

62
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,280
If we...

63
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,480
drove out of here and our truck
stopped working,

64
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,400
we wouldn't have
the strength to push it.

65
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,800
Please,

66
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,160
could my brother get
a warm meal?

67
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,960
Just come eat at my house, then.

68
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,160
Thank you so much.

69
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,960
Take it easy.

70
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,120
It's this way.

71
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,200
No, come this way!

72
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,200
My leg is giving me the ouchie!

73
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,920
Can't sleep?

74
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,320
What are you thinking about?

75
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,200
And you?
What are you thinking about?

76
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,480
I'm thinking that the two of us are

77
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,000
like Nat and Ton, aren't we?

78
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,120
What will you do
after this is all over?

79
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,280
Maybe I'll go back to
be with Little. I don't know.

80
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,480
You did say it might be possible

81
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,880
to return our animal form again.

82
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,120
When I said we're like Ton and Nat,

83
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,520
how come you didn't say anything?

84
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,440
You said all that randomly, no?

85
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,960
What did you want me to say?

86
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,400
Then I'll help you.

87
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,640
I still don't know
if we're like them,

88
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,160
but I feel the same way toward you

89
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,200
like those two feel toward each other.

90
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,040
So you can say that
you feel the same way, to me.

91
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Or maybe you don't?

92
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,480
I just want this whole thing to end,

93
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,080
and free your brother.

94
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Then you can go back to the zoo
to be with him.

95
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,120
Go to sleep.

96
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,480
Do you have to face away?

97
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,000
This is how I normally sleep.

98
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,320
Normally,
you sleep facing me.

99
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,040
I'll go lie down on the floor.

100
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,840
No, I will.

101
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,480
You sleep on the bed.

102
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,040
I can't sleep.

103
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,000
It feels nice,

104
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,000
but why is everything so blurry?

105
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,400
The sound distorts out mind.

106
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,080
I'm seeing cartoons.

107
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,320
Why am I a penguin?

108
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,400
Please, not so soon!

109
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
I still have so many things I want to do!

110
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,520
You did say you wanna
turn back into a penguin.

111
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,480
What if I changed my mind?

112
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,960
You mean it?

113
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,960
It's hard being human.

114
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,560
Sun, you seem to be a bit of a pessimist.

115
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
It's fun being human!

116
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,480
Make up your mind.

117
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,560
You wanna be a penguin or a human?

118
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,120
Do you want me to keep being human?

119
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,680
That's your decision to make.

120
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,120
I'm not gonna force you or anything.

121
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,440
Alright!

122
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll keep being human!

123
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,720
After we graduate from school,

124
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,280
we'll get a job in the real world.

125
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,680
Save up for the North Pole trip.

126
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,480
I wanna live a happy life with you, Sun.

127
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,080
It's not that easy.

128
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,200
We still need to put food on the table.

129
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,920
Then, I'll be a workaholic
for that ฿฿฿฿

130
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
Watch out you might get sick
and need to pay your hospital bills.

131
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,880
Then I'll become a jacked penguin,

132
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,560
beat all illnesses and keep my health strong!

133
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,280
Woah,

134
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
you barely have time to sleep
outside of work.

135
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,920
Will you have time for exercise?

136
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,840
Hmm..

137
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,200
It's true, being a human is harder.

138
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,280
Then, I'll..

139
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,360
just go back to being a penguin.

140
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:51,960
What?

141
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Why give up already?

142
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
I'm usually my best at everything..

143
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,080
But being a human is really too much..

144
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,280
Everywhere has rules

145
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,200
and limitations, it's all the same.

146
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,960
Even though it's tough,

147
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,320
being outside is better
than being inside.

148
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,360
If you're okay,

149
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,800
then stay here with me.

150
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,440
Hmm, I guess if
I go back to living with Little,

151
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,600
it would be the right choice.

152
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,400
Things were much easier
when I was a penguin.

153
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,280
Really?

154
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,040
I'm not sure, maybe it is.

155
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,600
Hello! What's your name?

156
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,920
I'm Ai.

157
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
I had a dream that

158
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,200
my hot neighbor
got possessed by a ghost.

159
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,280
The dream felt so real.

160
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,640
Maybe the Mole Goddess can
possess us in our sleep?

161
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,480
Right.

162
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,520
why didn't I think of that?
Let's go to bed.

163
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,360
Inviting me to bed, Nerd boy?

164
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,520
Why?

165
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,320
We need to be asleep to dream.

166
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,640
How is that weird?

167
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Quiet.
Stop talking.

168
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,120
I'm praying.

169
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,960
I knew you two'd be here.

170
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,960
Come out.

171
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,440
Yes, I'm talking to you.

172
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,360
Go quickly.

173
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,600
I didn't mean to.

174
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,160
Teerapat tricked me into this.

175
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,200
How did I end up here?

176
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,600
Am I sleepwalking?

177
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,400
Wow, me too!
Let's start sleepwalking club.

178
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,320
It's obvious that you
two are up to something.

179
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
I'm not a part of this.

180
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Why did you drag me here?
I was sleeping peacefully.

181
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,120
Alright,

182
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,000
you'll clean the chicken coop every week.

183
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,240
Please, ma'am, anything but that!

184
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,920
Then you'll clean
the bathroom all month!

185
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,280
Can't hear nothin'
La la la.

186
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,320
Nah, ah ah!

187
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,440
- Hold up,
- Then...

188
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,160
Isn't that a mole right there?

189
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,840
Yes, I've had it for a long time.

190
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,840
You guys didn't notice?

191
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,480
I was born this way.

192
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,120
Grandma,

193
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,680
you can't be playing us like this.

194
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,520
We'd get into big trouble,

195
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,960
if we're actually caught.

196
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,360
Who told you to sneak out at night?

197
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,080
And don't you dare call me grandma!

198
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,800
I'll break your pretty necks.

199
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,160
So, what did you want with us, Goddess?

200
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,560
Come with me, I'll tell you.

201
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,080
But don't you think

202
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,560
Miss Samorn looks
extra snatched in this slip dress?

203
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,440
Um, sure?

204
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,520
Her wardrobe's a 10/10.

205
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,520
Follow me.

206
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,160
Samorn has more slip dresses?

207
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,520
A secret baddie!

208
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,600
See, every time I use
my power to possess someone,

209
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,680
the crack on my barbie doll deepens.

210
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,720
What if the doll cracks and
breaks completely?

211
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,960
I don't know,

212
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,200
but...

213
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,120
I've heard that if it breaks,

214
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,000
the spirit will disappear.

215
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,040
It's like I'm on power saving mode.

216
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,800
It just feels off.

217
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,560
Huh,

218
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,280
do ghosts have feelings, too?

219
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,200
Ask ChatGPT.

220
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,680
Ghosts are people
in a parallel universe, right?

221
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
I should rewatch Interstellar.

222
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,360
So if we superglue your statue
to stop it from further cracking,

223
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,160
you'll technically regain strength?

224
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,040
Dunno, never tried.

225
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,640
Let's give it a go?

226
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,840
I think

227
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,120
you should walk
Miss Samorn back

228
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,000
and leave her body.

229
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,160
If you disconnect now,

230
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,640
and she wakes up here,

231
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,840
we'll be in real trouble.

232
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,480
That's true.

233
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Alrighty, boys.

234
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,840
I'll be back soon.

235
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,280
Where are you going?

236
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,280
To get my bag.

237
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,920
How long will you be gone?

238
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,280
Just be quick.

239
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,000
Scared?

240
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,880
Um.. Yeah.

241
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,800
Good.

242
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,880
This nerd boy.

243
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,120
"Korn! Why didn't
you check the truck thoroughly?"

244
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,280
Here he goes again.

245
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,800
You've got no gas?

246
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,680
No, just the car battery that's dead.

247
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,960
Do you happen to
have a jumper cable?

248
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,920
The jumper cable?

249
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,360
I think I do.
Let me go check.

250
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,960
Great, thank you!

251
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,800
But you guys know how to
use it, right? 'Cause I don't.

252
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,600
My partner usually does it for me.

253
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,280
Sure!

254
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,160
I know how to use it.

255
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,480
Ouch!

256
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,320
Does your leg hurt?

257
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,640
Yes, it does.

258
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Wait here.

259
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,160
My partner usually does it for me.

260
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,880
Showing off his chick.

261
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,200
Let's see if he actually has one.

262
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,520
Jealous?

263
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,160
What the hell?

264
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,680
Here it is.

265
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,560
Thank you.

266
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,520
Where are you now?

267
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,680
Huh, did you find more
lost people?

268
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,720
Strange,

269
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,240
there's been a
lot of lost people lately.

270
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,200
Oh, really?

271
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,880
They deliver drinking water?

272
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,840
Ask them to give us some for free?

273
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,000
We have a water filter at home,
why be so stingy?

274
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,760
Could you prepare extra food, babe?

275
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,280
They're probably starving.

276
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,880
So, how are the kids doing?

277
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Hey.. big brother,

278
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,600
can you go start the engine?

279
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,000
Sure thing.. little brother!

280
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,840
Did he say kids?

281
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,040
What's your point, idiot?

282
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,120
He's just trying to show off
his chick and his kids.

283
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,440
Hurry up, I'm starving to death.

284
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,240
Perfect timing, you two.

285
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,440
Do you want dinner now?

286
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,880
It'll be a while before Ton arrives.

287
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,160
We're not really that hungry.
We can wait.

288
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,800
Didn't you say
you're hungry just now?

289
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,640
We could do with a nap.

290
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,240
Ah, I see, let's wait for Ton then.

291
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,160
You can go back upstairs.

292
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,080
No need to feel awkward.

293
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,800
I totally get it. Go, go.

294
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,320
We have to go now.

295
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,000
No, we don't.

296
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,840
If we don't go, we'll bring trouble
to these people.

297
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,560
We won't run,

298
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,480
and we won't bring
any trouble either.

299
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,760
My brother is waiting, you know.

300
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,120
If it's just the two of us,

301
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,240
we won't make it.

302
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,080
Sis, I don't know if this will work,

303
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
but if you can hear me,

304
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,360
hurry and come help us!

305
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,720
Babe, I'm home.

306
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,000
Please come in.

307
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,520
This is Sont

308
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,360
and this is Korn,

309
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,280
and this is Nat, my partner.

310
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,080
Hello, hello.

311
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,040
Did you guys think
I'd have long hair?

312
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,040
Oh, no, no,

313
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,880
We wouldn't think that.

314
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,120
In this day and age,
it's totally normal.

315
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,640
The table is set.

316
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,440
Come have a seat.

317
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,320
Please, go ahead!

318
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,640
It looks delicious!

319
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,880
Aren't you stronger than
regular humans?

320
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,280
Go and get them!

321
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,040
You beat Korn before.

322
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,080
My.. instincts overtook me back then.

323
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,160
but now

324
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,800
I just can't.

325
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,280
Why?

326
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,480
I've been holding back my instincts,
so I can be close to you.

327
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,400
Huh? What does that
have to do with me?

328
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,680
I'm a carnivore.

329
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
If I'm around you,

330
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,120
I have to stop myself
from getting hungry.

331
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,360
Otherwise, I..

332
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,200
Even if it's gone,

333
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,120
we can bring it back, right?

334
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,040
Is it delicious?

335
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,320
Yes.

336
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,120
See, babe? I told you,

337
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,880
Almost expired food aren't that bad.

338
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,800
Really delicious!

339
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,800
Thank you.

340
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,440
Go ahead, eat up,
no need to hold back.

341
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,480
Eat up.

342
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,680
If you want seconds,
my partner can make more.

343
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,640
Everything he makes is delicious.

344
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,080
What about the kids?
Aren't the two of them hungry?

345
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,840
They haven't eaten anything yet.

346
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,760
They said they're not hungry,

347
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,960
but I bet that's an excuse.

348
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,160
They're probably up
to something upstairs.

349
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,560
Don't bother them.

350
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,440
What are you doing?

351
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,800
Don't go through their stuff, babe.

352
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,440
I wanna awaken your instincts.

353
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,520
Gimme a sec.

354
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,080
Hold up.

355
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,560
"Babe"?

356
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,160
I didn't say that.

357
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,480
"Babe" is cute. I like it.

358
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,920
What are you looking for?

359
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,160
Need help..

360
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,760
babe?

361
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,120
Need help, babe?

362
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,480
It's giving queen energy.

363
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,600
Is he the only one awake
in the whole school?

364
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,440
Hope he doesn't have an amulet.

365
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,840
I need to do number two soon.

366
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,200
Woah.

367
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,960
I ate up all my food : (

368
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,120
When will those two
finish fixing my doll?

369
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,800
Watch it, Jeng,

370
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,960
don't glue my fingers!

371
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,600
Pull it off!

372
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,760
Pull my fingers off!

373
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,480
What? The doll..

374
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,320
What's wrong?

375
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,560
It's vibrating!

376
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,680
Step back.

377
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,240
Step.

378
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,160
Back.

379
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,680
Jodd and Jeng,

380
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,280
listen carefully:

381
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,880
I forbid you from
losing this barbie doll.

382
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,680
Why?

383
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,960
Do you know what pocket Wi-Fi is?

384
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,040
Sure.

385
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,920
Same principle.

386
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,400
If I get too far from the doll,

387
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,840
the signal might weaken.

388
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,560
Let's give it a try.

389
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,000
Now's not the time to play.

390
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,040
What's the furthest distance

391
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,000
can your spirit be away from the doll?

392
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,680
Urgh.

393
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,960
Let's สำฟอำ already.

394
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,040
How are we going?

395
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,760
Boy, you ask too many questions.

396
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,240
Goddess sure is in serious mode.

397
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,600
Right.

398
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,760
Hop on!

399
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,120
Okay, okay!

400
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,800
You sit behind him- her!

401
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,000
Can you carry us all, sis?

402
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,600
Sure, I'm even carrying the show now.

403
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,240
Let's rescue our BL boys.

404
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Excuse me for being rude,

405
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,200
but do you two have children?

406
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,080
Not yet.

407
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,600
But we're just planning to have one.

408
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,200
Oh, then who are

409
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,720
the kids you mentioned...?

410
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,320
I found two children earlier,

411
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
they got lost in the forest,
just like you guys.

412
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,520
Is there something wrong?

413
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,000
You know, my brother,

414
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,840
when he eats too quickly,
his tummy gets bloated.

415
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,560
He needs to stand up
for the gas to move around.

416
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,840
Okay.

417
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,400
Eat slowly and chew properly.

418
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,880
Are you okay?

419
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,840
No, no!

420
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,240
Is he gonna be okay?

421
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,360
Drink some water.

422
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,240
Omigosh!

423
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,400
Wait, I'll go get
some water for you.

424
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,800
Please help my brother.

425
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,360
Calm down.

426
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,800
I've got you.

427
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,680
I'll excuse myself and
go to the bathroom first.

428
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,640
Wait, wait! The bathroom
is on the first floor,

429
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,680
just turn right here.

430
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,360
Are you okay?

431
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,880
The light is broken. I'll...

432
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,320
There's another
bathroom outside the house.

433
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,720
Just walk straight a
bit, and you'll find it.

434
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,560
It's broken.

435
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Oh, in that case,

436
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,000
- Just walk around a little.
- Here's your water.

437
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,840
I need help here!

438
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,760
I might be having diarrhea.

439
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,840
See, I told you,

440
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,240
we should have hired someone
to fix the pipes.

441
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,680
Look at him!

442
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,840
Come on, let's not
do this now.

443
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,760
Please, I can't hold it anymore!

444
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,240
Oh, go right ahead then.

445
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,520
Take it easy.

446
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,120
By the way,

447
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,440
you'll need to turn on the pumps

448
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
to use the second floor toilet.

449
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,640
Let me do that for you.

450
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,360
Korn!

451
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,720
Babe!

452
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,240
Stop!

453
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,240
If you don't stop, I'll shoot.

454
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,160
Finally, I found you.

455
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,120
Damn kids!

456
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,600
You wanna fight?

457
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,560
You two have nothing
to do with this. Get lost!

458
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,720
I'm calling the cops!

459
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,960
You hungry for bullets?

460
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,600
Run away, kids!

461
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,280
Go now!

462
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,680
If you're going to shoot,
then shoot!

463
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,920
Challenge accepted.

464
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,720
You told me to do this.

465
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,040
If you wanna shoot, then shoot.

466
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,160
I'm not involved.

467
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:24,920
Babe, does it hurt?

468
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,600
I know you're here.

469
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,280
What the hell!

470
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,640
What are you doing?

471
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,760
They came to the forest,

472
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,040
with a truck to delivery water?

473
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,280
Don't you think that's strange?

474
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,440
Open it!

475
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,240
Quickly!

476
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,560
Help me!

477
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,120
Stop!

478
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,440
Hands up!

479
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,000
Turn around slowly.

480
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,760
Who are you guys?
Why are you at my house?

481
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,040
And who are you?

482
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,120
Where are my friends?

483
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,200
Cease the noise,

484
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,640
and step aside!

485
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,800
You're Nat and Ton, right?

486
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,560
How do you know our names?

487
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,480
Step. Aside.

488
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,640
Why should I?

489
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,800
Do you know him?

490
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,360
I do not.

491
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,760
Does this guy I'm possessing
have such a sussy face?

492
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,680
What do you mean by "possess"?

493
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,280
What the?

494
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,040
Just do as I say.

495
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,120
Move!

496
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,200
I'm so confused.

497
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,320
Nat,

498
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,920
can you call the police?

499
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,280
Report what these
criminals are doing.

500
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,680
It's for evidence.

501
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,960
What about my friends?

502
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,240
Stop running away!

503
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,600
Do you know how tiring
it is to chase after you?

504
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,160
Don't try me.

505
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,320
The hell you looking at?

506
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,080
What were you looking at?

507
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,360
Go check it out.

508
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,800
Why me?

509
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,280
Check if someone's there.

510
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,200
I'll watch these two.

511
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,440
Ah, I didn't kill it.

512
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,680
What are you talking about killing?

513
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,520
He can't be dead!

514
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,760
What are you yapping about?

515
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,360
- Ghosts aren't real.
- I didn't kill him!

516
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,760
I didn't kill the school guard!

517
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,400
Ghosts aren't real.

518
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,360
No, no. There are no ghosts...

519
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,800
Ghosts aren't real.

520
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,120
You little shits.
The whole squad is here, then?

521
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,320
Sit down!

522
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,320
Sit down!

523
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,200
I'll shoot you for real!

524
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,080
Sit down,

525
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,880
don't try anything.

526
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,880
Sit.

527
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,840
Behave.

528
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,760
Whoever runs, I'll shoot!

529
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,640
I'm going to ask
you nicely one last time.

530
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,360
Where did you hide it?

531
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,160
Don't think I don't know.

532
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,880
Nah ah,

533
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,680
down, boys.

534
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,560
This is the last chance.

535
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,600
Where did you hide it?

536
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,040
Three!

537
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,720
Don't!

538
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,600
Don't move.

539
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,400
Two!

540
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,280
Behave.

541
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,040
Don't you remember, Sont?

542
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,520
You named me Junior.

543
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,160
Because I'm the smallest.

544
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,880
What the hell are you talking about?

545
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,080
What the hell are you talking about?
