1
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
So that’s today’s homework..

2
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,880
Okay,

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,960
class dismissed.

4
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,160
What’s with the stare?

5
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,400
Think I'm still mad at you?

6
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,560
I told you, it's fine.

7
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,760
Don’t be sad or feel guilty.

8
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,880
I’m waiting for you to pack up.

9
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,320
You kept staring,
so I thought something was up.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,960
Goddess,

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
he’s a true introvert.

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,480
“Did you see the video?”

13
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,640
“The video Nam lost to Junior?”

14
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,280
“Nam Splashed, Nam Crashed”

15
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,800
“What a cheater.”

16
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,960
“He cheated but still lost,
I’d die from shame”

17
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,120
“So pathetic”

18
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,720
“It’s good, budd.
Let’s cheat better next time.”

19
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,120
“Students, be quiet.”

20
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,040
“I said be quiet.”

21
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,440
Move over.

22
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,960
I am moving.

23
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,520
Move over there.

24
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,000
Trust fall.

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,320
Will you be quiet?

26
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,480
Be quiet, or you’ll do
community service twice a week.

27
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,200
I have an announcement.

28
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,280
All clubs must hand in paperwork

29
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,840
to document their effectiveness.

30
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,240
Boo. Boo.

31
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,320
As for students without a club.

32
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
No matter.

33
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,920
I have created a new club for you:

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,160
the "Community Service Club".

35
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,640
Members of this club

36
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,400
will clean the old building
after class.

37
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,080
I hope I made myself clear.

38
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
You are dismissed.

39
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,360
Help me!!

40
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,080
We could have avoided this,

41
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,640
if you guys didn’t beef with Nam.

42
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,960
I'd rather clean than
deal with him.

43
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,960
Good thinking.
Unlike someone.

44
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,800
Why did you quit
the swimming club again?

45
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,280
You were already in a club.

46
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,120
I just...

47
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
like cleaning.

48
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,040
So how do we clean
all this mess?

49
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,760
Just do what you can, children.

50
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,120
School is cutting
budget right now.

51
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,600
Hang in there.

52
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,800
Do you want my help?

53
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,680
It's okay, Auntie.

54
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,800
Your hands are already full.

55
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,040
You go rest, Auntie.

56
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,520
Alright.

57
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,640
Children,

58
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,040
I'll leave the rest to you.

59
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,160
Okay.

60
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,520
Dust everywhere!

61
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,920
Not even paid to do this.

62
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,640
Our semester fee is 47,375 THB.

63
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,840
That’s 94,750 per year.

64
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,800
There are 825 students.

65
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,080
That equals 78,168,750

66
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,440
They could easiy afford
10 more cleaners.

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,000
Yikes, nerd alert.

68
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,640
Where should we start?

69
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,520
If I got into the book club,

70
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,920
I wouldn't be cleaning
right now.

71
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,600
I was so close to joining.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,520
It's all your fault, Jeng.

73
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,640
Will you stop whining?

74
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,000
Are we gonna be free
for the whole semester,

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,400
if we get this done today?

76
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
That’s right.

77
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,840
Let's finish the job, folks.

78
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,040
Sun, Junior,
I take back what I said.

79
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,080
Thanks for leaving that club.

80
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,000
Second that.

81
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,760
We won’t get the job done
if it’s only Jodd here.

82
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,560
That felt like an insult.

83
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,520
Amazing.

84
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,960
So you do realize.

85
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,720
A nerd with a mouth.

86
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,360
No need to thank me.

87
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,800
You just leave all the cleaning to me.

88
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,200
I’ve never done this before.

89
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,440
What are you?
A spoiled rich kid?

90
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,720
Don't say that, Junior,

91
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,320
or Jodd will slack off.

92
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
When you clean,

93
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,640
start all the way up.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,720
Then sweep down in one go.

95
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,080
if you’ve got some rags,

96
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
you can wet it and cover
the broom when you clean.

97
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,760
That way, dust and cobwebs

98
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,800
won’t scatter like this.

99
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,240
I read about it in a book called
“108 Ways to Clean Your Home.”

100
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,600
Aren’t you a bit too chill?

101
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,640
Your chair looks shaky.

102
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,560
It’s all your fault, Jeng.

103
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,640
Let me help.

104
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,480
Sweep the floor properly.

105
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,320
Just copy me.

106
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,840
Do not copy him.

107
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,400
Give it.

108
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,680
Do it this way.

109
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,000
Show me again?

110
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,600
Move aside.

111
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,720
You go left, I go right.

112
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,360
I can just do this myself.

113
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,720
it’s alright, I wanna help.

114
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,880
How is this helping...

115
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,960
The broom is too short.

116
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,880
No, you are short.

117
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,080
I should be short.

118
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,840
My name is Junior.

119
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,360
Sun, stay still. Don't move.

120
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,080
I’m gonna fall.

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,920
So, you two...

122
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,600
What? We were...

123
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,160
Just cleaning.

124
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,360
Cleaning.

125
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,720
Five stars for teamwork.

126
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,400
Gimme five.

127
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,960
Community Service Club, go go.

128
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,040
Give it, fam.

129
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,640
Where’s my fivers?

130
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,120
I’ll give you tenners!

131
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,240
Right.

132
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,120
Hooray!

133
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,800
They acted cool and quit the club.

134
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,120
And now they’re cleaning the school.

135
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,480
Pathetic.

136
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,480
Let's give them some.

137
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,600
Aren’t they having too much fun?

138
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,200
Look at this guy,

139
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,280
practicing like crazy just
to get the scholarship.

140
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,480
If he loses it,

141
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,200
he’s got nothing else going.

142
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
Are we good, buddy?

143
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,360
Just messing with you.

144
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
You look kinda stressed.

145
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,800
Hey, Nam-splash.
Bye Nam-crash.

146
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,920
Nam, you're one of a kind,

147
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,240
you cheated and still lost.

148
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,960
Respect.

149
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,360
Tonight, you two go handle them.

150
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,200
Open the door.

151
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,400
Junior. Junior.

152
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,160
Junior. Where are you?

153
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,400
Junior, are you alright?

154
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,880
Junior.

155
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,640
Junior. Are you alright?

156
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,120
Are you okay, Junior?

157
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,200
Stop panicking. I’m fine.

158
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,400
It’s them again, isn’t it?

159
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,600
Umm..

160
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,040
Let's go.

161
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,440
Come on.

162
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,960
I need ten minutes.

163
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,840
What are you doing?

164
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,200
Don't you feel cold?

165
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
When I get cold,
my brother would hug me.

166
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,120
Don't be shy.

167
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,080
Suddenly being locked up
doesn’t feel so bad.

168
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,160
Why's that?

169
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,640
I like feeling cold.

170
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,360
Are you alright?

171
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,280
It's Nam again, right?

172
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,160
It’s fine.

173
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,760
What are you doing?

174
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,000
You’re not getting into my class
looking like that.

175
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,240
What should I do then?

176
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,080
I was bullied.

177
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,680
This is my only gym shirt.

178
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,480
Don't talk back.

179
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,320
I won’t be in your class then.

180
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,400
“This is an announcement.”

181
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,160
“Student who took scissors
from the sewing room,”

182
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,920
return them at once.”

183
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,840
What the hell?

184
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,720
What's wrong with you?

185
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,480
I'm just returning what’s yours.

186
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,480
I feel kinda cute wearing it.

187
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,480
Nam is a good stylist.

188
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,160
I’m gonna grab the cleaning stuff.

189
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,720
I take that back, Nam sucks.

190
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,520
Are you gonna let Nam
get away with this?

191
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,040
I won’t.

192
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,360
I just don't want to
play by his games.

193
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,080
Jodd.

194
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,760
Are you alright?

195
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,760
It hurts, duh!

196
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,600
Come.

197
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,440
Don’t get in there.

198
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
You might slip too.

199
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,400
Gimme a hand.

200
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,040
It hurts.

201
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,240
Can you walk?

202
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,880
Jodd.

203
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,840
Quick, take him to the nurse.

204
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,560
I’ll take care of the mess here.

205
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,080
Careful.

206
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,600
Slowly.

207
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,200
- Don't slip.
- Careful.

208
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,160
What happened to you?

209
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,080
Jodd slipped and fell, ma'am.

210
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,240
Bring him to the bed.

211
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,000
Aw, it hurts too much.

212
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,080
Ouchy.

213
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,120
I haven’t started.

214
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,600
Please be gentle.

215
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,000
So what did you do?

216
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,880
I greeted the floor too hard.

217
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:04,840
Not hard enough.

218
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,680
Ouch! Easy, easy. Ma'am.

219
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,240
You deserve it,
cracking a bad joke like that.

220
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,320
Kids these days

221
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,440
just can’t stay out of trouble.

222
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,000
You, give me a hand.

223
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,200
No, no, no.

224
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,040
- No, no, no.
- Stay still.

225
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,440
It stings.

226
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,640
Ouch! It hurts.

227
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,800
Stay strong, kiddo.

228
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,360
Ouch! Jeng, easy.

229
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,320
You’ll need a soft cast
on your ankle.

230
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,080
It's just a sprain,
nothing serious.

231
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,120
A cast?

232
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,720
Ouch! It hurts.

233
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,200
Easy, please.

234
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,320
Come on.

235
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,960
Name went too far this time.

236
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,280
Why won’t he leave us be?

237
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,240
Nam will do it again.

238
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,320
What should we do?

239
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,000
It’s time we fight fire

240
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,640
with fire.

241
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,120
Alright, break into groups
assigned to you

242
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,960
for our volunteer activities.

243
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,520
Today we’re doing something
a bit different.

244
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,280
One of the groups

245
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,560
will clean the chicken coops.

246
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,280
Any volunteers?
Raise your hand.

247
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I have faith in you...

248
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,680
Junior.

249
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,080
I am so proud of you.

250
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Hey, Auntie Noi.

251
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,240
Children, are you here
with the school?

252
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,560
Do you live here?

253
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,760
Come inside to
have some water.

254
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,960
It's hot today.

255
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,080
It's okay, Auntie.

256
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,200
We have to do some work soon.

257
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,040
Come visit when you’re done.

258
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,240
Want my help?

259
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,360
Nah.

260
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,800
You’re bad at cleaning.
Just watch the chickens.

261
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,320
Wanna come out?

262
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,840
Who’s this human
talking to?

263
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,000
You. I’m talking to you.

264
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,280
So you know bird-speak?

265
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,840
Yup, I know it.

266
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,120
Wanna come out, then?

267
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,960
I’d love that,
human boy.

268
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
The thing is,

269
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,800
do you see that guy over there?

270
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,160
I want you to find out

271
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,800
what they’re scheming about.

272
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
Deal, babe.

273
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,840
Of course the night guard
would fall asleep.

274
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,480
Really?

275
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,080
I don't think so.

276
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,440
All night guards do is sleep.

277
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,560
He’s not gonna be asleep this time.

278
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
Okay, then...

279
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,880
You wanna bet on it?

280
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,200
If he falls asleep,
you gotta pay up.

281
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,560
I’ll throw in 2K.

282
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,880
He wouldn't.

283
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,600
Cuz you’re paying him
to sneak around at night.

284
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,200
What the heck?

285
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,680
Where are the chickens?

286
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Jodd, Jeng.

287
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Jodd, can you stall Ms. Samorn
for a bit? Jeng, you too.

288
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,320
Why?

289
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,520
Don't ask now.

290
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,040
Where are the chickens?

291
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,920
They ran away,
but I'll get them back.

292
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,760
We’re screwed.

293
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,200
Ms. Samorn is there, quick.

294
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,880
Go now.

295
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,360
- Just go.
- Jodd, come on.

296
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,240
I’ll signal you.

297
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,480
What should we do?

298
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,320
What the heck?

299
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,360
Ma'am, please. Ma'am.

300
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,240
Hello, boys.

301
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,520
What's wrong with your shirt?

302
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,560
Shirt?

303
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,160
Oh...The chickens surrounded
my friend, ma'am.

304
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,960
I guess
they must be fighter cocks.

305
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,280
Good thing
we made it out, unharmed.

306
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,320
But a button came off.

307
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,160
- Button.
- Oh...

308
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,360
Okay. Come on, I'll teach you
how to sew it on.

309
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,760
That is great.

310
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,240
A good opportunity to

311
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,320
bring theory into practice.

312
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,520
You want us to do it?

313
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,080
Learning by doing
makes you remember.

314
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,040
Go ahead.

315
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,880
Okay.

316
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,040
Just try it.

317
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,680
Sew it at the middle of the button.
That's it.

318
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,600
Just pierce it through, right?

319
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,160
Just do it. Be careful.
You don’t wanna cut his nipple.

320
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,880
- There. Be careful.
- All right.

321
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,720
Almost sewed into my hand.

322
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,320
Almost there.

323
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,640
Are you done yet?

324
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,600
Someone let the chickens out.

325
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,240
Oh, no.

326
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,240
Heck, no!

327
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,200
Jodd's shirt is torn too, ma'am.

328
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,080
But the chickens are out.

329
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,560
But, ma'am.
My nipple is showing.

330
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,720
At this point, we need to do
some hidden stitches.

331
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,960
Hidden stitches?

332
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,040
Let me show you.

333
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,120
Be careful.

334
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,000
Tonight they’re scheming something
at the old building.

335
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,640
But it doesn't seem
like a good thing.

336
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,080
So, this is it.

337
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,080
So you don't see

338
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,640
any stitches.

339
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,200
Why's that?

340
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,760
Because I hid them.

341
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,800
All right, hidden stitches.

342
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,280
All right.

343
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,600
Watch how I do it.

344
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,960
I'll do it slowly.

345
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,800
Okay.

346
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,360
Ma'am, I think I got it.

347
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,760
Okay, you are very smart.

348
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
But I still need
to finish this tiny bit.

349
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,120
The chickens!

350
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,560
Over here.

351
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,920
Help me.

352
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,280
Work together.
If you can't catch them,

353
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,640
you are not allowed
to go back to the school.

354
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,280
Help me, I hurt my leg. Ma'am.

355
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,480
You just catch it.

356
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,840
- One... two... three.
- Do it now.

357
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,720
Come on, catch it.

358
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,240
Catch it now.

359
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,440
How did I end up here?

360
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,520
Why are you surprised?

361
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,240
Oh?

362
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,280
Are you visiting your son?

363
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,440
No, no.

364
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,960
So, why are you sneaking peeks?

365
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,440
What are you doing exactly
in front of school?

366
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,800
I happen to be

367
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,520
a zookeeper.

368
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
I am looking for a penguin.

369
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,520
He escaped from the cage.

370
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,200
Penguin?

371
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,480
Like a penguin penguin?

372
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,160
Like...

373
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,440
an actual penguin?

374
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,520
- Um...
- Not a plushie?

375
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,720
Not a plushie.

376
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,800
You...

377
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,520
Sure you’re not daydreaming or...

378
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,480
Let's say it's a real penguin.

379
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,280
Got that?

380
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,040
And he is so smart.

381
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,640
Most importantly, he actually
understands human language.

382
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,080
This is so awesome.

383
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:50,960
Are you…

384
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,080
Are you on drugs?

385
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,600
Or in the unit

386
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,040
for secret operations?

387
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,960
Let's say,

388
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,200
it's all right
if you don't see him.

389
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,600
I just

390
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,000
want to show off my penguin.

391
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,320
He understands human language.

392
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,080
That's all.

393
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,040
It's okay.

394
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,880
I am leaving now.

395
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,080
He understands human language

396
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,920
for every word?

397
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,480
Yes, yes.

398
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,600
Like yellow.

399
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,200
Yellow.

400
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:21,920
Mango.

401
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,600
Mango.

402
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,320
Ito!

403
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,520
Are you lonely?

404
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,880
I’ve been here for a long time,

405
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,560
seen many bonkers.

406
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,400
Parents can be cray-cray.

407
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,600
He is lonely.

408
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,960
This crazy guy
searching for a penguin.

409
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,000
Said he lost his penguin.

410
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,480
Too many things happen
to me in one day.

411
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,840
Wait up.

412
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,560
We are here.

413
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,880
It's Nam’s doing for sure.

414
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,560
What the heck?

415
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,880
What should we do?

416
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,000
Auntie.

417
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,440
Oh?

418
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
What happened, children?

419
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,320
And why are you still here?

420
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,280
We missed the bus.

421
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,720
Oh!

422
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,200
Come in first, children.

423
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,120
Beware of the mosquitoes.
Come in quickly.

424
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,760
Thank you.

425
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,640
Be careful.

426
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,960
Careful, dear.

427
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,440
And have you eaten
anything yet, children?

428
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,120
Not yet, Auntie.

429
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,960
Come sit and have a meal first.

430
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,480
Sit here.

431
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,080
There’s so much food, Auntie.

432
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,840
Is someone else coming too?

433
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,320
No one is coming.

434
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,400
It happens.

435
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,480
I planned to make a little bit,

436
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,320
but I always ended up making a lot.

437
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,920
I’ll go fry some more eggs for you.

438
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,840
Just a moment.

439
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,080
Yes.

440
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,800
Are you hungry, Jodd?

441
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,280
Starving.

442
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,040
As much as you can, okay?

443
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,680
So you won’t be hungry
when you go back.

444
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,800
Thank you.

445
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,560
That was close. Why didn’t you
watch out for the car , dear?

446
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,520
You might get hurt.

447
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,880
Are you feeling dizzy again, child?

448
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,520
Have you been taking
your medicine properly?

449
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,240
I can't remind you
when you're at school, you know.

450
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,920
All right.

451
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,080
Look.

452
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,600
What did you get on your clothes?

453
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,000
My friends asked me out for fun.

454
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,400
Are you going on
a trip abroad, Auntie?

455
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,240
No, child.

456
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,200
I’m moving in with my partner.

457
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,000
In Australia.

458
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,440
So, when are you leaving, Auntie?

459
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,200
I am not sure yet.

460
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,040
I need to finish all my errands.

461
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,880
I’m afraid that when I leave...

462
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,240
you all will miss me.

463
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,720
Oh, I'm already missing you, Auntie!

464
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,200
Where else could we find
a custodian as lovely as you?

465
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,160
You are too much.

466
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,560
But I will definitely miss you.

467
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,440
If the new custodian is mean,

468
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,680
I will miss you more and more.

469
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,240
I will miss you too.

470
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,760
Your food is the most delicious.

471
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,920
I'm afraid you'll end up
missing us more, Auntie.

472
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,560
I will surely miss all of you children.

473
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,600
You should go there.

474
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,640
There's no way
we’ll ever forget you, Auntie.

475
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,280
Oh, Sun. Are you serious?

476
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,000
Auntie might be kidding.

477
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,520
Right?

478
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,920
Sun’s talking a lot today, huh?

479
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,160
Normally, Jodd is
the most talkative one.

480
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,200
Oh.

481
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,760
Come on, hurry up and eat!

482
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,440
I will take you all back to school.

483
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,360
If we're late,
the teacher will scold you.

484
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,240
Sun.

485
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,600
Sun.

486
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,680
Come here.

487
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,200
Did he go to sleep?

488
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,080
No.

489
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,520
It’s too warm.

490
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
I can't breathe.

491
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,520
Why are you so stiff?

492
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,480
You’re not soft like me.

493
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,440
Isn’t it good?

494
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,000
It's good. Stiff is good.

495
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,320
Don't come too close. It's hot.

496
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
I’m falling off.

497
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,080
Oh, no.

498
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,080
He already went to sleep.

499
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,840
You’re right.

500
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,640
Keep your voice down.

501
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,200
I'll be back.

502
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,960
Two...three...four...
five...six...seven...

503
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,560
It's good being a guard.

504
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,800
I am doing nothing
and still have money.

505
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,120
But if there were
hundreds of kids like this one,

506
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,040
I'll be rich.

507
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,320
So good.

508
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,560
Proud to be rich.

509
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,360
Cheers.

510
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,480
Oh.

511
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,600
I'll get some sleep.

512
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,400
Is it really this easy?

513
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,640
Let’s go now?

514
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,920
Wait for ten minutes.

515
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,240
Before I left,
I saw Nam still asleep.

516
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,240
So, Jeng made a plan.

517
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,080
What took you so long?

518
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,720
What did you guys do?

519
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,680
Jeng and I were here
for quite some time.

520
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,240
- Sun was in the bathroom.
- Sun was asleep.

521
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,080
What was it exactly?

522
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,080
Well,

523
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,480
we slept and went to the bathroom.

524
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,600
You slipped up.

525
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,760
You just go.

526
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,280
You are defeated.

527
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,040
Anyway, under the tree
is a path to the old building.

528
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,360
You and Junior wait for him there.

529
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,720
Then, Jodd and I...

530
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,600
will go wait for them
at the old building.

531
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,880
Okay?

532
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,720
Okay, go.

533
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,680
Quiet.

534
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,800
Go.

535
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,640
Oh, it fell down.

536
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,400
What are the lights in the sky, Sun?

537
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,040
They’re stars.

538
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,000
It's beautiful.

539
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,240
So, what is a star?

540
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,720
Well...

541
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,160
we are now on
something like a star.

542
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,360
It's called...

543
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,960
the planet Earth,

544
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,040
a big rock floating in the sky.

545
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,680
But actually,

546
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,640
planets don’t give out light.

547
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,000
The light from the sun

548
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,760
reflects on those rocks.

549
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,920
That’s why they sparkle.

550
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,760
Hey, what was
that light just now, Sun?

551
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,600
A shooting star.

552
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,440
People make a wish on it.

553
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,200
They believe that
their wish will come true.

554
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,160
Do you want to make a wish?

555
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,920
Palms together
and close your eyes.

556
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,640
Then, make a wish.

557
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,360
Try it.

558
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Palms together.

559
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Then, make a wish from your heart.

560
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,560
Why are you smiling?

561
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,480
What did you wish for?

562
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,840
I wish Sun would stop
wearing a stern face.

563
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,200
When did I wear a stern face?

564
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,600
All the time.

565
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,320
What did you wish for?

566
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,880
Nobody tells what they wish for.

567
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,800
Oh.

568
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,120
But you just asked me.

569
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,880
Just tell me.

570
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,040
Just a bit.

571
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,320
I wish to forget
the worst thing that happened.

572
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,840
So, this is about Nam.

573
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,720
What?

574
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,240
Don't speak like
you know everything.

575
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,280
So, I don't know then.

576
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Nam is the one who hurt you, right?

577
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
You don't have to be afraid,

578
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,360
I will never hurt you.

579
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,080
You're smiling.

580
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,320
No, I didn't.

581
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,200
Really?

582
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,040
I didn't.

583
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,120
Alright, you didn't smile.

584
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,440
- No, I didn't smile.
- No, you didn't smile.

585
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,120
Don't do that.

586
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,200
You will fall from the tree.

587
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,320
What?

588
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,680
I'll do this.

589
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,120
Sun, you will fall down.

590
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,720
Just don't do it.

591
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,920
You will fall down.

592
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,720
Jodd, Jodd. Jodd.

593
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,880
Jodd.

594
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,720
Nam is coming.

595
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,360
I will take my revenge.

596
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,720
He'll pay
for what he did to me.

597
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,160
Quiet.

598
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,080
What did you just do?

599
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,440
When did you come in?

600
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,440
Mos, go and see

601
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,920
if the things you prepared
are ready or not.

602
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,880
Me?

603
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,720
Yes, you go.

604
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,920
What is it?

605
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,160
Whoa!

606
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,200
Whoa!

607
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,160
Ah!

608
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,880
Mos, go and see
what was that noise.

609
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,880
Me again?

610
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,400
I told you not to
come here around this time.

611
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,720
What the heck?

612
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,800
Where’s that creepy sound coming from?

613
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,400
Hey, not that.

614
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,000
At last,

615
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,440
you all have come to see me.

616
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,040
Nam.

617
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,480
I've waited for
this day for so long.

618
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,040
What the heck?

619
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,520
Nam, someone is calling your name.

620
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,840
I am going now.

621
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,240
You just can't go.

622
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,560
Ghost!

623
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,320
What the heck?

624
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,360
What the heck?

625
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,000
Hey, what's this?

626
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,040
Who did this?

627
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
What the hell is wrong with you?

628
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,560
And you? What's wrong with you?

629
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,280
You don’t know how to lose,
do you?

630
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,840
What the hell
are you talking about?

631
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,840
I don’t know what
you have been through in life.

632
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,680
If you mess with my friends,

633
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,840
I won’t let you get away with it.

634
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,640
I will live happily,

635
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,280
to the point where you have to
compare yourself to me every day.

636
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,800
I will make you feel defeated

637
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,760
and lose any hopes in life.

638
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,160
The one who’ll end up
with those feelings

639
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,960
will be you,

640
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,240
not me.

641
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,560
What should I do?

642
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,240
Have you seen his face?

643
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,920
He looks so funny.

644
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,000
You've put on a good show.

645
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,040
I am good at it.

646
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,240
Sun, follow me.

647
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,200
What's up, Auntie Noi?

648
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,800
Keep quiet.

649
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,480
Just don't ask.

650
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,520
Would you help me?

651
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,520
You all are so noisy.

652
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,120
Stop making noise now.

653
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,560
Just sleep,
so I can go back to my sleep.
