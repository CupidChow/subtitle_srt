[8 hours earlier]

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,440
What the hell is your problem?

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,600
Oh, shoot!
Did another inmate died on me!

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,080
Hey!

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,880
Hey! Wake up!

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,800
Hey! Hey!

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,120
Sleep tight my man.

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,920
Take good care of him, will you?

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,920
Okay.

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,360
That's intense, isn't it?

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,360
You should watch
WeTV dramas once in a while.

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,040
This trope has been
remade so many times,

17
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,440
and you still fall for it.

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,520
Knocked out cold, huh?
You idiot!

19
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,320
Hurry up! What are you doing?

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,360
I'm taking his gun.

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,640
He'll wake up soon!
Hurry up, let's go!

22
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,440
Shoot! How do you open this thing?

23
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,520
Well, do it then!

24
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,280
How should I do it?

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,520
Hey, the other side too!

26
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,120
Unlock it and run!

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,640
My hand is not steady.

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,560
I can't do it.

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,840
He'll wake up soon.

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,040
Bro, I think we should just run.

31
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,640
Forget about the penguins!

32
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,640
You sure like saying
stupid things, huh?

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,360
I'm serious, man.

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,920
Let's escape.

35
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,720
Take your mom with you too.

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:41,960
And it's all over.

37
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,400
You jerk,

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
I know you escaped already.

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,760
I'm giving you two days.

40
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,840
You'd better
bring all the animals back,

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,440
and don't even think about running.

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,680
You know I know
exactly where you two are, right?

43
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,400
Hey,

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,480
don't be like that.

45
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,600
We're not planning
to run away, boss.

46
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
If you try to run, you can start

47
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
preparing your mother's funeral.

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,040
Fine,

49
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
keep threatening all you want.

50
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,080
You think I’m scared of you?

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,160
You're not scared, right?

52
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,800
Then let's run.

53
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,640
No, I'm not scared.

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
It's about ethics.

55
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,400
When you work, you have
to finish what you started.

56
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,880
Yeah, really.

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,960
Where the hell are we supposed
to get the penguin to give them?

58
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
You think that kid...

59
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,120
was really a penguin?

60
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,960
I don't know either.

61
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,240
Do you remember when we
followed them to the school?

62
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,240
I told you I was
possessed by a ghost,

63
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,040
but you didn't believe me.

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
You thought I was
just messing things up.

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,520
How could I believe you

66
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,440
when you had so many
amulets around your neck?

67
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Wait!

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,960
My amulet necklace went missing too!

69
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,560
How could that happen?

70
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,840
You usually keep the amulet
with you all the time, don't you?

71
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
Did you see me wearing it?

72
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,120
See.

73
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,160
Can you explain how my amulet
necklace went missing?

74
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,840
A fool like you might
have just left it somewhere.

75
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,800
Stop overthinking and stop
being so superstitious.

76
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,120
Yeah,

77
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,920
I'm stupid,

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,560
I admit it.

79
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,920
So, tell me, smart guy.

80
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,160
All this crazy
stuff that's happened,

81
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,520
did it all happen just
because I'm stupid?

82
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,560
I know

83
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,440
you don't believe
in ghosts or spirits,

84
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,520
but think about it.

85
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,320
Why did that kid know

86
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,360
you were the one
who gave the penguin its name?

87
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,200
Did you see the tattoo on my back?

88
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,320
Had I not received this amulet,
from the shaman…

89
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,840
I don't know what
would have happened to me.

90
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,440
He said that

91
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,560
I was going through a rough time

92
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,080
and could be facing my end.

93
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,320
Because there's
a spirit targeting us.

94
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,640
You think we've made it this far

95
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,360
because of your plan?

96
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,640
I think

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,840
before we go after that kid,

98
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,960
I think we should go make
an offering to the shaman first.

99
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,000
Are you going?

100
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,520
You're the superstitious one.

101
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,440
Did you two recently committed

102
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,520
grave sins against animals?

103
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,800
The spirits of the beasts

104
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,080
are seeking revenge on you both.

105
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,480
In this situation,

106
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,840
what should we do?

107
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,400
I know, I see...

108
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,960
Whoa, so sacred!

109
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,760
Blessed this dude.

110
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,680
A penguin?

111
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,040
You two, should just go home no?

112
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,000
Wait, help us first!

113
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,240
Don't chase us away yet.

114
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,640
I thought you guys went around

115
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,120
killing bears, bulls,

116
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,440
panthers, lions.

117
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,520
Not just some tiny penguin.

118
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,720
Why are you so weak?

119
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,200
Hey wait a minute now.

120
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,920
Shaman, please help us!

121
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,000
What's wrong with you?

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,200
You two

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,960
are in trouble now.

124
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,680
And this time,

125
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,080
I can't help you guys.

126
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,920
Oh, what a waste of time.

127
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,040
Don't go yet.

128
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,280
Especially you pretty boy,

129
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,960
your fate is sealed.
You're facing your end.

130
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,400
Mr. Shaman, please help me!
Please!

131
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,840
I told you already.

132
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,000
Have you ever
heard of the "lycanthrope"?

133
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,440
The lycanthrope is
a wolf human hybrid

134
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,880
that can transforms between

135
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,120
a human and blends in with us.

136
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,120
A "penguinthrope"?

137
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,800
Yes,

138
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,600
a "penguinthrope".

139
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,280
Hey.

140
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,160
You need to use this

141
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,680
for the ritual to
bring back its original form.

142
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,800
You guys should give it a try.

143
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,040
This is...

144
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,160
Is this a human skin, Father?

145
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,040
It's no dog skin!

146
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,000
If you succeed,

147
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,680
you will get what you want.

148
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,800
You didn't tell me you'd stop.

Are you there?

Sun! Sorry, I'm late.

Besides what you've told me,

160
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,480
do you have any other clues?

161
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,720
Where has the spirit
mother of the mole gone?

162
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,920
Why isn't she
coming out to help you?

163
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,560
What happened
to the spirit mother of the mole?

164
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
I don't know either.

165
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,360
I've been calling her
for a while now.

166
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,720
No matter how much I called,
she wouldn't come out.

167
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,800
I don't know if it's
related to this statue or not.

168
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
Where have you been?

169
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,800
I've been everywhere already.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,800
The wood,

171
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,120
the zoo,

172
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,320
Ton and Nut's house,

173
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,640
and even the school.

174
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,160
I don't know where to go anymore.

175
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
Do you remember
the car's license plate?

176
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,520
- Mother of the mole!
- Mother of the mole!

177
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,720
Do you want a big room
or a small room?

178
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,600
I'll take the room with a bathtub.

179
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,160
It would be good
to take a shower first

180
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,040
to feel refreshed.

181
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,960
You don't have to be shy.

182
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,600
Some days, we have
ten people just in one room.

183
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,280
Well, the room with a bathtub,

184
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,840
there's only one left,
the large room on the second floor.

185
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,520
Let's go.

186
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,440
Shall we?

187
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,600
Okay.

188
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,440
Let's go.

189
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Thank you.

190
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,840
Sit!

191
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,880
Ugh, there's so much dust.

192
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,600
Shut the door! People will see.

193
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,680
I can't breathe.

194
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,320
When are you going
to stop being so stupid?

195
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,880
What are you doing?

196
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,600
[Motel Hotel Resort]

197
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,360
Hurry up and get prepping.

198
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,440
Get over here.

199
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
I know you don't want to do this.

200
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,800
You were forced, right?

201
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,120
If you want money,

202
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,360
I can go get it for you.

203
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,920
This ritual

204
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,000
will return you
to your original form.

205
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,160
If the ceremony ends and you're
still not the same as before,

206
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,600
it means you were lying.

207
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,800
And if you were lying,

208
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
what will happen next, Korn?

209
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,160
Death, I guess?

210
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,880
And if you don't want to die,

211
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,920
you better pray to
return to your original form.

212
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,560
Goddess.

213
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,880
You said you could handle it, right?

214
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,040
That's it, huh?

215
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,080
So, do you know?

216
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,960
The power has
its limits too, you know.

217
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,840
You guys don't have any clues,

218
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,720
what do you expect me to do?

219
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,960
Do you know The Lord of the Rings?

220
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,600
Like when Frodo puts on the ring

221
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,520
and Sauron can
feel where the ring is?

222
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,000
Lord what? Is that a tiktok?

223
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,040
So here's the thing.

224
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,480
If you hold something Junior's cherished,

225
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,760
will you be able to
know where Junior is?

226
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,600
Interesting,

227
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,040
I've never tried it either.

228
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,680
I can give it a shot.

229
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,120
But is there anything

230
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,400
That can be considered
Junior's cherished item?

231
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,760
Wait. I have this.

232
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,920
Junior always carries with him,

233
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,200
will it work?

234
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Please keep an eye
on my dancer doll.

235
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,600
If anything seems off,

236
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,080
you need to wake up the owner
of this body immediately.

237
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,560
Okay.

238
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,160
Junior is being held by them.

239
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,280
It seems like they're about
to perform some kind of ritual.

240
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,920
Motel.

241
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,640
Hotel.

242
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,040
Resort.

243
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,520
Aunty Noi!

244
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,800
- Aunty Noi!
- Aunty!

245
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,920
Aunty! Wake up!

246
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,640
Aunty! Wake up! Aunty!

247
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,800
Hey! Aunty!

248
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,400
Sis! Sis!

249
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,640
Where is Junior, Sis?

250
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,040
- Sis?
- Don't ask her yet.

251
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,760
Let her breathe for a moment.

252
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,400
I'll take care of Aunt Noi.

253
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,560
You guys go look for Junior,

254
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,160
following the hint she gave earlier.

255
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,040
So, is it going to be

256
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,840
a hotel,

257
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,440
motel, or resort?

258
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,800
Hotel,

259
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,640
motel,

260
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,280
resort?

261
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,880
Hmm, it seems familiar.

262
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,120
Is it the Motel Hotel Resort?

263
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,720
Why?

264
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,280
What are you going to do there?

265
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,640
Then why do you
sound a bit like Aunt Noi?

266
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,640
I'm here!

267
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,880
What now, should we go?
Let's help Junior!

268
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,880
So, who's who here?

269
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,840
When the doll broke,

270
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,080
that aunty body
became too tough,

271
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,240
to re-entered her body.

272
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,520
I couldn't enter anyone's body,

273
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,400
but it just happened
to enter Ms Samorn's body.

274
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,480
Shall we go now?

275
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,720
Are we going to help Junior?

276
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,920
Good! Let's go help Junior.
I'll drive.

277
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,560
Let's go.

278
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,000
Let's go!

279
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,880
Wait a minute,

280
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,680
is it you?

281
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,520
The ghost that likes to possess me?

282
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,800
And why do you have
to possess my body?

283
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,240
If I had a choice, I wouldn't want
to possess Auntie's body either.

284
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,840
What?

285
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,080
You're a hundred years old

286
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,600
and still dare to
call others "Auntie"?

287
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,880
Oh, well, you seem
more experienced than me.

288
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,440
I've been dead since I was young,

289
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,120
with a short life and no husband.

290
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,680
Who could be as hot as you,

291
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,920
with a foreign guy
coming to flirt with you?

292
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,160
How does she know that?

293
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,440
When possessing someone,

294
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,240
it's like I'm that person.

295
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,080
I can see their thoughts,
memories, everything.

296
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,000
But,

297
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,480
I wasn't interested in that.

298
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,840
Like when you

299
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,320
argued with your husband,

300
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,280
I didn't see anything.

301
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,640
And how did you know

302
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,800
I argued with my husband?

303
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,480
Everyone's bound to have issues
with their husband, right?

304
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,840
But that time when you

305
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,840
kicked that guy out of
your life after he hit you—

306
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,040
that was

307
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
iconic!

308
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,080
See?

309
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,560
Privacy doesn't exist around here.

310
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,280
From now on,

311
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,880
stay out of my business.

312
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,280
Access denied!

313
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,960
I've been meaning
to tell you for a while now.

314
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,800
Stop blaming yourself, Auntie.

315
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,120
Your child is truly blessed, Auntie,

316
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,880
to have reincarnated so quickly.

317
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,360
Before leaving,

318
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
he left a message
for you through me:

319
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,240
"Stop crying."

320
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,720
He wants you to
finally find happiness.

321
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,560
Crazy.

322
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,240
Nonsense!

323
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,360
There's no such thing as ghosts.

324
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,360
What is it then?

325
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,840
Sitting here talking,
if not a ghost...

326
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,160
or a talking fly?

327
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,760
Shoot!

328
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,960
The goddess is amazing.

329
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,040
You can possess someone

330
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,520
and still meddle
in their personal business.

331
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,600
And what about Ms Samorn?
How is she doing?

332
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,720
Ms Samorn might look like this,

333
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,360
but she's lowkey got her flair!

334
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,640
Really?!

335
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,640
Still,

336
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,080
using someone else's body

337
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,920
and getting involved
in their personal issues?

338
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,200
I'm going to tell Ms Samorn.

339
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,720
Do you want to know?

340
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,160
I want to know.

341
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,520
It goes like this...

342
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,760
Aunty?

343
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,800
The big room was just taken.

344
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,920
Can you use a smaller room instead?

345
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,360
Did someone just take it?

346
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,720
Um, yes.

347
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,720
They took it just now,
with three people.

348
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,800
I asked the spirits here,

349
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,240
and they said Junior is

350
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,240
locked up in the big room.

351
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,600
I'll take the small room,

352
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,720
but I'd prefer the one next to the
room with the three people earlier.

353
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,800
Okay.

354
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,240
Thank you.

355
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,400
You're being really impatient, huh?

356
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
What are you doing?

357
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,080
It says the water
should be chest deep.

358
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,400
Oh, here it is then.

359
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,160
You donkey,

360
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,800
this is called chest high!

361
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,080
Deep! The water needs
to rise to this level!

362
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,560
It needs to rise up
to this level right here!

363
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,440
You fool,

364
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,520
this is called the neck level!

365
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,560
This is the chest level!
The chest is right here!

366
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,960
The chest is right here, right?

367
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,560
It has to be submerged
beyond the chest level.

368
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,760
DEEP, chest deep.

369
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,840
Idiot, this is called
the level of the neck.

370
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,240
Do you even know
what the neck level is?

371
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,680
You're stubborn!

372
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,440
The water has to rise to
above chest level, right here.

373
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,520
It has to rise up to here.

374
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,840
It should rise up to here.

375
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,480
If it goes wrong,
can you take responsibility?

376
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,360
You idiot,

377
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,360
Damn.

378
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,520
The world must really revolve
around you, huh? You jerk.

379
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,600
Do whatever you want, asshole.

380
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,320
If he can't return to your body,

381
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,280
don't blame me.

382
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,120
Try Googling it yourself.

383
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,840
Where are you going?

384
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,320
What the heck?

385
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,800
Junior?

386
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,560
Junior?

387
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,560
Sun?

388
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,760
Are you okay?

389
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
I thought you weren't going to come.

390
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,520
How could I leave you?

391
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,960
I won't leave you.

392
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,560
What should we do?

393
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,880
I remember that

394
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,480
the big room has
a fire escape.

395
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,880
I'll go.

396
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,160
Hey, calm down.

397
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Calm down, okay?

398
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,000
If you force your way in and
get shot, what will you do?

399
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,040
We need to separate them first.

400
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,280
I will handle it myself.

401
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,960
Can you handle it, Goddess?

402
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,240
Well, there's only Ms Samorn

403
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,640
whom they haven't seen yet.

404
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,520
It has to be me then.

405
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,040
Please take care of the statue.

406
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,120
Okay, I will.

407
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,640
In that case, I'll leave it to you,
Auntie Noi. Please call the police.

408
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,680
Stay still.

409
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,120
Who is this?

410
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,760
You go check.

411
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,560
Fine,

412
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,760
I'll go.

413
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,280
Yo, what’s poppin baby?

414
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,920
I didn't call you a housekeeper.

415
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,120
Hurtful.

416
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,440
What housewife is this sexy?

417
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,200
Think before you speak.

418
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,920
Who is this?

419
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,680
I don't know either.

420
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,920
It's okay,

421
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,080
I'm here.

422
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,240
I don't want to go
back to being a penguin.

423
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,200
Don’t believe them.

424
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,360
We've we can only return to

425
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,120
our original body when
we're close to death.

426
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,440
Do you have something?

427
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,240
Oh,

428
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,280
my bed is broken.

429
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Can you two go check it out for me?

430
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,600
I don't know how I broke it.

431
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,120
Do we look like a bed repairman?

432
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,360
But you guys are hella fine.

433
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,960
I think you guys can fix it.

434
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,840
Please. Please help me.

435
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,800
Call someone else.

436
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,280
How cruel!

437
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,120
Okay, I will.

438
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,480
Stop it right now.

439
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,600
Don’t you dare.

440
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,880
Hey, don't...

441
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,440
Shoot! What the hell
happened to the goddess?

442
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,840
Hey, calm down.

443
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,000
If you want to go, I'll go myself.

444
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,080
No, I'll go myself.

445
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
Mina listen,

446
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
let me control this body.

447
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,840
I’ll handle it myself.

448
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,480
What's her problem?

449
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,680
What is she playing?

450
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,120
Are you really not going?

451
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,400
If you want to, follow me.

452
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,640
I'm in the room next door.

453
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,440
You’re on you own Sont!

454
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,880
Come in, my love.

455
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,360
This kind of atmosphere is

456
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,640
also quite exciting.

457
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,200
You guys are really stupid.

458
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,320
Korn!

459
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,160
Korn!

460
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,080
Come help me.

461
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,640
You pervert!

462
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,960
What the heck?

463
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,800
You little brats, you guys are

464
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,680
just being irrelevant.

465
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,720
Don't do anything to my students.

466
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,520
Korn...

467
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,440
Oh my gosh!

468
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,240
Seriously, this is no time to
get your rock off

469
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,080
Jeng! Are you okay?

470
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,800
You guys have a lot of friends, huh?

471
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,240
Let go!

472
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,960
What are you going to do?

473
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,880
Let's go.

474
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,800
This way, Ju!

475
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,960
Let's go.

476
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,520
Auntie Noi is going to get the car.

477
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,880
What the heck are you calling for?

478
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,040
I know.

479
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,240
Kids! Watch out!

480
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,760
Is the goddess going
to be okay, Jeng?

481
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,800
Sun!

482
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,440
Sun!

483
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,040
Sun!

484
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,600
How could you just leave me like this?

485
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,160
Didn't you promise
that we'd be together forever?

486
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,200
♪Loners together♪
