1
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,160
I’m still not sure

2
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,040
how things ended up going this far.

3
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,280
I might be too naive

4
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,600
and too slow to keep up with the others.

5
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,680
But if we’re in the water,

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,280
nobody’s quicker than a penguin like me!

00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,000
Here I come, guys.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,840
Whoever gets to me first

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,520
takes this big fish.

12
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,520
Hurry, hurry.

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,480
Great job, Junior.

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,600
There, all yours.

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,200
Look at you two, trading thanks.

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,920
Junior and Little.

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,360
Let’s go.
People are waiting for our show.

18
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,400
Come on.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,240
Hurry up.

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,920
Let's go.

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,680
Behave, students.

22
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,320
Don't ruin our school's reputation.

23
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,360
Hey, over there—no climbing.

24
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,760
You're not monkeys.

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,880
Or do you think you are?

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,480
Keep up with your friends.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,240
That one is cute.

28
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,680
Next, let's welcome

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,520
our clever twins:

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,240
Junior and Little,

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,720
the incredible penguins of Khao Phran Daeng!

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,280
Yay!

33
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,640
Junior and Little
are Humboldt penguins,

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,440
able to thrive in warm climates,

35
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,040
even in Africa and Asia.

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,200
Each year,
they leave the water to find their mate.

37
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,520
[Junior] “Humans get so happy
when they see animals acting cute.”

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,360
[Junior] “Why does this guy look so grumpy?”

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,640
[Junior] “Anyone who sees
penguins just can’t hold back a smile.”

40
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,600
Ha, gotcha.

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,280
Let's give it up for the twins!

44
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,760
[Junior] “What’s the tea for today?”

45
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,960
Hey,

46
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,880
You ever wanted to leave here?

47
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,760
[Junior] “Of course!”

48
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,280
Never leave.

49
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,280
[Junior] “What? Why not?”

50
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,560
[Junior] “Isn’t it fun outside?”

51
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,760
[Junior] “Humans seem to have so much fun,”

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,960
“always new things to do and...”

53
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,160
[Junior] “Hey, wait up!
I’m not done talking..”

54
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,880
[Penguin No.1] “I’m just as clever as Junior and Little,”

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,320
[Penguin No.1] “but I wasn’t ever chosen to perform.”

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,360
[Penguin No.2] “Stop bragging.
Only Junior understands human-speak.”

57
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,160
[Penguin No.1] “Animals that obsess
over humans too much”

58
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,360
“might one day end up in that empty cage”

59
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,280
[Penguin No.3] “The empty cage that
turns animals into humans, right?”

60
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,040
[Penguin No.1] “Turn into a human? Nope!”

61
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,200
[Penguin No.2 &amp; Penguin No.3] “Spooky!”

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,040
[Junior] “Turning into a human sounds fun!”

63
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,640
[Penguin No.1] “It’s just a silly rumor.”

64
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,680
“That empty cage doesn't really exist!”

65
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,920
[Junior] “Guess I’m the only one”

66
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,000
“hoping that silly rumor...”

67
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,360
“is real.”

ARCTIC

69
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,200
[Junior] “Did I really turn into a human?”

70
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,800
[Junior] “Wow, my legs are long.”

71
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
[Junior] “I gotta tell Little!”

72
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Hey, everyone,

73
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,280
the rumors are true!

74
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,800
It's me, Junior, can you tell?

75
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
Your friend!

76
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,000
Where's Little?

77
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,400
Where did Little go?

78
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,640
Did he turn into a human like me?

79
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,480
He left without saying goodbye?

80
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,400
I won't let that happen.

81
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,000
[Junior] “North Pole, wait for me!”

82
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,040

“I'm going straight to you!”

86
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,040
Hey! Who are you?

87
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Where are you going?

88
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,880
Stop! Stop!

89
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,680
[Junior] “No matter what,
I'm never gonna be caged again.”

90
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Hey!

91
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,520

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,840
Keep eyeing them
and they’ll blush to life.

94
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Want one?

95
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,760
Penguins love fish.

96
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,920
Sure they do.

97
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,720
I'm a penguin.

98
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,720
Hey, come back and pay!

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,000

103
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,160
“Come get your special prize now”

104
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,160
[Junior] “It’s Little.”

105
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,600
Where did you go?
Didn’t think I’d find you here.

106
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,680
I’m so happy you’re here with me, Little!

107
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,640
What's wrong with you?

108
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,720
Please don't die on me!

109
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,480
What're you doing?

110
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,880
Hey! Stop!

111
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Hey! Let go!

112
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,760
Let go! Stop!

PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR.

114
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,720
Please don't be dead.

115
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
It's okay.

116
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,880
Oh, now you're crying?

117
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,320
It’s not real.
It's just a plushie, okay?

118
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,280
I'm sorry.

119
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,640

You're not a student here.
You can't go inside.

- Please, please.
- No!

126
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,800
You don’t go here.

127
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,400
But I am, really.

128
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,840
Oh, why are you so stubborn?

129
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,240

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,520
I missed a number!

134
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,520
Come back here!

135
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,240
Sure I bought the wrong number,

136
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,160
but my memory isn’t wrong.

137
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,360
But I really go here!

138
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,720
Oh really?

139
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,120
Why?

140
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,880
Then tell me, what color
represents this school?

141
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,000
PHANARAK SCHOOL,
KHAO PHRAN DAENG DISTRICT

142
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,840
It’s orange.

143
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,600
Wow, you really know a lot!

144
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,440
What is the motto of this school?

145
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,360
Be Creative, Be Curious, Be Free!

146
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,080
Oh la la.

147
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,960
If you're really a student here,

148
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,160
then what's my name?

149
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,560
Drake?

150
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
It’s Dui!

151
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,440
P’ Dui, come on.

152
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,240
please let me in!

153
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,800
Kid, I’ve got the face card,

154
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,200
but my heart isn't as good as my looks.

155
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,080
I said you can't come in!

156
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,840
Come on, I answered all
your questions! Let me in!

157
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,160
What's all that noise?

158
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,240
It's so chaotic.

159
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,840
It's this kid.

160
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,360
He's trying to get into the school

161
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,760
even though he's
not a student here.

162
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,880
I think I recognize him.

163
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,560
He’s a sophomore from class 3.

164
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,400
Is that right?

165
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,920
Of course.
How long have you worked here?

166
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,960
Can't you
remember this much?

167
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,400
Could you turn off the radio?
Why leave it on?

168
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,440
Go get the uniform and
supplies from the school office.

169
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,640
Okay.

170
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,880
Why am I here?

171
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,080
Are you doing a fit check?

172
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,800
We, students,

173
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,000
must not act in a way

174
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,120
that cause trouble

175
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,600
for ourselves

176
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,000
and others.

177
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,720
Students, stand still.

178
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Respect our flag.

179
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,280
Let’s start today’s activities with good blessings.

180
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,800
Class representatives will hand out donation
envelopes after the line up.

181
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,320
Now is the chance to make merit.

182
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,120
Donate a lot if you have a lot.

183
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,600
Also donate a lot
even if you don’t have any.

184
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,680
Do you understand?

185
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
Yes.

186
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,640
For the afternoon activity,

187
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,280
there will
be club introductions.

188
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,360
I hope everyone will warmly

189
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,160
welcome new members.

190
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,760
I said to stand still!

191
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,160
You should be aiming to
gain knowledge and experience,

192
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,280
in line with our school
motto which is...

193
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,640
Be Creative

194
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,240
Be Curious

195
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,560
Be Free!

196
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,080
Why do we have to stand under the sun?

197
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,520
Can't we stand in the shade?

198
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,720
I can barely hear you all.

199
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,040
One more time.

200
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,000
Be Creative

201
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,640
Be Curious

202
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,240
Be Free!

203
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,120
Last time, say it louder!

204
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,520
Be Creative

205
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,560
Be Curious

206
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,520
Be Free!

207
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,840
You are dismissed.

208
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,840
All students

209
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,640
must join a club

210
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,680
as soon as possible.

211
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,560
Otherwise, you’ll earn demerit points
for bad behavior.

212
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,800
In this heat,
we’re still forced to wear a shirt!

213
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,640
How do humans
manage to live like this?

214
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,720
I’m just gonna dive in the water.

215
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
You're right here!
I was looking for you.

216
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,160
What's your name?

217
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,960
You’re here all alone?

218
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,960
Let’s hang out!

219
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,200
Hold on!

220
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
What’s the hurry?

221
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,960
Tell me your name first.

222
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,840
Do you know

223
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,040
how hard it was to find you?

224
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,520
I ran, got yelled at,
got fooled by a fake penguin,

225
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,800
played 99 questions with the security guard,
and got sun-burned for no reason.

226
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
It was really tough!

227
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,560
So, will you tell me your name?

228
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,760
I'm Junior. What about you?

229
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,360
Tell me and I’ll let you go!

230
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,760
I'm Sun.

231
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,720
Sun.

232
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
Wait, wait.

233
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,960
What are you wearing?

234
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,440
Headphones.

235
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,000
Headphones?

236
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
What are they for?

237
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,440
They're for listening to music.

238
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,480
I can't hear anything at all.

239
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,960
I'm not playing anything now.

240
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,480
Oh, then why are you wearing them?

241
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,400
So that no one bothers me.

242
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,040
Huh, so nothing’s playing.

243
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,200
So, you wanna hang out?

244
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,040
No, thanks.

245
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,320
You’re leaving again?
Come on!

246
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,040
This guy’s got speed.

247
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,440
Wait for me.

248
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,840
Where is he going?

249
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Stop!

250
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,760
Who the heck do you think you are?

251
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,040
Can't you see they're competing?

252
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,280
Move aside!

253
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,480
What's your name?

254
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,080
Junior.

255
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,480
Junior?

256
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,320
From what year?
I’ve never seen your face.

257
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
You swim really fast!

258
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,760
Want to join the swimming club?

259
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,320
If you do, you might win
a sports scholarship.

260
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,080
What’s a sports scholarship?

261
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,960
If you get the scholarship,
you'll get to study for free.

262
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,200
You mean I'll get to
study here, right?

263
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,920
So what do I need to do?

264
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,120
Go apply over there.

265
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,520
Go ahead, over there.

266
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,960
Fill out the application form.

267
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,000
SWIMMING CLUB APPLICATION FORM

268
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,640
JUNIOR OF KHAO PHRAN DAENG

269
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,000
Junior of Khao Phran Daeng?

270
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,440
Sounds unusual.

271
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,200
I'm Nam, the Swim Team’s Captain.

272
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,720
Come to me
if you’ve got any questions.

273
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,680
Did you take swimming lessons?

274
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,920
You’re really fast!

275
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,440
I didn't take any lessons.

276
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,160
I was born a fast swimmer.

277
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,880
Nam practices so hard,
but he's not as fast as you.

278
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,000
Just shut up, Mos.

279
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,600
This is Mos,

280
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,880
my friend who practices hard

281
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,520
but still can't swim as fast as me.

282
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,720
What the heck?

283
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,560
His family’s in electronics.

284
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,840
That’s why he’s got a shocking personality.

285
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,480
You must be familiar

286
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,360
with those “Anong” chained stores in malls.

287
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,040
Named after his dear mommy.

288
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,400
Watch it, dumbass.

289
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,160
This is Nam.

290
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,920
His dad owns a famous
real estate company

291
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,680
with thousands of acres of land

292
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,080
bigger than mountains.

293
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,920
He has hundreds of watches,

294
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,120
but what's even more
impressive is that

295
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
his son won a scholarship
to study for free!

296
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,120
You have a problem with that?

297
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,440
Nah.

298
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,560
Just messing with you.

299
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,600
And you?

300
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,840
Where are you from?

301
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,200
What do your parents do?

302
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,120
I haven't met
my parents for a long time.

303
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,920
They could be in the North Pole right now.

304
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,760
Cool!

305
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,440
That's awesome!

306
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
Come again?

307
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,040
They’re touring the North Pole?

308
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,120
Um.

309
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,880
Don't your parents work?

310
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,880
I don’t think so.

311
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,000
They're probably there,
just sleeping and eating all day.

312
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Cool!

313
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,440
That’s impressive.

314
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,200
What business is your family in?

315
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,640
That's enough, you guys.

316
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,600
You keep throwing questions at him.

317
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,360
Let’s go see the other school clubs.

318
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,800
Since you're new here and all.

319
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,120
What do you say?

320
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,000
Okay.

321
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,880
Come along.

322
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,160
This way.

323
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,720
That way.

324
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,200
one two, one two three

325
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,760
one two, one two, one!

326
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,520
Snatched.

327
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,680
You pass.

328
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,040
His ears are sticking out.

329
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,320
This guy wants to join your club.

330
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,920
I guarantee he's in great shape!

331
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,960
He's kind of cute.

332
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,080
But somehow he pisses me off.

333
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,240
If you're going to talk this loud,

334
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,880
why would you whisper?

335
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,840
I can just leave.

336
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,240
You guys are
trying too hard to be cool.

337
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,680
What's the point of your club?

338
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,600
We don’t have cheerleading competitions.

339
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
What are you up to?

340
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,640
You've got a good build.

341
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,720
Try striking a pose

342
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
like the rest of the squad here.

343
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,000
A bit short, but not bad.

344
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,720
I think he can improve.

345
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,360
How about him?

346
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,000
He might not be
very good at dancing,

347
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,440
but you’re choosing based on looks right?

348
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,720
APPLICATIONS ARE OPEN

349
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,120
If the club before didn’t interest you,
let’s try this one then.

350
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,640
Can you let him join?

351
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,280
That guy?

352
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,680
Aha.

353
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,200
Quite a model student, are you?

354
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,880
You're already in the swimming club

355
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,760
but still looking for better opportunities.

356
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,280
Let’s go in together.

357
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,440
Is something wrong?

358
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,200
Gimme mroe.

359
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,800
Be sad.

360
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,520
Why?

361
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,640
Why did you have to leave me?

362
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,600
Be angry.

363
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,840
You brat!

364
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,680
How could you do this to me?

365
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,240
Back to being happy.

366
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,760
That's good.

367
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
Can you sing?

368
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,920
Bet.

369
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,200
Let’s hear it.

370
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,520
Now.

371
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,480
Thailand unites Thai people
with flesh and blood.

372
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,080
- It is land of...
- Alright, alright.

373
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,480
You're just not what we’re looking for.

374
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,720
Come on, I can act exactly
how you want me to!

375
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,040
Yeah, but you have
to be able to sing, too.

376
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,800
You're off-key and out of rhythm,

377
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,640
and it's just

378
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,560
not worth the trouble for me.

379
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,040
But there are many types
of performances, you know?

380
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,480
Including performance art,

381
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
like theatrical acting, or miming.

382
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,520
The only one that truly matters...

383
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,840
is musical!

384
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,480
If I learn how to sing,
will you let me join?

385
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,560
- Well, no.
- What.

386
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,840
So what are you good at?

387
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,240
I'm not good at anything at all.

388
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
It's okay.

389
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,280
You can always learn.

390
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,960
Welcome aboard!

391
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,360
Honestly, I've been
performing my whole life

392
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,600
now I’m kind of fed up.

393
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,640
LIBRARY

394
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,560
Wait here, okay?

395
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,240
Right now, there are only 3 spots
left in the reading club.

396
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,160
Line up!

397
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,560
One, two, three,

398
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,320
four.

399
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,720
Hey,

400
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,640
you're Junior, right?

401
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,560
I'm Jod.

402
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Mr. Junior,

403
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,920
I'm begging you,

404
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,800
can you please make way for me?

405
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,280
I'm not handsome, not rich,
and not good at anything.

406
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,760
But you have the swimming club

407
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,880
and clubs welcoming
you everywhere.

408
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,240
I'm begging you,

409
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,440
can I be third in line, Mr. Junior?

410
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,800
I'm begging you, Mr. Junior.

411
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,240
Please. Please.

412
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,160
Please, Mr. Junior.

413
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,320
Okay.

414
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,120
Really?

415
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,200
Thanks, budd.

416
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,160
My ass is saved.

417
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,560
LIBRARY

418
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,840
Weren’t you the guy who
won the Computer Olympiad?

419
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,840
Come on in, before the others!

420
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,480
You can code, right?

421
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,720
Great! Welcome, you talented boy!

422
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,320
This sucks.

423
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,760
Isn’t this called “beauty privileges”?

424
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,000
Okay, the rest can come in now.

425
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,360
Come in.

426
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
We’re full now.

427
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,080
You can leave.

428
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,880
LIBRARY

429
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,880
Are you okay, Jodd?

430
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,240
We still have other clubs to choose.

431
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,760
You don’t get it.

432
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,560
Explain to me so I can get you, then.

433
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,760
You’re talented and good-looking.

434
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,760
Of course all the clubs want you.

435
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,880
But I'm useless!

436
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,960
You can do whatever you want to do.

437
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,760
All I want is to join a club,
but I can’t even manage to do that.

438
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,440
All I want is to go to the North Pole,
but I can’t even manage that too.

439
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
What are you talking about?

440
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,080
You said so yourself that
I can do whatever I want to do.

441
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,240
Penguins live in the North Pole,

442
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,840
so I want to go to the North Pole.

443
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,400
But I can’t even manage to do that, see?

444
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,760
Oh.

445
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,320
Right.

446
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,200
But penguins don't live
in the North Pole, you know.

447
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Have some manners.

448
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,480
Didn't your parents teach you not to snoop?

449
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,760
Oh, I don’t have parents.

450
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,320
By the way, how do you use this?

451
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,600
What do you want to know?

452
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,760
Are there penguins
in the North Pole?

453
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,720
NO!

454
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,680
Is this real?

455
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,600
No!

456
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,000
I already told you penguins
don't live in the North Pole.

457
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,680
Yeah,

458
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,320
penguins don't live
in the North Pole.

459
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,120
I just don't know how to
live my life from here.

460
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,240
You're tripping.

461
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,560
It's like your whole life
revolves around the North Pole.

462
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,440
And here you are,
being sad about school clubs.

463
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,600
But I believe that

464
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,480
there’s a club outside that wants you

465
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,880
How positive of you.

466
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,160
During times like this,

467
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,240
we need something to
anchor our emotions.

468
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,840
Ever heard of the “Mole Goddess”?

469
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,880
No.

470
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,320
Didn’t you know? She’s a spirit

471
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,680
of a hundred-year-old lady,
who haunts that tree.

472
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,800
Legend says that

473
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,160
if the Goddess possesses someone,
a mole will appear next to their nose.

474
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,800
This Goddess character is too sus.

475
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,320
Can you not interrupt me?

476
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,520
Let me finish.

477
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,160
If the Goddess fulfills your wishes,
and you don’t repay her,

478
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,600
get ready to be
haunted every night.

479
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,240
Just don’t make a wish.

480
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,800
So you wouldn’t have to repay her.

481
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,280
No!

482
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,080
This is the last chance
for me to be in a club.

483
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,680
Please let me

484
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,720
be in a club this time.

485
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,640
Any club will do.

486
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,320
Let me just add on a bit more.

487
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,640
I wish there were good
people, funny people,

488
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,680
smart people, and cool people in
the club, just like that, Goddess.

489
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,160
And if I get what I asked for,

490
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,000
when I go home this time, I will
bring back ten crates of red water

491
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,880
and a silk outfit with flower
patterns to offer to you.

492
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,320
Sathu.

493
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,040
Hey, you're not asking?

494
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,280
Go ahead and ask!

495
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
What should I ask for?

496
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
For penguins to
live in the North Pole, huh?

497
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,080
No, that's too difficult.

498
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,240
Just ask for something you really
want, but make it realistic.

499
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,440
You don't need to say anything.

500
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,520
What you're asking
for isn't easy either.

501
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,400
Such a long list of things.

502
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,520
what am I supposed to do?

503
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,800
What are you looking at?

504
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,280
Don't you see?

505
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,680
Don’t try to scare me.

506
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,320
I'm not scared.

507
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,880
Why can't he see?

508
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,560
Only those who aren't humans

509
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,480
can see spirits.

510
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,880
How do you know I'm not human?

511
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,680
Lotto results on December 1st, 2024

512
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,200
0,9,0,9.

513
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,960
Oh! I am really a student here.

514
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,080
Birds!

515
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,560
You can't get in.

516
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,400
Your card is declined. Try another one.

517
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,240
Let me in, please.

518
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,600
Nah ah ah.

519
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,600
Well, you're not a student here.

520
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,040
What's all that noise?

521
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,120
It's really chaotic.

522
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,400
Thanks, grandma.

523
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,880
You may call me “sis.”

524
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,560
I’m Mina.
Call me “grandma” again and I’ll cry.

525
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,440
I'm sorry, sis,

526
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,360
but you look so young for
being a hundred years old!

527
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,560
I actually died at 25.

528
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,560
So how is it?

529
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,240
Is being a human fun?

530
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,320
But it seems like it's
not that much fun, I guess?

531
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,720
That’s what being human is like.

532
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,840
I think I kind of understand now.

533
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,080
Since

534
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,040
I've become a human now,

535
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,520
I want to live for myself.

536
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,080
Even if there’s no penguins in the North Pole.

537
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,080
I still want to go there.

538
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,160
I’m gonna see the North Pole no matter what.

539
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,960
The incense is almost gone,

540
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,760
so I'll disappear soon.

541
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,160
If you ever feel lonely,

542
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,400
feel free to light some
incense and I’ll appear.

543
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,760
That...

544
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,120
You need to use
a lighter to light

545
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,320
that stick, just
like you did before.

546
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,840
See you later!

547
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,800
Here.

548
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,400
Did I come off too blunt?

549
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,080
Here.

550
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,920
The teacher asked me
to lend this to you.

551
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,840
Oh!

552
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,000
What are the chances, we’re neighbors!

553
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
What is this?

554
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,080
The teacher asked me
to lend this to you for now.

555
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,640
Once you get your own,
just return it to me.

556
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,480
Is it a shirt?

557
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,680
You’re sort of a loner like me, are you?

558
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,960
Judging by the way you acted,
I’m probably right.

559
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,880
Well, you always
have that fierce look

560
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,520
and ignore others all the time.

561
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,600
With that attitude,
who’d dare to come close?

562
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,960
If you don't have friends,

563
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,200
you can be my friend!

564
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,920
No need to deny it.

565
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,640
I've seen you follow
me to every club.

566
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,560
Do you really want to
be my friend that much?

567
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,280
I'm not following you.
The school is just small.

568
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,760
Where else could I go?

569
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,960
Really?
Not following me, then, Sun?

570
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,160
Well.

571
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,720
I met you at every club I went to.

572
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,640
It's probably not that
much of a coincidence. Right?

573
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,600
No matter which club I go to,
I see you everywhere.

574
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,600
If you don't hide behind a pillar,
you hide in various corners.

575
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,440
Huh?

576
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,040
You followed me
secretly, didn't you?

577
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,200
If you ever change your mind,
just tell me.

578
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,320
How much longer
is he gonna make me talk by myself?

579
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,360
Do you have anything you want
to do but haven't done yet?

580
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,960
Which club do
you want to be in?

581
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,360
Swimming club, like you.

582
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,680
I’m most suited for this club.

583
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,920
Where are you going now?
Come on!

584
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,920
All day, you’re running away.

585
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,320
What the hell is your problem?

586
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,800
Junior is joining the swimming club.

587
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,600
What are you gonna do?

588
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,840
You called me here for this?

589
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,160
Why are you getting in my way

590
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,240
because of that damn guy?

591
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,920
You're not answering the question.

592
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,280
Do you think someone like Junior

593
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,880
would give up his spot,

594
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,880
the way you did for me?

595
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,000
He’s too stupid to get the situation.

596
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,200
I came up with a few ways.

597
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,120
Just wait and see tomorrow,

598
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,480
before the competition,

599
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,600
he’ll be so scared,
and quit the club himself.

600
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,440
You already know

601
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,040
the kind of person I am.

602
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,280
I’m not gonna let anyone
take my scholarship.

603
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,760
I've warned you already.

604
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,240
Don't mess with my people.

605
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,200
I’m never gonna leave him be.
