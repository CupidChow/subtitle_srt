1
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,720
Where the hell are they running to?

2
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,840
What the hell is wrong with them?

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,080
And who the hell are those two?

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,680
I have no idea.

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,320
Oh, then what do you know?

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,400
How would I know,
I’m right here with you.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,680
- Forget it, I have to go help.
- Calm down,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,360
don't be so reckless right now.

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,760
Calm down about what?

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,720
I have a better plan.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,520
What plan? Tell me.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,880
I haven't figured it out yet.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,880
If you want to help your friends,

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,960
you have to listen carefully.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,880
Because I don't know

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,640
how much longer
I can stay in this body.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,560
Hey, kids,

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,800
what are you doing here?
Why aren't you in bed?

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,680
How...

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,880
did I end up here?

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,920
Aunt,

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,960
please don't panic.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
You're possessed by a ghost.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Hey,

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,280
why are you telling her?

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,560
If she knows,
she won't let me possess her!

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,880
Are you the Goddess of the Mole?

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,560
I think we should get to the point.

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,320
To keep it short

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,000
before I get
kicked out of this body.

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,920
The two thieves
broke into the school.

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,200
They're part of an illegal
wildlife trafficking gang.

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,000
They're here to take Junior.

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,840
Wait, what's Junior
got to do with this?

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,600
He's not an animal!

36
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,960
Junior got involved somehow.

37
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,040
Huh?

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,840
Is Junior involved in
wildlife trafficking?

39
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,600
No,

40
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,560
he's the one who frees the animals

41
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,440
from the wildlife trafficking gangs.

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,280
Huh?

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,320
Is Junior a cop?

44
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
OMG, I'm going crazy!

45
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,360
Come on, Goddess,
explain the whole story clearly!

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,640
Here's the thing. Sun and Junior

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,720
are just regular
students like you guys.

48
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,000
They're just here to help, okay?

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,200
Wait, are you using
child labor, Goddess?

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,880
In that case, I'll report
you to the Ministry of Magic!

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,200
Give it a rest, will you?

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,760
If you can possess people,

53
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,640
why don't you just
possess those two?

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,600
Everyone has their weaknesses.

55
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,200
They may seem like pushovers,

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,920
but they're covered in
amulet tattoos.

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,520
And I'm not sure what
kind of protective magic they've got.

58
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,040
That's why I can't possess them.

59
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,960
So, this is how
I ended up like this.

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,400
It's like the server is going to crash.

61
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,000
Alright, then tomorrow
I'll go get a tattoo.

62
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,960
So, what do you want
us to help with, Goddess?

63
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,360
Jeng.

64
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
What did you just say?

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,360
Did I get possessed?

66
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,920
In the name of all those holy,

67
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,520
please help me!

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,560
Are we even going
to have a proper conversation?

69
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,600
There must be someone else
the Goddess can possess, right?

70
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,280
Being a person really sucks, doesn't it?

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,560
Hmm, wait a second.

72
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,440
What did you say just now?

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,320
'Being a person really sucks'?

74
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,000
Sun know that
I'm not a person?

75
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,080
Tell me, don't be quiet.

76
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,400
Hurry up.

77
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,400
I knew from the moment I saw you.

78
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,640
Do you remember

79
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,920
when you're about to jump into the
water, and I stopped you?

80
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,640
Then you took my headphones
and put them on without asking.

81
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,040
You're good with your memory, huh?

82
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,160
I instantly recognized

83
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,560
you were the penguin
who stood there staring at me.

84
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,240
Or do you know because you're like me?

85
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,480
If Sun were a penguin like me,
how did you lift....?

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,960
"...or are you just
a jacked penguin?

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,120
So, what were you before?

88
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,680
Hurry up, answer me!

89
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,000
Why do you want to be a person?

90
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,280
I was just hoping for something...

91
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,120
I just thought...

92
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
maybe I'd find something good,
like other people do.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,840
But it's not the way
you thought, right?

94
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,280
Yeah,

95
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,960
that's why I said
I was just out here hoping.

96
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,680
So, what were you before?

97
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,400
Answer me.

98
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,280
Ugh, where are you going again?
I'm asking what you used to be!

99
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,360
Why don't you focus
on finding a way out of here?

100
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,480
I don't want to stay
here another night.

101
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,640
Hey, I'm tired already.

102
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,920
Can we take a break?

103
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,080
I'm hungry now.

104
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,080
Shoot!

105
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,600
What the hell is this again?

106
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,440
Do you think...

107
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,800
... the penguin fly away?

108
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,440
Penguins can’t fly, you donkey.

109
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,840
Why are you complaining so much?

110
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
You can see that
we haven't found them yet.

111
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,560
Shit, right now?

112
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,400
What now?

113
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,040
Do you have a power bank?

114
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,200
Yeah, just a second.

115
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,200
What is it with you?

116
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
Because you're this dim,

117
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,400
that’s why your mum abandoned you.

118
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,240
Why does something so easy,
seem so difficult for you?

119
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,040
Wow, you're really
insulting my mom now?

120
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,120
Yeah, so what?

121
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,760
Fr, you’re the worst.

122
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,200
Are you five or something?
Talk like an adult.

123
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,360
With that attitude,
no wonder nobody can stand you.

124
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,080
You don't even have a wife.
You're a waste.

125
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
I don't need a wife,

126
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,680
I'm independent.
What the hell does it matter to you?

127
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,920
Wow, acting all tough, huh?

128
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,360
Calling me a kid.
Such a flex, huh?

129
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,160
Go on, leave.
We don’t need clowns like you.

130
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,640
I’d rather be friendless
than deal with you.

131
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,400
Okay, don't you cry for me.

132
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,840
Yeah, I'm not gonna cry.

133
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,800
I'd rather have no friends ... weirdo.

134
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,760
Did I tie the bow correctly?

135
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,360
What if I get caught?

136
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,040
Yesterday, did I tie the bow
on the left or the right?

137
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,520
Or did I not even tie it?

138
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,680
I don't know.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,720
My father taught me
not to trust people.

140
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,560
They are so complex
and unpredictable,

141
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,080
like vines that twist and turn.

142
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,400
It's tangled up with me now.

143
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,240
But it's not as crooked
as the heart of a person.

144
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,200
"Students!"

145
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,960
Is that too harsh?

146
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,440
"Students!"

147
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,560
A bit draggy.

148
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,720
"Students!"

149
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Okay. Good.

150
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,520
What's two plus two, students?

151
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,080
A bit too easy?

152
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,560
What about eight times five?

153
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,720
This one might be too hard.

154
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,320
Let's go find

155
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
a new problem then.

156
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,640
Because of you,

157
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,720
we don't know what's
going to happen to them.

158
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,400
Don't you have to consent if
someone is going to possess you?

159
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
If she possessed you

160
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
but you weren't willing,

161
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,600
would you be okay with that?

162
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,520
Yeah, once you graduate,
you should apply to

163
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,000
be the Minister for Magic!

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,480
Call me Dumbledore.

165
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,640
Here she comes, the Goddess!

166
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,960
What Goddess are
you guys talking about?

167
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,560
Why haven't you
two gone to class yet?

168
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,240
I never thought you'd be
like this, Thanachart.

169
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,560
Even though you're smart,

170
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,520
you still need to have
discipline, understand?

171
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,320
Yes mam.

172
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,760
Take your friend to class too.

173
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,200
Yes, let's go.

174
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,240
Let's go, go to class!

175
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,200
Are you tired?

176
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,720
Do you want to take a break?

177
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,600
Yes, boss,

178
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,640
don't worry.

179
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,840
I'll return it for sure...

180
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,000
Definitely this week...

181
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,040
yes...

182
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,480
yes sir, no problem...

183
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,880
No problem... except for your attitude.

184
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,400
You finally showed your face.

185
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,800
I knew it.

186
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,800
People like you can't make it.

187
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
I'll get back at you later.

188
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,240
Alright, let's find it already.

189
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,400
I'm too tired to argue with you.

190
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,040
Why didn't you just
take the money and run?

191
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,360
You'd get both the money

192
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,680
and a new life.

193
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,520
If I could have done it, I would
have done it a long time ago.

194
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,640
You don't have to
worry about your mom.

195
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,160
She's quicker than I am.

196
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,840
The debt collectors won't
be able to catch her.

197
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,720
I can't just leave my mom behind.

198
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,360
Oh, now you're playing the good guy?

199
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,200
The animals you
raised with your own hands,

200
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
you can still sell them
without a second thought.

201
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
You think I like it?

202
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
I have to eat, I have to survive.

203
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,120
Come eat, come on!

204
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,480
You're really bold, aren't you?

205
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,040
You're so small, yet you still
want to fight everyone.

206
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,040
With a size like that,

207
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
how about "Junior"?

208
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,920
Alright, then I'll call you
"Junior" from now on.

209
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,200
Being a penguin like you
doesn’t sound half bad —

210
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,000
eat, sleep,

211
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,040
and no worries to stress about.

212
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,520
So, what are you staring at me for?

213
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,800
You want something more, or what?

214
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,200
Nah, I'm fine.

215
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,680
Just a little stressed, that's all.

216
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,680
I just came back
from my dad's funeral.

217
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,280
Do you know that

218
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,680
when he was alive,
I hardly ever talked to him?

219
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,480
I hated how he
always made my mom sad.

220
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,000
Now, it's just my mom left.

221
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,080
Or maybe we might
have misunderstood him.

222
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,120
He might have been forced into it.

223
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,360
I'm not joking here.

224
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,520
Someone like Sont
wouldn't do this to me or Little.

225
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,880
He's trying to sell you guys.

226
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,240
You're fooling yourself,
you know that?

227
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,800
But I still want
to ask him to be sure.

228
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,880
I don't want to misunderstand Sont,
like I misunderstood you before.

229
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,960
If you were still in that cage, he
would have probably sold you by now.

230
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,360
After all this, do you still think
you're misunderstanding him?

231
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,640
But you don't know
him as well as I do.

232
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,960
But I know you.

233
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,520
I know you're a kind person,

234
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,280
you care about others.

235
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,720
But can you stop being so stubborn?

236
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,320
Just stop thinking about
meeting him already.

237
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,400
What right do you have to tell
me what I should or shouldn't do?

238
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,320
Well, you...

239
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,480
Well you...what?

240
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,840
Must be nice being you.

241
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,040
Do whatever you want

242
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,640
without overthinking.

243
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,840
Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
It's my life,

244
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,800
and I don't need you interfering

245
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,120
or telling me what to do.

246
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,120
If it falls apart or goes to hell,

247
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,880
that's my problem.

248
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,600
Fine.

249
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,520
If you want to do
whatever you want, go ahead.

250
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,120
It's your life, after all.

251
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,960
You never had me in
your life to begin with anyway.

252
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,400
(Baby, why did you leave me?)

253
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,440
So, can you finally tell me
where the way out is?

254
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,480
I can tell you,

255
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,640
but can I have that
banana over there?

256
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,800
Please be kind to a broken-hearted birdie.

257
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,560
No!

258
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,960
If you want it, go get it yourself.

259
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,800
Even if I gave it to you, you'd
still refuse to tell me anyway.

260
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,640
Ah, so you can see right
through me, huh?

261
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,400
Alright, then I'm off.

262
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,840
I'll stay right here.

263
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,720
(It's tough being a broken-hearted bird.)

264
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,000
Soft power of Thailand.

265
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,960
Why is this so hard?

266
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,920
I'm hungry.

267
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,800
Did you eat everything
in the bag already?

268
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,800
Yeah, it's all gone.

269
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,520
When I'm irritated,
I just eat everything.

270
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,800
Donkey!

271
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,040
You ate it all and you're still
complaining about being hungry?

272
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,800
Well, I'm just hungry!

273
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,640
Let me go I’m tired.

274
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,200
Stay still.

275
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,200
What are you going to do?

276
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,920
You stay still.

277
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,920
Why are you keeping this?

278
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,120
You said you'd stop bothering me.

279
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,240
Hey, what the hell is this?

280
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,600
Not only are you not helping,
but you are also a burden.

281
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,320
When will someone like
you stop acting like this...

282
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,240
Hold on, hold on.

283
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,040
I'm begging you. Can you stop
yelling at me for just a second?

284
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,680
What the heck! What a waste of time.

285
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,640
What the heck!

286
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,840
they really took our penguin.

287
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,160
What the frick!

288
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,240
How the hell did they
know about the tag?

289
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,800
I think they're
around here somewhere.

290
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,920
Let's split up and cover more ground.

291
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,760
No way,

292
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,040
there might be ghost.

293
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,800
It's almost dark too.

294
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,280
You don't need to
get a protective tattoos.

295
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,840
An anti-moron tattoo
might be a better idea.

296
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,520
Hey, where are you going?

297
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,760
Wait for me!

298
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,760
Can penguin really feel cold?

299
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,240
Sun...

300
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,800
Sun...

301
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,320
Sun...

302
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,120
You want to eat me, don't you?

303
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,800
Come on then.

304
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,280
Go ahead, take a bite...

305
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,520
I won't mind.

306
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,480
What the hell is wrong with me.

307
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,800
Dig in.

308
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,760
Where are you going?

309
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,080
The fire's about to die out.

310
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,520
I'm going to get more wood.

311
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,960
You stay here.

312
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,320
I'm still not over
being angry at you.

313
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,720
But today,

314
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,720
when I thought I was going to die...

315
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,760
I won't be angry at you anymore.

316
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
You're just sick with a fever,
don't overdo it.

317
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,720
Hey, what are you doing?

318
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,120
What’s wrong?

319
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,200
Is it hot?

320
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,760
I'm really hot.

321
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,480
So, are you hot or cold, exactly?

322
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,200
Well... both.

323
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,200
But it's cold, right?

324
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,840
Hold on,

325
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,800
I'll go get more wood.

326
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,240
Can you wait a sec?

327
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,560
Then you can go.

328
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,680
Sit with me for a sec.

329
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,320
Do you know,

330
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400
when I was in the cage,

331
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,440
I used to like watching people.

332
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,040
Tourists, through the glass.

333
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,440
Once they walked past,

334
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,920
I always thought that

335
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,120
they must be able to
do whatever they wanted.

336
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,840
But when I got out,

337
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,120
I realized that it
might not be like that.

338
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,840
Actually, those
people might be sad,

339
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,360
they might be crying,

340
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,560
they might be upset,

341
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,160
or they could be arguing,

342
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,920
just like we are right now.

343
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,520
But honestly,
I still want to be here,

344
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,560
no matter what,
even if it ends up like this.

345
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,320
I don't want to
go back in there,

346
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,000
just thinking about
what I want to do,

347
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,680
but never actually doing it.

348
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
If I really die,

349
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,120
even if I don't get to
go to the North Pole,

350
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,720
I'm glad I got to meet you.

351
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,320
You talk like
you're going somewhere.

352
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,560
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

353
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,080
You don't really know my life.

354
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,120
So, how long have you been human?

355
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,320
Is there anything you want to do?

356
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,080
You know,

357
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,640
since the thing with Nam happened,

358
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,240
I decided I wouldn't
be friends with anyone again.

359
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,280
But then I met you.

360
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,400
You're the first
real friend I've ever had.

361
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,760
Do you know that?

362
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,400
What about Jodd and Jeng?

363
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,840
They're the second
and third, of course.

364
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,000
And what about you?

365
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,360
What do you want to do?

366
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,360
It would probably be great to
try doing a lot of things with you.

367
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,840
Can I have some water, please?

368
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,840
Water please?

369
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,560
Just take him, he looks so weak.

370
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,880
Hey,

371
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,880
where are you from?

372
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,680
Are you okay?

373
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,840
- Hey!
- Hey.

374
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,800
Who are you guys?

375
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,240
What are you doing
messing with my friends?

376
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,800
We’re just finding new
place to fresc...

377
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,640
for fresh air,

378
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,080
and then we found your friend
lying there all curled up like this.

379
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,040
Are you thirsty?

380
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,560
Do you guys want to
come to my house?

381
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,840
It's okay,
just drop us off in the city.

382
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,040
I don't know if you guys are going
to try to kill us or something.

383
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,480
Have you been
watching too many dramas?

384
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,320
Going to the hospital in
the city takes a few hours.

385
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,320
What starts as just a little fever
could turn into something serious.

386
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,280
But it's up to you.

387
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,000
Here's the thing.

388
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,800
Wait for him to get better first,

389
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,320
then we can drop you off.

390
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
My boyfriend looks tough,

391
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,480
but there's no way he'd kill anyone.

392
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,800
Make yourself at home. You can
take your friend to the couch first.

393
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,200
I'll go grab the first aid kit.

394
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:13,960
Okay.

395
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,000
How's it going?
Are you feeling any better?

396
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,040
Let me take your
temperature for a moment.

397
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,120
You still have a fever.

398
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,600
Junior, do you have
a headache or a runny nose?

399
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,240
He might just have a slight fever.

400
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,760
A fever?

401
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,800
Here.

402
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,680
It's probably because
the weather changed,

403
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,160
and he must be tired. You've been
out in the sun all day, right?

404
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,760
Alright, let's eat, and then
take the medicine again.

405
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,360
For now, let him rest.

406
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,240
By the way, have you
eaten anything yet?

407
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,880
Not yet.

408
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,120
So, where do you live?

409
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,360
Should I drop you off?

410
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,720
I've already told my dad.

411
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,680
He'll come pick me up tomorrow.

412
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,320
Tonight, I hope it's okay to
trouble you guys for the night.

413
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,080
Sure, no problem at all.

414
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,000
In that case, we'll go get

415
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,440
something for you to eat first.

416
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,520
Shall we?

417
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,520
Just take care of him for now.

418
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,920
Let's go.

419
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,880
Do you still have a headache?

420
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,640
If you have a runny nose
and a sore throat,

421
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,200
I think it's better
to go to the hospital.

422
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,040
Take it easy.

423
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,200
Are you worried about me?

424
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,320
Do you want more water?

425
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,720
I don't want water.

426
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,600
I want love.

427
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,760
Yup, you’re better now.

428
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,240
Oh no, why can't I find my glasses?

429
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,480
Have you seen my glasses?

430
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,440
Well, where did you put them?

431
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,840
Try looking for them.

432
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,600
Oh no, no matter how much I look,
I can't find them!

433
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,840
Where did I put them?

434
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,360
Then you'll go open the drawer,

435
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,640
and then the cupboard
with the plates.

436
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,240
Who would put glasses in there?

437
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,360
If you know where it is,

438
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,240
just tell me so I don't
waste time looking for it.

439
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,400
Over there.

440
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,280
Oh!

441
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,880
More accurate
than a fortune teller.

442
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,320
Oh no, it's in the fridge.

443
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,720
How did I forget I put it in here?

444
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,160
Have you washed the vegetables?

445
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,160
Alright, I'll do it.

446
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,920
The water's leaking again.

447
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,280
Do we have to fix it again?

448
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,160
Ugh, no matter how many times
we fix it, it never gets any better.

449
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,560
Let's call a technician to fix it.

450
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,240
It's going to be
expensive, you know.

451
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,640
Do you know why it's still leaking?

452
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
It's because you're

453
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,880
so stingy!

454
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,200
How stingy are you going to be?

455
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,320
Here, wash this too.

456
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,480
Seriously, can you buy something
that's fresh for once?

457
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,440
You only buy discounted stuff
that's about to expire.

458
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,040
You always buy stuff like this.

459
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,720
It's still good,

460
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,240
it's not expired yet.
It's still fine to eat.

461
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,760
But if you buy fresh stuff,
it would taste better, wouldn't it?

462
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,840
Here, try it.

463
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,320
Is it okay to eat?

464
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,760
Wow, it's delicious!

465
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,240
What was P’ Ton doing on P’ Nut's cheek?

466
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,200
Normally, I only see you
eating fermented fish,

467
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,360
But today, you're all
about that luxe meal!

468
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,880
Well, since there are guests today,

469
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,960
I'm just being a little fancy.

470
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,720
And what if I told you that I'm
trying to save money to have a baby?

471
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,880
What does that mean?

472
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,400
It means having a baby.

473
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,040
Alright then,

474
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,000
but you didn't say
that from the start!

475
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,480
Oh crap, we're screwed!

476
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,200
- Turn off!
- Turn off what?

477
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,040
Turn off the water valve!

478
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,640
Hey,

479
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,960
I think I forgot something.

480
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,760
What did you forget?

481
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,240
Gigi.

482
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,640
Think! Where did you put it?

483
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,600
Prob, somewhere near the stream.

484
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,440
It’s nothing valuable...

485
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,440
but I can't buy it anymore.

486
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,280
Can you go find it for me, please?

487
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,960
Alright, I'll go check for you.

488
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,400
Make sure you find it!

489
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,440
Take care of the kids too!

490
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,640
Hey, boys, do you want to
change your clothes first?

491
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,280
Wanna chill on the bed?

492
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,920
I'm sorry for

493
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,760
what I said to you back then.

494
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,040
I'm sorry too

495
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,760
for leaving you alone like that.

496
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,800
From now on, if there's anything,

497
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,640
you can just speak to me directly.

498
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,960
Or should we cook together first?

499
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,360
No need.

500
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,600
If I have something to say,

501
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,000
I'll speak directly.

502
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,200
Do we really
have to do this?

503
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,120
Well, it keeps scratching tourists.

504
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,760
If we don’t handle this,

505
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,520
how are we gonna make money?

506
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,160
Will you pay for their medical bills?

507
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,200
Can’t risk leaving the nails on anymore.

508
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,960
You shouldn't have scratched him.

509
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,840
Hold him tight.

510
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,800
Sun stay still.

511
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,200
Black Panther.

512
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,320
Do you know them?

513
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,440
Come closer,

514
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,680
I have something to show you.

515
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,800
What are you gonna do?

516
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,600
Are you pulling a
prank or something?

517
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,920
Look into my eyes.

518
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,080
Do you see anything?

519
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,400
Are you scared?

520
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,080
Nope.

521
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,600
I used to live in that cage.

522
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,720
Do you have a Sont like me?

523
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,760
I don't really like
talking about them,

524
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,640
but it was because of them

525
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,760
that I wanted to be human.

526
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,960
It's okay.

527
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,240
Whenever you're ready to
talk about it, you can tell me.

528
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,880
Have you ever thought

529
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,040
what it would be
like if we had parents?

530
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,560
Would they hug us?

531
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,240
Would they'd praise us
if we did something good?

532
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,080
But it would
probably feel a bit awkward

533
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,560
if they did that, right?

534
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,440
It's impossible anyway.

535
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,840
We're not even human.

536
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,960
So you don't want to go back
to being a black panther, do you?

537
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,000
But even if you wanted to go back,

538
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,480
I still wouldn't let you.

539
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,000
I don't want to,

540
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,080
but I've heard that

541
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,960
some of them, when
they go back to the cage,

542
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,040
end up being the
way they were before.

543
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,760
Do panthers like it when they do this?

544
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,480
I read about it in a book once.

545
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,280
My love, I'm back.

546
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,400
Please, come in.

547
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,080
This is P’ Sont and

548
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,480
this is P’ Korn.
