1
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,560
What are you doing?

2
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,680
You know,

3
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,760
if you wrestle my boyfriend,

4
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,000
you'd probably get bored of me.

5
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,320
Cuz we'd always stick together.

6
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,960
You wouldn't like that,
would you?

7
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,280
No.

8
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,800
Sorry for making you feel
uncomfortable.

9
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
Being friends is good enough, yeah?

10
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,360
What are you doing?

11
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,960
Close your eyes.

12
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,160
Why?

13
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,240
Or I'm taking my clothes off.

14
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,160
You can't do that here.

15
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,960
Are you crazy?

16
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,160
Then close your eyes.

17
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,160
Get up slowly.

18
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,720
Turn here.

19
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,800
The skinship is on another level.

20
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,400
Why wait?

21
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,000
Be boyfriends now!

22
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,200
Happy Birthday to you!

23
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,600
What are you doing?

24
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,040
There weren't any candles,
So I used incense.

25
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Happy Birthday~ Happy Birthday.

26
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,320
Happy Birthday to you.

27
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,800
What are you looking at?

28
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,200
The Mole Goddess?

29
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,520
Whatever I say,
the Goddess can't respond, right?

30
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,480
Grandma, when was your birthday?

31
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,200
I'll make merit for
you on your birthday.

32
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,920
But it must have
been hundreds of years ago.

33
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,320
I wonder if grandma will remember.

34
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,960
Tonight, you're in for it, Jodd!

35
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,360
I'm not scared!

36
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,560
Who'd be sca...

37
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,160
be scared?

38
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,200
Hey Sun, aren't you excited?

39
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
We've been preparing
this surprise for a long time!

40
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,000
I never knew today was my birthday.

41
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,680
Huh? If you didn't know,

42
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,720
how could Junior know?

43
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,440
Is it March 21st?

44
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,360
That's in two weeks!

45
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,600
I mean, I forgot.

46
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,240
Make a wish, hurry up!

47
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,400
You didn't have to do all this,

48
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,600
I don't even like birthdays.

49
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,240
No?

50
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,720
You're smiling so big though!

51
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,520
But we need

52
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,320
a candle for you to make a wish.

53
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,880
Have you asked for...

54
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,960
permission
from the Goddess?

55
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
I'm telling you, the Goddess
wouldn't do anything to me!

56
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,880
Make a wish!

57
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,080
Come on!

58
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,200
Hey,

59
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,360
why are you making a wish, Ju?

60
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,440
It's the birthday boy
who needs to make the wish!

61
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,800
It wasn't my wish I made.

62
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,960
I wished for Sun's wish
to come true.

63
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,000
Jeng can be such a yapper!

64
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,080
Hey, don't bully Nerd Boy.

65
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,320
Who told you to protect me?

66
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,560
Okay.

67
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,640
Hey, I haven't eaten that!

68
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,400
Hey,

69
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,680
Stop it, that's my cake!

70
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,240
You, Jeng!

71
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,600
Hey!

72
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,680
Jeng, stop!

73
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,640
Hey!

74
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,080
Got cha!

75
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,320
Whoops, sorry!

76
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,280
Jodd, Jeng, your parents
are here to pick you up!

77
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,880
Okay, Ms.

78
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,120
My boys.

79
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,440
I'll see you again next semester!

80
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,040
Why are you crying?

81
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,200
I've never had friends before.

82
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,480
It's okay, Jodd.
We'll meet again soon.

83
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,280
Ever heard of WeChat?

84
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,480
Hey, Sun.

85
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,240
Take Junior to
the temple fair I talked about.

86
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,120
He wants to go.

87
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,320
See you next semester, guys.

88
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
I'm glad to
have you as friends.

89
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,960
Also, the two of you should be
more than friends.

90
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,720
Bye-bye, my friends!

91
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,720
Bye-bye.

92
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,400
You don't have to miss me!

93
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,520
I love you, boys!

94
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,920
I'm going back to the dorm.

95
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,720
I'll see off the two of them.

96
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,880
Here you are.

97
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,920
Why didn't you go back to the dorm?

98
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,080
I've been waiting for you.

99
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,240
Wanna go on a date?

100
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,400
Date?

101
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,560
Let's go on a date

102
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,680
at the temple fair.

103
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
You wanted to go, right?

104
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,480
Thing is,

105
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,640
if we're gonna be together,

106
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,280
we should go on a date first.

107
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,320
Thought you'd never ask.

108
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,560
=Caged Again=

109
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,320
I'm a penguin,

110
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,640
so I can't fly.

111
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,960
I didn't ask you to fly,

112
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm asking you to climb.

113
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,440
How am I supposed to do that?

114
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,680
That's easy, I've done it before.

115
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,760
Show me, then.

116
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,040
Hurry up, show me!

117
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,240
I'm waiting to see.

118
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,920
Sun!

119
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,480
Sun, get over here.

120
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,880
Sun!

121
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,120
What are you boys up to?

122
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,320
Gee, how did I end up here?

123
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,560
Gee, do tell me.

124
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,240
Please, Mr, can we just

125
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,600
go out for a little walk? Please.

126
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Yeah, that's cute.

127
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,320
No!

128
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,120
Go.

129
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,960
Go back inside.

130
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,280
Just for a bit? Please, Mr.?

131
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,400
No.

132
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,640
I'm going on a date with
my boyfriend. Please, I'm begging you.

133
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,560
No,

134
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,040
go that way, now!

135
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,400
Just go!

136
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
It's the disrespect for me.

137
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,200
How were they gonna climb?

138
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,240
You invited me on a date.
How can I miss this opportunity?

139
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,800
- What are you doing?
- Hush. Trying to think.

140
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
What's your plan?

141
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,920
Why is he still here?

142
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,440
Aha,

143
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,480
I know you're still around here.

144
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,240
You..

145
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,480
will never escape
my gays!

146
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,600
He's gone.

147
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,640
Come on, follow me! Hurry up!

148
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,520
Hurry up, but quietly!

149
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,760
Move out of the way!

150
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,960
It has to be opened here.

151
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,400
You don't have the strength,
move aside!

152
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,360
Sun!

153
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,600
Sun!

154
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,080
Put away your claws.

155
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,360
Am I a good penguin or what?

156
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,280
Yesss!

157
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,600
Let's go to the temple fair!

158
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,400
When are we getting
to the temple fair?

159
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,760
I'm tired already!

160
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,000
Honestly...

161
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,400
I don't know either.

162
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,840
Come on!

163
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,600
We'll get there eventually.

164
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,040
This still counts as a date.

165
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,640
What are you looking at?

166
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,800
A car is speeding towards us.

167
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,200
Let me ask for directions.

168
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,040
I don't see anything.

169
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,800
My hearing is really good.

170
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,960
Even when you snore, I can hear it!

171
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,720
Holding my hand
made you lost focus!

172
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,320
Huh...

173
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,640
Then let's keep walking.

174
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,360
We might find a house,
and then we can ask for directions.

175
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
You sure?

176
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,800
You might lose focus again.

177
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,280
But I wanna hold your hand.

178
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,480
If you wanna,
then go ahead.

179
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,760
Hold my hand tight.

180
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,280
I'm tired already.

181
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,240
Are you okay?

182
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,440
Can we take a break for a bit?

183
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,520
Why are you jiggling?

184
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,080
My legs hurt.

185
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,240
Where?

186
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,880
What are you doing?

187
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,240
I'm massaging you.

188
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,920
You're like a cat

189
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,280
kneading dough.

190
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,480
Why don't you meow

191
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,440
like a good kitty?

192
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,960
Maybe later.

193
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,720
Is the pain gone?

194
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,400
Noooooo ) :

195
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,320
It hurts here..

196
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,000
Here?

197
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,000
And here.

198
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,320
And here?

199
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,280
And here too.

200
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
Here again?

201
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,440
Right here, here, here and here.

202
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,520
Ouch,

203
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,080
what are you doing?

204
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,760
Sorry!

205
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,680
Does it hurt a lot?

206
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,800
Sun, you can leave
me here if you want.

207
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,080
I'm just too tired to go on.

208
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,200
How could I leave you?

209
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
Come on, I'll walk with you.

210
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,160
I can't even walk,

211
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,080
I'm not buff like a black panther.

212
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,680
That's silly.

213
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,760
You're a person now.

214
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,320
You should be able
to walk well by now. Come on.

215
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,520
Sure I'm not
as strong as a panther,

216
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,520
but I'm definitely sharper than one.

217
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,720
This is obviously the moment you
give me a piggyback ride.

218
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,440
Is it okay?

219
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,680
This feels like

220
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,360
I'm forcing you.

221
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
You wanna get on or no?

222
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,160
Hmm,

223
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,040
you want me to or no?

224
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,840
Fine, let's go!

225
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Okay, then.

226
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,600
You're so heavy!

227
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,360
Wow! You're really heavy!

228
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,680
I'm not. Stop complaining!

229
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,880
<3 <3 <3

230
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,160
Sure, you're not.

231
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,240
- Sun.
- Yes?

232
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,960
What is the event like?

233
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,520
There's live music,

234
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,520
colorful lights,

235
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,360
and a lot of people.

236
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,440
I guess.

237
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,240
Sounds fun!

238
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,920
We'll be the stars
of the fair for sure.

239
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,000
Take it easy.

240
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,640
It's only our first time.

241
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,200
That's great,

242
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,440
I'm happy to have you with me.

243
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,600
I've always been with you anyway.

244
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,040
That's not true.

245
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,160
If I hadn't approached you,

246
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,200
we probably wouldn't
be together like this.

247
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,080
Have you ever

248
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,800
gone anywhere besides school?

249
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,800
Well, it was when
we went to the zoo.

250
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,880
Back then you were a chubby penguin.

251
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,880
Who's chubby?

252
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,120
Who you calling chubby?

253
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,880
If you can wriggle like that,

254
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,040
then you can walk on your own.

255
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,480
Hey, what's wrong?

256
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,760
What's wrong?

257
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,280
Fine, I won't hold your hand then.

258
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,120
Wait up!

259
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,920
Didn't I tell you

260
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,440
to catch them all?

261
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,040
You know, your brain is there
to filter your thoughts.

262
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,560
Oh, you smart guy,

263
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,440
you smart, so smart.

264
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,120
So smart that
we have to be handcuffed?

265
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,880
Shut your mouth.

266
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,720
Acting tough now?

267
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,000
- Hey, stop!
- You want it, right?

268
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,200
- Oh, what are you going to do?
- Why?

269
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,360
- Oh, what are you going to do?
- Why? Why?

270
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
- What the hell is this?
- Why?!

271
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
So smart, aren't you?

272
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,600
Hey, stop!

273
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,320
Who's the smart one now?

274
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,600
Not you.

275
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,360
He could die.

276
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,640
He's dead!

277
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,880
Babe, are you done sulking?

278
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,560
I'm sorry...

279
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,240
My stomach hurts.

280
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,520
Ouch!

281
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,520
Help me!

282
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,200
You think I'm that dumb?

283
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,520
Are you really upset?
Here, we're holding hands now.

284
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,400
We're holding hands.

285
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,320
Hey,

286
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,440
you said your legs hurt, right?

287
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,280
Hey, where are you taking my bike?

288
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
Hey, come here quickly!

289
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,840
Get up here, quickly!

290
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,240
Sorry, bro!! My boyfriend and I are
going to the temple fair.

291
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,000
You're gonna fall off.

292
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,840
You're so stern.

293
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,520
You could just speak nicely.

294
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,760
I'm just worried,
you'll fall.

295
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,080
Are you sulking again?

296
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,040
Yes.

297
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,000
Let's make up.

298
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,160
Nah, changed my mind.

299
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,560
You can be upset with me now,

300
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,560
but if we get to the temple fair,
we'll make up.

301
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,120
Let's hurry and go.

302
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,400
Ride carefully.

303
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,120
Sun.

304
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,000
This is it, the temple fair.

305
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,800
Hello!

306
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,840
Can I get a shoutout
from those who've

307
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,560
escaped from their
wives to hang out?

308
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,680
Go, go.

309
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,520
Hello, daddy.

310
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,560
Did you come alone?

311
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,200
I came alone. I came to see you.

312
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,240
Is this the temple fair?

313
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,840
But isn't the fair
supposed to be at the temple?

314
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,960
How about this table?

315
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,840
Hurry, dance!

316
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,320
But it's okay,
this place looks fun too.

317
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
Come dance with me, Sun.

318
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,600
Still came alone,
as usual, right, baby?

319
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,600
Drink it all up!

320
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,840
Wow!

321
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,720
Handsome, I don't think
I've seen your face before.

322
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,920
Do you live around here?

323
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,080
Sing a song for me, please.

324
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,880
I'd better not.

325
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,800
Wow, even your
voice sounds handsome!

326
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,520
My instincts never miss,

327
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,120
come on, sing quickly!

328
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,960
Are you embarrassed?

329
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,040
You sing, and I'll dance.

330
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,320
That way, both of us will
be embarrassed!

331
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,200
Come on.

332
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,480
Alright then,

333
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,520
come on.

334
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:41,040
- Sing now, sing!
- Sing now, sing!

335
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,720
The temple fair isn't fun at all.

336
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,360
Temple fair?
What temple fair?

337
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,680
Alright, place your bets!

338
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,480
This temple fair is way
more fun than before!

339
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,000
You said you knew it,

340
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,720
but you've never been there either.

341
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,760
Place your bets, quick!

342
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,040
Hurry up,

343
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,360
Open!

344
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,560
Hey, I won!

345
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,360
Place your bets.

346
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,840
Where did this kid come from?

347
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,400
As soon as they get here,
they start winning!

348
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,680
It's just a fluke.

349
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,120
Come on, let's go again!

350
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,480
You've won a lot already!
Place your bets now!

351
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,400
Hey, kiddos, go home already!

352
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,040
No way, I want my money!

353
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,160
No one gets any money here.

354
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,640
What are you saying?

355
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,200
We're just playing for show.

356
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,440
To get chips and
exchange them for a water bottle.

357
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,880
No money involved at all!

358
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,240
You can exchange yours
for a water bottle too!

359
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,520
Alright, let's keep playing!

360
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,400
I told you,

361
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,080
the fair should be at the temple!

362
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,240
We're at the temple now!

363
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,360
Or did we come on the wrong day?

364
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,120
I don't think so.

365
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,400
Can you smell the incense?

366
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,000
Hiya!

367
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,920
Big sis here is so lonely,
she's looking for some coc-

368
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,800
I mean, she's looking for some

369
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,480
company!

370
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,880
You heading to the fair?

371
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,680
Just a little further
and you'll get there.

372
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,320
Talking about this

373
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,280
reminds me of the old days

374
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,560
when I used to be all lovey-dovey
with my man.

375
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,040
Then, an evil wench

376
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,320
got in the way of my love.

377
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Just talking about it hurts.

378
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,000
So where did you two come from?

379
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,720
I'm scared, Sun.

380
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,760
Drop the act,

381
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,520
girl!

382
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,640
Where ya from?
Tell me!

383
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,840
We're from the boarding
school around here.

384
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,600
A boarding school?

385
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,000
Is it Phana Phana something?

386
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,520
Yes, sis.

387
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,640
If you can see me,

388
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,320
then you've
probably seen that girl,

389
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,040
the short-haired
ghost with the mole.

390
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Have you seen her?

391
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,680
You mean Sis Mina?

392
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,600
That's the one!

393
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,520
That's the one!

394
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,000
You wanna know,

395
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,280
some juicy gossip about her?

396
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,560
You're probably wondering

397
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,480
why birds love to poop
on Mina's shrine, right?

398
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,640
DISCLAIMER: This has nothing

399
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,840
to do with me and Mina,

400
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,600
got it?

401
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,800
Right, listen carefully

402
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,040
because I'm only
going to say this once.

403
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,000
Here's the tea.

404
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,840
After Mina died,

405
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,840
rumors started
spreading that she was

406
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,800
the secret mistress
of Lord Phan Det.

407
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,880
When the truth came out,

408
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,880
we held a grand
ritual to curse her,

409
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,720
complete with
burning chili and salt—

410
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,840
a full-on, intense curse ceremony.

411
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,240
We were so angry

412
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,480
we couldn't think straight.

413
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,800
During the ritual,

414
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,080
a bunch of birds came and

415
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,880
pooped all over
the ceremony, ruining it.

416
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,280
So, the wife cursed Mina,

417
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,600
So her life would always

418
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,000
be plagued by bird droppings.

419
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,520
Whether as a spirit
or if she reincarnates

420
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,040
as a human.

421
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,360
So,

422
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,800
if she's born again,

423
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,480
her life's forever gonna be full of

424
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,240
shit.

425
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,680
But honestly,

426
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,360
I do feel sorry for her.

427
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,920
Why is it that these f-boys
never got cursed?

428
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,960
We live and die in a patriarchy.

429
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,400
DISCLAIMER: this isn't a story
between me and Mina,

430
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,360
got it?

431
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,800
Is it a story between me and Mina?

432
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,240
It's not.

433
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,960
The incense is about to burn out.

434
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,360
See you all later!

435
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,840
I had so much fun
gossiping with you today.

436
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,560
It brings back memories
of the good old days.

437
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,920
Take care, bye!

438
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,160
I feel really sorry
for Sis Mina, though.

439
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,200
I'm scared.

440
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,640
It's okay, the ghost is gone now.

441
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,760
Why are you
sneaking in to kiss me?

442
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,520
Just ask nicely,
and I'll give it to you.

443
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,400
You really like being
a ghost, don't you?

444
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,720
Look at you, a cheeky ghost!

445
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,640
You're being too mean.

446
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,240
I was just teasing a little!

447
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,880
You're the cheeky ghost!

448
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,280
Hey, where are you going?
Wait for me!

449
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,000
It's the temple fair
Jodd was talking about!

450
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,800
Let's go.

451
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,480
How much is it?

452
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,480
Fifty baht.

453
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,280
So cute.

454
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,520
This one is even cuter!

455
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,680
I really don't want to eat it.

456
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,560
But I want to!

457
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,560
Black panther is
tasty, you know!

458
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,320
You're all mine!

459
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,880
Are you hungry?

460
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,280
Not really.

461
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,720
Do I look like I'm hungry?

462
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,720
Uncle, can I have one more?

463
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,200
Here you go!

464
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,400
20 baht.

465
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,440
How do you play?

466
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,960
I don't know.

467
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,800
I couldn't catch them!

468
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,640
Do you want mine?

469
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,200
This paper is like my heart,

470
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,280
don't you think?

471
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,520
Why?

472
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,840
Just a little push and it breaks,

473
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,120
just like how I felt when I tried
getting closer to you before,

474
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,240
always getting rejected.

475
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,760
So, I'm like the water
in this box then.

476
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,280
Why?

477
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,560
Look into the water.

478
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,520
Do you see anything?

479
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,520
I see fish.

480
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,600
Take a closer look.

481
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
Do you see your own reflection?

482
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,920
That's it.

483
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
I'll always be watching you

484
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,560
When your paper is broken.

485
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,680
What am I gonna do
if in the next life.

486
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,480
I'm reborn as a fish?

487
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,360
What now?

488
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,120
I'm a penguin.

489
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,560
I've eaten a lot of fish.

490
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,720
If in the next life,
I'm born as a fish,

491
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,760
then I'll be a fish with karma.

492
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,920
I might end up being sold
in this box, huh?

493
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,800
Look at their faces.

494
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,480
They probably want to
get out so badly.

495
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,920
They might actually like
being here, you know.

496
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,000
But if I were a fish in this box,

497
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,120
I'd probably still want to escape.

498
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,400
You have to help them!

499
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,240
Look at this guy,

500
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,760
He's gonna die,
gasping for the last breath like that.

501
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,440
That fish looks just like me!

502
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,160
That one too.

503
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,200
And that one too.

504
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,920
All the fish look just like me.

505
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,280
You need to help get them out.

506
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,240
Umm, okay.

507
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,000
Can I have another
fish scoop, please?

508
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,480
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

509
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,520
Let go! Let go!

510
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,400
Idiot in love!

511
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,160
This is so you...

512
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,160
Why? What's wrong with me?

513
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,520
So cute.

514
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,440
Is there anything
else you want to do?

515
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,400
Let's do everything together!

516
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,800
Hey, I want to blow
smoke like those people.

517
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,400
I'm human too,

518
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,680
why isn't there smoke
coming out of my mouth?

519
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,400
No, don't do that. It's not good.

520
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,880
Why?

521
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,720
I've seen Nam do it before.

522
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,640
I want to try.

523
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,120
Sun, I want to play that thing!

524
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,600
Are you scared?

525
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,160
No,

526
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm not scared. Who's scared?

527
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,240
Why won't you be direct
and admit you're scared?

528
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,880
Look at me.

529
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,440
Why won't you be direct
and admit you're scared to me?

530
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,720
No, I'm not scared,

531
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,240
I'm just not used to it.

532
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,200
This is called being scared.

533
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,680
Fine, let's walk away then.

534
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,200
Hello everyone,

535
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,720
this is Namphueng Kallaya,

536
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,400
the new Mor Lam singer.

537
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,120
Come have a blast tonight!

538
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,080
Dance till our hips break!

539
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,720
This singer

540
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,440
looks familiar.

541
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,920
Do you know her?

542
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,480
I know her!

543
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,400
I remember her well.

544
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,280
Come on, Sun! Let's dance!

545
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,680
No.

546
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,320
Come on, let's dance! Hurry up!

547
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,600
I don't want to.

548
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,760
Come on, let's dance! Please!

549
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,240
No.

550
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,440
Come on, let's dance!

551
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,240
I already said no!

552
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,840
No.

553
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,840
Are you done being grumpy?

554
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,160
I'm dancing!

555
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,760
I'm not sulking!

556
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,720
You always tell others to be direct,

557
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,720
but when it comes to yourself,
you're not direct either.

558
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,760
Okay, I'll be direct.

559
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,800
I just want you to have fun with me.

560
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,760
If there's something
you don't like doing,

561
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,120
you don't have to do it just for me.

562
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,720
Like with the firecrackers earlier,

563
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,160
if you didn't like it,

564
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,720
you should have
just told me you didn't like it.

565
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,520
I didn't like it,
but I still wanted to try.

566
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,400
If I got to do it with you,

567
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,640
maybe it would turn out to be good.

568
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,680
Let's do many things together.

569
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,120
From now on, I'm not gonna be scared.

570
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,160
So, do you want a friend?

571
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,120
No.

572
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,400
I saw you staring
at me, so I thought

573
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,480
something was up.

574
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,600
I can do it alone.

575
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,640
Hey, where are you going now?

576
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,440
I know you're a kind

577
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,880
and considerate person,

578
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,560
but can you stop being like this?

579
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,760
Don't worry,

580
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,640
I'll never hurt you.

581
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,640
Happy Birthday to you.
