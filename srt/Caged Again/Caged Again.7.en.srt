1
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,720
You named me Junior.

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,560
Because I'm the smallest.

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,920
What the heck are you talking about?

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,360
What the heck are you talking about?

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,400
Don't move, you scumbag!

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,480
Stop your nonsense.

7
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,000
This is bad!

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,960
What should we do?

9
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,040
Hey! Stop right there!

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Stop right there!

11
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,200
May I know your name?

12
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,640
Are you the one who
called the police?

13
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,680
How did you know that

14
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,800
the criminals were trafficking animals?

15
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,120
Why the penguin mascot?

16
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,880
- Could you clarify?
- Please answer the questions.

17
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,800
I'm the one who

18
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,960
tipped off the police.

19
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,080
But I ask for one thing

20
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
please stop calling me a hero.

21
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,960
How have you been?

22
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,960
Why are you here, brother?

23
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,040
What will you do
after this is all over?

24
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,280
I guess I'll go back
to living with Little.

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,400
I don't know.

26
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,760
You said it might be possible

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,920
that we'll go back
to being animals again.

28
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Nothing to worry about now

29
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,640
=Caged Again=

30
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,520
Does it still hurt?

31
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,840
Leave,
I'm gonna take a shower.

32
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,040
Let's shower together.

33
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,400
Are you shy?

34
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,640
I'm not.

35
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,520
Hope you feel better soon.

36
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,480
They've been caught.

37
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,040
When will you go back?

38
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,680
Alright, I'll take
a shower first then.

39
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,120
Please, stop calling me a hero.

40
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,360
I'm just

41
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,800
a normal guy with a normal life

42
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,720
who happens to work

43
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,120
at a laundromat in the village.

44
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
I don't know what made me

45
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,000
come by this area,

46
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,280
but my instincts told me

47
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,320
something bad was about to happen.

48
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,120
Truth be told,

49
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,040
I've been keeping an eye on
these guys for weeks now.

50
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,640
I just can't stand it
when I see people do wrong.

51
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,920
We've been taught to

52
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,520
do the right things, no?

53
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,480
I'm the one who
tipped off the police.

54
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,880
The police saw
my video on TikTok, damn it.

55
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,160
They didn't even interview me.

56
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,640
Why would you want
to be in the spotlight?

57
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,920
It's good that they got caught.

58
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,440
If we were in the news, our parents
would probably be worried sick.

59
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,520
Do you think those animals
would want to go back to the zoo?

60
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,440
As for me, I don't want
to go back to school yet.

61
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, so lazy!

62
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,760
I don't want to go back either.

63
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,840
Are you Jeng?

64
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,000
The teacher probably
doesn't know we're here.

65
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,920
But this morning, I heard Nat say
that Miss Samorn called.

66
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,240
How did she know?

67
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,960
Soon, we will have to go into
the city to give the statements.

68
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,840
I don't know when we'll be done.

69
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,920
But Nat went out to buy food.
He'll be back soon.

70
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,360
Do you think you'll come back late?

71
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,480
Tomorrow morning, me thinks.

72
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,520
Oh, Miss Samorn...

73
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,480
Has she arrived already?

74
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,520
Yeah.

75
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,320
She'll be here in about ten minutes.

76
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,080
She said she wants you all to learn

77
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,560
some sewing or embroidery.

78
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,240
I heard she plans to

79
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,440
have you sew
blankets for the whole class.

80
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,920
Using more hidden stitches?

81
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,040
Ugh, no way, I'm not doing that!

82
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,320
Um, right.

83
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,080
She looks really mad

84
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,640
that you snuck out of school.

85
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Ton,

86
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,880
please help us.

87
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,920
Miss Samorn is
exploiting us for child labor.

88
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,080
Yes,

89
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,680
please don't send us back!

90
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,400
Correct.

91
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,440
I'm just kidding.

92
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,600
She said you guys

93
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,920
can stay for one more night.

94
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,760
She did say that?

95
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
This is not right.
Don't you fool me!

96
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,760
It's true. I said

97
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,600
you guys are still in shock,

98
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,520
so you can take a break.

99
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,320
Nat stopped by to
take care of papers earlier.

100
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,680
I know, you all

101
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,800
wanna skip school so badly.

102
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,000
Just take care of
the house today, alright?

103
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,040
Yay!

104
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,160
I feel at ease tonight.

105
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,600
Well, I'll go now.

106
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,400
Someone, please
come and get the food.

107
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,920
No need, I'll go myself.

108
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,960
Thank you so much.

109
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,840
Thank you.

110
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,600
Hey guys, I found something good!

111
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,680
What now?

112
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,080
Tadaaa!

113
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,080
Is that alcohol?

114
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,920
Whoa, you're not bad at all!

115
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,360
How did you know that?

116
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,600
Because I've noticed the security
guard, Sang, likes to drink it.

117
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,960
I've been wanting
to try it for a long time.

118
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,200
Hey, babe,

119
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,600
do you want to try some?

120
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
- Alright, I'll leave you alone.
- Hey, hey, careful,

121
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,040
you're going to spill it!

122
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
So, what about you?
Do you want to try?

123
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,320
Alright, let's do it!

124
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,920
You, Junior, do you want to try?

125
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,680
No.

126
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,920
Not going to try?

127
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,400
Not refusing, bring it on!

128
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,880
Alright, let's go for it then!

129
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,680
If you get drunk,
what are you going to do?

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,880
Whoa, come on, Sun!
Don't stop, Junior.

131
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,800
We'll have to go
back to school anyway.

132
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,640
When will we get
another chance like this?

133
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,760
We still have to
wait three more years

134
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,480
until we're twenty.
Isn't it a bit too soon?

135
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,920
Today's

136
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,840
the day we're going to taste
what it's like to be adults.

137
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,520
Cheer!

138
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,320
Alright, tonight

139
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
let's do everything we've
always wanted to do!

140
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,280
Let's do it!

141
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,920
Come on, Sun, drink up!

142
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,640
Cheers!

143
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,800
Shoot, Junior, how come
you handle it so well?

144
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,640
Of course!

145
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
What's up with you?

146
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,440
It's like you've
never seen a ghost before.

147
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,760
Don't go in!

148
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,960
Just go in already!

149
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,520
You can't die, alright!

150
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,640
Who's dying?

151
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,560
I wanna watch something else.

152
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,880
That penguin said,

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,280
"Waddle I do without you?"

154
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
Cray-cray.

155
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,640
Hey!

156
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,320
You and your combos!

157
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,400
Oh!

158
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,840
I won't play anymore!

159
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,840
Don't worry,

160
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,920
I'll be your player 1.

161
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,520
Bet?

162
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,080
Bet.

163
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,040
Thanks bro!

164
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,360
Turtle wave power!

165
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,920
Ah, wrong game, bro.

166
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,640
Hurry up, we're about to lose,

167
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,560
Jodd!

168
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,200
Lose? No way!

169
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,880
Here, take this elbow

170
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,480
strike! How's that?

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,160
Hey!

172
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,160
Hey.

173
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,600
Yay!

174
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,440
Hey.

175
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,640
How much...

176
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,800
Sun, sing a song for us!

177
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,720
No!

178
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,320
You're awesome, for sure!

179
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,640
You've made a kitty out of me.
Meow, meow!

180
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,160
It's beautiful!

181
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,080
Alright then!

182
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,760
Now it's Jeng's turn!

183
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,680
Truth or dare?

184
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,920
Truth.

185
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,680
Truth?

186
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,160
Have you ever done something weird
and not dared to tell anyone?

187
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,720
I've been watching your tiktoks.

188
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,560
Is this weird enough?

189
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,720
Haha, seriously?

190
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,080
You all shy now, Nerd Boy!

191
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,240
Which video do you like?

192
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,560
You only get to ask one question!

193
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,120
Oh.

194
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,040
Now it's my turn.

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,640
Truth

196
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,120
or dare?

197
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,560
Truth.

198
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,800
Why do you sleep hugging
a teddy bear every night?

199
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,840
Your turn to be shy?

200
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,560
Dare, dare.

201
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,400
What's with you?

202
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,080
If you chose truth,
then it's gotta be truth!

203
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,280
You picked truth already, remember?

204
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh, no way!

205
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,320
Alright, then you kiss
Junior on the cheek.

206
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,720
Deal.

207
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
What's that got to do with me?

208
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,080
You guys are so clumsy!

209
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,680
Let's drink with style.

210
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,680
Jeng,

211
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
go grab a towel and clean up!

212
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,000
Truth or dare?

213
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,160
Truth.

214
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,680
Do you still want to
go back to living as before?

215
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,600
And what if I don't go back.

216
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,480
Can the two of us
be like Nat and Ton?

217
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,880
If you don't answer,

218
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,520
then I dare you to kiss me.

219
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,520
Love is a beautiful thing.

220
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,440
Are you hungry?

221
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,320
Wanna eat something else?

222
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,040
No?

223
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,120
You're missing out!

224
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,920
I'm pretty tasty!

225
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,280
Do we really have to
go back to school now?

226
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,480
Are you feeling
down because of this?

227
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,560
I want to stay here
with you guys for a long time.

228
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,880
We'll be together again
once we go back to school.

229
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,720
It's not the same, man.

230
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,800
How is it different?

231
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,400
At school, what can you do

232
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,560
besides play soccer,

233
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,600
sit around, chat,

234
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,280
- or sneak in gaming late at night?
- Correct.

235
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,640
Then why don't you
go to a non-boarding school?

236
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
You seem to like
the life in the outdoors more.

237
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,400
Me?

238
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,360
When I was a kid,
I didn't have many friends.

239
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,280
My parents thought that

240
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,560
if they sent me to boarding school,

241
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,880
I might make some friends.

242
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,760
But when I got here,

243
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,480
in the end, I still didn't have any.

244
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Why didn't you tell
your parents?

245
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,360
They work and
come home late every night.

246
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
You know,

247
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,000
my mom's been watching this
show since forever.

248
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Until now

249
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,320
she's only up to Episode 7.

250
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,440
That's how much she's busy.

251
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,960
I don't want them to worry
about me being lonely.

252
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,280
So, here I am,

253
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,640
making silly videos,

254
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,040
acting carefree day by day.

255
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,400
If they can see the vids,

256
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,880
they'll stop worrying about me.

257
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,600
But now I think

258
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,720
If I go back home,

259
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,040
I'll tell them how I feel.

260
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,840
If it weren't for you guys,

261
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,120
I probably wouldn't wanna
tell them I've been feeling lonely.

262
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,680
Yeah, thanks to you too, Ju.

263
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,440
You've made me think about
things differently as well.

264
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,040
You guys know,

265
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,320
that I'm good at studying?

266
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,600
What?

267
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,320
Are you trying to brag?

268
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,760
It's not that.

269
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,800
It's just that I studied hard

270
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,320
because my parents didn't have

271
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,760
the opportunity to
get a higher education.

272
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,240
They see me

273
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,280
as their second chance in life,

274
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,400
so they want me
to do well in school.

275
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,240
If I do well

276
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,720
and get into medical school,
I'll be successful.

277
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,560
My family isn't wealthy,

278
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,360
but my parents always say

279
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,320
the only thing they
can give me is knowledge.

280
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,880
I don't really know
if I enjoy studying,

281
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,680
but as long as my parents are happy,

282
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,840
I'm happy too.

283
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,840
But now I'm starting

284
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,920
to think about

285
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,720
what I

286
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,160
truly want.

287
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
But then again,

288
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,880
I still can't figure it out.

289
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,880
So what about you, Ju?

290
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,240
How did you grow up?

291
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,720
Let me guess,

292
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,080
your family is rich,

293
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,360
and there are people
supporting you, right?

294
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,440
No, it's not like that.

295
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,120
I didn't live with my parents,

296
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,280
but I have a lot of friends.

297
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,960
I grew up in a small space,

298
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,320
so I couldn't go anywhere.

299
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,520
When someone shows interest,

300
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
it feels good.

301
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,880
Do you live in an orphanage?

302
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,840
Yeah, that's right,
it was an orphanage.

303
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,480
When I was there,

304
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,520
my other friends didn't really
know what they wanted to do.

305
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,160
If there weren't any
caregivers giving instructions.

306
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
But I

307
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,360
want to do this and that, you know?

308
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,440
I feel like

309
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,480
if I'm born,

310
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,080
I should live
life to the fullest, right?

311
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,480
But now, I'm starting to doubt it.

312
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Speaking like this

313
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,400
doesn't sound like you at all.

314
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,680
Don't give up so easily, okay?

315
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,440
What's this?

316
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,360
You're something else.

317
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,560
You tell others not to give up,

318
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,800
but what about you?

319
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,480
Don't pressure me.

320
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,200
Tell us. We wanna know
what you want to do.

321
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,680
Hurry up.

322
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,040
The thing I want to do,
I can't do it alone.

323
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,440
If I have to tell you,
it would probably be...

324
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,160
Oh, you want to have a wife.

325
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
Darling,

326
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,360
I want to have someone in my life.

327
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,000
[I want to be a driver.]

328
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,240
What are you doing?

329
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,720
[I want to be a driver.]

330
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,360
It's what I want to do.

331
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,120
I want to be a driver.

332
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,880
Why?

333
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,400
I don't know,

334
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,800
I'm just sitting here thinking,

335
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,440
I don't really go anywhere much.

336
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,280
If I were a driver,

337
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,960
I'd probably get
to go to new places.

338
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,360
Working while

339
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,720
traveling

340
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,280
would be pretty cool.

341
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,880
Then it's my turn.

342
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,280
[Be an influencer with
one million followers.]

343
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,280
What I wanna be.

344
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,200
It's what I like best.

345
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:33,200
[Junior's dream. North Pole.]

346
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,320
You can keep it in mind for now,

347
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,120
and write it down
once you figure it out.

348
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:03,920
[Sun's dream: I want
to have someone by my side.]

349
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,080
Kids,

350
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,440
wake up now,

351
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,480
hurry up!

352
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,400
It's time to wake up,
you have to go back today.

353
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,240
Wake up now!

354
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,120
Ugh, why are you
waking me up so early?

355
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,800
Wake up now, let's go!

356
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,120
This is the moment,

357
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,680
I might as well fake being dead.

358
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,360
Let's go take a shower and
get dressed quickly.

359
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,080
Didn't forget anything,
right? Let's go.

360
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,280
Wait a minute,

361
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,520
I forgot my power bank.

362
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,640
- You always forget.
- Wait a moment.

363
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
Hurry!

364
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,640
Oh, Jodd.

365
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,520
Why are you making that face?

366
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,960
I don't want to go back yet.

367
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,960
You can't escape this time.

368
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,640
Miss Samorn is worried that
your parents might be concerned.

369
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,480
Okay.

370
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,400
Ton,

371
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,920
can we stop by somewhere
before going back to school?

372
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,920
Sure.

373
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,600
I want to go see
[Penguin]

374
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,400
the giant guinea pig.

375
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,600
Is the giant guinea pig
the same as a capybara?

376
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
- Yes, it's capybara.
- Right.

377
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,760
Shall we go?

378
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:42,880
Let's go!

379
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,360
Let's go see the giant guinea pig.

380
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,680
Hey, I'm coming too!

381
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,760
The giant guinea pig.

382
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,160
Let's go see the capybara.

383
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,200
The capybara.

384
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,600
The giant guinea pig.

385
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,080
Morilo.

386
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,160
Is it on the nose?

387
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah, if you don't believe me,
go smell its nose then.

388
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,320
Then you try climbing into
the cage and show me.

389
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,840
Yeah, by the way, what about Sun?

390
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,720
Yeah, didn't they say
he was coming earlier?

391
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,080
What are you doing?

392
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,200
Do you remember when we talked about

393
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,000
how if anyone ever got out,

394
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,480
that one should come
back and tell the story?

395
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,360
Do you know what I went through?

396
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,600
So I thought that I would
come back and be with you.

397
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,440
Then...

398
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,560
I'll do what you told me to do.

399
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,920
I've heard that

400
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,960
anyone who goes back
to the abandoned cage

401
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,880
will return to
being the same as before.

402
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,560
I have something I want to tell you.

403
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,960
When you said you were leaving,

404
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,120
I kept wondering
if I did something wrong

405
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,920
or if I made

406
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,600
your life full of bad memories.

407
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,800
Is that why you didn't want
to be human anymore?

408
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,960
I understand. It's your decision.

409
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,800
It's your life.

410
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,720
I don't even know
what I'm rambling about,

411
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,760
but can you stay with me?

412
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,800
I won't lie and say
it will only be happiness

413
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,840
because I know

414
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,360
there will be things
that will make you sad.

415
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,040
But if you're sad,

416
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,440
I'll be by your side.

417
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,680
And if anyone tries to hurt you,

418
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,360
I'll help you deal with them.

419
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,440
I don't know if it's too late,

420
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,800
but I want you to stay with me.

421
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,120
Ever since you came into my life.

422
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,760
I've realized that
I've been so incredibly happy

423
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,680
I'm happy too.

424
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,760
I still have a lot of
things I want to do.

425
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,280
And

426
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,120
I know

427
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,280
I probably can't do
everything I want,

428
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,360
but I still want to give it a try.

429
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,960
It might not be anything big,

430
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,400
just wanting...

431
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,480
to eat what I want to eat,

432
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,960
watch what I want to watch,

433
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,280
or be near the people
I want to be with,

434
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,200
and just go with the flow.

435
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,920
If I can do that,
I'd feel like life is still mine.

436
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,680
And it would be nice

437
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,600
if you were with me.

438
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,280
Wanna be boyfriends?

439
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,320
I don't know

440
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,080
what will happen in the future

441
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,440
or if I'll still want
to be penguins again.

442
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,440
But today,

443
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm happy to be with you.

444
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,080
Huh...

445
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,880
Did I say something wrong?

446
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,960
So, are we together?

447
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,080
Then let it be
a thing for the future.

448
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,880
Huh?

449
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,680
What's up with him?

450
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,840
What future are
you talking about, Sun?

451
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,640
Take good care of yourselves.

452
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,720
If you come to my house next time,

453
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,680
just come right in!

454
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
- Alright!
- Okay.

455
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,720
Hey! Don't forget to ring
the bell before coming in!

456
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,520
Will do.

457
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,920
Good bye.

458
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,640
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

459
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,320
In a few weeks,
this term will be over.

460
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,080
Please have all students come
to the administrative office

461
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,840
to contact your parents
to schedule a time for pickup.

462
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,240
I’m waiting at the administration room

463
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,440
Don't make a sad face,

464
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,960
no one's coming
to pick me up anyway.

465
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,080
My parents are
probably busy working.

466
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,920
Hey, why are you all getting sad?

467
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,160
Then,

468
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,320
after the term ends, how about
we sneak off to the temple fair?

469
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,440
I used to go all the time before.

470
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,960
And who did you go with?

471
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,120
Why do you want to know?

472
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,720
You went alone, huh?

473
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,800
What is a temple fair?

474
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,680
How did you grow up

475
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,600
not knowing about
monks or temple fairs?

476
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,920
Then why would you go and tease him?

477
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,240
A temple fair is a celebration

478
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,960
where everyone goes to have fun,

479
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,480
like playing with balloons,

480
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,360
ferris wheel, and bumper cars.

481
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,400
Yes,

482
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,840
just thinking about it makes me want

483
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,120
to go and have the time of my life!

484
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,760
Then count me in.

485
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,040
Sun, will you go with us?

486
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,440
Well, if you go, there's
no way Sun won't go too,

487
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,240
right?

488
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,560
Can I have your fish?

489
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,760
Only the chicken is left.

490
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,080
No,

491
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,440
I want to eat fish.

492
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,400
What else this time?

493
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,640
Jeng, help me out!

494
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,360
You should be the smartest
and most knowledgeable.

495
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,360
Are you insulting me?

496
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,480
What's up?

497
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,320
Did you have a fight with Sun?

498
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,640
You're really smart!

499
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,520
Enough, I'm not helping anymore.

500
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,200
I was just teasing.

501
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,040
Actually, I didn't
have a fight with him.

502
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,800
But it feels like he's still
not ready to open up to me.

503
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,280
- Really?
- Um.

504
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,160
I think you two
look like you're in love.

505
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,800
What's there left to open up about?

506
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,360
Really? But when
I asked him to be my boyfriend,

507
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,880
he still hasn't said yes.

508
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,680
Boyfriend?

509
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,680
Then why didn't you
tell me from the start?

510
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,640
Well, you didn't ask me.

511
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,200
I'll be the one to set you two up.

512
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,240
Sun's just

513
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,880
playing hard to get.

514
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,480
Playing hard to get?

515
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,200
You want him to
open up to you, right?

516
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,760
There are many
types of relationships,

517
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,880
like life partners,

518
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,400
boyfriends,

519
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
or just talking stage.

520
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,840
Talking stage?

521
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,840
You see if it will turn into
a relationship.

522
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,280
So, does that mean Sun and
I are at the talking stage?

523
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,680
Well... I'm not sure.

524
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,040
But I just want to say that

525
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,440
every relationship

526
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,640
has its problems.

527
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,520
So, you're ready, right?

528
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,120
I'm ready.

529
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,360
Here's the thing.

530
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,040
If you want Sun to open up,

531
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,280
what you might be able to do now is

532
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,160
find something he likes

533
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,520
and give it to him.

534
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,880
Say something, anything,

535
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,920
to make him feel like

536
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,960
he means something to you.

537
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,000
Eventually, he'll
open up about his feelings.

538
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,720
How?

539
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,040
Watch and learn, kid.

540
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,200
Jodd.

541
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,520
Jodd, wake up!

542
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,320
Why did you wake me up?

543
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,200
Do you want to know

544
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,320
why I like watching your videos?

545
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,160
I'm going to sleep.

546
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,760
Because you're handsome.

547
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,480
Did the Mole Goddess possess you?

548
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,040
Listen to me,

549
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,120
you're handsome,

550
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,680
funny,

551
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,880
and even though
you seem like a bit of a loser,

552
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,240
you stand firm in your beliefs.

553
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,360
I like how confident you are.

554
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,280
I don't want you to lose that.

555
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,920
Watching your videos

556
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,840
made me feel a lot
more confident in myself.

557
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,400
I like you.

558
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,960
Thank you for being my friend.

559
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah... I like you too.

560
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,480
The chemistry is chemistry-ing~

561
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,840
You can go back to sleep,

562
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,320
I just wanted to tell you this.

563
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,120
Just like that.

564
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,040
You can try finding
something he likes.

565
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,720
Quite tricky I think.

566
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,640
I think I know now.

567
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,320
Master rizzler.

568
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,600
Is the black panther
part of the cat family?

569
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
Yeah, so what's the relevance?

570
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,320
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to gaming now.

571
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,200
Is that right?

572
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,880
Go get that W,
or D, nerd boy.

573
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,440
What?

574
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,400
I'm playing animal crossing.

575
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,080
Sure you are.
I'm leaving now.

576
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,880
I know you meant what you said,

577
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,960
cuz I meant it too.

578
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,440
Go to sleep.

579
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,360
Here we go again.

580
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,840
You called me

581
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,280
but you're keeping quiet.

582
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,760
But I know even
you don't say anything

583
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,840
because you have
something else going on.

584
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,800
Did you have a fight with Junior?

585
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,680
I just want someone
to sit quietly as a friend.

586
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,800
Feels like I'm being
told to mind my own business,

587
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,520
but let me tell you something.

588
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,240
They casted me in this show
cuz I make everything my business.

589
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,200
I heard

590
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,400
Junior asked
you to be his boyfriend.

591
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,680
So why are you stressing?

592
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,400
Don't you like him?

593
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,680
Yes, I like him.

594
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,080
I like him a lot.

595
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
But I'm afraid that

596
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,640
if I agree to be his boyfriend,

597
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,640
and everything goes really well,

598
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,080
what if one day

599
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,400
he faces something bad

600
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,840
and wants to go back
to being a penguin again?

601
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,680
What should I do then?

602
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,240
If it's going to end up like that,

603
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,240
maybe it's better
I don't start it at all.

604
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,680
It's too late now.

605
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,480
Only 3 episodes left,

606
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,840
and when you were an animal,

607
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,240
you just followed your instincts.

608
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,080
But when you became human,

609
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,480
you don't trust you own instincts.

610
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,880
Come on,

611
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,280
whatever is meant
to happen will happen.

612
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,760
Don't overthink or worry
too much about the future.

613
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,120
Just live

614
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,960
in the present.

615
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,760
Whatever you feel,

616
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,840
just go with it.

617
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
You're a life coach, huh?

618
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,520
I listen to
'Mission to the Sun' often.

619
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,040
What's that?

620
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,680
Is this really a good idea?

621
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,560
What're you doing?
