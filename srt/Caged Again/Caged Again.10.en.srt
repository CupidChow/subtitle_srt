1
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,280
I wish everything
was just a nightmare.

2
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,360
So that when I open my eyes,

3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,240
Sun is still here.

4
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,080
But it's not.

5
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,720
I guess I have to accept the truth.

6
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,680
That Sun...

7
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,120
will never come back again.

8
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,320
(5 months later.)

9
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,920
This break I’m really lonely.

10
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,400
If it weren't for you,
I would never survived.

11
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,920
Did you watch the video I sent you?

12
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,840
What video are you talking about?

13
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,880
It's that video I sent.

14
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,640
The cat video,
the one with the chubby cat.

15
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,520
It's really cute, man.

16
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,480
Hey, man.

17
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,640
How are you doing?

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,720
I don't know how to contact you,

19
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,120
you don't use Line
and I can't DM you.

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,680
Junior, you see this?

21
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,640
What do you think
I should caption it?

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,600
What?

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Are you okay?

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,040
I just miss Sun.

25
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Soon the police will find Sun.

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,440
You have to believe me.

27
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
He won't disappear.

28
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,440
Matter never disappears.

29
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
It only changes form.

30
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,240
You're such a nerd.

31
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,160
What's up with you?

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,480
You see me like this, but I
actually read books, you know.

33
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,720
What if...

34
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,320
I try making a video
to search for Sun?

35
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,160
Maybe it will become
a trend on social media,

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,440
and people will help look for him.

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,760
Would it be a good idea?

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,240
Or should I try hacking the IP
to access the government server?

39
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,320
It's okay,

40
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,520
no need to search for him.

41
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,280
I think he probably won't come back.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,360
What do you mean, ‘It’s okay’.

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,040
Didn't you tell me to
be true to my feelings?

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,200
If you're sad, just say you're sad.

45
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,240
What's going on with you now?

46
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,480
It's okay, man.

47
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Hey, are you okay?

48
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,800
This semester,
I got really low grades.

49
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,640
There were subjects that
I thought I did well in,

50
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,800
but when the grades came out,

51
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,280
I got really low.

52
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,160
Hey!

53
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,680
If you're having fun, that's fine.

54
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,080
Forget about the grades.

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,560
I still saw you
retaking your F exam.

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,120
I don’t think I can just forget about it?

57
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,960
You might be better at other things

58
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
than just being
good at taking exams.

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,080
Maybe I'm just not cut out
for taking exams like this.

60
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,920
I don't think I'll continue
my studies anymore.

61
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,520
Hey, Junior,

62
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,360
think about it carefully.

63
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,720
Don't you like
swimming and computers?

64
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,200
You might not like or
be good at other subjects,

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,560
but that's okay.

66
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,880
I don't like studying either,

67
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,640
but I still do it.

68
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,040
If you're leaving,

69
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,240
at least stop by to see us sometime.

70
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,720
Hey, Jeng,

71
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,560
don't encourage him like that.

72
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,560
Let Ju make his own decision.

73
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,000
I think he already
thought it through.

74
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,920
It's up to you,

75
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,160
I can't force you.

76
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,600
But you have to
stop by and see us, okay?

77
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,840
You have to stop
by and see us, okay?

78
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,800
Hey, you have to come, alright?

79
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,640
Alright, got it.

80
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,280
At least we're
here for you, you know.

81
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,320
I'm always by your side.

82
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,520
I already told you in advance

83
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,320
that I wanted to leave early today.

84
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,320
You can't treat me like this!

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
I already told you!

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,720
I'm meeting my girlfriend
to watch a movie today.

87
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,640
I have to pick her up soon.

88
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,560
You can handle it for
me in the meantime, ok?

89
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,720
I've only taken three days off

90
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,360
this year:

91
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,240
two days ago and today.

92
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,840
Listen, you brat!

93
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,680
I can't take it anymore!
I'm quitting!

94
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,200
Well, if you want to go, then go.

95
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
But I'm not paying you for today.

96
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,280
Yeah,

97
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,040
it's just a few hundred,

98
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,040
I don't need it anyway.

99
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,520
Yeah, go ahead.

100
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,440
Penguin Laundry, clean

101
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,960
crazy refreshing,
just like having a penguin

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,440
stand there and
do the laundry for you.

103
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,040
No need to go
all the way to the Pole.

104
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,080
Just come right in and relaxed.

105
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,760
Penguin,

106
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,120
can I take a picture, please?

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,440
How did a penguin

108
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,080
ended up in such
a hot place like this?

109
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,920
Aren't penguins supposed
to live in the Pole?

110
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,320
I'm leaving now.

111
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,960
My mom will be worried.

112
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,680
Aren't you tired?

113
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,800
Listening to me,
praying for you every day.

114
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
I'm going to save money
to go to the North Pole,

115
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,080
and I will live there.

116
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,360
And if Sun comes back,

117
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,520
please tell him that

118
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,480
I've already followed my dream.

119
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,240
But if he doesn't come back,

120
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,880
it's all your fault.

121
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,000
Is it fun for you

122
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,880
to see me struggle as person?

123
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,920
Being human isn't that easy,
you know.

124
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,960
If you're going to get back at me

125
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,240
when everything in
my life is going well,

126
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,280
you didn't have to
bless me from the start.

127
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,440
Thank you, dear.

128
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,560
You're welcome, aunty.

129
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,560
Ever since

130
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,040
you started working at my shop,

131
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
we've had a lot more customers
coming in for laundry.

132
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,240
I really don't want you to leave.

133
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,800
I don't know where
I'll find someone like you.

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,760
Try to think it over first.

135
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,520
Jobs like this aren't
easy to come by these days.

136
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,600
Especially since
you didn't finish your studies.

137
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,600
Thank you so much.

138
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,400
I'm leaving now, Sun.

139
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,040
I won't come to see you anymore.

140
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,040
I won't wait for you

141
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,720
or cry for you anymore.

142
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,120
I'm going to Bangkok to find a job.

143
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,320
Once I have enough money,

144
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,960
I'll go to the North Pole.

145
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,240
And I'll never come
back to Thailand again.

146
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,920
I will get married there.

147
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,000
I will live my life there.

148
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,640
I will live my life happily.

149
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,160
And I will forget
everything about you.

150
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,160
If you don't want me to go,

151
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,280
then hurry back to me.

152
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,000
You told me you'd go to the
fair with me every year.

153
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,720
I'm sorry for being late.

154
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,440
Just you coming back makes me happy.

155
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,480
Thank you for coming to see me.

156
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,360
I'm not going anywhere.

157
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,600
I'm staying here with you.

158
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,840
I love you.

159
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
Are you being sulky?

160
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,120
Do you love me that much?

161
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,360
I love you more
than anything in the world.

162
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,440
So, are you going
to Bangkok now?

163
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,840
Who told you?

164
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,760
I heard someone

165
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,120
say,...

166
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,920
"I'm going to
Bangkok to make money..."

167
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,920
"I'm going to the North Pole

168
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,080
to find penguins."

169
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,760
"I'm sure I'll meet
someone better than Sun."

170
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm only gone for a little while,

171
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,320
and you're already looking
for someone new?

172
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,680
I guess I have to move on, right?

173
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,440
No one knows where you've gone.

174
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,040
What are you doing?
That's inappropriate!

175
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,400
Shall we begin,

176
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,200
my love?

177
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,080
Are you crazy?
What are you going to do?

178
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,960
You're being inappropriate!
This is crazy!

179
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,560
Right here then.

180
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,840
Are you crazy.

181
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,880
- No...
- What are you looking at?

182
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,400
What?

183
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,880
Is that a person?

184
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,120
What is it?

185
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,640
A person.

186
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,800
A person.

187
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,840
Who is it?

188
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,920
Hey, Sun!

189
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,240
Sun!

190
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,520
Sun!

191
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,040
Are you okay, Sun?

192
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
- Sun!
- How did you end up here, Sun?

193
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,680
Hey.

194
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,960
Sun!

195
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,800
Are you okay, Sun?

196
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,640
Sun!

197
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,640
Sun!

198
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,920
You, I think we should
take him to the hospital first.

199
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,600
Let's go, take it easy.

200
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,160
Take it easy, Sun.

201
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,920
Are you okay?

202
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,640
Take it easy.

203
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,720
Are you okay?

204
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,680
Take it slow.

205
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,560
Do you still want to go to Bangkok?

206
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,520
I'm not sure.

207
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,880
If you disappear again, I might go.

208
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,760
In that case, we can go together.

209
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,160
I really want to face the
5 hours traffic.

210
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,960
A three-month
advance deposit, please.

211
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,640
How was today?

212
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,080
Did you enjoy your meal?

213
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,360
I'd rather have
stir-fried basil with squid.

214
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,400
Why is that?

215
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,320
The minced pork
doesn't taste that great.

216
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,960
It's tasty too, though.

217
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,920
Is something wrong with her, Sun?

218
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,080
She's crying again.

219
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,520
What are you going to do?

220
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,280
Listen, she's crying again.

221
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,640
Aren't we going to help her?

222
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,000
It's nothing.

223
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,200
How can it be nothing?
Didn't you hear her crying?

224
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
I heard it, but...

225
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,000
Let's just leave her be.

226
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,680
What are you going to do? Let's go.

227
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,840
I never thought
you would be like this.

228
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,200
Do you want to know
why she's crying?

229
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,120
Oh, Sun!

230
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
Can't you hear

231
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,160
her crying? There might be danger.
Aren't you going to help her?

232
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,840
Come on.

233
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,720
If you were pregnant,

234
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,520
what would the baby be like?

235
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,800
The face would be a black panther,

236
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,680
and the body would be a penguin.

237
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Or maybe the face
would be a penguin,

238
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and the body would
be a black panther.

239
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,920
I think

240
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,400
it's better if the face is a penguin

241
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,320
and the body is a black panther.

242
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,160
That way, the baby
will be strong like you.

243
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,280
But I'd prefer

244
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,720
a black panther face
and a penguin body.

245
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,880
I want our baby to be soft
and gentle like you.

246
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,680
But I can't get pregnant.

247
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,680
Oh, come on!

248
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,320
You bought a snack?

249
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,720
This is our baby.

250
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,680
I heard you say
you wanted to have a child.

251
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,360
I've seen many people
raising animals as their kids.

252
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,560
This apartment,
we can't keep cats or dogs,

253
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,480
so all we can have is fish.

254
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,040
I'll let you choose
the name for the baby.

255
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,840
What do you want to name it?

256
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,680
Alright, then I'll name it...

257
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,280
"Guinny"!

258
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,760
‘Black Bae’ over here.

259
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,200
Wait, you told me to pick a name!

260
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,600
Guinny! Guinny! Guinny!

261
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,880
Guinny, come to papa.

262
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,400
Black Bae, come to mama.

263
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,400
My son, come here.

264
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,520
Hey!

265
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,440
(Junior's dream: The North Pole.)

266
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,760
Do you remember
when we wrote down

267
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,680
what we wanted to do?

268
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,680
Should we do what
we once dreamed of doing?

269
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,600
What is it?

270
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,360
I want to go to the North Pole.

271
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,120
I said I wanted to
go to the North Pole.

272
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,560
Pay attention!

273
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,400
What do you think?

274
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:13,920
Alright,

275
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,240
we need to start saving up.

276
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,160
Maybe we should wait
another ten years to go?

277
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,440
Ten years, really?

278
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,040
Well, right now we
don't have any savings yet.

279
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,800
I think maybe in three years.

280
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,520
Why three years?

281
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,640
Did you go gambling?

282
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,560
No.

283
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,000
The birds just brought it to me.

284
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,760
So, you didn't gamble, but you had
the birds bring you money instead?

285
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,000
Are you crazy?

286
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,040
The birds brought it to me
themselves, I didn't force them!

287
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,760
If that's the case, it looks like

288
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,200
it's just me who has to work
hard to save money then.

289
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,680
You should write your own down.

290
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,480
Who said I didn't write it?

291
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,400
Where is it?

292
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,520
(Sun's dream: I want
to have someone by my side.)

293
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,280
Someone like you, wanting
to do something like this?

294
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,280
Hey,

295
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,160
are you still keeping this?

296
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,760
Why are you keeping it?

297
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,520
Did you see the number on the tag?

298
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,760
251100.

299
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,240
I don't know my
own birthday like you.

300
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,600
In one cage,
there are several penguins.

301
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,240
Suddenly, I thought that

302
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,880
this number might be my birthday

303
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,440
because it has been
with me since the beginning.

304
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,560
But looking at this number,
it's pretty close, isn't it?

305
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,040
Yeah, but it is trivial.

306
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,640
What do you mean by trivial?

307
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,960
What do you want for your birthday?

308
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,560
I want you.

309
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,080
You already got me,

310
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,080
what more do you want?

311
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,680
I want more.

312
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,240
I want you. I want you. I want you.

313
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,600
I want you. I want you. I want you.

314
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,120
(4 years later.)

315
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,840
Oh, keep making me kick my legs

316
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,720
I'm so tired!

317
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,240
Keep kicking your legs like that!

318
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,480
I can swim all the strokes.

319
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,240
Is there anything harder than this?

320
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,880
Do you want it?

321
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,520
Bring it on.

322
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,200
Alright!

323
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,320
I will teach you a move
harder than the frog style,

324
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,200
harder than the butterfly.

325
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,280
Is there such a thing?

326
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,520
Yes, there is.

327
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,040
It's the penguin stroke, of course!

328
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,280
Cut!

329
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,720
Why didn't you fall down then?

330
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:47,920
When he finished

331
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,400
hitting, you should have
fallen down immediately,

332
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,920
pretending to be hurt
and falling right away.

333
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,920
After getting hit, fall
down immediately

334
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,760
and act like you're hurt. Okay?

335
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,760
I was so excited earlier that

336
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,840
I didn't even realize
when I got hit.

337
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,880
Huh, you didn't feel anything?

338
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,400
He hit pretty hard just now.

339
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,880
Alright, try again.
Hit him like you did before.

340
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,160
Okay?

341
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,720
- Okay.
- You hit hard, okay?

342
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,920
Try it out!

343
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,720
And action!

344
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,440
Cut!

345
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,920
Why didn't you fall down?

346
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,760
Did you feel it just now?
Did you feel when he hit you?

347
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,280
I already fell just now.

348
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,440
Okay, after hitting,
fall immediately.

349
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,720
No waiting, just hit and
fall, okay?

350
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,240
Okay.

351
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,000
One more time, okay?

352
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,600
Okay.

353
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,160
One more time.

354
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,040
And action!

355
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,280
Cut!

356
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,840
He hasn't hit you yet.

357
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,400
He hasn't hit you yet,
why would you fall?

358
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,200
He hasn't hit you yet,
wait for him to hit first.

359
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,360
Once he hits, then you can fall.

360
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,440
One more time,
I'm giving you the last round.

361
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,080
You hit me as hard as you can.

362
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,600
Don't be afraid
that I'll get hurt, okay?

363
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
Ready?

364
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,680
And action!

365
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,320
Ouch!

366
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,480
Cut!

367
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,880
Freaking Finally!

368
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,920
Good job.

369
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,040
Thank you.

370
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,680
What are you asking for?

371
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,040
Do I have to tell you?

372
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,840
Hey, if you ask for something,
it's something I can give you.

373
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
You can't give it to me.

374
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,240
Jodd! Jeng!

375
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,920
Hey, keep your voice down,

376
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
this is a shrine.

377
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,280
Jod and Jeng is this...

378
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,640
What?

379
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,920
You guys can still be together.

380
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,720
Will you guys be
together until you're old?

381
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,920
Of course,

382
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
we are lovers.

383
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,840
What is your relationship?

384
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,080
Hey, you tease them, and then
you'll be jealous of them again.

385
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,760
You should come and stay with me.

386
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,280
You asked me
what I asked for, right?

387
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,320
This is it.

388
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,440
Sure, go ask for it.

389
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,520
Hurry up and ask for it.

390
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,480
Seeing a shrine like this makes me
think of the Goddess of Moles.

391
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,560
Right, I don't know where she went.

392
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,280
I think she's been reborn.

393
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,000
Who knows,

394
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,680
maybe she's still a ghost.

395
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,640
If it were me, I would
have been reborn a long time ago.

396
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,080
If you talk about her too much,

397
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,800
she'll definitely
come to see you tonight.

398
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Come on, I'll wait for her tonight.

399
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,280
Do you guys know

400
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,960
what her dream is?

401
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,680
What is it?

402
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,800
Having a new shrine.

403
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,320
Is that all?

404
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,600
Well, the old shrine
where she used to live

405
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,320
birds like to poop on it, right?

406
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,240
And it's like

407
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,800
leveling up to upgrade
new shrines or something.

408
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,040
That's cool.

409
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,600
I'd better write a game out of it.

410
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,480
Oh, you audacious birds!

411
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,840
I ran away to set up a new shrine,

412
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,640
and you still come to shit on me.

413
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,560
Just wait until I’m promoted
to an even higher spiritual rank!

414
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,160
You’re going down

415
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,480
- Like the economy.
- Like the economy.

416
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,200
Just you wait.

417
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,960
- Hey!
- Hey!

418
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,760
I thought
the goddess had disappeared.

419
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,880
It's good that the goddess is fine,

420
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,920
but it's bad that birds still
come to poop like before.

421
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,880
Then why doesn't heaven lift
the curse of bird droppings?

422
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,960
What curse?

423
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,600
Nothing.

424
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,920
It's been a long time.

425
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,440
Ju.

426
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,880
I know what you're looking at.

427
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,760
What?

428
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,280
You ask the goddess

429
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,880
whether she still wants the
ten crates of red water

430
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,160
and silk outfit with a floral pattern.

431
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,080
Yes.

432
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,240
She asked if you wanted to talk.
She said she would possess someone.

433
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,120
No, no, no.

434
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,560
The statue will break again.

435
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,160
I'm too lazy to use glue to fix it.

436
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,920
"You're annoying."

437
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,720
She said that. I didn't say it.

438
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,640
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah, I know.

439
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,720
Come see me more often,

440
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,240
I'm lonely.

441
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,480
The goddess.

442
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,000
This way.

443
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,480
Oh really?

444
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,920
The goddess.

445
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,800
May you bless Jeng.

446
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,200
Satu.

447
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,560
I'll give you 20 crates.

448
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,920
Hurry up and say Satu.

449
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,800
- Satu.
- I just said it.

450
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,640
Hello.

451
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,200
- Hello!
- Hello!

452
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,880
This is a gift.

453
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,640
Hey, thank you. Thank you.

454
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,560
Hey, Nut.

455
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,040
- Hello!
- How are you? Hello!

456
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,920
Have you traveled far?

457
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,400
Yes, it's very far.

458
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Wait a moment. It's almost done.

459
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,440
Today we have some
food that you guys like.

460
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,840
Do you guys see her too?

461
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,320
This is my child.
Her name is Kong Khwan.

462
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,960
Is she cute?

463
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,040
Yes, she is.

464
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,520
You guys go play games
with Jod and Jeng first.

465
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,120
I'll prepare some food for you.

466
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,520
Okay.

467
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,720
You'll get it for sure.

468
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,040
Hey guys,
you don't care about us at all.

469
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,000
Don't bother me. I'm playing a game.

470
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,360
What the hell are you doing, Sun?

471
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,920
I lost.

472
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,440
Now that we've met,
please pay attention to us.

473
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,160
Yeah, you guys
don't care about us at all.

474
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,680
What the hell are you talking about?

475
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,640
Doesn't your house have internet?

476
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,080
I talk to you every day.

477
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,920
If you hadn't bullied me,
I would have beaten Jeng.

478
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,600
Someone like you can beat Jeng?

479
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,200
You guys are going to
the North Pole soon, right?

480
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,160
Really?

481
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,480
Shoot, that's great.

482
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,320
What's great?

483
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,960
Your life is better than ours.

484
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
You know I already
have 3,000 followers?

485
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,400
Shoot, this means
I'm about to become famous.

486
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,640
I didn't mean that.

487
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,440
I meant that
you're going to America.

488
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,920
Are you going to America, Jodd?

489
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Don't you know this?

490
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,360
Kids, come help carry the food.

491
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,480
- Okay.
- Sure.

492
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Let's go.

493
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,680
Have you ever eaten this?

494
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,920
Next time, I won't lose to you.

495
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,360
Kong Khwan has gone to bed.

496
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,520
And Kong Khwan, did you guys adopt her?

497
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,920
No, we let someone else
be our surrogate mother.

498
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,280
Since we got married,

499
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,160
we've been looking
for ways to have children.

500
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,520
So have you graduated yet?

501
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,120
We're done

502
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,120
but I might continue studying.

503
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,360
But Jodd,

504
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,480
once his visa is approved, he'll go
to America by the end of this year.

505
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,600
What are you looking at?

506
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,800
I didn't think
you'd leave this fast.

507
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,640
And will you
be there for a long time?

508
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,160
I'm probably just going along.

509
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,640
There's nothing special
to do in Thailand anyway.

510
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,800
I want to try out making content
about living alone in America.

511
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,160
Maybe I'll be famous.

512
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,040
Everything is content to you.

513
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,720
And you traveling away so far,

514
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,240
aren't you afraid that someone
around here will miss you?

515
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,680
Who,

516
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,920
who would miss me?

517
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,640
Jeng doesn't miss me.

518
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,480
He'll go to study in Boston.

519
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,080
He and I can easily to meet up,

520
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,560
unlike the two of you.

521
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,000
Hey,

522
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,560
they're probably having something.

523
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,880
Why are you whispering?
Everyone here can hear it all.

524
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,320
What's something?
There's nothing at all.

525
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,400
I think it's here.

526
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,760
I'll go open it myself.

527
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,240
- Hello!
- Hello!

528
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,040
- Noi!
- Hello!

529
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,120
Hi Timothy.

530
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,200
- Hello!
- Please come in.

531
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,720
- Hello!
- Hello!

532
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
How are you, aunty?

533
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,680
I am also fine.

534
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,120
Since I talked to you guys that day,

535
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,160
I've been staying with Timothy.

536
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,440
Thank you so much, you guys.

537
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,560
One way ticket to paradise?

538
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,200
Oops,

539
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,720
don't tease me.

540
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,480
Would you like some?

541
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,600
Would you like to join, Ms Samorn?

542
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,760
I'm not really used to it, but...

543
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,840
just a little bit is fine.

544
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,360
Junior,

545
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,360
it's your turn.

546
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
Truth or Dare?

547
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,760
I have something to tell you.

548
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,720
I am a penguin.

549
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,640
As for Sun, he is a black panther.

550
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,720
If you're a penguin

551
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,240
and you're a black panther,

552
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,800
then Jodd is a dog.

553
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,960
What's that dog barking sound, man?

554
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,320
If I were a dog,

555
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,480
I would be the cutest

556
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,440
and most loyal dog.

557
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,080
Is that right?

558
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,320
- Thank you.
- Please.

559
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,560
Are you okay?

560
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,160
I'm good.

561
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,640
You're totally drunk.

562
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,480
You, I'm still okay.

563
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,320
Walk carefully.

564
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,840
See you, guys.

565
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,840
See you, Ms Samorn.

566
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,160
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

567
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,240
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

568
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,360
Take care.

569
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,240
Be careful, man.

570
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,040
- Be careful.
- Are you okay?

571
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,640
- See you, bro.
- Go home safely.

572
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,560
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

573
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,600
- Bye-bye!
- Go home safely.

574
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

575
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,760
We're going back first.

576
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,320
Don't forget about us.

577
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,400
It's not like you all left

578
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,520
and never came back.

579
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,040
I know.

580
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,480
Don't forget, man.

581
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,280
Don't forget what?

582
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,680
Now, it's probably
just you who forgot.

583
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,320
Let's go, Jeng.

584
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,400
Are you okay?

585
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,440
Come and ride on my back.

586
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,720
One, two, three.

587
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,200
See you, man.

588
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,360
See you.

589
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,040
What's going on
between the two of them?

590
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,240
Don't meddle in
other people's business.

591
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,880
This kind of thing requires
understanding. It’s chemistrying.

592
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,800
I never thought I'd get
to see everyone together like this.

593
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,600
I can still remember
the first day I met you.

594
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,360
The day you made a face
like you had fallen in love.

595
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,880
Really? But at that time,
I wasn't thinking about anything.

596
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,360
But you still liked me first anyway.

597
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,000
Well, you were
the one flirting with me.

598
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,640
And you kept chasing after me too.

599
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,960
Because I knew that you liked me.

600
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,160
So, I kept pursuing you.

601
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,880
Or do you not like me?

602
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,120
I like you, soft little penguin.

603
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,440
I'm happy for P’ Nut and P’ Ton too.

604
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,960
They got married and had a kid already.

605
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,800
Jodd and Jeng were finally
able to follow their dreams.

606
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,040
Ms Samorn also

607
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,680
got to dress the way she likes.

608
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,040
As for Aunty Noi,

609
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,200
she finally
started to find happiness.

610
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,240
It's great!

611
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,640
Everyone has done what they love.

612
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
You’re the same as well.

613
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
You will be going to the North Pole.

614
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,000
Are you excited?

615
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,040
I wish there were
penguins at the North Pole.

616
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,400
Here it is.

617
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,520
When you go to the North Pole,

618
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,720
there will be
one penguin there after all.

619
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,960
You're daydreaming.

620
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,040
Talking aimlessly.

621
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,760
What about you? Have you thought
about what you want to do?

622
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,680
It's the same as always.

623
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,120
I just want to
keep living like this.

624
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,560
But actually, there is one thing.

625
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,080
I want to be with
you for the rest of my life.

626
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,360
I said it.

627
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,920
Let's go home.

628
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Wait a second.

629
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,880
Why?

630
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,920
(Arctic)

631
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
This place is even more
beautiful than the picture.

632
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,840
I never thought I
would come this far.

633
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,280
In the past, I just lived

634
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,400
a repetitive life in
that cage and at school.

635
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,200
But after meeting you,

636
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,320
I got to go to other places,

637
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,480
temples,

638
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,600
karaoke bars,

639
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,560
and even gambling spots.

640
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,320
And look at us now,

641
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,040
I've come all the way
to the North Pole.

642
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,320
What black panther would
make it to the North Pole, right?

643
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,120
Penguins too.

644
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,920
Do you know,

645
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,680
before, when I saw parents
picking students up,

646
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,400
I felt really lost.

647
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,880
Until I came here with you.

648
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,480
The place you've always dreamed of.

649
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,000
It feels like
my dream comes true as well.

650
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,920
Just for a moment,

651
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,040
I felt like
I finally made it back home.

652
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,720
You too.

653
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,200
You are like home to me.

654
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,880
I love you, Sun.

655
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,880
What? I can't hear you.

656
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,120
You said you have
good hearing, right?

657
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,640
Huh? I didn't hear anything at all.

658
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,200
I love you, Sun!

659
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,680
I love you the most,

660
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,480
more than all
the panther I've ever met.

661
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,160
Loud enough?

662
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,760
I love you too, Junior!

663
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,240
I love you the most.

664
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,800
I love you more than
any penguin I've ever met.

665
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,400
I can't hear anything at all.

666
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,200
I love you, Junior!

667
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:17,440
Thank you to each and every one of our fans!
