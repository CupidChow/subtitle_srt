Gosh, she's so pretty!

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,780
Isn't it crazy? How is her face so pale?

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,940
Gosh, it's like porcelain!

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,330
How are her legs so long? Is she two meters?

Hi, Kim Ji Eun!

24
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,000
Ji Eun! Do you remember me? We've met before.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,880
Of course.

 I, Kim Ji Eun. Is this what it's like to live as an insider? 

32
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,290
   

33
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,640
 I saw Queen Ji Eun today. She's so gorgeous. 

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,040
 Kim Ji Eun's so kind. I want to be friends with her. 

35
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,650
 Where everyone knows me and likes me. 

36
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,860
 That's right. I'm an insider— 

37
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,350
Why'd he bump into me?

38
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,490
Sorry. Are you okay?

39
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,160
I didn't see you.

40
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,850
Huh? Are you in our class?

41
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,610
We're really sorry.

42
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,790
Huh? I-It's fine.

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,580
She's in our class?

44
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,420
It's my first time talking to her, too.

45
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,390
What's her name?

46
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,140
 That's right. Total outsider, Kim Ji Eun. 

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,020

 "Insider Time." IT for short. 

62
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,660
 Having no phone is one thing. But there's no one who doesn't use IT. 

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,130
I swear on everything I have. I seriously saw it!

64
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,400
Hey, hey! Did you check IT?

65
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,870
- Look at this call-out post! 
 - That's insane!

66
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,130
Hey! Who's the jerk leading someone on?

67
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,910
What a complete asshole!

68
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,530
Geez, Oh Joon Pyo! You're getting crushed.

69
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,030
You f***ing suck at this game!

70
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,800
Damn it! One more round!

71
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,760
Shit, there's an open spot. Hurry and recruit on IT.

72
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,510
 They all talk and reply on IT. 

73
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,830
 That's everyone, 

74
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,560
 except me. 

75
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,580
 What should I post? 

76
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,790
   

77
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,180

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,050
No, give me an example! An example! 
    

80
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,460
Something that hits the nail on the— 
    

81
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,890
   

82
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,930
Sorry. I was too loud, wasn't I?

83
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,140
Hey...

84
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,870
Hey!

85
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,360
Are you mad?

86
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,810
Huh? Why?

87
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,880
I mean, I thought I was being too loud.

88
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,510
What did you do?

89
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,760
I didn't even realize you were there.

90
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,990

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,100
Everyone, attention, please.

92
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,540
We're skipping morning assembly today.

93
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,810
Place the Korean performance task on the podium before lunch.

94
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,600
As for today's PE class...

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,610
Hey, Prez*! It can't be! 
  (Short for "class president.") 

96
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,080
Please, oh, please!

97
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,500
- It's outdoors. 
 - Nice!

98
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,940
The PE teacher wanted to go over theory, but I talked him out of it.

99
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,810
 Class Prez! Class Prez! 

100
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,910
 Class Prez! Class Prez! Class Prez! 

101
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,320
 Right. She's a true insider. 

102
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,260
 She has a great personality and knows how to lead the kids. 

103
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,820
Is anyone absent?

104
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,640
Where are Kang Woo Bin and Motor Mouth?

105
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,400
Are they tardy?

106
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,180
Hey, we're not late.

107
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,720
The homeroom teacher gave us an errand. That's why I just got here.

108
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,390
Today's PE is outdoors, right?

109
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,300
It's not a theory class, is it?

110
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,620
Motor Mouth, you're noisy as soon as you walk in.

111
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,760
 He's also an insider. 

112
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,310
 He has a personality, and he's cute in his own way. 

113
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,540
 He even has a nickname. 

114
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,860
 And the guy who's simply handsome. 

115
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,390
 An idol trainee. 

116
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,940
 The guy who's just handsome is bound to be an insider. 

117
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,140
Hurry and sit. I won't go easy on you just because you're a trainee.

118
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,750
Of course.

119
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,610
Things are just hectic as I'm preparing.

120
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,750
Whoa! As expected from our future superstar.

121
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,080
That's idol trainee class!

122
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,730
Hey, did you read yesterday's post on IT?

123
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,410
- The secret forum? What's Dopamine going to do? 
 - How could that happen?

124
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,190
Exactly! I'd like to live that kind of life before I die.

125
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,510
 What can I do about lacking presence? 

126
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,320
 Can I create it all of a sudden? 

127
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,200
   

128
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,700
   

129
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,890
Mom!

130
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,950
No, it's Ji Eun.

131
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,290
What's tonight's dinner?

132
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,850
What about me? How could you leave me out?

133
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,520
You forgot? How could you forget your daughter? I like buffets, too!

134
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,900
How could you say I have no presence?

135
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,830
Whatever! I'll take care of myself.

136
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,900
It's like I'm invisible! Seriously!

137
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,990
Are you serious?

138
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,940
   

139
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,690
    
  I'm the one who farted during math. 

140
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,200
 Cursing me out was too harsh, though. 

141
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,230
 I liked him first. Can't I just steal him? 

142
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,820
 I saw you cheating. Do you have any shame? 

143
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,120
 I'm such an outsider. 

144
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,450
 Is it really okay to live like this? 

145
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,690
 I bet I'm worse off than you. Want to battle? 

146
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,550
 I only sleep during breaks because I don't have any friends. 

147
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,520
 I did that, too. 

148
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,500
 But I don't anymore because it's awkward when someone wakes me up. 

149
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
 Crazy, that happened to me, too. 

150
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,580
 I play a mind game every day at lunch. 

151
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,870
 I eat alone if I don't hurry and sit next to someone. 

152
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,980
 I was like that, too. 

153
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,750
 But after my classmates asked me which class I was in, I just ate alone. 

154
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,300
 Last time we played dodgeball, I lasted until the end, 

155
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,900
 but our team lost, saying everyone was out. 

156
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,980
 The homeroom teacher sincerely worries about me. 

157
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,570
 And last time— 

158
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,990
 You win. What kind of life are you leading? 

159
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,730
Yes!

160
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,820
   

161
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,740
My life is so boring.

162
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,330
Hey!

163
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,710
Do you have a moment?

164
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,430
- Me? 
 - Yeah.

165
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,730
Thank you so much. I left my phone today.

166
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,530
It's okay. You can leave it in my drawer after you're done with it.

167
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,800
No way. I heard there's been a lot of theft in the class lately.

168
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,940
I'll check something and return it right away.

169
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,090
Oh, all right.

170
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,930
 Holy shit. He's handsome AF. 

171
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,690
This is our first time talking, right?

172
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,740
You go straight to practice after school, right?

173
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,850
You're incredible. Being an idol trainee sounds really difficult.

174
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,780
Nope, it's nothing much.

175
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,910
It's incredible!

176
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,160
To become a V trainee, you must have good looks, voice, and dancing skills.

177
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,850
I know because I like idols, too.

178
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,390
That was too much information, huh? Sorry.

179
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,510
All done! Thanks.

180
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,100
Let's hurry up. You'll be late for PE.

181
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,770
You're not going?

182
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,260
I don't feel too well. I'm going to the nurse's office.

183
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,640
Hey, pass! Pass!

184
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,030
Wrong way! I said over here!

185
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,040
Pass, pass! Kwang Hyeon, over here!

186
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,230
Come on! Here, here!

187
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,220
Take this!

188
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,430
- That's f***ing hilarious! 
 - She didn't know!

189
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,920
She became broke trying to attend a fan signing event!

190
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,610
Whatever!

191
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,590
My dad's going to kill me if he finds out.

192
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,470
Our Woo Bin will be like that one day, huh?

193
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,530
We'll have to buy a shitload of his albums to meet him.

194
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,140
- Why? 
 - Hey, did you see IT?

195
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,940
- What is it? 
 - Someone posted secretly taken photos of our Woo Bin!

196
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,510
Hey, can't we report this?

197
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:43,030
 This is our first time talking, right? 

198
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,000
It's anonymous, so we can't even catch the guy.

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,060
Gosh, can't we just reveal their real names?

200
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,840
Are you nuts? Then, none of us will be able to attend school.

201
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,350
Hey, Kim Chae*. Look at your lips. 
  (Short for Kim Chae Yeon.) 

202
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,090
When did you buy that?

203
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,720
I'll show you in class later. This is freaking expensive!

204
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,230
 That was freaking expensive! 

205
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,530
 Who's the crazy f***er! 

206
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,300
 Ko Sang Woo! You went into the classroom after playing soccer. 

207
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,520
 Don't cross the line! What would I do with a girl's lipstick? 

208
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,130
Who was the last person to leave the class before PE?

209
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,500
You!

210
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,710
Y-You...

211
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,990
Whoever you are! Weren't you the last to come out earlier?

212
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,660
You came out while we were warming up during PE.

213
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,740
Look at her. Why can't she speak?

214
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,420
You know that there have been a lot of thefts in our class lately?

215
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,970
Don't be upset since we're only asking due to its sensitive nature.

216
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,420
Were you the last to come out?

217
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,800
The one who left after me was Woo Bin...

218
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,660
Whoa, I can't hear a f***ing word she's saying.

219
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,240
Hey, what did you say?

220
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,160
 - What's with her? 
 - She's suspicious. 

221
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,590
 She's freaking creepy. 

222
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,040
 Who has spoken to her before? 

223
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,590
Stop accusing her. I was the last to leave.

224
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,080
You were?

225
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,000
Come to think of it, I didn't see you during PE.

226
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,350
I was in the nurse's office, and I locked the classroom.

227
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,260
I also unlocked it in time for your return.

228
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,660
I didn't see anyone suspicious.

229
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,230
More importantly, it wasn't her.

230
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,030
She left later because I asked her for a favor.

231
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,670
That's what he says, but what if Kang Woo Bin stole it?

232
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,350
As if! Is Woo Bin crazy?

233
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,090
Just shut your mouth!

234
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,950
Yes, I sincerely apologize.

235
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,010
Under the cushion.

236
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,950
What's this doing here?

237
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,280
What the heck? You didn't even look properly.

238
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,130
Hey, you're f***ing unbelievable.

239
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,160
You better apologize.

240
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,560
Gomenasai*! Let it slide this once. 
  (Sorry in Japanese.) 

241
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,100
You're not upset, are you?

242
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,620
I'm not.

243
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,780
You could've just said Woo Bin was the last to leave.

244
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,980
It wasn't that hard.

245
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,400
Hey, she was scared by your gaze, you clear-eyed maniac.

246
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,090
And you? Are you sick?

247
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,350
Why the nurse's office?

248
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,500
I had a headache.

249
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,970
Are you okay?

250
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,270
 That was the first time anyone stepped up for me and helped me. 

251
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,050
Thanks for speaking up for me.

252
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,440
What did you say, Eun Joo?

253
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,540
Eun Joo.

254
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,890
 Eun Joo. Eun Joo? Eun Joo! 

255
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,720
Eun Joo?

256
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,470
Eun Joo!

257
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,190
An entire semester is almost over.

258
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,410
I'm...

259
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,780
Kim Ji Eun!

260
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,960
Kim Ji Eun! Kim Ji Eun!

261
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,380
How could he get my name wrong?

262
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,730
Did someone drop this?

263
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,770
It must be someone from our school.

264
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,180
Why do I feel so hungry? What's for lunch today?

265
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,990
   

266
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,530
- Water celery pork belly? 
 - Oh, that sounds good!

267
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,660
    
 - I hate water celery! 
 - Sounds so good!

268
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,100
Who likes water celery?

269
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,890
   

270
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,870
   

271
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:37,960
team credit

272
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,000
 I found an opportunity. 

273
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 My first and last chance to escape being an outsider and become an insider. 

274
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,900
♫  No turning back, timeout!  ♫

275
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,860
♫  Driving me crazy! Driving me crazy!  ♫

 - What full course? 
 - That's enough. 

280
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,280
 - It was beef broth. 
 - What are you saying? 

281
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,110
 Hey, you just bumped into her. You should apologize. 

282
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,790
 W-What? 

283
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,120
 Go on and do it. 

284
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,120
 - Sure. 
 - S-Sure. 

285
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,330
 Why'd he bump into me?
