1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,550
You!

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,010
I need you to like me starting today!

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,690
It's Confession Day soon.

4
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,550
Confess your love to me in front of everyone.

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,580
W-What do you mean by that?

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,990
 I didn't think I could do it on my own. 

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,420
 But maybe right now... 

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,130
I...

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,100
want to become popular.

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,110
What...

11
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,270
You want to become what?

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,170
If someone famous like you confessed your love to me publicly,

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,250
I'd become famous, too, I thought.

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,490
So, make me popular like you.

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,480
That's what I want.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,580
Are you crazy? I can't confess my love to you. It makes no sense.

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,250
Everyone thinks I'm an idol trainee.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,030
Maybe you could use that when you confess.

19
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,320
Maybe say, "I need to tell you this even if I debut."

20
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,910
Do you really want to go out with me?

21
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,130
Even so, starting off like this is a little...

22
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,700
Who suggested we go out?

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,660
I said I wanted to become popular.

24
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,460
How could I go out with you? I don't even like you.

25
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,190
What?

26
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,350
You keep saying "popular."

27
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,730
Why is that important, anyway?

28
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,180
Do you know what it's like to be an outsider?

29
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,180
I have no friends, I have no presence,

30
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,840
and I have no name, either.

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,180
And later on, it'd be like I never existed.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,400
No one will remember me.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,960
You'll never understand it.

34
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,270
I'm not threatening you. I'm begging you.

35
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,150
Help me just once. Please, please?

36
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,820
I'll make sure to keep your secret. Please?

37
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,150
Please?

38
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,590
♫  Driving me crazy! Driving me crazy!  ♫

39
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,260
♫  My strategy is just an excuse, want you, I want you  ♫

40
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,340
♫  Timeout! Timeout! Timeout! Timeout!  ♫

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,830
   

42
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,750
   

43
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,740
   

44
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,980
   

45
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:46,770


46
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,720
   

47
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,290
 Hey, Mo Bong, hurry. 

48
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,100
Geez, do I really have to? I don't want to.

49
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,180
Let's do it.

50
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,620
Practice first.

51
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,410
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

52
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,590
Ready, go.

53
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,350
 Shine Muscat! I'm shy! 

54
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,330
♫  I'm Muscat because I'm shy  ♫

55
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,780
- Oh, right. 
 - The cat.

56
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,810
Sorry.

57
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,370
- Start over. Start over. 
 - Start over. One more time.

58
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,860
 Shine Muscat! I'm shy! 

59
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,200
Oh, Kang Woo Bin! Come on!

60
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,970
Come on, I'm shooting a reel!

61
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,600
What's wrong with him?

62
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,990
Is something wrong?

63
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,570
Hey.

64
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,130
I'm sorry if I cut you off.

65
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,410
Do you have a moment?

66
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,400
Yeah, sure. L-Let's go.

67
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,510
Hey, aren't we doing it?

68
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,080
♫  Shine Muscat  ♫

69
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,640
Where are we?

70
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,180
Come in.

71
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,350
Thank you for accepting my suggestion.

72
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,500
You call that a suggestion? That was a threat.

73
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,690
Let's talk about everything here from now on.

74
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,840
Consider it a hideout.

75
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,580
Can we come in here so freely?

76
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,500
Yes, no one comes here.

77
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,690
You must come here often.

78
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,540
I come here whenever I'd rather be alone than be in the classroom.

79
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,780
Now, shall we talk about Confession Day?

80
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,890
Did you think of anything?

81
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,060
About what?

82
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,670
Right now,

83
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,720
I don't even know what's going on.

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,900
I do.

85
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,150
What is it?

86
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,160
"Heart-pounding..."

87
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,260
W-What's this now?

88
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,410
    
 The time slot to receive everyone's attention.

89
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,380
You'll confess your love to me before the first period starts.

90
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,580
   

91
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,770
 Kim Ji Eun! 

92
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,600
 Listen to me carefully starting now. 

93
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,110
   

94
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,440
 Kim Ji Eun! Kim Ji Eun! 

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,380
 Kim Ji Eun! Kim Ji Eun! 

96
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:07,270
 Kim Ji Eun! Kim Ji Eun! 

97
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,150
Are you out of your mind?

98
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,110
Hey, I'd rather die.

99
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,510
Why? Shouldn't we do at least that much so I could be popular?

100
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,410
No, I'll become an outsider, too.

101
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,410
Calm down first and—

102
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,970
This might be good, too.

103
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,820
 Oh, here. 

104
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,950
 I need something else. 

105
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,170
 What else do you need? 

106
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,470
 You. 

107
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,160
 What? 

108
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,620
 I want to count our days starting now. 

109
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,540
 This is our first day together, okay? 

110
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,560
 Gosh, I'm so flustered right now. 

111
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:26,770
 Kim Ji Eun! Kim Ji Eun! 

112
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,390
No way.

113
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,820
My name would be mentioned a lot on IT, right?

114
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,120
I'm sure it will. They'll say you're crazy.

115
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,470
Most importantly—

116
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,650
Or do you want to come out of the auditorium singing?

117
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,740
Right, you can't sing. How about lip syncing—

118
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,520
Listen to me, I said.

119
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,890
You should think carefully, too.

120
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,350
What?

121
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,550
Think about what the problem is

122
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,340
before you say you want to become an insider.

123
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,990
Anyway, I just need to confess publicly, right?

124
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,860
Yes. But can you come up with a better scenario than mine?

125
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,400
Are you kidding? Yours are so dated.

126
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,360
Don't yell at me.

127
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,010
You think so? I had butterflies when I read it in web novels.

128
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,930
Whatever. Just keep your secret.

129
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,660
This will be the end of it.

130
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,350
You'll delete the video immediately, too.

131
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,740
Yes, of course.

132
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,210
Once IT gets filled with my name,

133
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,740
our deal is done.

134
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,980
 Ha Yoo Jin, I'll tell you tomorrow, but I like you. Go out with me. 

135
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,570
 I'm so nervous. I'll just confess my love tomorrow. 

136
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,530
 How many couples will there be this time? 

137
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,360
 But I'll do it, too. 

138
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,930
 Who's Ha Yoo Jin? 

139
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,580
 Amazing. Is she the quiet one? 

140
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,530
I thought they didn't get along because he always picked on her.

141
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,170
Wow, he's confessing his love to her? Amazing.

142
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,550
I just need to do a good job on Confession Day.

143
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,920
But Kang Woo Bin will do a good job, right?

144
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,270
If he confesses his love to me, I'd be...

145
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,760
Gosh, seriously! What am I supposed to do?

146
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,340
I'll tell you officially.

147
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,100
 What? To me? 

148
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,450
From now on,

149
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,040
you're the only one in here.

150
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,280
 I understand how you feel. But... 

151
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,840
 sorry! 

152
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,290
♫  The moment I first saw you  ♫

153
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:32,820
♫  My eyes are blinded by the light, I feel like I'm dreaming  ♫

154
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,980
Gosh, seriously!

155
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,510
Do I have to do this?

156
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,250
If only she didn't have the video...

157
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,970
I like you? I like you.

158
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,500
Do I like you?

159
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,290
No.

160
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,670
I like you.

161
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,800
That was kind of nice.

162
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,330
Give me a break.

163
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,950
Hold on.

164
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,520
What if she actually falls for me?

165
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,400
That'd be kind of an issue.

166
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,590
I'll receive a love confession and boost my popularity, too.

167
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,460
 Lee Dong Min, the transfer student in Class No. 2. Does he have a girlfriend? 

168
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,440
 He's so freaking cute. 

169
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,520
 You think so, too? I do, too. 

170
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,090
 Should I just tell him tomorrow? 

171
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,670
 It'd be an assault if I did, right? 

172
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,320
 Lee Dong Min's features are more prominent than my future. 

173
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,330
"Freaking cute"?

174
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,730
Isn't Kang Woo Bin better looking?

175
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,560
He was mentioned within a week after he transferred.

176
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,940
He hasn't signed up yet?

177
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,220
He must not know he's popular, then.

178
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,290
So easy. So easy.

179
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,490
Some people get popular overnight.

180
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,370
If I had a chance, I'd immediately...

181
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,990
 You should think carefully, too. 

182
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,850
 What? 

183
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,550
 Think about what the problem is 

184
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,530
 before you say you want to become an insider. 

185
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:45,510
   

186
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,590
♫  You're in the raindrops at dawn  ♫

187
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:59,850
♫  I'm on my way to you without realizing  ♫

188
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,370
♫  Cold wind brushes against me  ♫

189
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:09,540
♫  My beating heart is filled with butterflies  ♫

190
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,970
♫  The stars are whispering tonight  ♫

191
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,580
 A couple was born in Class 3 this morning. 

192
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,970
 I got a message. He said he'd come to confess during lunch. 

193
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,600
 What do I do? 

194
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:30,020
♫  Just like the stars, you approached me  ♫

195
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:36,520
♫  I want to tell you this with my eyes closed  ♫

196
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,370
   

197
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,390
   

198
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,900
♫  A moment filled with excitement  ♫

199
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,100
 I've liked you since last year. 

200
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,830
 Can I confess my love? 

201
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,490
 I can't tell you who I am yet. 

202
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,670
 I just like you. 

203
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,900
♫  Let's look at each other and be together  ♫

204
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,060
♫  Close to you  ♫

205
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,940
 I should've told Kang Woo Bin to post it on IT first. 

206
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,660
 Can he do a good job? 

207
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,590
 It'd be pointless if he confessed without anyone knowing. 

208
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,380
Geez, what do I do? I'm screwed.

209
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,960
Please...

210
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,680
Thank goodness.

211
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,830
Don't you even see me?

212
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,780
I do. Why do you ask?

213
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,070
You bumped into me first.

214
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,430
Did I? I'm sorry.

215
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,010
I still have many payments to make for the phone.

216
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,800
I don't even have insurance for it.

217
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:58,220
What does that have to do with you apologizing?

218
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,000
Nothing. Sorry.

219
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,030
You didn't get hurt, right?

220
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,760
How come you haven't changed at all?

221
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,490
What?

222
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,660
You have a bad memory, too.

223
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,790
What do you mean?

224
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,010
Why does he look familiar?

225
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,470
It's amazing! You saw it, too. Right?

226
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,670
- Did you see it? 
 - See what?

227
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,510
Someone posted about liking me.

228
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,030
- What are you talking about? 
 - Don't you know?

229
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,740
Who... It was you, right?

230
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,200
 - It wasn't me.  
 - It was you!

231
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,280
 No, it wasn't. 

232
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,530
 Wasn't it you? You two are kind of close. 

233
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,600
- Kang Woo Bin. 
  - What are you saying? 

234
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,210
Did you see IT?

235
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,100
There were two couples, apparently.

236
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,190
I guess everyone is confessing their love.

237
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,500
I need to do it, too.

238
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,240
What?

239
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,560
What's wrong with you?

240
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,720
Oh, it was you.

241
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,980
You scared me.

242
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,880
Hey, are you okay?

243
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,810
Huh? Yes. I'm okay, Ji Eun.

244
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,000
What?

245
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,540
   

246
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,130
   

247
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:50,220
   

248
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,550
- Not satisfied? 
 - You're bad at aiming.

249
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,840
No wonder you have a bad aim in video games.

250
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,560
- Get me, get me. 
 - Are you finished?

251
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,210
Did he run away just like that?

252
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,230
That's why you can't aim in video games.

253
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,350
Are you kidding me?

254
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,840
What are you saying?

255
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,690
I got you earlier.

256
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,520
My gosh!

257
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,930
Guys.

258
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,010
So cold.

259
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,770
Are you okay?

260
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,740
What are you guys doing?

261
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,670
I-I really didn't see you.

262
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,750
I-I swear.

263
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,380
I'm sorry.

264
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,290
You're Kim Eun Ji, right?

265
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,590
I'm sorry.

266
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,720
Kim Ji Eun.

267
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,110
Yes.

268
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,720
It's Kim Ji Eun, I said. Remember it correctly.

269
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,110
Oh, okay. Kim Ji Eun.

270
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,980
By the way, have you two been close?

271
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,200
No, we aren't yet.

272
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,410
But I'd like to get close to her starting now.

273
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,170
I... like Kim Ji Eun.

274
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,940
Hey, he's confessing...

275
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,200
The Confession Day isn't over yet.

276
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,580
I like you, Kim Ji Eun.

277
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,400
K-Kim Ji Eun?

278
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,340
 It's Kim Ji Eun, I said. Remember it correctly. 

279
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,890
 I like you, Kim Ji Eun. 

280
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,860
 "Kim Ji Eun." 

281
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,840
 It's so weird he's calling me like that. 

282
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,540
- Kim Ji Eun. 
 - What's this now?

283
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,680
What happened to you?

284
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,420
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

285
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,330
How come you haven't changed? Kim Dud.

286
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,020
What?

287
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,070
I think I called you that then, too.

288
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,060
No.

289
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,320
Was it Kim Flop?

290
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,120
How do you know...

291
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
 Hey, Kim Dud. 

292
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,600
 We can play together. 

293
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,510
 What are you doing here alone? 

294
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,260
You...

295
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,220
You...

296
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,400
You turned out better than I expected.

297
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:18,130


298
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,030
♫  No turning back, timeout  ♫

299
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,760
♫  Driving me crazy! Driving me crazy!  ♫

300
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,400
♫  My strategy is just an excuse, want you, I want you  ♫

301
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,610
♫  Timeout! Timeout! Timeout! Timeout!  ♫

302
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:35,840
♫  There's nothing to hide, like this, timeout  ♫

303
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,770
♫  Timeout!  ♫

304
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,050
♫  Timeout!  ♫

305
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,460
♫  No turning back, timeout  ♫

306
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,750
♫  Driving me crazy!  ♫

307
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,670
   

308
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,100
Thank you.

309
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,980
How's the new school? It must be a lot to deal with.

310
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,740
It's okay.

311
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,470
Be careful not to start rumors.

312
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,310
You might have to transfer again if the debut schedule changes.

313
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,440
Can I not transfer?

314
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,690
What?

315
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,240
I want to graduate there.

316
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,870
Why?

317
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,760
Did you reunite with your first love or something?
