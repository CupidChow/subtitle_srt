1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,770
I...

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,100
actually got eliminated from the debut group.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,950
♫  No turning back, timeout  ♫

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,920
♫  Driving me crazy! Driving me crazy!  ♫

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,490
♫  My strategy is just an excuse, want you, I want you  ♫

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,600
♫  Timeout! Timeout! Timeout! Timeout!  ♫

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,170
   

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,050
   

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,010
   

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,040
&lt; 

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,030
   

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,970


13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,820
   

14
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,570
I need to let him know.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,610
But what do I tell him?

16
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,010
- Good job. 
 - Good job.

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,390
Good work!

18
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,670
Tired, right?

19
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,710
- No. 
 - Not at all.

20
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,130
Your schedule is finally out.

21
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,860
We're going to announce each member starting tomorrow.

22
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,510
Lee Dong Min, you're first.

23
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,260
Me?

24
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,370
Your peaceful school days will come to an end.

25
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,000
- Congratulations! 
 - You're finally debuting!

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,240
Congrats!

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,520
- Good job. 
 - Good work! You're almost there.

28
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,310
   

29
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,330
   

30
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,480
 Isn't it crazy? 

31
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,780
 Lee Dong Min's debuting? Is that for real? 

32
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,570
This is the biggest news!

33
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,560
Did anyone know about this?

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,660
Anyone? No one, right?

35
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,930
Oh, my gosh.

36
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,480
Lee Dong Min?

37
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,240
Oh? Yes, Kim Ji Eun!

38
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,790
Did you know about this? Huh?

39
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,640
Why is Lee Dong Min...

40
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,610
You knew about this?

41
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,420
Whoa, she didn't know, either. Crazy!

42
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,110
Wait, let me process this.

43
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,610
Whoa! There will be two 5th-generation idols born from our class!

44
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,510
Why are both of them not here?

45
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,790
So, that's how Lee Dong Min knew.

46
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,260
But honestly, what is Kang Woo Bin thinking?

47
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,430
Seol Hee.

48
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,490
Can you stop calling my name?

49
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,530
You've made my ears bleed since yesterday.

50
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,640
Please return the phone.

51
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,040
I won't use it again.

52
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,310
And by any chance...

53
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,570
Yes, I saw everything.

54
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,960
It's full of interesting things.

55
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,470
This is what you used to threaten Kang Woo Bin, right?

56
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,260
No wonder the confession felt so lame.

57
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,370
I thought it was so random.

58
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,190
You won't tell the other kids, right?

59
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,490
Kang Woo Bin had no ill intention. Rather—

60
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,810
I told you to stop being pretentious.

61
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,340
Huh?

62
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,260
 You remember the 3-minute tone-deaf guy video, right? 

63
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,040
 Do you know who that is? 

64
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,920
 Look forward to it. He deceived the entire school. 

65
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,460
I have the video here.

66
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,420
If I expose this, Kang Woo Bin's school life will be over.

67
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,730
Do you need to go this far?

68
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,550
It's Woo Bin! Apart from everything, he's your friend.

69
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,070
How f***ing annoying... hearing that from you.

70
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,540
What?

71
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,000
Just return to the way you used to be.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,810
Like you don't exist.

73
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,570
Hey, Min Seol Hee!

74
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,620
Sorry! Sorry, Seol Hee!

75
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,560
Who's the 3-minute tone-deaf guy?

76
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,930
Wait, what do we do about this dopamine thrill?

77
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,450
So, that means he deceived the entire school.

78
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,380
The person who announced this is truly a nutjob.

79
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,310
No!

80
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,780
Am I still invisible to you?

81
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,170
Lee Dong Min, you...

82
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,930
Kang Woo Bin?

83
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,690
Well, I guess...

84
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,930
it's just a matter of time.

85
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,140
I didn't know you were a trainee.

86
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,520
Of course, you didn't. I never told you.

87
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,370
You know, I think Kang Woo Bin will get seriously hurt.

88
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,290
The situation is really bad right now.

89
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:43,140
Like you said, he shouldn't just stay quiet.

90
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,500
I didn't mean Kang Woo Bin should step up.

91
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,020
What?

92
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,190
You like Kang Woo Bin.

93
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,460
No, that's...

94
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,970
because he's my friend.

95
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,200
Friend?

96
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,420
I don't think so.

97
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,480
Since I wasn't, either.

98
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,980
Lee Dong Min.

99
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:42,570
♫  In this moment, there's nothing there for me  ♫

100
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:49,210
♫  The moment I approach you  ♫

101
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,020
♫  I feel you here  ♫

102
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,020
♫  I picture you in my mind  ♫

103
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,190
♫  Every time I get close to you  ♫

104
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,860
♫  Just like that  ♫

105
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,350
   
   

106
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,960
 So when will he be revealed? 

107
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,560
   

108
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,950
   

109
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,070
What are you guys doing here?

110
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,790
Good thing you're here.

111
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,610
Kim Ji Eun.

112
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,200
Kim Ji Eun, are you okay?

113
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,270
You look pale.

114
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,430
You're one to talk. Are you okay?

115
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,960
So... do you know what she's like?

116
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,750
She's quite the spectacle.

117
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,380
What's with the atmosphere?

118
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,280
What's wrong?

119
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,310
Before that, Kang Woo Bin.

120
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,340
You heard about Lee Dong Min, right?

121
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,380
Yeah.

122
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,040
You have nothing to say to me?

123
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,390
- On IT, you're— 
 - Wait! Wait a minute.

124
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,390
I'll talk.

125
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,670
What's the matter with you two?

126
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,960
Did something happen?

127
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,550
Kang Woo Bin, did you see IT?

128
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,560
The post about the 3-minute tone-deaf guy.

129
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,530
Yeah, I did.

130
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,380
I can try to stop it somehow.

131
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,260
So, just say you got eliminated from the debut group, like I said.

132
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,800
How will you stop it?

133
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,480
I'm...

134
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,700
IT's administrator.

135
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
I can do anything with this.

136
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,070
Who wrote what, who sent what, and...

137
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,850
even who deleted what...

138
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,900
What do you...

139
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,000
Holy!

140
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,870
Hey, you!

141
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,400
This is all because of you, Kang Woo Bin.

142
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,210
Fine, I wrote that call-out post.

143
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,140
Because you're f***ing absurd.

144
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,240
I wanted to crush you.

145
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,370
How could you lie like that? Are you out of your mind?

146
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,580
Class prez...

147
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,440
I know what you're saying,

148
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,470
but can't you just protect Kang Woo Bin this once?

149
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,660
I don't think exposing him like this is right.

150
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,200
Like hell you can protect him!

151
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,870
You used that to do weird shit.

152
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,070
It wasn't necessarily like that.

153
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,680
Ji Eun.

154
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,060
I'm the worst, aren't I?

155
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,880
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,600
I was going to upload it anyway.

157
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,730
Kang Woo Bin!

158
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,480
 "I actually got eliminated from the debut group." 

159
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,840
 Is what I was going to say. 

160
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,490
 Since that would fix everything. 

161
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,400
But guys,

162
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,330
I can't get eliminated.

163
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,280
Because...

164
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,740
I was never a trainee, to begin with.

165
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,940
 I...can't sing. 
   
   

166
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,450
 I'm tone deaf. 

167
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,390
 The 3-minute tone-deaf guy. 

168
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,270
 You all know him, right? 

169
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,760
I'm really sorry.

170
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,310
 To everyone. 

171
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,390
You're really the worst.

172
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,760
You do whatever you want to the end.

173
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,250
You don't care about me at all.

174
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,890
The fact that you've been lying all this time?

175
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,800
Yeah, that pisses me off! But what pisses me off more...

176
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,450
is that Kim Ji Eun knew that you and I...

177
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,070
couldn't even talk about stuff like that.

178
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,220
- That's... 
 - Shut up.

179
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,970
Hey, Class prez!

180
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,840
♫  My entire body froze  ♫

181
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,000
♫  I waited every day for today, hello  ♫

182
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,160
Are you crazy? What do you plan to do?

183
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,360
I actually feel relieved.

184
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,730
I really could've stopped it somehow!

185
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,450
Why did you do this? The comments are...

186
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,780
♫  I burst into tears with you standing in front of me  ♫

187
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,510
It's all right.

188
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,780
Really.

189
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:07,370
♫  That I've missed you, that I've longed for you  ♫

190
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,990
♫  I couldn't even tell you anything, but hello  ♫

191
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,630
I know how to erase this. Hold on. 
    

192
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,870
It's okay.

193
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,450
Crazy conning bastard.

194
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,460
I want to vomit. That's f***ing fraud.

195
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,600
What's wrong with you?

196
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,760
H-Hey, throwing trash is too harsh!

197
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,920
 - Guys, stop it! 
 - I'm just throwing it in the trash. 

198
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,240
 That's enough, guys! Stop it! 

199
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,890
 Look at you running your mouth. 

200
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,610
 Hey, your mouth is the real trash! 

201
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,000
Hey, Kang Woo Bin.

202
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,210
Let's go to the snack bar.

203
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,360
Snack bar?

204
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,640
I really need to follow a diet regimen now.

205
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,340
You should treat me to my last supper.

206
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,050
Are you mugging me?

207
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,480
Forget it if you don't want to.

208
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,170
Better for me if I go with Kim Ji Eun.

209
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,180
I'm going, I'm going. I'll treat you.

210
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,600
 With that, I hope you spend a meaningful vacation, 

211
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,610
 and return to school in good health. 

212
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,860
 Now, we will start the awards ceremony 

213
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,220
 for the second Gaeon High School Reels Competition. 

214
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,190
 The winner is... 

215
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,280
 Kang Woo Bin. 

216
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,990
 Please come forward. 

217
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,960
 If it was going to end up like this... 

218
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,030
Shit. It's wrong to have him win just because he had the most views.

219
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,660
 This award is being presented because he received 

220
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,500
 the highest number of views and likes in the 

221
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,440
 second Gaeon High School Reels Competition 

222
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,380
 held on the community app, Insider Time. 

223
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,750
 Finally, a word from the winner. 

224
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,170
 I know a speech is supposed to be formal. 

225
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,410
But rather than a speech,

226
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,820
I'd like to say this to my friends, so I'll speak casually.

227
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,540
First off, I'm sorry, everyone.

228
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,610
Hey, just turn off the TV!

229
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,470
- Why bother listening to that bastard? 
 - Turn it off.

230
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,120
- Yes, just turn it off. 
 - Just turn it off.

231
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,140
No!

232
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,930
Let's just watch, please. Okay?

233
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,580
As you all know,

234
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,300
I'm a fraud.

235
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,180
 You're the 3-minute tone-deaf guy. Right? 

236
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,150
 Getting attention didn't feel too bad. 

237
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,730
 But how are you a trainee— 

238
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,700
 I... like Kim Ji Eun. 

239
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,130
 I was having fun for a moment, but so much time passed. 

240
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,830
 If it wasn't for somebody, even more time would've passed. 

241
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,250
 The Confession Day isn't over yet. 

242
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,510
 I like you, Kim Ji Eun. 

243
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,870
 I tried not to get caught at first, no matter what. 

244
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,360
 What about you? 

245
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,720
 I thought that was the way to protect myself. 

246
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,540
 But in reality, 

247
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,830
 I completely failed to protect my friends who were on my side. 

248
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,320
 I couldn't do anything for them. 

249
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,880
 I didn't have the courage to be honest. 

250
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,250
And I ended up getting the courage...

251
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,140
from the person I least expected.

252
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,470
 I'm... IT's Administrator. 

253
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,430
 I want to be totally honest now. 

254
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,520
 Popularity and attention... 

255
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,620
Someone who can treat...

256
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,920
everyone sincerely, even without those things.

257
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,430
Because I want to become someone like that,

258
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,270
though it's much too late,

259
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,660
let me tell you before it's even later.

260
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,350
I'm really...

261
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,530
I'm really sorry for everything.

262
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,710
That's all.

263
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,060
Hey, Mo Bong.

264
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,080
Did you cry?

265
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,450
What about you?

266
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,200
Aren't you even mad at Kang Woo Bin?

267
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,300
Aren't you pissed off that your friend did that?

268
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,550
Because we're friends.

269
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,130
Because we're friends, just as you said.

270
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:46,440
So, I can ask him why he did that and hear him out.

271
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,860
Also, everyone has a lie or two buried in their hearts.

272
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,970
I'm sure you're the same!

273
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,920
Just let me catch you just once.

274
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,720
Forget it.

275
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,470
Hurry up and come so we can go and get some malatang.

276
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,480
Why the long face?

277
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,450
You should just curse me out.

278
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,600
Why would I curse you out?

279
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,150
I can't complain even if you were to cut ties with me.

280
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,930
I'm sorry.

281
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,520
Son of a bitch.

282
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,880
You're really a f***ing asshole!

283
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,160
Do you know that, you maniac?

284
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,520
You're good at cursing.

285
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,820
Aren't you sick of me?

286
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,450
I sniped you on Insider Time.

287
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,540
I don't have the right to.

288
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,390
I mistreated a friend who trusted me for eight years.

289
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,320
I'm sorry.

290
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,360
I shouldn't have done that, either.

291
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,370
You didn't do anything wrong.

292
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,660
I mean it.

293
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:31,170
♫  I'm waiting alone for you, missing you  ♫

294
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:41,630
♫  Tonight, I'm under the starlight that used to embrace the darkness  ♫

295
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,680
This was exactly the spot.

296
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,910
Take care.

297
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,290
   

298
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,400
Kang Woo Bin, where are you?

299
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,240
Yes.

300
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,290
Why are you running?

301
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,910
You did a great job, really.

302
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,220
T-Thank you.

303
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,760
One moment, though.

304
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:12,010
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

305
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,010
I just thought you went through a lot.

306
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,780
I'm sorry if I offended you.

307
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,190
No, I liked it.

308
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,880
That's not what I mean... You know...

309
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,970
What I'm trying to say is—

310
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,600
Shall we sit?

311
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,900
♫  Love is sweet  ♫

312
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,270
I didn't expect you to take it head-on like that.

313
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,380
You were great.

314
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,110
Not at all.

315
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,040
I'm also going to do it with my own strength.

316
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,650
Of course, it'll be difficult.

317
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,780
But I learned a lot from you.

318
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,280
You didn't learn anything.

319
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,890
You say I gave you insider lessons,

320
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,850
but I don't think I taught you.

321
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,560
Because I learned more from you.

322
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,470
From me?

323
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,440
No way.

324
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,820
We should...

325
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,460
continue doing this.

326
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,780
No, we don't need to do it anymore.

327
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,260
You don't need to cater to me.

328
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,510
But I want to continue.

329
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:58,630
Kang Woo Bin... you know...

330
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,360
- I actually— 
 - I like you.

331
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,660
I mean it.

332
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,710
Right now,

333
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,670
I like you a lot, Ji Eun.

334
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,230
♫  Love or dream, they're things I muttered  ♫

335
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:50,120
♫  Once tomorrow comes again, I'll try to breathe again  ♫

336
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,870
♫  Just like dreamy flowers that bloom out of my reach  ♫

337
00:27:54,870 --> 00:28:01,740
♫  Tomorrow will come for sure because time isn't lazy  ♫

338
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:10,110
final credits

339
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:15,110

341
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,330
What did you have for breakfast?

342
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,440
Breakfast? I had cereal.

343
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,560
Cereal? I told you to eat healthy.

344
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,880
Did you have breakfast?

345
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,730
No, I slept in as usual.

346
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,130
Hey, what are you two doing?

347
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,000
Come on. Give it a rest.

348
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,790
You happy?

349
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,940
Gosh, it's hot.

350
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,640
Back to school is annoying enough, and I have to see this, too?

351
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,040
Ji Eun, hit me up if you get in a fight with Kang Woo Bin.

352
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,320
I'll tell you all about his cringe-worthy past.

353
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,720
Really? What's in store?

354
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,730
Hey, that's not right!

355
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,600
- Do I have a cringeworthy past? 
 - It's too hot.

356
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,770
How have you been?

357
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,810
Whoa, you managed to come when you said you were busy, Idol.

358
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,700
You're right.

359
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,730
So, I can't play with you anymore. You know, right?

360
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,840
Whatever.

361
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,620
Hey, you look great.

362
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,430
You'll make it to be a sixth, seventh, and even 10th generation idol.

363
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,090
I guarantee you.

364
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,200
Hey, you're not dissing me, right?

365
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,780
- Diss? 
 - Woo Bin.

366
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,470
That's not how that works.

367
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,800
- You think it's like a level? 
  - Insider. 

368
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,010
 Someone with lots of friends and 

369
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,840
 gets attention from everywhere, playing an important role. 

370
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,470
 That's the definition of insider I knew. 

371
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,530
Hey, forget it. Let's hurry up and go.

372
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,800
We'll be tardy on our first day. Hurry up.

373
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,980
 But it means something different to me now. 

374
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,680
 Someone I can share my time and feelings with. 

375
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,590
 When you can accept each other just as you are. 

376
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,890
 That's more than enough. 

377
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:13,500
- It's like that. Isn't it? 
 - Right, right.
