1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:09,960


2
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,500
 I never intended to lie. 

3
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,430
Is he really debuting?

4
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,150
That's what I heard. It's still hard to believe.

5
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,300
A trainee at our school?

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,290
 I just never denied it. 

7
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,280
 That's how I became the center of attention. 

8
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,570
 I saw God-tier Woo Bin today. 

9
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,430
 He's better looking in person. 

10
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,230
 Woo Bin's so nice. 

11
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,460
 Hurry and debut! I'm rooting for you. 

12
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,960
 The top three rude remarks our school students are surprisingly unaware of. 

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,670
 "Doing well?" Do you think I am when Kang Woo Bin isn't next to me? 

14
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,800
 "Did you eat?" Do you think I can eat when Kang Woo Bin isn't next to me? 

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,740
 "Take care." Do you think I can take care when Kang Woo Bin isn't next to me? 

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,770
 By the time I was more accustomed to the pros than the cons of this life, 

17
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,750
 too much time had already passed. 

18
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,110
♫  No turning back, timeout  ♫

19
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,080
♫  Driving me crazy! Driving me crazy!  ♫

20
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,460
♫  My strategy is just an excuse, want you, I want you  ♫

21
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,630
♫  Timeout! Timeout! Timeout! Timeout!  ♫

22
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,130
   

23
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,030
   

24
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,070
   

25
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,010
   

26
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,000
   

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,620
How long will you keep this up? You fake trainee.

28
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,470
What did you just say?

29
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,760
It's a lie. You being a trainee.

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,780
That's out of the blue...

31
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,450
How did you know?

32
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,450
Is that important?

33
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,210
How long did you think you could hide it?

34
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,380
I'll take care of it.

35
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,030
Is lying for an entire year your idea of taking care of it?

36
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,490
F***! Let go of me!

37
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,610
Who are you to play around with her?

38
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,470
She's a real dud who doesn't know how to filter garbage like you!

39
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,480
Are you talking about Kim Ji Eun?

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,810
Did Kim Ji Eun tell you?

41
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,910
- What bullshit— 
 - This is my business!

42
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,750
I know what I'm doing.

43
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,840
But it's up to you if you want to expose me.

44
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,770
And add the last touch...

45
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,590
This is it. This is it!

46
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,410
It's so good! This place is amazing.

47
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,990
You've never been here before?

48
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,920
This place is a must-visit if you're from our school.

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,090
This is really your first time here?

50
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,820
Yeah, I don't usually eat out.

51
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,670
Since people come with their friends after all...

52
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,290
You didn't want to eat alone, huh?

53
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,700
Huh? Yeah, you're right.

54
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,240
I need to take this call.

55
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,710
What? You can just answer it here.

56
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,460
Hey, take your time!

57
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,300
Don't finish it.

58
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,960
Don't tell me...

59
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,230
I-It's nothing.

60
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,750
That's hot!

61
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,210
You like it?

62
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,060
What?

63
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,460
I'm asking you since Mo Bong isn't here.

64
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,000
How will you respond to Kang Woo Bin's confession?

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,520
Be honest between us. Okay?

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,020
Oh, that?

67
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,610
Like I said earlier, I'm still thinking about it.

68
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,820
What's there to think about? Someone like you.

69
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,870
I'm sure you're not quibbling over details about Woo Bin.

70
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,910
I'm just really curious.

71
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,780
I'm very close to Woo Bin, but I had no idea.

72
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,210
Well, you see...

73
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,290
What the heck? Where are you going?

74
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,150
Something urgent came up, so I'm leaving first.

75
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,940
What was the call about?

76
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,470
I'm going! Enjoy the rest.

77
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,110
Bye!

78
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,120
Yeah?

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,770
We were in the middle of a conversation. You didn't answer—

80
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,400
I...

81
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,610
I need the restroom.

82
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,170
This is all you have?

83
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,480
I went through trouble to get that.

84
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,430
You really are a loser, huh?

85
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,710
You can't even land some cigarettes?

86
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:30,420
You shouldn't go around lying about your "golden" middle school days, then.

87
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,770
I heard you were my boyfriend's obedient dog, always at his beck and call.

88
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,950
Woof, woof! Dog.

89
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,030
That was quite the identity change.

90
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,740
Just let it slide.

91
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,230
Not without a price.

92
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,860
From now on, you better run over when I call you.

93
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,380
Answer me.

94
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,190
All right.

95
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,700
 That's not right! 

96
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,140
I-Isn't that too cruel?

97
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,010
It's not like he did anything wrong in middle school.

98
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,850
Who the hell is she?

99
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,080
A friend?

100
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,200
How admirable of two losers.

101
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,050
You better behave.

102
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,090
My boyfriend is just waiting for you to slip.

103
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,290
Are you okay?

104
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,400
You didn't do anything wrong. So, you don't have to go along—

105
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,230
Who said you could follow me?

106
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,540
Huh?

107
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,090
Why the f*** are you meddling?

108
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,920
 Everyone has a secret they want to hide. 

109
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,210
 And just because I know their secret 

110
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,930
 doesn't mean I can easily approach that person. 

111
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,900
 Where are you? Is something wrong? 

112
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,400
 I have something to ask you. This never happened to me before. 

113
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,040
 Didn't we agree to meet before class? 

114
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,550
 I'm in the club room. 

115
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,890
Did something happen to him?

116
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,510
Bong Gu...

117
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,350
Kang Woo Bin!

118
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,140
Kang Woo Bin, where were you?

119
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,080
Why didn't you reply?

120
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,140
What's going on?

121
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,490
Woo Bin! I have to tell you something.

122
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,110
Woo Bin!

123
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,260
It was helpful. Thank you!

124
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,420
Gosh. Keep it charged!

125
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,350
All right.

126
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,490
Oh, what's for PE today?

127
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,090
I'll ask the PE teacher.

128
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,780
Okay!

129
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,140
Is something wrong?

130
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,450
By chance, are you mad at me...

131
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,600
Could we talk?

132
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,830
Hey, Mo Bong. Want to hit the gaming cafe today?

133
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,870
Oh, sure!

134
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,770
What the? Is something wrong?

135
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,350
Ji Eun!

136
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,760
Will you keep standing there?

137
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,910
You're in the way.

138
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,910
Man, I don't want to! I always lose with you.

139
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,570
Hey, what do you mean?

140
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,570
Don't you remember me hard carrying last time?

141
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,440
Not at all.

142
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,610
 Geez, after all I did, huh? 

143
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,490
- Then, let's make a bet today. 
 - Ramen?

144
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,720
You memory manipulator.

145
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,650
- Ramen? 
 - Fine!

146
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,600
Okay! Can't believe...

147
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,250
What? What do you have to tell me?

148
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,630
Are you really a dud?

149
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,460
You dragged me here to ask that?

150
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,230
I really want to mind my own business.

151
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,150
I need to keep a low profile.

152
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,600
But you keep doing this!

153
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,240
Do what?

154
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,650
Why are you hanging around Kang Woo Bin?

155
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,270
Because he's an insider? Because he's handsome?

156
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,670
I don't know about "handsome."

157
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,180
Or is it...

158
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,590
because he's an idol trainee?

159
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,250
Are you really an idiot?

160
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,790
And why are you mad?

161
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,670
You keep making me worry!

162
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,010
I mean...

163
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,370
Kang Woo Bin... and Oh Bong Gu, too.

164
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,840
What did I do so wrong?

165
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,410
What on earth did I do?

166
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,000
Kang Woo Bin won't even answer me.

167
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,540
What am I supposed to do?

168
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,570
He's a nobody.

169
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,710
I'm going to go.

170
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,730
Stay here.

171
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,320
 When will Kang Woo Bin debut? 

172
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,510
 It's so quiet. 

173
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,660
 You're right. 

174
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,680
 He does seem quite relaxed for a trainee. 

175
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,150
 Have you been a trainee? 

176
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,340
 Keep your mouth shut if you're clueless. 

177
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,690
 I told you. 

178
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,230
♫  I picture you in my mind  ♫

179
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,580
I don't know why you're acting like this all of a sudden.

180
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,960
What am I supposed to do?

181
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,850
Just stay here.

182
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,530
The Kang Woo Bin I know wouldn't treat me like this for no reason.

183
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,880
How much do you actually know about that bastard?

184
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,850
No, it's not just you.

185
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,290
Everyone at this school is being deceived.

186
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,890
Deceived?

187
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,940
Wait, do you...

188
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,730
Are you...

189
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,560
aware he's not a trainee?

190
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,830
What? W-What are you saying?

191
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,800
I don't know.

192
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,650
You really knew.

193
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,330
So, did you go along even knowing that?

194
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,130
Did you tell the other kids?

195
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,630
Honestly... What are you thinking, huh?

196
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,240
Don't tell the other kids!

197
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,840
He must've had his own circumstances!

198
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,790
Do you... like him?

199
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,730
It's not like that! We're...

200
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,340
just friends.

201
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,930
You really don't?

202
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,140
Do I not have to worry?

203
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,460
Yes, it's not like that.

204
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,570
But why do you care so much about me?

205
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,880
You're just trying to mess with me, aren't you?

206
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,980
You were the same back then.

207
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,530
I've changed a lot since then!

208
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,380
No.

209
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,380
You're the same oblivious girl.

210
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,840
Forget it.

211
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,210
Why do I even try with you?

212
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,210
Then, do you know?

213
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,550
Why Kang Woo Bin is treating me like this?

214
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,190
Why do you think?

215
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,170
He probably thinks you told me what I know.

216
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,140
He thinks I told you?

217
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,620
Please don't make me worry. Okay?

218
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,520
 The call is not going through. 

219
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,460
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

220
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,920
   

221
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,290
It's a misunderstanding.

222
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,040
Mo Bong Gu, too. What's with everyone?

223
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,550
 I'll expose a big fiasco soon. 

224
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,230
 There's a crazy bastard who's deceiving the kids at our school. 

225
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,060
 Everything out of his mouth is lies. 

226
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,340
 But everyone falls for it and treats him like an insider. 

227
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,170
What's wrong with her?

228
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,570
Who doesn't have a secret?

229
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,600
   

230
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,580
   

231
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,040
K-Kang Woo Bin!

232
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,880
Kang Woo Bin.

233
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,590
Please hear me out.

234
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,900
I know what you're thinking, but that's a misunderstanding.

235
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,370
There's something I need to do.

236
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,900
I'll explain everything.

237
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,700
It's not what you're thinking. Really!

238
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Are you kidding me?

239
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,510
I saw everything.

240
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,420
Saw what?

241
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,930
Mo Bong, are you dating these days?

242
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,730
There are no secrets with us, right?

243
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,300
Don't you think so? He's being suspicious.

244
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,170
Kang Woo Bin!

245
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,980
Hey, I'm leaving first. I need to stop by somewhere.

246
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,850
What's wrong with him?

247
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,040
You can go ahead.

248
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,270
Am I invisible or something?

249
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,660
Do you think we're f***ing kidding?

250
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,560
I heard you're being disobedient to Hyeon Ji, you f***ing loser.

251
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,370
When? I did everything she asked for.

252
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,780
He's such a loser!

253
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,960
Bong Gu.

254
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,030
Bong Gu?

255
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,170
You'll forever be a f***ing loser to us.

256
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,610
Got it?

257
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,640
F***.

258
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,640
You're really acting the f*** up.

259
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,870
If you had only apologized to my Hyeon ji,

260
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,090
we wouldn't be here right now.

261
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,030
Clench your jaws.

262
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,620
Why is the sound on?

263
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,480
Hey, what the hell?

264
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,820
- Huh? She's... 
 - Hey! I didn't take anything.

265
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,750
I was just passing by!

266
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,670
Bye now!

267
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,690
You're really mean.

268
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,170
What?

269
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,020
Go check her phone. What if she took our photo?

270
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,600
Sure! I'll show you!

271
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,240
Take a look.

272
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,230
 Gosh, wasn't it hot? 

273
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,160
 It wasn't that hot. 

274
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,550
 You're so cute. 

275
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,240
 - So cute. 
 - No, you are. 

276
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,020
   

277
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,250
   

278
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,310
What's that?

279
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,790
You! Shit, you—

280
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,560
She has a ton of boyfriends!

281
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,530
I think you're her fourth!

282
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,720
You crazy bitch!

283
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,900
Hey, are you nuts?

284
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,160
Digging into people? That's a crime!

285
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,520
Hey! Let go of me!

286
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,590
How about you?

287
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,590
What you did to Mo Bong Gu is fine?

288
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,900
How's that different?

289
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,230
I'm... I'm going to kill you, crazy bitch!

290
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,880
F***ing bitch! Were you toying with me?

291
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,800
I'm still recording!

292
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,720
Even so! You shouldn't hit her!

293
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,940
Who the hell are you?

294
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,360
You're really embarrassing me.

295
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,760
You think I can't hit a girl?

296
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,970
Are you okay?

297
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,490
Mo Bong Gu.

298
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,340
Woo Bin!

299
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,290
It's hot! Get off me!

300
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,510
Are you okay?

301
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,970
Kang Woo Bin, how did you find us here?

302
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,250
Are you okay?

303
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,020
Woo Bin! It was a misunderstanding.

304
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,840
I never told anyone about you. I swear!

305
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,320
It's understandable you'd think that.

306
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,430
If that's the case, then I'm sorry! But I really...

307
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,230
I'm telling the truth.

308
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,790
How could I do that to you?

309
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,800
It's all right.

310
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,880
   
   

311
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,010
Hi, Kim Ji Eun!

312
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:58,290
♫  I find you before I look for an umbrella on a rainy day  ♫

313
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:05,230
♫  I worry if your wet clothes make you cold  ♫

314
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,600
 The three letters of my name appeared for the first time. 

315
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,730
 Not a pronoun or any related words. 

316
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,790
 My three-lettered name. 

317
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,110
 Kim Ji Eun. 

318
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,500
♫  Shine, you're my dream come true  ♫

319
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:29,030
♫  You're the light I look at, when I'm with you  ♫

320
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,160
Oh, you're here. Have a seat.

321
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,230
I wondered if you'd come today.

322
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,090
Thank you.

323
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,420
It's nothing. We agreed to meet at this time.

324
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,360
Did you see IT?

325
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,980
It feels weird.

326
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,150
Isn't this your first time being mentioned on IT?

327
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,860
Yeah.

328
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,510
It clearly read Kim Ji Eun.

329
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,570
You're not that kind of person.

330
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,570
I misunderstood you.

331
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,090
You treat your friends more sincerely than anyone.

332
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,460
 What you did to Mo Bong Gu is fine? 

333
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,450
 How's that different? 

334
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,760
But as you know, I'm not.

335
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,790
I was pathetic.

336
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,380
In fact, I'm the bad one for deceiving everyone.

337
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,400
You're not.

338
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,760
Then, can we get along again?

339
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,760
I had a really hard time

340
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,440
because you kept avoiding me.

341
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,130
Me, too.

342
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,040
It was hard avoiding you.

343
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,380
I had a really hard time.

344
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,650
Remember you told me to think about the

345
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,530
real reason I couldn't become an insider?

346
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,650
I realized it this time.

347
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:10,570
In situations like this, I'm very awkward.

348
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,390
I'm going to learn properly.

349
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:26,100
If becoming an insider means knowing how to get along with your friends,

350
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,910
can you continue to teach me?

351
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,430
 I'm doomed. 

352
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,390
Sure! I-I'll teach you.

353
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,170
 Kim Ji Eun! 

354
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,820
Lee Dong Min?

355
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,820
I'll teach you. How to become an insider or whatever.

356
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:15,970


357
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,020
   

358
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,980
 What does he know? 

359
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,720
 I'm going to go. 

360
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:33,910
♫  When I am down, I see you everywhere  ♫

361
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,120
 Stay here. 

362
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:42,260
♫  In this moment, there is nothing left for me  ♫

363
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,470
♫  Approaching you...  ♫
