Let's just stop here.

You and I both.

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,420
Sorry for throwing this on you.

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,600
I'll get going.

28
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,680
 Why are you suddenly acting like this? 

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,400
♫  Goodbye  ♫

30
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,160
 Is it because of Lee Dong Min? 

31
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,290
 I really hate kids like you. 

32
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,860
 What? 

33
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,590
 You were really nothing at all. 

34
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,740
 You were just... 

35
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,730
 nothing at all. 

36
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,600
I shouldn't have tried to do anything.

37
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,960
I should've just stayed put.

38
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,530
I shouldn't have asked Kang Woo Bin from the start.

39
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,750
 Can you meet me right now? 

40
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,650
Why are you sulking so early in the morning?

41
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,680
What is it?

42
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,510
Do you see him?

43
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,910
- He's handsome AF! 
 - His face is freaking tiny.

44
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,340
I thought he was an idol!

45
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,630
Hey, what are you waiting for? Ask him for his number!

46
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,120
You ask him!

47
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,830
Your food's here.

48
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,550
Thank you.

49
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,150
Stop crying and eat.

50
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,910
You don't like ketchup.

51
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,410
I don't have an appetite.

52
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,590
You should still eat.

53
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,470
I'm not hungry!

54
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,610
Well...

55
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,620
I said I'm fine, so why...

56
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,850
Why aren't you eating?

57
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,340
- I have a shoot tomorrow. 
 - Huh?

58
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,400
Eat up.

59
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,330
Lee Dong Min, were we 10 years old when we met?

60
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,480
Like you said,

61
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,650
you know me well since you've seen me for a long time.

62
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,120
I was a dud, like you said, and I couldn't get along with the other kids.

63
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,040
What about that?

64
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,790
I didn't want to be like that anymore,

65
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,040
so I really tried my best.

66
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,510
Insider...

67
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,940
Sure. I wanted to become an insider getting attention,

68
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,130
so I did a lot of things I usually wouldn't do.

69
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,000
But without even realizing it,

70
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,400
I hurt someone and caused them harm.

71
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,690
Maybe it's better for me to stay put.

72
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,620
If I stay put...

73
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,750
If I stay a dud,

74
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,380
nothing bad will happen.

75
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,630
What is it now?

76
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,670
You scared me!

77
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,060
Why are you angry?

78
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,280
Don't you know?

79
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,440
You're really...

80
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,500
I told you, didn't I? Not to worry me.

81
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,370
But...

82
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,730
Forget it!

83
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,530
I shouldn't have told you anything!

84
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,430
I'm leaving.

85
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,030
What?

86
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,910
Follow me.

87
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,390
♫  When I am down, I see you everywhere  ♫

88
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,980
Why did you suddenly bring me here?

89
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,420
What are we doing here?

90
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,030
Isn't this your personal seat?

91
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,170
What are you saying?

92
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,090
Look at yourself.

93
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,760
You were like that back then, too.

94
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,790
Hey, Lee Dong Min.

95
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,830
I'm sorry, but I'm in a terrible mood today.

96
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,290
You said you had something to tell me.

97
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,420
I'm leaving if you don't.

98
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,090
When you were like that...

99
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,120
♫  ...remain in my dream  ♫

100
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,610
♫  When you are close to me and I feel you  ♫

101
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,670
♫  Just hear my voice, now you listen to me here  ♫

102
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,470
 You always caught my attention since then. 

103
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,660
"Why is she sitting there like that?"

104
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,820
You got under my skin.

105
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,210
Nothing bad will happen,

106
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,620
but will you really do nothing?

107
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,280
If you keep acting like that, it makes me want to stay by your side.

108
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,490
So, please, you dud!

109
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,560
That won't do.

110
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,720
I won't be a dud.

111
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,160
I won't be a dud from now on!

112
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,880
Look at you!

113
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:09,680
♫  You're forever, I can feel you over here  ♫

114
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,250
Is it good?

115
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,470
I'm replenishing my sugar level.

116
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,850
Aren't you eating?

117
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,400
Yeah, I'll get fat.

118
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,040
What the heck? Are you on a diet?

119
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,480
Are you really an idol or something?

120
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,700
- You eat your fill. 
 - Okay.

121
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,450
Anyway, I'm going to do something.

122
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,080
Since it ended up like this, I shouldn't have said that to Kang Woo Bin.

123
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,710
He was probably taken aback.

124
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,850
Kang Woo Bin really helped me out.

125
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,440
- But I treated Kang Woo Bin— 
 - Kang Woo Bin, this! Kang Woo Bin, that!

126
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,200
Is he the only thing you can talk about?

127
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,520
No, that's not it! I really owe him—

128
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,380
Geez, Uncle. What is it now?

129
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,870
Where are you, Uncle?

130
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,110
Is this all I have to do?

131
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,540
It's hot. Give me some space.

132
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,490
Just walk ahead. Or just leave.

133
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,420
Why should I leave? I met her first.

134
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,270
Kang Woo Bin, I have something to tell you.

135
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,980
Sorry, it'll only take a moment.

136
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,450
What?

137
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,050
Yes.

138
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,260
Right now?

139
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,450
Something's wrong, isn't it?

140
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,810
I was more curious about that than anything.

141
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,030
What exactly is going on?

142
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,330
What I told you was a bit abrupt, but I meant it.

143
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,200
But after some thought,

144
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,820
I don't think we need to reveal everything.

145
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,120
You can just say you got dropped from the debut team.

146
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,380
That solves everything.

147
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,150
You... want me to lie again?

148
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,360
It's not for you, but it's for your friends.

149
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,930
We just need to set things straight. That we were never anything, to begin with.

150
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,800
Are you drawing a line?

151
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,010
Is that necessary after all this time?

152
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,660
You're really not going to tell me what's wrong?

153
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,860
There are things that don't need to be said.

154
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,140
Just like your secret.

155
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,650
I would...

156
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,470
just like for you to do as I said.

157
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,820
    
 - Holy cow.

158
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,070
    
 Did you all see this?

159
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,430
- Whoa. 
 - This is crazy!

160
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,780
They must be debuting.

161
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,470
- That's crazy. 
 - It's about time.

162
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,190
- Isn't that insane? 
 - Wow.

163
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,130
He's in our class.

164
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,150
Is Kang Woo Bin going to debut?

165
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,370
We'll be friends with an idol?

166
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,110
- That's sweet! 
 - What's this?

167
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,980
- That's insane! 
 - Kang Woo Bin must be debuting!

168
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,460
- Finally! 
 - This is his group, right?

169
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,630
Kang Woo Bin will dominate the music industry once he debuts.

170
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,960
Right? Right?

171
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,290
 This is Kang Woo Bin's group, right? 

172
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,020
 Kang Woo Bin said he's in the debut group. Amazing. 

173
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,580
 But why was it so quiet? 

174
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,950
 He should be really busy, but it didn't show. 

175
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,700
Make it quick. What do you have to tell me?

176
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,380
Well, you see...

177
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,540
You asked me that time at the malatang restaurant, right?

178
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,750
What I plan to do with Kang Woo Bin's confession.

179
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,510
Honestly, we're not even like that.

180
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,650
Rather than rejecting him or not, to be honest—

181
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,120
Yeah?

182
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,710
You're f***ing pretentious.

183
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,650
You think you're special?

184
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,600
No, since you asked me that time...

185
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,240
So, why are you telling me this now?

186
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,780
What does your relationship with him have to do with me?

187
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,250
Do I look like a joke to you...

188
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,970
because I collapsed after taking those pills?

189
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,010
And why do you keep acting like we're friends?

190
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,980
Don't cross the line.

191
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,880
Sorry. I just...

192
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,150
Who are you to accept or reject Kang Woo Bin?

193
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,050
How obnoxious.

194
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,290
How did she know?

195
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,450
 She likes Kang Woo Bin? 

196
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,800
- Gosh, he's so handsome! 
 - Did you watch the teaser?

197
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,160
- Of course, I did. 
 - Why didn't you tell me?

198
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,330
Kang Woo Bin will be in the teaser, too. Right?

199
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,740
I had no idea!

200
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,740
Isn't he so handsome?

201
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,830
Hold your horses! Why are you acting like amateurs?

202
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,940
Our Woo Bin will be overwhelmed if you overreact.

203
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,240
It just feels real now that the photos are out.

204
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,570
Hey, you know what to do when Kang Woo Bin comes, right?

205
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,060
No, "Whoa!"

206
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,750
No, "Amazing!"

207
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,600
No, "Woo Bin, can I get your autograph?"

208
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,690
- Oh, come on! 
 - Why can't we?

209
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,670
 We should get Woo Bin's autograph in advance! 

210
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,820
Bong Gu,

211
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,100
do you know where Kang Woo Bin is?

212
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,180
Kang Woo Bin? No.

213
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,960
I haven't seen him for a while.

214
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,030
He's not reading my texts, either.

215
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Hey, what will happen to you two now?

216
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,140
Are you dating or not?

217
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,610
Is it a fling or not?

218
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:08,340
It can't be. He's debuting soon, so I guess he can't?

219
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,830
Bong Gu, I have to tell you something.

220
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,810
Then, could you spread that rumor?

221
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,520
To be honest, that confession—

222
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,920
Huh?

223
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,670
Hey, what is this?

224
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,490
Did you see this?

225
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,630
 My uncle's acquaintance is on V Entertainment's A&amp;R team. 

226
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,610
 He said the boy group has five members. 

227
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,440
 But the thing is all the members have been trainees for at least three years. 

228
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,910
 Kang Woo Bin was a trainee for only one year. What's going on? 

229
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,350
Uncle's acquaintance, my foot.

230
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,780
This is a fabrication!

231
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,980
   

232
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,490
    
 What the? The user must have deleted it right away!

233
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,900
 No, I'm serious. 

234
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,000
 This has never happened before. Why does it keep getting deleted? 

235
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,490
 What's the "V Entertainment" post? 

236
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,850
 I didn't even get to read it. 

237
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,950
 It's allegedly about Kang Woo Bin, but no one got to read it. 

238
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,440
 Apparently, it keeps getting deleted. 

239
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,880
 Is it just mindless hating? 

240
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,120
 Is there an IT administrator? 

241
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,440
 I've got chills. 

242
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,810
   

243
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,020
Getting caught like this is out of the question!

244
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,530
   
   

245
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,760
What are you doing?

246
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,610
S-Seol Hee!

247
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,140
What's that?

248
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,030
Why do everyone's real names show up on IT?

249
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,820
You're the administrator?

250
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,760
I'll explain everything! Please hear me out—

251
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,830
You f***ing give me the chills.

252
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,290
Seol Hee. Seol Hee!

253
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,440
Please hear me out!

254
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,280
What more can you say?

255
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,100
I know I haven't done anything right.

256
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,210
But I didn't know how to befriend anyone.

257
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,440
So, I just wanted to use it for reference.

258
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,810
What people like and dislike...

259
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,340
Everything makes sense now.

260
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,430
You read it, didn't you? The message I sent to Kang Woo Bin.

261
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,220
I'm pissed off.

262
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,730
Does Kang Woo Bin know?

263
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,490
Even knowing this, he still—

264
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,500
He doesn't know. He has no idea!

265
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,060
That being said, Kang Woo Bin and I aren't like that.

266
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,980
I'm the one who—

267
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,050
It doesn't matter now.

268
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,680
I'll take this.

269
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,230
You just f*** off.

270
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,160
 You remember the 3-minute tone-deaf guy video, right? 

271
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,880
 Do you know who that is? 

272
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,200
 Look forward to it. He deceived the entire school. 

273
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,200
   

274
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:36,950


275
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,390
I...

276
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,150
actually got eliminated from the debut group.
