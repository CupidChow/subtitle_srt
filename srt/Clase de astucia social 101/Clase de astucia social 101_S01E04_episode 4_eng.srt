1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:09,940


2
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,410
I need to ask you something.

3
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,550
Is there another trainee at this school?

4
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,690
A trainee from our company?

5
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,560
You're the only one.

6
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,160
Why do you ask?

7
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,050
It's nothing.

8
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,900
   

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,750
♫  No turning back, timeout  ♫

10
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,740
♫  Driving me crazy! Driving me crazy!  ♫

11
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,170
♫  My strategy is just an excuse, want you, I want you  ♫

12
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,310
♫  Timeout! Timeout! Timeout! Timeout!  ♫

13
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,780
   

14
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,690
   

15
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,690
   

16
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,650
   

17
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,670
   

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,460
You...

19
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,190
You...

20
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,270
You turned out better than I expected.

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,920
What?

22
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,230
What are you doing here?

23
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,470
Were you two talking about something?

24
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,790
Right, I thought you moved somewhere far away.

25
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,630
I'm back now.

26
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,450
You wouldn't have recognized me unless I told you.

27
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,430
Of course not.

28
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,920
How did you recognize me?

29
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,540
You haven't changed.

30
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,540
You're just as pitiful as you were then.

31
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,970
What are you saying? I'm not.

32
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,710
Excuse me.

33
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,630
I'm sorry to interrupt.

34
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,650
Don't we need to talk?

35
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,010
Oh, right. We do.

36
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,140
Because you just left like that,

37
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,040
I was really stunned.

38
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,540
I'm sorry. I was too flustered.

39
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,930
You're a trainee, right?

40
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,440
Is it okay that this was posted?

41
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,650
A video, too?

42
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,280
By the way, you didn't have an IT account.

43
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,230
I signed up just now.

44
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,460
By the way,

45
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,920
how did you know I didn't have an account?

46
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,380
Well, I just guessed you didn't.

47
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,880
You just transferred here, too.

48
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,850
I'm leaving.

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,210
Follow me.

50
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,560
So, you were friends when you were kids?

51
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,560
Not exactly friends.

52
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,520
We saw each other often when he lived below us.

53
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,610
But I haven't seen him since he moved.

54
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,290
Almost six years? I think it's been seven years.

55
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,040
What's he like?

56
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,670
He just seems...

57
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,430
He turned out well.

58
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,440
Look at this, Kang Woo Bin.

59
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,170
 Kang Woo Bin just confessed his love publicly in the schoolyard. 

60
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,400
 He has a crush on her. 

61
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,580
 Who's she? Is she from Class 2? 

62
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,520
 She's his ideal type. 

63
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,320
 He didn't want to regret it if he didn't confess before his debut. 

64
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,140
You said you'd reject me. You can't just leave like that.

65
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,610
It's because I was so unexpectedly flustered.

66
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,170
Anyway, I did what you asked me to do. Our deal is over.

67
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,140
As you said, you became famous on IT.

68
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,580
You just need to reject me quickly. Right?

69
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,070
No.

70
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,330
No?

71
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,210
Just look at IT. No one's talking about me.

72
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,180
They all say, "Kang Woo Bin's crush. Kang Woo Bin's girl."

73
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,900
- I'm Kang Woo Bin's so-and-so. 
 - What's the difference?

74
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,240
This isn't what you promised.

75
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,150
I said the deal is over once my name is all over IT.

76
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,100
No one knows who Kim Ji Eun is yet.

77
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,240
So...

78
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,030
W-What do you want to do?

79
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,180
I think it might be better to relay the rejection.

80
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,250
So I get as much attention as possible.

81
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,570
Are you...

82
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,240
a bully?

83
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,660
This isn't right.

84
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,300
I swear I'm not threatening you. But that video—

85
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,400
No!

86
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,010
It's not that.

87
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,900
You can't become popular with this.

88
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,870
I told you, right?

89
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,860
You should think about... what your problem is.

90
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,750
Fine.

91
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,510
Let's give it a shot.

92
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,300
I'll make sure you become popular without a silly confession like this.

93
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,010
   

94
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:06,150
The fact that you have no presence means there's nothing memorable about you.

95
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,820
Think about the popular kids you always talk about.

96
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,120
They're all strong characters. Mo Bong Gu or Min Seol Hee.

97
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,800
They have motorized mouths. They're talkative, outgoing,

98
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,580
and they're always confident. They know all the gossip and information.

99
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,820
What does Min Seol Hee remind you of?

100
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,410
She's superior.

101
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,950
She's smart and she does many things.

102
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,170
Yes, that's it.

103
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:36,070
Start thinking about what kind of character you want to become.

104
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,910
If possible...

105
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,830
something unique.

106
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,310
Unique?

107
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,300
 Kang Woo Bin doesn't know, but I definitely have a unique quality. 

108
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,140
   

109
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,110
 For example, a positive character and full of energy. 

110
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,820
Some kids lift your mood by just being there.

111
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,880
I have no energy these days.

112
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,620
I'm depressed.

113
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,360
It's hard, isn't it? If so—

114
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,870
Gosh, how lucky you are.

115
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,720
Maybe it's God telling you to take a break.

116
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,390
 A positive lucky girl. A classic ENFP. 

117
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,480
 This is my character. 

118
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,510
Who are you? Do you know me?

119
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,330
Tell your tired friend to take a moment to herself.

120
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,970
How about you become friends with someone positive?

121
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,100
- Do you know her? 
 - Of course not.

122
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,440
You can make a lot more friends, too.

123
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,830
Wouldn't that be so...

124
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,050
lucky, lucky?

125
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,550
Vicky Lucky?

126
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,920
Lucky Vicky.

127
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,070
Yes, it'd be so Lucky Vicky.

128
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,060
I'm Kim Ji Eun from Class 2.

129
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,060
What class are you guys from?

130
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,560
So...

131
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,820
So, if you're depressed, since I'm cheery...

132
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,910
What?

133
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,650
 Did Min Seol Hee have to be athletic, too? 

134
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,520
 Unni, you're so cool. 

135
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,470
 The goddess of dodgeball. She looks amazing. 

136
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,320
 Can anyone defeat her in dodgeball? 

137
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,900
 You'll make an impression if you're exceptional at something. 

138
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,340
 Take sports, for example. 

139
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,820
 An athletic girl whom many have a girl-crush on. 

140
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,320
 That's not a bad character. 

141
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,680
 Here I go! 

142
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,600
Are you okay?

143
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,650
Oh, no...

144
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,690
No! No, that's not it.

145
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,280
It's so hard.

146
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,700
She's friends with kids from other classes, too?

147
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,620
She really is an insider.

148
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,550
 Showing a lot of reactions is good if you have no talent. 

149
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,450
 You can say that's the most important thing. 

150
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,100
I'm telling you.

151
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,850
That's why I told the math teacher this.

152
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,290
"You're the one who clogged the toilet.

153
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,940
I unclogged it." And he said—

154
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,890
Really?

155
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,580
Yes, really.

156
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,310
Wow, amazing!

157
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,760
I see. So? What happened?

158
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,990
Huh? Well...

159
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,090
- So, I told the math teacher— 
 - The math teacher?

160
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,680
Hey, shut up. He's talking.

161
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,570
Good job spoiling the vibe.

162
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,820
Gosh, don't be so harsh.

163
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,180
So, I...

164
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,340
No, I was just...

165
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,080
I just...

166
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,080
Woo Bin. Kang Woo Bin!

167
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,880
- Is that her? 
 - Yes, she's the one.

168
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,570
Did you decide on a crazy character?

169
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,720
You were unbelievable today.

170
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,820
You really were impressive.

171
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,840
What do you mean? I did as you told me to.

172
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,070
When did I...

173
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:09,970
What was "Lucky Vicky" all about?

174
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,460
It's called "Ji Eun's way of thinking."

175
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,480
I wanted to help someone depressed.

176
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,180
Did she ask you for help?

177
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,040
Huh? No, it's not that.

178
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,070
It's just that she looked depressed.

179
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,610
Can't you act natural?

180
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,390
Is it that hard?

181
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,770
Are you crying?

182
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,830
It's hard.

183
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,370
It's hard, I said.

184
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,860
What?

185
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:04,380
You were born with everything, so you don't have to do this.

186
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,630
I can never be funny, and I'm not a good listener.

187
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,130
Geez, why is it so hard?

188
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,990
You'd never understand.

189
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,360
You were born to be popular.

190
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,300
Born to be popular?

191
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,790
That's just what you think.

192
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,330
As you know,

193
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,870
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for that lie.

194
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:12,600
I think you would've been popular without that.

195
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,340
I don't know.

196
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,570
Once they find out the truth,

197
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,950
becoming an outsider won't be the end of it.

198
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:42,530
I think Kang Woo Bin would've been popular, no matter what.

199
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,300
Mo Bong Gu is really popular, too.

200
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,740
Who likes him that much, anyway?

201
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,680
Should I help them out?

202
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,180
Maybe being Cupid can be my character.

203
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,910
 Hey, hurry it up. Mo Bong Gu, you stupid idiot. 

204
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,660
We haven't beaten you enough lately, right?

205
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,560
   

206
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:38,840
♫  When I am down, I see you everywhere  ♫

207
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:46,130
♫  In this moment, there is nothing left for me  ♫

208
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,620
♫  The moment I approach you  ♫

209
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,110
Why are you so surprised?

210
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,040
Well, I didn't think you'd talk to me.

211
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Does that sound weird?

212
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,020
How are you feeling these days?

213
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,400
Does it feel like you became a superstar overnight?

214
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,430
Superstar?

215
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,670
You've always been so quiet.

216
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,830
You don't usually talk to other kids.

217
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,500
Yeah, that's true.

218
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,680
Anyway, it's really amazing.

219
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,970
How could Woo Bin choose you...

220
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,420
We're getting malatang*. Want to join us? 
  (*Spicy Chinese hotpot) 

221
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,810
Mo Bong Gu and Woo Bin are coming, too.

222
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,780
Malatang? Can I join you?

223
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,800
Mo Bong, Won Ji is coming, too.

224
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,030
Okay.

225
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,670
Won Ji? I'm Ji Eun.

226
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,040
Gosh, I called you Won Ji.

227
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,900
I understand. People get confused often.

228
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,920
We'll be waiting downstairs.

229
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,500
Take your time.

230
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,000
Let's go.

231
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,180
What are you doing?

232
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,860
Are you happy about something?

233
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,840
Happy, my foot.

234
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,550
I'm getting malatang with my friends.

235
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,990
Gosh, you're Ms. Popular now, Kim Dud.

236
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,330
Right, I wanted to tell you something.

237
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,420
I didn't get to tell you the other day.

238
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,060
Please forget about that nickname. Don't call me that, either.

239
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,430
I call you a dud because you're one. What else?

240
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,400
I'm not anymore.

241
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,110
Don't tell the other kids, either.

242
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,370
Is it because Kang Woo Bin confessed his love?

243
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,660
Why? Are you trying to hide your past?

244
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,650
What do you mean, hide?

245
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,470
I just want to change now.

246
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,470
Anyway, I'm leaving now.

247
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,990
I need to get malatang with my friends.

248
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,160
This is a new group, isn't it?

249
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,890
Having Ji Eun with us feels new.

250
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,110
So, what's going on with you two?

251
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,470
Tell me first once things get settled.

252
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,980
I need to take back the spotlight.

253
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,280
Hey, Kim Dud.

254
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,530
Wait for me, Kim Dud.

255
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,930
"Kim Dud"?

256
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,430
That's her nickname.

257
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,070
She has had it since she was 10.

258
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,850
Kim Dud?

259
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,540
No, it's not a nickname. Only he called me that.

260
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,630
What? Are you interested in Kim Ji Eun, too?

261
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,310
More importantly, do you know each other?

262
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,320
Childhood friends?

263
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,280
Something like that.

264
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,580
I stopped her whenever she tried to hang out with bad kids.

265
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,750
Do you remember?

266
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,530
Did you?

267
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,240
Kang Woo Bin, you'd better get nervous.

268
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,940
Childhood friends, neighborhood friends, church friends, and middle school friends.

269
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,990
All of them are your competitors.

270
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,320
It reminds me of when I was in middle school.

271
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,940
Countless girls competed against me, then.

272
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,410
 I want to confess my love to Mo Bong Gu, but I failed. 

273
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,260
 But I'll keep an eye on him. 

274
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,280
 Mo Mong Gu is so popular. 

275
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,200
 Say why you like him, too. He might respond. 

276
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,450
 He's fun. 

277
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,060
 It's cute how sociable he is, too. 

278
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,520
What?

279
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,110
Why are you looking at me like that?

280
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,820
By chance, are you in love?

281
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,510
By chance, are you into me over these two?

282
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,150
Well, no.

283
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,470
Seriously, what will you do?

284
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,220
Will you accept him?

285
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,190
Hey, why do you ask so directly?

286
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,580
It's not as easy as it sounds.

287
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,240
Of course not. I heard Kang Woo Bin is an idol trainee.

288
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,230
You're debuting soon, right?

289
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,620
I'm thinking about it, too.

290
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,270
Hey, Dong Min. You want to eat with us?

291
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,960
There's a good malatang spot nearby.

292
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,750
Are you all going?

293
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,380
It's going to be difficult for me to have dinner.

294
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,220
I forgot my lesson is happening soon.

295
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,900
All of a sudden?

296
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,710
Let's eat later. Anyway, I'm leaving.

297
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,040
See you.

298
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,700
Hey, Kang Woo...

299
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,810
Let's go without him. The four of us can go.

300
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,880
 You swear you never told anyone, right? 

301
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,030
 If they find out, I'll... 

302
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,050
Why are you still out here?

303
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,020
What are you doing here?

304
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,380
I asked why you're still out here.

305
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,660
You said you had a lesson.

306
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,930
Well, the thing is...

307
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,280
I'll go in.

308
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,320
Enough is enough.

309
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,730
Aren't you f***ing embarrassed?

310
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,050
How long will you keep this up?

311
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,310
You fake trainee.

312
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,460
♫  No turning back, timeout  ♫

313
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,380
♫  Driving me crazy! Driving me crazy!  ♫

314
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,170

♫  There's nothing to hide, like this, timeout  ♫

318
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,750
 You can make a lot more friends, too. Wouldn't that be so... 

319
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,020
 lucky, lucky? 

320
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,330
 Vicky Lucky? 

321
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,310
 Lucky Vicky. 

322
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,850
 What? 

323
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,510

 Seriously. 

328
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,240
 No! No, that's not it. 

329
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,800
 - So, I told the math teacher— 
 - The math teacher? 

330
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,810
 Hey, shut up. He's talking. 

331
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,530
