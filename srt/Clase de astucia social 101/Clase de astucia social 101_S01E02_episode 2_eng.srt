1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:11,960


2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,050
Crazy, is he a trainee?

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,050
Crazy! Did the debut group get fixed?

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,930
Amazin!

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,750
I couldn't get a clear shot.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,710
Sucks.

7
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,010
Hey, who's that?

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,270
He must be a trainee. He's totally gorgeous.

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,390
Gorgeous.

10
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,680
   

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,430
   
   

12
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,590
   

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,940
   

14
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,790
   

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,640
   

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,850
   

17
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,680
   

18
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,820
 It appears that the V's Rookies debut group has been fixed. 

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,220
 We got one, at least. 

20
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,690
 Isn't that our school's uniform? 

21
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,930
 We had a V trainee? 

22
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,520
 Isn't that Kang Woo Bin from Class 2? 

23
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,550
Kang Woo Bin!

24
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,080
You placed first in our class on the mock exam again.

25
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,920
Give him a round of applause.

26
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,580
 This is mine now. 

27
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,300
   

28
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,460
♫  No turning back, timeout  ♫

29
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,280
♫  Driving me crazy! Driving me crazy!  ♫

30
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,860
♫  My strategy is just an excuse, want you, I want you  ♫

31
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,040
♫  Timeout! Timeout! Timeout! Timeout!  ♫

32
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,420
   

33
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,420
   

34
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,390
   

35
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,400
   

36
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,320
   

37
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,520
"M"?

38
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,100
 Man, I'm f***ed! I lost my earbuds. 

39
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,950
 I just bought them, too. 

40
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,930
 Is anyone a 2D fangirl? 

41
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,950
 I'm the only otaku? Truly? 

42
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,400
 Why do posts keep coming up about the 3-minute tone-deaf guy? 

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,100
   

44
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,870
   

45
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,960
Amazing!

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,390
   

47
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,110
   

48
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,390
   

49
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,660
Holy cow, I can see everything here?

50
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,790
 There were various things I could find out through this unbelievable phone. 

51
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,460
 The posts they've made. 

52
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,600
 And even the messages they've sent each other. 

53
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm telling you, it's crazy.

54
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,890
It'd be great as long as there's no art fail.

55
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,230
- Exactly. 
 - Kageyama is so hot here!

56
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,290
Kageyama?

57
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,520
You like Kageyama, too?

58
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,210
Yeah! What a coincidence.

59
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,530
He's my favorite!

60
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,920
That's insane.

61
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,330
You're a first.

62
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,780
Kim Ji Eun?

63
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,770
What class are you in?

64
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,920
Class 2.

65
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,110
 Before, I had no idea what to say in order to approach them. 

66
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,150
 But with this phone, it's only a matter of time before I befriend everyone. 

67
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,630
We're planning to see Kageyama on Saturday since it's his birthday.

68
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,010
Want to join us?

69
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,150
What?

70
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,850
Let's go together and take photos.

71
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,570
Oh, my gosh! I'm so excited!

72
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,940
A cartoon character has a birthday?

73
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,910
Oh, you want to read the books?

74
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,270
Gosh, the cafe is set up so nicely.

75
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,440
I want to see Kageyama in person so badly!

76
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,560
But what's up with her?

77
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,730
She's a Muggle from all angles. Why pretend otherwise?

78
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,030
So annoying.

79
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,450
Forget her. Let's watch this.

80
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,100
   

81
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,530
Do you, by chance...

82
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,430
need earbuds? Want to buy used?

83
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,760
Earbuds? All of a sudden?

84
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,300
Don't you need them?

85
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,410
I did lose them...

86
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,200
But how did you know?

87
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,350
I never told anyone.

88
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,700
What?

89
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,120
Oh! Well...

90
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,540
I could just tell from one glance.

91
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,630
You look like you don't have any. You look lacking.* 
  (Also means "loser") 

92
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,460
What? I'm a loser?

93
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,930
No, no! I didn't mean that's what you look like!

94
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,310
Seriously!

95
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,880
   

96
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,130
Guys, be quiet.

97
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,950
All I hear is you guys from the office!

98
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,720
Geez, why is my class the only noisy one?

99
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,860
Be quiet, all right?

100
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,140
 Yes! 

101
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,290
All you do is answer.

102
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,050
You can come in!

103
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,400
Hey, look at him! He's so handsome!

104
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,130
Whoa! A transfer student!

105
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,050
New recruit!

106
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,100
Hey, hey! Sit down.

107
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,220
Yes.

108
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,260
You haven't even served in the military. New recruit, my foot.

109
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,220
New recruit, I mean, transfer— You!

110
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,570
Transfer student, would you like to introduce yourself?

111
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,810
If you're an "I," as in introvert, then you don't have to.

112
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,860
I'm Lee Dong Min.

113
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,540
Whoa! He's freaking charismatic!

114
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,340
You can have a seat.

115
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,140
All right, today's announcements are...

116
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,140
Yay! Nothing.

117
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,500
Be quiet and study, got it?

118
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,900
 Yes! 

119
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,820
Where did you come from?

120
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,800
How tall are you? What's your tier?

121
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,690
Do you have a girlfriend?

122
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,970
Hey! Be quiet, will you?

123
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,360
Does he seriously have a motor in his mouth?

124
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,280
Hey, you don't look too bad.

125
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,060
Hey, Kang Woo Bin! You better keep your guard up!

126
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,160
As if.

127
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,000
Want to go to the snack bar?

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,040
Oh, I'm good.

129
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,290
Mo Bong, let's go.

130
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,130
Class Prez, want to join us?

131
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,450
No, I'm way behind on orders.

132
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,770
Was your name Lee Dong Min?

133
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:18,320
This is our class president, shopping mall CEO, YouTuber, and...

134
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,930
Well, she has various other personas, but that's all you need to know.

135
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,430
And here we have Kang Woo Bin.

136
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,590
He's the future of K-pop.

137
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,550
You know V Entertainment? He's a trainee there.

138
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,690
A V Entertainment trainee?

139
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,890
Since when?

140
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,320
Oh, well...

141
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,190
About a year now.

142
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,540
But he already secured a spot in the debut group.

143
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,050
He still never misses a class at school.

144
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,500
He's my friend, but he's really incredible.

145
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,020
Hey, let's go to the snack bar already.

146
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,570
And I'm Mo Bong Gu.

147
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm responsible for all the gossip at our school.

148
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,050
Feel free to ask me anything.

149
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,100
School life will be a breeze with information like this.

150
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,210
Sure, thanks.

151
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,470
Hey, let's go. The pizza bread—

152
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,790
See you. Oh, right! The pizza bread! Let's go!

153
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,660
- Kang Woo Bin, come on! They'll sell out! 
 - They already sold out!

154
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,180
I'm telling you, they're sold out!

155
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,000
What good is knowing everything?

156
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,390
I'll never cross paths with someone like them.

157
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,160
Really? It's that bad?

158
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,830
What's the big deal about the 3-minute tone-deaf guy?

159
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,200
You know the video that was deleted right after three minutes?

160
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,570
Some guy sings very seriously.

161
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,490
But he sucks.

162
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,340
No one still knows who it is?

163
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,510
His face wasn't that clear.

164
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,550
I bet I can find out if I get a better look.

165
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,720
Gosh. But it was deleted.

166
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,950
It would be impressive if someone could find out.

167
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,930
   

168
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,520
Hey, you're Kim Ji Eun, right—

169
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,980
Let's go! What are we doing in PE today?

170
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,480
Oh, right! My phone. Go ahead.

171
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,950
Okay! Let's go.

172
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,840
   

173
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,330
Who are you?

174
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,750
You're...

175
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,360
I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue.

176
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,210
Do you have something to say?

177
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,710
PE class starts soon.

178
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,670
Actually,

179
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,600
I have something to ask you.

180
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,890
What is it?

181
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,520
Well, you see...

182
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,040
♫  I've waited for today!  ♫ 
    

183
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,360
♫  Hello!  ♫

184
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,870
   

185
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:54,250
♫  Though it's the day I've dreamed of countless times and practiced for  ♫

186
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,500
♫  I burst into tears  ♫

187
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:05,740
♫  With you standing in front of me, I stare blankly at my feet  ♫

188
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,960
♫  That I missed you, that I longed for you  ♫

189
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,240
♫  I couldn't even tell you  ♫

190
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,230
What is it?

191
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,390
Hey...

192
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,720
Well, you see...

193
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,660
What's going on, Joo Yeon?

194
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,130
What?

195
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,510
Oh, sorry!

196
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,770
What was it again?

197
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,760
Was it Ji Yeon? Ji Won?

198
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,230
Ji Young? Ji Hyeon?

199
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,640
Ji Young!

200
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,670
No, she's in the other class.

201
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,080
Anyway, why did you call me here?

202
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,050
You're the 3-minute tone-deaf guy, right?

203
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,020
 You're the 3-minute tone-deaf guy, right? 

204
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:01,980
What?

205
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,170
To be honest, I saw you!

206
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

207
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:16,380
♫  With you standing in front of me, I'm just staring at my feet  ♫

208
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,520
Hey, Mo Bong! Hurry up.

209
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,280
Geez, must I do it? I don't want to.

210
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,520
Come on!

211
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,910
Let's practice first.

212
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,680
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

213
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,810
Start!

214
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,500
 Shine muscat! I'm shy! 

215
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,620
♫  I'm Muscat because I'm shy  ♫

216
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,050
- It's a cat! 
 - Oh, right! Sorry.

217
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,570
- Again. 
 - One more time.

218
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,100
 Shine Muscat! I'm shy! 

219
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,510
Oh, Kang Woo Bin! Come on!

220
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,900
Come on, I'm shooting a reel!

221
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,500
What's wrong with him?

222
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,450
Is something wrong?

223
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,780
Hey.

224
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,740
I'm sorry if I cut you off.

225
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,950
Do you have a moment?

226
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,690
Yeah, sure. L-Let's go.

227
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,400
Thank you for accepting my suggestion.

228
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,510
You call that a suggestion? That was a threat.

229
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,710
Let's talk about everything here from now on.

230
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,820
Consider it a hideout.

231
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,590
Can we come in here so freely?

232
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,560
Yeah, no one comes here.

233
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,580
You must've come here often.

234
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:14,460
I came here whenever I'd rather be alone than be in the classroom.

235
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,730
Now, shall we talk about Confession Day?

236
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,810
Did you think of anything?

237
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,000
About what?

238
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,680
Right now, I don't even know what's going on.

239
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,630
I do.

240
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,690
I recorded the video out of shock at the time.

241
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,610
You're the tone-deaf guy.

242
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,140
But how are you a trainee—

243
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,850
Why did you stay quiet even though you knew?

244
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,340
I had no choice but to stay quiet.

245
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,250
So what?

246
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,050
What will you do now?

247
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,550
I was just curious how a trainee—

248
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,420
You'll reveal that it was a lie, too?

249
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,900
 What? 

250
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,330
T-That's what I wanted to ask!

251
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,460
Forget it.

252
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,420
What do you want?

253
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,940
You're making me sound like I'm really blackmailing you.

254
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,290
I won't tell the others.

255
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,990
And you think anyone will listen to what I say?

256
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,230
I do have a video,

257
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,850
but I'm a total outsider. Unlike you.

258
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,900
Just tell me!

259
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,830
There must be something you want!

260
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,870
Something I want?

261
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,480
 It's my first time talking to her, too. 

262
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,660
 What's her name? 

263
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,200
 She's freaking creepy. 

264
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,090
 Who has spoken to her before? 

265
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,340
 Something I can't do on my own. 

266
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,300
 If I have to use someone else's influence... 

267
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,190
Is it money?

268
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,280
Fine, I don't know much, but just tell me.

269
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,940
You...

270
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,200
You!

271
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,320
I need you to like me starting today!

272
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:49,330


273
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:56,960
♫  I waited every day for today, hello  ♫

274
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,020
   

275
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:09,430
♫  Though it's the day I've dreamed of countless times and practiced for  ♫

276
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,190
♫  I burst into tears  ♫

277
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,990
 Did you order delivery? 

278
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,650
 - Oh, yes. I'll take that. 
 - Enjoy. 

279
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,930
♫  I stare blankly at my feet  ♫

280
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:27,160
♫  That I missed you, that I longed for you  ♫

281
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,590
♫  I couldn't even tell you anything, but hello  ♫

282
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,850
 It's Kang Woo Bin! 

283
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,670
 Holy cow! I didn't know you were a trainee. 

284
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,400
 V Entertainment? That's wild! 

285
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,920
 How could I not have known? He really is handsome. 

286
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,540
 He used to be in my class. 

287
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,820
 Did you see IT? You're a hot topic. 

288
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,180
 Since when were you a trainee? 

289
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:59,850
♫  Like a common scene from a movie, hello  ♫
