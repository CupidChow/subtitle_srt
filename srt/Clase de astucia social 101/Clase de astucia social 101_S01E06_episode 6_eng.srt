1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,800
♫  Driving me crazy! Driving me crazy!  ♫

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,240
♫  My strategy is just an excuse, want you, I want you  ♫

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,500
♫  Timeout! Timeout! Timeout! Timeout!  ♫

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,090
   

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,870
   

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,900
   

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,000
   

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,950
   

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,070
The reason I can't become an insider?

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,300
D-u-d?

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,610
Oh, come on.

12
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,210
How long will you call me that? I've changed since then!

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,280
That grade school dud grew up exactly the same.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,930
Change that first.

15
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,990
If you want to become an insider or whatnot.

16
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,750
You dud!

17
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,240
You're going to teach Kim Ji Eun how to become an insider?

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,580
I'll probably do a better job than you.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,880
Do you even know Kim Ji Eun?

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,520
Oblivious, invisible, and inarticulate.

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,230
Need I say more?

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,030
Hey, recognizing her flaws won't fix anything.

23
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,130
We need to emphasize her strengths.

24
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,690
Then, you tell me what they are.

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,990
Obviously, her kindness!

26
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,160
And...

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,390
well, she's kind.

28
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,000
She's more of a dud and outsider than you think.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,760
Wouldn't I know better since I've known her for a long time?

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,900
At least right now, I know her better.

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,080
I'll show you.

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,840
She'll escape being an outsider overnight.

33
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,750
Seriously, I've heard enough.

34
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,640
You keep calling me an outsider to my face!

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,000
   

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,550
Everyone's attention, please!

37
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,340
It's happening this year, too.

38
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,110
- Oh, yeah! 
 - Reels!

39
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,540
It's the same as last year.

40
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,200
You get 60 seconds max in vertical orientation.

41
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,740
The teachers will be the judges,

42
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,560
but the more recommendations you get on IT, the more points you get.

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,660
The reel content—

44
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,460
can be anything as long as it's not inappropriate.

45
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,100
You know, right?

46
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,520
Yay! The money prize is bigger than last year's.

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,460
The response was good last year.

48
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,400
They'll also award certificates during the end-of-thesemester ceremony.

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,440
Class prez, will you enter again?

50
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,880
Give others a chance since you won last year.

51
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,410
What chance?

52
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,740
 It's doable if Kang Woo Bin and Lee Dong Min both help me. 

53
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,200
 They'll definitely help me, right? 

54
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,240
(What?)

55
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,320
 I don't film those things. 

56
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,160
Why not?

57
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,190
Trainees can't be exposed to these things.

58
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,400
Since I'm still supposed to be a trainee.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,880
Give me a break.

60
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,030
And why can't you?

61
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,080
This will help to get you out there since you just transferred here.

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,300
Are you a trainee, too?

63
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,480
Why must I put myself out there?

64
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,150
And the kids know me already.

65
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,130
Good for you.

66
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,340
Can't you just do this for me?

67
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,330
It's meaningful if you do it alone.

68
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,100
I can't do it alone.

69
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,930
Last year...

70
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,580
   
   

71
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,890
Anyway, I can't.

72
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,000
And it's usually done in teams.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,050
Then, first, find yourself a partner.

74
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,760
This is your homework.

75
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,460
That's how I can assess your level.

76
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,680
Assess? More like taking the credit without any effort.

77
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,020
Hey, Kim Dud. I'll teach you.

78
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,790
- Fundamentally— 
 - You don't even know what reels are.

79
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,170
You think I don't know?

80
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,060
Says who?

81
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,450
Stop! Stop!

82
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,200
Why are you fighting over me?

83
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,080
Although, it doesn't feel all that bad.

84
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,400
Anyway, I want to try this.

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,110
I'll do my best, so help me this once. Please?

86
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,400
   

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,180
One, two, three!

88
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,530
Bong Gu!

89
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,960
Oh, Kim Ji Eun!

90
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,350
Hey, regarding the reels—

91
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,260
Hey. Mo Bong! We need to strategize, too.

92
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,050
Yeah! Let's talk later. I'm busy preparing my reel.

93
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,560
Let's go.

94
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,820
Oh, no.

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,670
Who else other than Mo Bong Gu can I ask for help?

96
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,570
What are you doing?

97
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,650
Seol Hee!

98
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,180
What?

99
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,230
You're going on the reel competition, right?

100
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,300
With whom?

101
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,440
Are you asking me to join you?

102
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,770
Yeah, can I?

103
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,960
We really must've grown close.

104
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,870
Judging by how you're asking me.

105
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,630
Uncle, stop asking me to do this!

106
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,310
Or just hire more part-timers!

107
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,140
I mean, why does it have to be here?

108
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,680
I'm hanging up!

109
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,720
You again?

110
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,540
Are you following me?

111
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,590
Why do you keep showing up?

112
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,670
Look who's talking. Continue on your way.

113
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,760
By the way, you're not even that close to Ji Eun.

114
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,600
I heard you were just briefly friends when you were little.

115
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,320
Don't cross the line.

116
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,660
I'm sincere toward Kim Ji Eun.

117
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,800
- You're just helping her for fun— 
 - What if it's more than that?

118
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,740
Nothing out of your mouth is a fact.

119
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,320
You think I'm keeping it a secret for your sake?

120
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,750
What is Kim Ji Eun to you?

121
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,960
What about you?

122
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,360
- Obviously, she's— 
 - You sincerely want to turn her into an insider?

123
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,290
Is that really it?

124
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,570
Let's say that's true. But...

125
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,350
are you qualified?

126
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,650
You remember, right? You said you'll take care of it.

127
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,770
I'll wait and see.

128
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,680
   

129
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,420
So many comments.

130
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,740
So, you can recommend your own?

131
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,770
If I had known, I would've liked my own last year.

132
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,780
 Selling "flash loss" pills. Remote transactions accepted. 

133
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,250
 Message me if you're interested. 

134
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,820
 Written by Shin Yeon Jeong. 

135
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,390
What's this?

136
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,530
Hello?

137
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,840
 I just sent you a video. 

138
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,600
Yeah.

139
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,030
Huh?

140
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,660
 Practice that. 

141
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,180
Seol Hee asked you to do this with her?

142
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,270
This is practically "Street Women Fighter"!

143
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,880
How is Seol Hee such a good dancer?

144
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,240
Didn't you know?

145
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,680
Seol Hee has been dancing since she was little.

146
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,670
She's even good at dancing?

147
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,010
Class president, YouTuber, and shopping mall CEO...

148
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,720
Even dancing?

149
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,330
Seol Hee has got everything going.

150
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,660
People call her "God-tier Life" for a reason.

151
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,270
Teach me how to dance. I really want to do this with Seol Hee!

152
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,130
I can't teach you something like this.

153
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,690
♫  No turning back, timeout  ♫

154
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,630
♫  Driving me crazy! Driving me crazy!  ♫

155
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,420
Can you tell anything by looking?

156
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,550
Just tell her you can't.

157
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,040
Or look for someone else.

158
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,950
But Seol Hee asked me to do this together.

159
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,800
I'm done breaking it down.

160
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,580
Break what down?

161
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,980
♫  Let me love you, no turning back, timeout  ♫

162
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,600
♫  Driving me crazy! Driving me crazy!  ♫

163
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,010
♫  My strategy is just an excuse, want you, I want you  ♫

164
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,750
♫  Timeout! Timeout! Timeout! Timeout!  ♫

165
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,710
♫  There's nothing to hide, like this, timeout  ♫

166
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,440
Whoa, that was amazing!

167
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,180
Were you always good at dancing?

168
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,260
I don't think so. You weren't like this at all back then!

169
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,710
This is nothing.

170
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,240
I'll make it easy for you. Stand next to me.

171
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,840
Okay!

172
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,160
Look straight ahead.

173
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,080
You were already here?

174
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,710
You're such a great dancer. You were awesome.

175
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,570
I thought you were Honey Jay.

176
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,910
Did you practice a lot?

177
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,490
I did practice a lot, but there was too little time.

178
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,370
And it's hard to say I'm a good dancer yet.

179
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,780
You don't need to be a good dancer.

180
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,100
No one thinks you'd be a good dancer, either.

181
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,620
Still, I did my best.

182
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,400
We both have to do well for the reels to come out nice.

183
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,650
Our content is just me with you.

184
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,970
There's no need to feel pressured.

185
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,090
You know, I've been dancing since forever.

186
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,530
What's so bad about flapping around? It's cute.

187
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,640
Really?

188
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,720
I'll still do my best, so I'm not deadweight.

189
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,240
 Is something wrong? 

190
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,870
 Hey. 

191
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,240
 I'm sorry if I cut you off. Do you have a moment? 

192
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,100
 Yeah, sure. L-Let's go. 

193
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,970
You're nothing at all.

194
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,570
What did you say?

195
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,810
Should we get right to it?

196
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,290
What's this?

197
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,550
Well, is it okay if we just watch?

198
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,270
We wanted to watch you dance.

199
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,310
Me, too!

200
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,950
Well, suit yourselves.

201
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,320
Let's get started, Ji Eun.

202
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,720
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

203
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,280
♫  No more calculating, let me love you, let me love you  ♫

204
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,910
♫  No turning back, timeout  ♫

205
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,720
♫  Driving me crazy! Driving me crazy!  ♫

206
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,460
♫  Saying I'm worried is an excuse, want you, I want you  ♫

207
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,720
♫  Timeout! Timeout! Timeout! Timeout!  ♫

208
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,560
♫  There's nothing to hide, like this, drop out  ♫

209
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,310
Whoa, Kim Ji Eun!

210
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,570
Wow!

211
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,780
Shit, crazy...

212
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,860
 486th day of wishing for Min Seol Hee's debut. 

213
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,910
 Unni, please debut! 

214
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,580
 Min Seol Hee, did you know this? 

215
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,200
 They say you lose your memories if you see a pretty person. 

216
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,780
Yes.

217
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,350
You're nothing at all.

218
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,630
Nothing.

219
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,730
 Kim Ji Eun's pretty good and cute, too. 

220
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,750
So f***ing annoying.

221
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,720
Since when were we ever friends?

222
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,380
It was you?

223
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,440
Are you sick? Are you okay?

224
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,210
Get lost.

225
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,380
I said to get lost—

226
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,810
Seol Hee! Seol Hee!

227
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,160
Seol Hee, wake up!

228
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,530
Seol Hee! Seol Hee!

229
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,250
 Kim Ji Eun! 

230
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,720
   

231
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,240
A diet pill?

232
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,960
Yes. It's called "flash loss" or something.

233
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,680
The other school was upside down because of this, too.

234
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,270
And now, it's our school's turn.

235
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,490
Why on earth would you take meds from an unknown source?

236
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,630
I mean, why would Seol Hee...

237
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,230
She doesn't need to go to the hospital?

238
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,100
No, she seems to be just sleeping for now.

239
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,830
I'll have to see once she wakes up.

240
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,210
I let Seol Hee's mom know.

241
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,150
I see. I'll be at the faculty office.

242
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,630
Come right away if anything happens, okay?

243
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,420
I'm confiscating these pills. All right?

244
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,580
I hope Seol Hee will be okay.

245
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,940
Seol Hee's mother's calling. You can go inside.

246
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,170
You're up?

247
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,000
Are you feeling better?

248
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,600
I'm fine.

249
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,010
Woo Bin gave your mother a call.

250
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,690
I think she arrived just now.

251
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,920
I really hate kids like you.

252
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,460
What?

253
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,180
You were really nothing at all.

254
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,140
You were just...

255
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,420
nothing at all.

256
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,340
S-Seol Hee!

257
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,380
I'm sure she'll be okay. I don't think she took a lot.

258
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,250
Putting that aside, you guys are still number one.

259
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,020
You might really win the prize.

260
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,500
Huh? Oh, okay.

261
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,520
You're good at dancing, too.

262
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,980
I really wasn't going to say this, but I even left a comment.

263
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,920
I specifically called you out, "Kim Ji Eun."

264
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,340
How long did you say you've known Seol Hee?

265
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,240
Huh?

266
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,450
Since we were in elementary school, so about eight years.

267
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,840
It's as long as you've known Lee Dong Min.

268
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,560
Why do you ask?

269
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,940
What do you think about Seol Hee?

270
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,220
What do you mean?

271
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,000
   
 No one announced they'd confess to a future idol. Right? 

272
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,390
 I'm not asking you to say yes. 

273
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,290
 But this year might be my last chance. 

274
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:21,140
♫  I'm waiting alone for you on the streets tonight, missing you  ♫

275
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,220
 I'm sure I'll be really nervous that day. 

276
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,540
♫  I'm under the starlight  ♫

277
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,700
 But I'll still try to be brave. 

278
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,980
 After you debut, we won't be able to meet often. 

279
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,150
 The Confession Day isn't over yet. 

280
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,510
 I like you, Kim Ji Eun. 

281
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,680
 Of course, you better not accept it even if I confess to you. 

282
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,870
 I support your dream more than anyone 

283
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,790
 and I know Confession Day doesn't mean anything to you. 

284
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,490
 H-He confessed— I mean, Kang Woo— 

285
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,470
 Please accept my gift, though. 

286
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,020
 Just think of it as a gift from a friend to another. 

287
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,200
 This is my confession. 
   

288
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,660
   

289
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,600
 I'll tell you the specifics in person. 

290
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,340
♫  I'll be missing you  ♫

291
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:32,640
♫  Even if the cold wind passes by this day  ♫

292
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,760


293
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,230
I think I have to say it.

294
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,200
I'll have to...

295
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,400
reject your confession in public in front of everyone.

296
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
So suddenly?

297
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,270
It's still a bit of a stretch.

298
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,230
You said you'd reject me when you were a true insider.

299
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,610
I'll also say your confession was all a scripted show.

300
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,480
What?

301
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,500
So, you should come clean, too.

302
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,730
That it was all fake and that you're sorry for lying.

303
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,940
Why all of a sudden?

304
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,010
Did something happen?

305
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,150
If you don't tell them, I will.

306
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:30,010
You know, right? I have those videos of you singing, too.

307
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,080
If you tell them yourself, I won't upload those videos.

308
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,930
I'm not asking.

309
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,680
Right now,

310
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,200
I'm threatening you.

311
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,100
♫  I believed we'd meet one day  ♫

312
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,900
♫  Though I didn't know it would be today  ♫

313
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:57,810
♫  I recognized you right away, hello  ♫

314
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:02,950
♫  I awkwardly greeted you from far away  ♫

315
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,270
♫  Even the hair calmly tied together  ♫

316
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,050
   

317
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,730
♫  Even the night air still hanging by our lips  ♫

318
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:16,660
♫  You're still pretty, just like you were before  ♫

319
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,280
 There's no end to the uploads. 

320
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,580
 I don't think I can watch all of them. 

321
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,050
♫  I've been waiting for today all my life, hello  ♫

322
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,350
 She's cute. 

323
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:36,240
♫  I hoped I'd meet you as a better person  ♫
