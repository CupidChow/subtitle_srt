1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,435
So are you saying you are
the ghost painter for Yoo In Ho?

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,944
As you know,
having a ghost painter is...

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,215
a very sensitive issue.

4
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,614
Could you elaborate?

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,714
Sure.

6
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:27,525
The rough sketch for
all of Yoo In Ho's paintings were...

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,824
drawn by me.

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,995
I also provided the ideas too.

9
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:37,694
If that's true,
this is absolutely shocking.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,070
Can you prove what you just said?

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,805
Yes. I brought a painting here.

12
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:59,759
We just received new information.

13
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,559
We just heard
Mr. Moon Jeong Wook...

14
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,125
murdered the missing
CEO Yoo In Gook of Ingook Products.

15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,424
Is this true?

16
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,064
No.

17
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:15,440
So you didn't?

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,675
No.

19
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:20,275
The anonymous informant
sent us a video.

20
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,314
Let's have a look.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,214
In Gook.

22
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,385
You shouldn't have done this either.

23
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:31,954
I'm going to report you guys
this instant.

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,830
- In Gook!
- Hey!

25
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,229
Stop!

26
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,624
In Gook!

27
00:01:38,029 --> 00:01:40,464
In Gook. Open your eyes, In Gook.

28
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,365
You jerk.
What have you done to my brother?

29
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,035
I... I didn't...

30
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,564
Yoo In Ho's manager,
Moon Jeong Wook,

31
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:52,874
is a killer who murdered my father
15 years ago.

32
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,344
The audio file was proof.

33
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,445
Are you still going to claim
your innocence?

34
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,814
I didn't do it.

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,025
I'm only here to expose
Yoo In Ho's past.

36
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:13,055
Then does this
have anything to do...

37
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,025
with Yoo In Gook's murder?

38
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:22,469
All of In Ho's paintings
were drawn by me.

39
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:24,580
I was the one who came up
with the ideas as well.

40
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,580
Hold on.
Let's talk about that later.

41
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,950
According to the audio recording,
what the informant said seems true.

42
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,480
It seems like you killed him.

43
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,390
What happened that day?

44
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,784
All the paintings are mine.
I drew them.

45
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,659
I created them all
from the very beginning.

46
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,629
Mr. Moon, please answer me.

47
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,230
Did you come here today...

48
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,629
to hide your murder?

49
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:49,425
Is your claim even true?

50
00:02:53,369 --> 00:02:57,075
I only came here to expose
Yoo In Ho's past!

51
00:02:58,809 --> 00:03:02,245
Why do you keep talking
about nonsense?

52
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,115
Mr. Moon.

53
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,444
Mr. Moon.

54
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:13,260
We have breaking news.

55
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,890
Mr. Moon Jeong Wook,

56
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,999
late Yoo In Ho's close friend
from college and manager,

57
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,369
left the studio
during the live broadcast...

58
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,895
of "News Table",
an investigative reporting program.

59
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:27,210
This happened immediately after
the program received a report...

60
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,934
that Mr. Moon could be involved
in a murder case.

61
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,510
The informant claimed
that Mr. Moon murdered his father,

62
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,450
who had disappeared 15 years ago...

63
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,474
and submitted an audio file
as proof.

64
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:41,619
Mr. Moon did something unprecedented
by leaving the studio mid broadcast,

65
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:45,314
and some believe that this must mean
that he did commit the murder.

66
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,085
"News Night" will cover more on this
later tonight.

67
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:51,955
I have no plans to kill you.

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,430
Everyone will believe
that you're a murderer.

69
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,064
No one will believe you.

70
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:01,404
Where did you bury him?

71
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,205
I said, where?

72
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,374
How did you live the past 15 years
after committing murder?

73
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,884
Were you not troubled?

74
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:15,585
I was in pain.

75
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:18,455
I was going to turn myself in
at first.

76
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,029
But In Ho said...

77
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,795
Look at you blaming someone else.

78
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,495
Living as his slave for 15 years
was your choice as well.

79
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:34,905
Your world will be
more painful than now.

80
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,684
Yoo In Ho's manager,
Moon Jeong Wook,

81
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,184
is a killer who murdered my father
15 years ago.

82
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:55,560

Are you still going to claim
your innocence?

84
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:00,365
I didn't do it.

85
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:01,865
I'm only here to expose
Yoo In Ho's past.

(CHIP-IN)

92
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,334
Many of us went into his room
that day.

93
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:20,310
Then shouldn't you suspect them all
instead of cornering her?

94
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,810
Everyone else confessed
that they had gone into his room,

95
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,349
but Bit Na hid it from us.

96
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:25,479
She didn't hide anything.

97
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:26,620
She just didn't have the chance
to say it.

98
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,384
What's the difference?

99
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:32,560
You were going to keep it a secret
unless the photos came, right?

100
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,985
I was going to tell you.

101
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:35,589
But...

102
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:36,855
But what?

103
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,334
Forget it.
You don't need to explain.

104
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,675
These photos don't confirm anything.

105
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:55,774
There's no way
you could've killed him.

106
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,545
Even if the world
was crumbling down,

107
00:06:58,219 --> 00:06:59,345
you wouldn't do that.

108
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,215

Why didn't you tell me
that you had gone into his room?

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,675
I'm your mom,
and I will always be on your side.

112
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,035
So tell me.

113
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:35,045

There were others
who had gone there,

and they all fed him sleeping pills.

121
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,634
So I was scared.

122
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,904
Still, you should've told me.

123
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,475
Is there anything else...

124
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,445
you haven't told me?

125
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,315
Did you really not kill him?

126
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,955
- Mom.
- I'm just asking.

127
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,485
At least I should know the truth.

128
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,065
It's okay.

129
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,034
If you didn't kill him, you're fine.

130
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,945
I can't help but suspect Bit Na.

131
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,549
Who knows?
Maybe she fed him sleeping pills...

132
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:22,689
or injected him with nicotine.

133
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,760
You don't know for sure.

134
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,185
She probably played detective
in order to hide what she had done.

135
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,754
Hey, you let her use you
like a fool.

136
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,825
Don't corner Bit Na like that.

137
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,699
I seriously doubt she killed him.

138
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:42,240
That's exactly why
you are a poor judge of character.

139
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,610
There's no reason
for her to kill him.

140
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,475
You don't know
what's going through her mind.

141
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,150
Ever since she and her mom came,
it didn't feel right.

142
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,150
They kept blabbering
about the interior.

143
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,390
They're broke
and have nowhere to go.

144
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,754
They had planned everything.

145
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,429
In that case,
we'd have to suspect everyone.

146
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,659
Hey, why do you keep defending her?

147
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:07,465
Is she your daughter or something?

I don't even trust my own daughter
that easily.

I'm only saying this
because you'd never do this.

That's... That's what he said.

How could someone so gentle
do something like that?

167
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,029
"Gentle"?
He's the most heinous of all.

168

171

I just can't believe it.

172
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:19,735

do such a thing?

173
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,804

176
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,784
it was strange...

177
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:42,558
that he called you to his studio
at 4 a.m.?

178
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,955
Yes, I did.

179
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,500
But Dad has always been
so eccentric.

180
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,865
Right. He was.

181
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:52,264
I'm pretty sure
it's one of the people here.

182
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,504
Is there anyone you suspect?

183
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,534
Gosh, who in the world did this?

184
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:03,975
Hey, we shouldn't be here right now.

185
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,715
Follow me.

186
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,825
You've ruined everything.

187
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,500
What are you talking about?

188
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,294
We were almost there.
Everything was coming to an end.

189
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,264
But now,
you're the center of attention.

190
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,774
What if they find out about us?

191
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:34,304
That won't happen.

192
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,105
How are you so certain?

193
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,445
I only exposed In Ho's evil deeds.

194
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,590
Don't you see the mess
you've caused...

195
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,254
thanks to your own evil deeds
getting exposed?

196
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,554
Lie low for the time being.

197
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,894
I'll call you once the dust settles.

198
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,230
And don't come here unannounced.

199
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,764
There are people watching.

200
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,164
Look.

201
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:05,034
It's just best to be cautious
for the time being.

202
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,674
Stay somewhere quiet
until I call you.

203
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,345
Stay there.

204
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:16,245
This isn't it.

205
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,754
Where is this?

206
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,355
It's not here either.

207
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:22,024
Is it here?

208
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,325
No.

209
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,595
This means...

210
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,429
whoever took this photo...

211
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:30,640
was here as well.

212
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,465
We should find out
where they were hiding.

213
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,264
Darn it. This isn't it.

214
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:38,404
There's a pillar.

215
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:40,534
Pillar.

216
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,274
Pillar.

217
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,345
What? Hold on.

218
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:48,345
Gosh, how did they squeeze in here?

219
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:51,554
Let's see.

220
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,429
What? This is it!

221
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:55,554
It's here!

222
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,554
Hey, did you not see anyone
hiding behind here?

223
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,429
No.

224
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:02,695
Whoever was here was the one
who texted you.

225
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,835
Think carefully.

226
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,164
Anything?

227
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,075
Gosh.

228
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,705
Let's look around a bit more.

229
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:16,304
They could've left something behind.

230
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,345
What are you doing?

231
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,789
Why do you care?

232
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,644
I want to help.

233
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,815
By the way,
what are you looking for?

234
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,624
Anything that the culprit
left behind.

235
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,095
What?

236
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:37,965
Why is this one a different color?

237
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:46,134
It's nothing.

238
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:51,650
- Oh, my!
- Mom!

239
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,819
- Ji Hye!
- Mom!

240
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,220
Wake up!

241
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,220
- What happened?
- Why did she collapse?

242
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,289
Isn't that nicotine?

243
00:15:58,289 --> 00:15:59,760
- It's nothing.
- It is! No!

244
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,860
Don't touch that!

245
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,689
Gosh, why did you smell it?

246
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:05,100
Why is this here?

247
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,159
- Mom!
- Who put it here?

248
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,600
Wake up!

249
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,669
Gosh! Who put it here?

250
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,995
Who?

251
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,169
Who in the world did this?

252
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:16,605
My gosh!

253
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,904
Ms. Park!

254
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:30,615
- Oh, my.
- Mom, are you okay?

255
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,754
Yes.

256
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,884
What happened?

257
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,959
You collapsed
after smelling the nicotine.

258
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,154
"Nicotine"?

259
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:42,595
- Goodness.
- Are you okay?

260
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,965
Why was that there?

261
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,735
Who knows?

262
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,309
Why was there nicotine
in the studio?

263
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:53,274
Did you put it there?

264
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,409
Isn't that the nicotine you used
to inject your dad with?

265
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:57,745
No.

266
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,215
Then how will you explain
being there in the studio...

267
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,445
and us finding the nicotine
in there?

268
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,884
Is this all just a coincidence?

269
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,654
It really wasn't me.

270
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,695
I didn't do it.

271
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:14,370
I had no idea
the nicotine was there.

272
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,225
Why would I have looked around
had I known?

273
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,370
- Exactly.
- Who knows?

274
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,435
She could've placed it there
and feigned ignorance.

275
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,040
What's wrong with you all?

276
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,150
There were others in the studio
that day.

277
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,814
The one who photographed her...

278
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,074
could've hidden it there.

279
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:36,350
Why is everyone so eager
to accuse her?

280
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,560
Because she lied from the get-go!

281
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,854
Why would she lie
if she had nothing to hide?

282
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,254
Tell me the truth.

283
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:44,830
You're the one
who injected In Ho, right?

284
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,995
Hey!

285
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,625
Yes?

286
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:49,725
Shut it.

287
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,069
Don't you dare attack Bit Na.

288
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,004
I don't care who you are.
I won't let it slide.

289
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:10,415
You see,

290
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,955
I know all the objects
that are in the studio,

291
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,584
and I've never seen
that bottle before.

292
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,465
No matter what the others say,
I believe in you.

293
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:23,625
Thank you.

294
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,034
Goodness,
did Hae Joon just get here?

295
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,975
I wonder how he's handling the mess
from yesterday.

296
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,445
"The mess"?

297
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,405
Didn't you hear?

298
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,749
He claimed that Jeong Wook
killed his dad.

299
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:42,449
It was even broadcast on TV.

300
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:43,544
What?

301
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,425
I guess Hae Joon came here
to take revenge.

302
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,354
How did he keep it all inside?

303
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,764
I should've fed him
more delicious dishes.

304
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,385
I only just found out...

305
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,754
about what happened.

306
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,784
What do you know?

307
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:24,695
Don't try to console me
if you can't.

308
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:44,445
I still think that you used me.

309
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,314
I want to believe
that you're not the killer,

310
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,844
but who knows?

311
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,495
This is the part I'm stuck on.

312
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,695
Bit Na,
how long were you in the studio...

313
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:09,635
that night?

314
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,635
Tell me.

315
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:14,034
Tell me.

316
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:16,745
How long?

317
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,385
What's wrong with you?

318
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,290
I'm trying my best...

319
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,854
to use my rusty brain
so that I can clear your name.

320
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,784
Are you going to just sit idly?

321
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,294
Goodness.

322
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:33,155
I'm the only one working hard here.

323
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:38,094
You're only doing this
for the inheritance.

324
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,675
What?

325
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:49,074
If I'm not vindicated,
I won't receive the inheritance.

326
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,715
That's why you're trying so hard.

327
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,014
Is that really what you think?

328
00:20:58,489 --> 00:20:59,655
What a brat.

329
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,985
Even if you don't treat me
like your mom,

330
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,024
I still am.

331
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:08,125
My daughter
has been accused of murder,

332
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:10,294
and yet,
you think it's all about the money?

333
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:11,895
Seriously?

334
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,300
So you think...

335
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,804
I'm just an inconsiderate,
materialistic person?

336
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,135
Fine.

337
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,935
I get how you always thought of me.

338
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:24,104
Forget it.

339
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,344
I don't care if you get framed.
Do whatever you want.

340
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:43,499
(Things that happened
on the day Mr. Yoo died)

341
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:45,439
(11 p.m., Bit Na gets a suspicious
text from Mr. Yoo's number.)

342
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:47,364
(2:30 a.m., Dokko Chul
goes into Mr. Yoo's room...)

343
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,834
Look at how cold-hearted she is.

344
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,504
She's just like her dad.

345
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,344
- What?
- Hey.

346
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,719
I recently saw something,

347
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:08,885
and it has been bothering me.

348
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,284
What is it?

349
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:14,425
I wonder if Bit Na
threw that away or not.

350
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,504
I heard...

351
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:25,935
you took a script
from that woman's room.

352
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:28,205
Where is it?

353
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,675
"A script"?

354
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,050
What script?

355
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,050
You know, when you told me
to go through her room.

356
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,850
That thing in the trash can.

357
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,054
Oh, right.

358
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,259
There it is. She had it.

359
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:45,860
It was odd. It's really odd.

360
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,370
Here it is. Take a look.

361
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,294
It's really weird.

362
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,895
All scripts look like this.

363
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,534
"Her daughter, Gemma,"

364
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,040
"is the scarier one."

365
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,475
"Gemma had poison."

366
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:05,544
"The same poison that caused
my husband, Henry's death!"

367
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,044
It's weird. Isn't it?
Isn't this weird?

368
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,314
Gemma is Bit Na.

369
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,625
Sophia is Ms. Ji.

370
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:17,324
This is totally
a story about this family.

371
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,764
You...

372
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:27,235
wrote this, didn't you?

373
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:33,875
It's obviously not a script.

374
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:38,774
It's a murder plan.

375
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,455
You killed Mr. Yoo...

376
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:47,854
and blamed Bit Na
for everything, didn't you?

377
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:54,725
You're laughing at me?

378
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,064
Do you think I'm making this up?

379
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,205
Sophia. "Sophia"?

380
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,604
You're Sophia.

381
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:08,875
You depicted yourself
as the gentlest character.

382
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,574
If you find it suspicious,

383
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,844
go tell the police about it.

384
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,114
Do you think they'll believe it?

385
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:19,385
Then...

386
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,225
are you saying it's a coincidence...

387
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:25,324
that Mr. Yoo died of poisoning
just like the husband...

388
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:27,024
in this script?

389
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,425
In Ho...

390
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,935
didn't die of poison,
but sleeping pills.

391
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,935
And you gave him one of the pills.

392
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,074
That's because...

393
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:41,004
you wrote that letter for us...

394
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,814
trying to make use
of Mr. Yoo's sleeping pill allergy.

395
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:48,284
I never did that. Get out.

396
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,054
I told you to get out. Get out.

397
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,225
What makes you think
you're so great...

398
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,229
that you look down on me
and ignore me all the time?

399
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:00,625
You deserve it!

400
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,439
I have no reason
to show you respect. Get out.

401
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:08,064
"Respect"? I don't even want that.

402
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:11,875
You. Do you even
consider me as a human?

403
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,209
Do you think you look like
a decent human to me?

404
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:19,820
Wasn't it enough to ignore me
and belittle me for 20 years?

405
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,090
What more do you want
even after Mr. Yoo's death?

406
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,044
I hate having to see you!

407
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,685
Wasn't it enough...

408
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,989
to stick around and torture me
for the last 20 years?

409
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:29,584
Will you please stop?

410
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,965
Yes.

411
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:45,004
I know what I did is wrong.

412
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,774
It might sound like an excuse,

413
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,074
but I was too young back then.

414
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:54,544
I didn't know how to
get over my feelings.

415
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:59,215
I had to bring up a child
out of wedlock.

416
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:01,584
Do you think
everything was great for me?

417
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:07,024
Is that your excuse?

418
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,965
I also regret
what I did back then to death.

419
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,435
But we can't turn back the time.

420
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,534
Yes.

421
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:18,635
I do feel bad for you.

422
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,604
You do feel bad for me?

423
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,284
Is that why you tried so hard
to butter him up in front of me?

424
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,314
Because I was scared.

425
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,695
I was scared
he might abandon Bit Na...

426
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,524
just like he abandoned me.

427
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:46,895
I was desperate...

428
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,205
to make sure Bit Na was a girl
who had a father.

429
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,810
I was afraid
that her ties with Mr. Yoo...

430
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,405
would get cut off
if I didn't do that.

431
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,245
I've been abandoned before,

432
00:27:00,249 --> 00:27:02,784
and I know how scary it can be.

433
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,715
So I didn't want...

434
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,584
Bit Na to feel such things.

435
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:17,794
Are you saying you're a mom too?

436
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,364
I don't care about
you and your daughter.

437
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,675
Get out.

438
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,344
Take out your feelings on me
if you have any.

439
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:36,385
I'll take it.

440
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:38,614
Leave my daughter out of this.

441
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:42,024
I know you framed Bit Na
for everything.

442
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:45,554
You shouldn't do that to her.

443
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,695
Bit Na did...

444
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:52,465
nothing wrong other than the fact
that I gave her birth.

445
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:59,034
Like I said, go tell the police.

446
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,205
Fine.

447
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,645
I'll make sure
I get you locked up behind bars.

448
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,344
Look forward to it.

449
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,195
Mom...

450
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,635
I'm sorry.

451
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,380
I'm sorry.

452
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,475
My daughter.

453
00:28:56,983 --> 00:28:58,078
Hey.

454
00:28:58,483 --> 00:29:00,818
How can you eat
after what you've done?

455
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:03,488
You're sitting there
without any shame.

456
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:06,758
Are you going to be shameless
in taking his inheritance too?

457
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:09,387
You're always talking about money.

458
00:29:09,762 --> 00:29:11,532
Is that all you can see?

459
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:12,893
What makes you any different?

460
00:29:12,893 --> 00:29:15,427
At the very least,
my kid comes before money.

461
00:29:15,663 --> 00:29:17,832
Money doesn't mean the world to me
like it does to you.

462
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:20,298
Who says
money means the world to me?

463
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,667
Did you hear me say that?

464
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:25,768
Sul Young,
shouldn't you call the police...

465
00:29:25,772 --> 00:29:27,838
and have her questioned again?

466
00:29:29,782 --> 00:29:31,707
You can manage.

467
00:29:33,753 --> 00:29:35,518
Are you telling him to report her?

468
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:38,988
Why are you so worried?

469
00:29:39,322 --> 00:29:41,288
If she's innocent,
she'll be released.

470
00:29:41,622 --> 00:29:43,657
If she did something,
she'll be punished.

471
00:29:43,693 --> 00:29:46,258
You talk as if
she committed a huge sin.

472
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:48,697
We can't say it's small.

473
00:29:49,332 --> 00:29:52,367
The investigation could've been
ruined because of her lie.

474
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:55,768
Or maybe it's already ruined.

475
00:29:56,483 --> 00:29:58,409
- Isn't that so?
- You.

476
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:00,348
- Mom.
- You're pretending to be innocent.

477
00:30:02,524 --> 00:30:04,788
Didn't you feel guilty
when you were accusing me?

478
00:30:05,294 --> 00:30:08,263
Usually, when people have
something to hide,

479
00:30:08,263 --> 00:30:10,629
people tend to stay quiet.

480
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:14,304
You're treating her like a criminal.

481
00:30:14,304 --> 00:30:15,763
It was only one lie.

482
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:17,334
I'm saying this because...

483
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:20,203
one lie can turn into
more than just one.

484
00:30:20,203 --> 00:30:21,344
Why would you say
something like that?

485
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:24,374
No one knows what
other secrets she's hiding...

486
00:30:24,374 --> 00:30:26,108
behind that innocent face of hers.

487
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:28,939
Your mother's assault charge.

488
00:30:30,384 --> 00:30:31,748
Wasn't that yours?

489
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:39,248
Seeing how you're denying it,
it must be true.

490
00:30:42,723 --> 00:30:43,828
It's not what you think.

491
00:30:44,963 --> 00:30:46,699
Your motherly love is
indeed touching.

492
00:30:47,503 --> 00:30:50,098
You took the fall for the assault
charge for your daughter.

493
00:30:51,503 --> 00:30:54,199
You can tell us yourself
what the truth is.

494
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:01,384
Why can't you talk?
Tell us the truth.

495
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:04,379
The truth, you've been
looking for all this time.

496
00:31:10,594 --> 00:31:11,719
Yes.

497
00:31:13,193 --> 00:31:15,094
- I did it.
- Stop it.

498
00:31:15,094 --> 00:31:17,028
He was abusive to my mother
in front of me.

499
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:18,564
So I hit him.

500
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:19,689
No.

501
00:31:20,403 --> 00:31:22,104
It was me who assaulted him.

502
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:25,328
You didn't do it. I did it.
It was me.

503
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:26,598
I did it.

504
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:28,598
It was me.

505
00:31:29,503 --> 00:31:31,038
What concerns me is...

506
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:34,508
your inclination of violence
inside you.

507
00:31:35,513 --> 00:31:37,879
No one knows what you will do
because of...

508
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:40,248
your short temper.

509
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:41,923
How dare you?

510
00:31:41,923 --> 00:31:43,548
Bit Na is rigid.

511
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:47,689
So she can easily break
just like this.

512
00:31:48,993 --> 00:31:51,959
What happened to
the honest and innocent Bit Na?

513
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:53,659
Only her shell remains.

514
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:55,763
Shut your mouth.

515
00:31:55,763 --> 00:31:58,598
Now, after all this,
who do you think...

516
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:02,068
will believe you?

517
00:32:45,084 --> 00:32:46,278
What are you doing there?

518
00:32:50,324 --> 00:32:51,449
Mom.

519
00:32:52,693 --> 00:32:54,124
Why don't we...

520
00:32:54,124 --> 00:32:55,318
I told you...

521
00:32:56,094 --> 00:32:57,989
not to bring that up again.

522
00:32:58,233 --> 00:32:59,459
Mom.

523
00:33:02,403 --> 00:33:06,129
People were insulting me
because of my stupidity.

524
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:07,969
No child would just
watch that happen.

525
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:12,008
It's not your fault. It's mine.

526
00:33:12,274 --> 00:33:14,008
It's all my fault.

527
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:24,748
Yes.

528
00:33:26,493 --> 00:33:28,459
I think Bit Na will give up
on her own.

529
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:30,558
Yes.

530
00:33:31,794 --> 00:33:33,258
Where are you now?

531
00:33:34,064 --> 00:33:36,798
Okay. I'll see you there.

532
00:33:37,374 --> 00:33:38,469
Okay.

533
00:34:02,193 --> 00:34:04,629
The death of Ingook Products' CEO
will become old news soon.

534
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,558
People tend to forget news that
doesn't concern them quickly.

535
00:34:12,173 --> 00:34:14,104
I have Hae Joon's trust.

536
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:16,768
I'll handle this, so this doesn't
get any more attention.

537
00:34:19,743 --> 00:34:22,938
Everything will end as planned.

538
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,688
Just wait a bit longer.

539
00:35:12,964 --> 00:35:14,699
What on earth are you doing?

540
00:35:16,104 --> 00:35:17,528
You did this too, right?

541
00:35:19,803 --> 00:35:22,168
Hae Joon, listen to me. Wait.

542
00:35:48,303 --> 00:35:51,133
What is it? Do you still have
things to say to me?

543
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:52,929
Aunt Sul Young had these photos.

544
00:35:58,343 --> 00:36:00,444
I think she and Mr. Moon
planned this,

545
00:36:00,444 --> 00:36:02,639
so you'd give up the inheritance.

546
00:36:11,394 --> 00:36:13,619
Are you all right, Hae Joon?

547
00:36:13,894 --> 00:36:15,964
You should worry about yourself now.

548
00:36:15,964 --> 00:36:17,429
I can take care of myself.

549
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:19,989
Then, why are you worrying about me?

550
00:36:22,104 --> 00:36:23,199
Anyway,

551
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:25,329
watch out for her.

552
00:36:40,254 --> 00:36:41,552
Hello.

553
00:36:41,553 --> 00:36:44,349
You must come home
and take care of something.

554
00:36:44,654 --> 00:36:48,418
You were the one who took photos
of Bit Na in the studio that night.

555
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,958
I need you to explain that
to the family.

556
00:36:51,093 --> 00:36:54,862
Tell them that you were
in the studio that night.

557
00:36:54,863 --> 00:36:56,958
You said that was
already taken care of.

558
00:36:57,334 --> 00:36:59,203
We need more solid evidence.

559
00:36:59,203 --> 00:37:00,969
Bit Na won't give up that easily.

560
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:02,599
This is the last time.

561
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:04,708
I'll wait for you.

562
00:37:22,723 --> 00:37:23,929
Everyone.

563
00:37:25,394 --> 00:37:27,059
- Look at these photos.
- What?

564
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:30,059
These photos were found
in that woman's room.

565
00:37:32,174 --> 00:37:35,298
That woman took Bit Na's photos,
so she could frame Bit Na.

566
00:37:36,203 --> 00:37:38,108
I should just teach
that woman a lesson.

567
00:37:42,113 --> 00:37:43,508
Fine. Go ahead.

568
00:37:43,613 --> 00:37:45,579
Have a look. Am I right?

569
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:51,289
Exactly.

570
00:37:52,694 --> 00:37:54,088
Why are you so quiet?

571
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:56,958
Before, you all had her
in the corner.

572
00:37:56,964 --> 00:37:58,329
Are your lips all glued?

573
00:37:58,894 --> 00:38:00,933
I didn't suspect her for a second.

574
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:02,803
She's not the type
to do something like that.

575
00:38:02,803 --> 00:38:05,469
You were the most talkative one.
Why don't you say something?

576
00:38:05,904 --> 00:38:07,499
No, I wasn't.

577
00:38:07,504 --> 00:38:10,739
I just wanted to find out the truth.

578
00:38:11,314 --> 00:38:14,314
Besides, even if you found
these photos in Sul Young's room,

579
00:38:14,314 --> 00:38:16,644
it's true that
she didn't tell the whole truth.

580
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:18,648
It's her fault
for not telling us the truth.

581
00:38:18,654 --> 00:38:20,354
You're unbelievable.
Are you serious?

582
00:38:20,354 --> 00:38:21,679
You startled me.

583
00:38:23,354 --> 00:38:24,519
What?

584
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,289
Why are you here again?

585
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:34,699
I never wanted to see you again.

586
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:38,969
Are you here to see Aunt Sul Young?

587
00:38:40,033 --> 00:38:41,599
What's your relationship with her?

588
00:38:41,703 --> 00:38:43,199
What are you implying?

589
00:38:43,374 --> 00:38:46,239
Do you think you'll get everything
if Bit Na gives up?

590
00:38:48,883 --> 00:38:50,013
How do you...

591
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:51,548
How do you think I know that?

592
00:38:52,754 --> 00:38:54,749
Do you think Aunt Sul Young
will give you your cut?

593
00:38:55,654 --> 00:38:57,124
You'd been working for my uncle
all your life.

594
00:38:57,124 --> 00:38:58,749
Are you working for her now?

595
00:39:00,394 --> 00:39:01,989
Don't you have
your own life to live?

596
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:50,739
Did you use me too?

597
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,739
How does Hae Joon know
what we talked about?

598
00:39:53,243 --> 00:39:54,814
What does he know?

599
00:39:54,814 --> 00:39:56,239
Don't play innocent with me.

600
00:39:57,013 --> 00:39:59,749
Hae Joon knew everything
about our plan.

601
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:01,219
No way.

602
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:03,012
How could he know that?

603
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:05,278
Don't you dare lie to me.

604
00:40:07,422 --> 00:40:10,317
Right here. Everything
we talked about is in here.

605
00:40:10,853 --> 00:40:12,587
If you betray me,

606
00:40:13,422 --> 00:40:14,917
I'll expose you.

607
00:40:16,523 --> 00:40:17,627
You're laughing?

608
00:40:20,632 --> 00:40:22,532
You're no different than him.

609
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:24,667
No, I'm nothing like him.

610
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:26,667
He was evil.

611
00:40:26,972 --> 00:40:29,598
He didn't deserve to live his life.

612
00:40:29,942 --> 00:40:32,408
Even the moment when he was
diagnosed with the terminal illness,

613
00:40:32,572 --> 00:40:33,842
he didn't show any remorse.

614
00:40:33,842 --> 00:40:37,207
He mocked me
even until the very last moment.

615
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:40,377
And once he was blinded by greed,

616
00:40:40,853 --> 00:40:43,118
he wasn't able to see
what was around him.

617
00:40:43,623 --> 00:40:45,287
What I regret is...

618
00:40:46,123 --> 00:40:47,692
that I actually trusted you.

619
00:40:47,692 --> 00:40:48,787
No.

620
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:51,558
You didn't trust me.

621
00:40:53,362 --> 00:40:54,957
You just needed me.

622
00:40:57,103 --> 00:40:59,802
You were so full of desires
to kill him,

623
00:40:59,802 --> 00:41:02,043
but you were so incompetent
that you couldn't do anything.

624
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,238
That's why you needed me.

625
00:41:03,342 --> 00:41:06,512
You just wanted to have
his fame and wealth.

626
00:41:06,512 --> 00:41:08,282
You killed him
because you wanted that.

627
00:41:08,282 --> 00:41:10,808
Don't make it sound like
you sacrificed yourself for me.

628
00:41:10,953 --> 00:41:12,048
Even to the end...

629
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:14,317
Are you saying you'll betray me?

630
00:41:14,853 --> 00:41:15,948
No.

631
00:41:18,552 --> 00:41:20,448
We were never in this together.

632
00:41:23,163 --> 00:41:26,227
What if I reveal everything
we did together?

633
00:41:27,063 --> 00:41:28,627
Will you be able to handle it?

634
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:33,368
I told you that
I know you very well.

635
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,037
I know that you don't even
have the courage to do it.

636
00:41:40,813 --> 00:41:42,678
Your threat won't work on me.

637
00:41:44,183 --> 00:41:45,908
The only thing you can do is...

638
00:41:45,913 --> 00:41:48,548
living your life in hiding
just like now.

639
00:41:49,353 --> 00:41:50,718
As if you're dead.

640
00:41:52,353 --> 00:41:53,587
Leave now.

641
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,868
Why are you here?

642
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:11,937
What?

643
00:42:12,472 --> 00:42:13,937
Am I not allowed to come in here?

644
00:42:13,972 --> 00:42:15,977
How dare you set foot in this house?

645
00:42:22,052 --> 00:42:23,678
This is my house.

646
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:27,187
Don't just stand there.
Get him out of this house.

647
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:30,087
- Leave.
- Let go of me!

648
00:42:30,563 --> 00:42:31,758
Why would I leave?

649
00:42:33,192 --> 00:42:35,127
You were the one
who killed Hae Joon's dad...

650
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:38,368
and Mr. Yoo, right?

651
00:42:39,672 --> 00:42:41,098
It was you, right?

652
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:44,908
Right.

653
00:42:45,742 --> 00:42:47,008
I killed him.

654
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:57,747
Why are you looking at me like that?

655
00:42:58,222 --> 00:43:00,322
In Ho was the evil one.

656
00:43:00,322 --> 00:43:02,417
Why are you looking at me like that?

657
00:43:02,922 --> 00:43:04,857
When In Gook died,

658
00:43:04,893 --> 00:43:07,598
I told him that we should call
the police from the get-go.

659
00:43:08,132 --> 00:43:10,868
But the person who stopped me was...

660
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:12,767
that jerk, In Ho.

661
00:43:14,873 --> 00:43:18,167
What? Do you think I'm lying?

662
00:43:18,572 --> 00:43:20,572
Weren't you the one
who injected nicotine in Mr. Yoo,

663
00:43:20,572 --> 00:43:22,707
threw the pottery at Bit Na,

664
00:43:22,782 --> 00:43:24,607
and hit her head with a golf club?

665
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:26,948
It was all you, wasn't it?

666
00:44:24,072 --> 00:44:25,167
What?

667
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:27,607
Did you attack Bit Na because...

668
00:44:27,643 --> 00:44:29,107
she deserved to die?

669
00:44:30,483 --> 00:44:31,647
Why?

670
00:44:31,652 --> 00:44:33,647
Why don't you say
someone made you do it?

671
00:44:33,853 --> 00:44:35,747
How could you call yourself
a human being?

672
00:44:36,683 --> 00:44:37,787
Right!

673
00:44:39,222 --> 00:44:40,718
I'm not a human being.

674
00:44:42,123 --> 00:44:45,388
I've lived my whole life
as his slave...

675
00:44:47,463 --> 00:44:49,098
and servant.

676
00:44:49,762 --> 00:44:50,857
Is that all?

677
00:44:52,172 --> 00:44:54,638
Do it again.
Come up with a new idea too.

678
00:44:55,972 --> 00:44:57,837
Don't you think
you're getting lazy these days?

679
00:44:58,512 --> 00:45:01,742
When people have enough food
and a roof over their heads,

680
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:03,043
it shows in their art.

681
00:45:03,043 --> 00:45:04,238
Look at this.

682
00:45:04,552 --> 00:45:07,078
I can't even see
your true intentions here.

683
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:12,948
What?

684
00:45:13,222 --> 00:45:14,718
Why are you looking at me like that?

685
00:45:14,722 --> 00:45:16,017
Are you upset?

686
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:18,492
Please let me go now.

687
00:45:18,492 --> 00:45:19,828
I'm begging you.

688
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:21,258
That again.

689
00:45:21,902 --> 00:45:23,357
It's been 15 years.

690
00:45:24,302 --> 00:45:26,428
I worked long enough for you.

691
00:45:28,072 --> 00:45:29,543
I want to live my own life too.

692
00:45:29,543 --> 00:45:32,067
"I want to live my own life too."

693
00:45:36,143 --> 00:45:38,408
Do you think
a murderer has a right to do so?

694
00:45:39,012 --> 00:45:41,817
Do you think people will acknowledge
you as their fellow human being?

695
00:45:42,983 --> 00:45:45,417
I understand that
the statute of limitations is over,

696
00:45:45,853 --> 00:45:47,893
but the moment people find out
that you killed a man,

697
00:45:47,893 --> 00:45:48,992
your life is over.

698
00:45:48,992 --> 00:45:51,132
What about you? Do you think
you won't get burned for this?

699
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:52,258
Me?

700
00:45:53,592 --> 00:45:56,158
I should say that I did it
out of my loyalty to you.

701
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:00,897
"I couldn't report my friend
to the police."

702
00:46:01,543 --> 00:46:04,138
Our people have a soft spot
when it comes to affection.

703
00:46:04,873 --> 00:46:07,877
And people will believe me
exactly what I tell them.

704
00:46:10,342 --> 00:46:11,808
And do this again tomorrow.

705
00:46:12,413 --> 00:46:13,647
Oh, right.

706
00:46:14,552 --> 00:46:15,647
And...

707
00:46:20,253 --> 00:46:22,988
if you ever bring that up again,

708
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:27,428
I'll report you
to the police myself.

709
00:46:29,463 --> 00:46:32,328
Don't provoke me, please.

710
00:46:57,992 --> 00:46:59,488
What are you doing?

711
00:47:00,563 --> 00:47:02,928
This is my painting.

712
00:47:04,063 --> 00:47:06,928
It's my painting. I painted this!

713
00:47:18,983 --> 00:47:20,147
He's gone mad.

714
00:47:21,722 --> 00:47:23,017
He's crazy.

715
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:53,848
The sun...

716
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,377
must be red.

717
00:48:00,453 --> 00:48:02,362
He's ruining the painting.

718
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:03,888
I'm not ruining it.

719
00:48:04,322 --> 00:48:05,457
I am finally...

720
00:48:06,293 --> 00:48:08,058
completing it.

721
00:48:17,043 --> 00:48:18,172
You're going to take that?

722
00:48:18,172 --> 00:48:19,442
It's my painting.

723
00:48:19,442 --> 00:48:20,773
You were telling lies
on that live broadcast.

724
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:22,083
You must be out of your mind
for real.

725
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,877
- You crazy...
- It's my painting!

726
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:27,848
I'm the one who painted this.
It's mine!

727
00:48:49,442 --> 00:48:50,537
Mr. Moon.

728
00:48:53,413 --> 00:48:55,377
Why did you try to kill me?

729
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:57,948
You tried twice.

730
00:48:59,983 --> 00:49:01,178
I'm sorry.

731
00:49:01,683 --> 00:49:02,778
I...

732
00:49:06,052 --> 00:49:07,587
trusted you.

733
00:49:07,922 --> 00:49:10,158
I actually trusted and looked up
to you more than my dad.

734
00:49:11,492 --> 00:49:14,488
Shouldn't you at least tell me
why you tried to kill me?

735
00:49:22,103 --> 00:49:23,198
Here.

736
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:25,138
It's my gift to you.

737
00:49:26,112 --> 00:49:28,337
Everything you want to know
is in there.

738
00:49:30,313 --> 00:49:31,848
You'll know once you read it.

739
00:51:03,003 --> 00:51:05,267
June 28, 2020.

740
00:51:05,972 --> 00:51:08,138
In Ho's family
all gathered together.

741
00:51:08,882 --> 00:51:11,578
Sul Young and my plan
began to take off too.

742
00:51:12,353 --> 00:51:15,877
We also prepared nicotine
and a syringe for Bit Na.

743
00:51:16,822 --> 00:51:18,448
Sleeping pills and nicotine.

744
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:21,048
How will In Ho die?

745
00:51:22,123 --> 00:51:24,727
I want his life to end for good.

746
00:51:26,592 --> 00:51:28,857
June 15, 2020.

747
00:51:29,703 --> 00:51:32,172
I successfully moved In Ho's will
from the clock in the hallway...

748
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,997
of the second floor to the safe.

749
00:51:35,103 --> 00:51:37,373
In order to
look at the will secretly,

750
00:51:37,373 --> 00:51:39,337
they will have to
give a sleeping to In Ho.

751
00:51:40,012 --> 00:51:41,138
Yoo In Ho.

752
00:51:41,483 --> 00:51:44,638
You'll end up
falling for your own tricks.

753
00:52:19,012 --> 00:52:22,817
Your call cannot be connected.
You'll be redirected to voice mail.

754
00:55:09,722 --> 00:55:11,618
May 22, 2020.

755
00:55:12,253 --> 00:55:13,618
In Ho collapsed.

756
00:55:14,222 --> 00:55:16,158
He's allergic to sleeping pills.

757
00:55:16,523 --> 00:55:19,857
Sul Young apparently gave him one
because In Ho was too troubled.

758
00:55:20,663 --> 00:55:23,357
But he never takes sleeping pills.

759
00:55:23,663 --> 00:55:26,572
Why did Sul Young
suddenly give him one?

760
00:55:26,572 --> 00:55:28,643
(Yoo Bit Na, 10 percent.
Ji Sul Young, 10 percent.)

761
00:55:28,643 --> 00:55:30,868
(Kim Ji Hye, 10 percent.
Yoo Hae Joon, 10 percent.)

762
00:55:39,683 --> 00:55:42,218
May 31, 2020.

763
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:45,618
Sul Young came to my room
for the first time.

764
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:49,658
She said In Ho is
playing a sort of a game...

765
00:55:49,793 --> 00:55:53,857
to find out how his family feels
by using his will as a bait.

766
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:58,671
And Sul Young told me about her plan
to give him sleeping pills...

767
00:55:58,672 --> 00:56:01,897
by using his game on him.

768
00:56:03,242 --> 00:56:06,713
We decided to find a way
to get rid of Bit Na,

769
00:56:06,713 --> 00:56:07,968
his first inheritor.

770
00:56:09,683 --> 00:56:11,238
(June 13, 2020)

771
00:56:13,552 --> 00:56:16,178
June 13, 2020.

772
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:20,048
Sul Young successfully
switched out...

773
00:56:20,322 --> 00:56:23,118
the letters In Ho made
with the ones she made.

774
00:56:24,592 --> 00:56:26,787
It looked exactly the same
on the outside,

775
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:30,528
so In Ho would have no idea
that the letters were switched out.

776
00:56:32,072 --> 00:56:34,767
It'll be In Ho's birthday soon,

777
00:56:35,472 --> 00:56:37,267
our D-Day.

778
00:56:51,322 --> 00:56:55,388
In Ho will slowly die
after taking sleeping pills.

779
00:57:11,842 --> 00:57:13,437
I have something to say to him.

780
00:57:14,043 --> 00:57:16,308
You don't have to tell me that.

781
00:57:16,942 --> 00:57:18,548
Are you taking that to his room?

782
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:19,678
Yes.

783
00:57:20,753 --> 00:57:23,048
You must have had a tough day.
Great job.

784
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:25,917
No, don't mention it.
Go get some rest.

785
00:57:37,532 --> 00:57:38,828
I'll take that.

786
00:57:46,413 --> 00:57:47,508
I'll have it.

787
00:58:15,143 --> 00:58:16,238
Help...

788
00:58:18,813 --> 00:58:21,707
Help... Help me.

789
00:58:33,492 --> 00:58:34,687
It's time...

790
00:58:36,922 --> 00:58:38,787
for you to help me out.

791
00:58:46,703 --> 00:58:48,198
I lived in agony...

792
00:58:50,773 --> 00:58:52,508
for the last 20 years.

793
00:58:55,143 --> 00:58:57,707
I want to escape
from that agony now.

794
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:05,008
You should...

795
01:00:06,913 --> 01:00:10,048
never have returned to me
after our divorce.

796
01:00:16,063 --> 01:00:17,857
You shouldn't have...

797
01:00:18,933 --> 01:00:21,158
brought me back into this agony.

798
01:00:48,893 --> 01:00:50,822
(CHIP-IN)

799
01:00:50,822 --> 01:00:52,362
Mr. Moon Jeong Wook has died.

800
01:00:52,362 --> 01:00:53,933
How much more are you hiding?

801
01:00:53,933 --> 01:00:56,302
You're going to use this
to play around with me for life?

802
01:00:56,302 --> 01:00:57,302
What are you doing?

803
01:00:57,302 --> 01:00:58,933
- This should be destroyed!
- Are you insane?

804
01:00:58,933 --> 01:01:00,402
Where is everything?

805
01:01:00,402 --> 01:01:02,043
An exhibition to remember Mr. Yoo?

806
01:01:02,043 --> 01:01:03,373
I'm Mr. Yoo's bereaved family.

807
01:01:03,373 --> 01:01:04,373
Should we destroy this?

808
01:01:04,373 --> 01:01:06,012
Once a fraud, always a fraud.

809
01:01:06,012 --> 01:01:09,107
Let us begin the memorial auction
of Painter Yoo In Ho.

810
01:01:09,313 --> 01:01:11,742
110,000 dollars.
120,000 dollars. 150,000 dollars.

811
01:01:11,742 --> 01:01:12,848
200,000 dollars.

812
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:14,948
There's something
we must do together.
