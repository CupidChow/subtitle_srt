- Did you sleep early last night?

- You said you'll give her a lesson.

I didn't do this, okay?

for something you did?

- Uncle.
- If you...

I wasn't severely injured.

for a few more days.

41
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,050

That's why I got discharged.

you remind me of your dad.

Why aren't you getting upset?

48

You hate it the most

before Uncle could see it.

152
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,210
Then suddenly, the door opened.
I thought it was him, so I hid.

153
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,890
I went in to hide a present.

154
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,590
Then suddenly, the door opened.
I was surprised, so I hid.

155
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,600
I went inside to clean, of course.

156

to the back garden this instant.

order me around?

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,890
What are you doing here?

161
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,250
I was looking for In Ho,
but he's not here.

162
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,120
He's in the living room.

163
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,630
Oh, I see.

164
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,890
Why did I not see him?

165
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,240
Goodness.

166
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,680
Why did you hide when I entered
if you had gone there to see him?

167
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,550
I didn't hide.

168
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,180
You must've missed me
due to your poor vision.

169

right now. It's urgent.

170

171
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,840

so much today?

172
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,080
Darn it.

173
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,500
Are you sure it was because
of that letter?

174
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,730
Yes.

175
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,970
It doesn't make any sense.

176
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,640
What is it?

177
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,770
I knew it.

178
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,410
I didn't get
why you suddenly texted me.

179
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,750
Were the dishes too salty for you?

180
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,080
Oh, that text?

181
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,420
Did you even get to see Mr. Yoo?

182
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,360
I went down to the living room,
and he was there.

183
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,600
Hey, how could you be put
under academic probation...

184
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,520
when your tuition is so expensive?

185
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,590
Did you chip in or something?

186
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,060
My brother paid for it.

187
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,630
To be exact, Bit Na's dad
paid for it.

188
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,830
- No, he's my brother.
- Goodness.

189
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,540
Then who was in the room
until the very end?

190
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,710
Hae Joon and your dad.

191
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,510
If both of them were in there,
they probably didn't read the will.

192
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,280
Then who went inside first?

193
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,380
Hae Joon.

194
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,310
Maybe he read it
before your mom came in.

195
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,390
I doubt it. There was no paint
on his palms.

196
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,520
Oh, right.

197
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,090
You had your camera with you
the entire day.

198
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,590
Do you have any more videos?

199
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,130
I recorded another one
during the party later that night.

200
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,200
- We should watch that.
- Okay.

201
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,660
Stay focus.

202
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,060
What is it?

203
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,900
Did you have a nightmare
or something?

204
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,840
No, I'm okay.

205
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,050
Did you do this?

206
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,720
Yes, frame by frame.

207
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,060
You're brilliant.

208
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,890
That was a compliment.

209
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,330
I hate compliments the most.

210
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,300
People only compliment you
when they need something.

211
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,370
You're right. That makes sense.

212
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,540
I thought you'd call me despicable.

213
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,070
What's the point of being nice?

214
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,310
What is it this time?

215
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,320
It's nothing. I've uploaded
these photos on Reveal the Truth.

216
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,280
I thought maybe
they'd spot something.

217
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,190
Goodness, they should've told me.

218
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,540
I mean, they did it.

219
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,430
Look at this.

220
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,200
The sock is inside out. My goodness.

221
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,370
They can't even take off
their socks right.

222
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,640
What?

223
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,550
What is this?

224
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,220
Gosh.

225
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,520
Oh, my. What should I do?

226
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,290
My gosh.

227
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,590
Wait.

228
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,330
The sock is covered in blood.

229
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,300
(Reveal the Truth Behind
Painter Yoo In Ho's Death)

230
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,710
They're amazing.

231
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,810
Why?

232
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,310
Gosh, when did they spot and mark
all of these?

233
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,550
Look at Ms. Park who was behind me.

234
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,290
She's putting something
in the blender.

235
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,370
What? There's only a silhouette.

236
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,460
- Isn't this Yoo Hae Joon?
- No.

237
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,260
Judging by the hair,
it's definitely Dokko Chul.

238
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,840
Don't men have similar hairstyles?

239
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,370
It doesn't matter who it is.

240
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,700
What matters is what he's doing.

241
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,200
Look at where his hands are.

242
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,470
- Don't you see a pill?
- That's my dad.

243
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,910
You're so behind.

244
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,320
We already talked about this.

245
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,240
We said someone
was switching something by the sink.

246
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,860
Raise the brightness of your screen,
and you'll see.

247
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,980
How do you raise it?
They should've brightened it first.

248
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,130
Do they want us to do the work?

249
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,650
Were they both in on it?

250
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,390
What's your take on this?

251
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,450
Do you think whoever fed him
the sleeping pills...

252
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,790
is the culprit?

253
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,090
If they fed him sleeping pills,

254
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,230
then of course, they are.

255
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,160
That's why he passed away.

256
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,880
Who would've known a couple of
sleeping pills would've killed him?

257
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,770
You're more naive than I thought.

258
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,740
They may have known.

259
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,840
Who knows?

260
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,910
This was all because of that letter.

261
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,180
If not, he wouldn't have died.

262
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,450
The letter?

263
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,280
Yes, the letter.

264
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,420
That started off...

265
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,950
this entire mess.

266
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,020
But that letter only told us
where the will was.

267
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,660
It didn't mention
any sleeping pills.

268
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,260
What if the sender already knew?

269
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,400
What if the sender wanted us
to feed him sleeping pills?

270
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,340
Be honest!

271
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,840
Why was there blood on your sock?

272
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,420
You were the one
who hit Bit Na with the golf club,

273
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,720
wasn't it?

274
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,090
It wasn't me.

275
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,060
I'm a witness.

276
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,110
I saw the culprit's silhouette,

277
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,100
but I couldn't identify the person.

278
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,400
I ran away...

279
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,740
because I was afraid
of being suspected.

280
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,380
Do you hear yourself?

281
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,320
You left your cousin
who was bleeding...

282
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,650
and ran away
without even calling 911?

283
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,210
You are the culprit.

284
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,650
We even have evidence.

285
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,550
Let's turn him over to the police.

286
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,920
I'm afraid you can't.

287
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,220
What? I can't?

288
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,920
You punk. How dare you threaten me?

289
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,830
I wasn't threatening you.

290
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,900
I know quite a lot of things.

291
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,160
What do you know?

292
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,770
About your fabrication.

293
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,650
You did give him sleeping pills.

294
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,190
- That's...
- How is one pill...

295
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,490
much different from five?

296
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,160
You did that.

297
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,090
Well...

298
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,630
I wasn't trying to do that.

299
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,130
So...

300
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,880
Fine, I fed him.

301
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,770
But I didn't know
things would turn out this way.

302
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,710
Bit Na.

303
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,910
I'm shocked.

304
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,910
I thought my dad was only guilty
of committing fraud five times,

305
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,650
but he had committed adultery
as well.

306
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,560
Hey, I told you not to call me
for the next few days.

307
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,020
Stop everything for now,
and hide them all.

308
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,160
If I get caught now,
everything will be over.

309
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,130
Gosh, that geezer always tells me
to submit written apologies.

310
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,260
When will he die?

311
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,330
I hope it's soon.

312
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,000
You've been eavesdropping?

313
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,150
I only did this
to catch the culprit.

314
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,140
- Don't be ridiculous.
- The culprit is among us.

315
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,140
How did you do this?

316
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,640
Answer me.

317
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,320
I'll call the police.

318
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,060
Sul Young, you don't need
to call them...

319
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,920
because of family issues.

320
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,190
He's right.
Hae Joon was just being immature.

321
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,960
We don't need to involve the police.

322
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,000
Call the police.

323
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,370
- Hey!
- This shouldn't be taken lightly.

324
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,730
Yes, we should report this.

325
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,940
Ms. Ji, calling the police
will only exacerbate the situation.

326
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,070
Let's just turn a blind eye.

327
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,580
I agree.

328
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,110
What's with you guys?

329
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,950
Fine.

330
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,120
Then I'll call Attorney Jin.

331
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,360
We can ask her for advice
regarding wiretap.

332
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,550
After receiving your call,
I hurriedly looked in this...

333
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,820
and found out something new.

334
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,660
Mr. Yoo adopted Mr. Yoo Hae Joon...

335
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,260
as his son before his death.

336
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,110
What did you say?

337
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,240
He was adopted?

338
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,780
Without saying a word to me?

339
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,840
He went through the process himself
while I was abroad.

340
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,980
I just found out
and ran over in shock.

341
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,450
- I can't believe this.
- Why didn't you tell us?

342
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,350
What would've changed if I told you?

343
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,290
So that I could
get attacked like Bit Na was?

344
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,490
That's why I didn't say anything.
I was afraid someone may attack me.

345
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,830
Why do you all pretend
like you don't know?

346
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,930
You all know she was attacked
because of her inheritance.

347
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,340
We don't know that for sure.

348
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,880
Of course, we know for sure.

349
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,940
It's obvious that
one of us attacked her.

350
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,270
Don't you think so?

351
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,740
You're right. It's one of us.

352
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,050
And you're sitting here despicably
as if nothing had happened.

353
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,520
Wait, then what's going on?

354
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,020
What happens
now that Hae Joon was adopted?

355
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,860
If the will doesn't show up,
Ms. Bit Na and Mr. Hae Joon...

356
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,330
will each inherit
50 percent of his inheritance.

357
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,930
Wait.

358
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,070
Then if something happens to Bit Na,

359
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,870
this jerk will end up
taking his entire fortune, right?

360
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,310
I knew it was you.
I knew you did that to Bit Na.

361
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,450
And you just said
the culprit is one of us.

362
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,600
Why are you framing me
without any evidence?

363
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,990
We don't need any evidence!
What you said is the evidence!

364
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,230
How can my words
be used as evidence?

365
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,900
You should really stop
being that unreasonable.

366
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,570
Wow, I can't believe this.
Look at his attitude.

367
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,700
One second.

368
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,500
Ms. Jin, then what will happen...

369
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,370
once the will is found?

370
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,570
Then it'll be divided
according to his will.

371
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,980
In that case... And I'm asking
just in case. One in a million.

372
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,250
If one of the heirs are
associated with In Ho's death,

373
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,320
then how much will they get?

374
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,920
In that case,

375
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,020
that person's share will be
divided among the other heirs.

376
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,070
Then the 10 percent may end up
turning into 14 or 16.

377
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,160
You're right.

378
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,010
Uncle In Ho thought of me
like I was his own son.

379
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,040
And that's why he adopted you?

380
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,180
Yes.

381
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,080
Yet you kept it as a secret from
your family to protect yourself?

382
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,550
Yes.

383
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,300
You prepared
more surprises than I thought.

with Ji Sul Young")

("Monthly Art")

386
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,220
What more did you leave for us?

387
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,920
I look forward to finding out.

388
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,910
These people got together
and plotted Mr. Yoo's death.

389
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
They chipped in to make it happen.

390
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,610
What do you mean by chipping in?

391
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,860
Chip in.

392
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,360
It means making contributions.

393
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,900
When many people get together,
it's easier to help one person.

394
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,400
I feel bad for this artist.
His family or friend killed him.

395
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,760
What are the police doing?
We're investigating for them.

396
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,340
It seems like he knows, right?

397
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,340
What should I do?

398
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,380
You know, that thing.

399
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,320
Why didn't you report that?

400
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,080
He wouldn't just sit around
if I did.

401
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:52,220
He'll tell the police
that I looked at his will.

402
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,670
I can't let that happen.

403
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,790
You should've told the police.

404
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,630
Were you going to
keep it a secret forever?

405
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,560
You need to tell them everything
to catch who's behind this.

406
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,600
Didn't you hear that
I'll lose my rights?

407
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,940
Hey.

408
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,270
Five million dollars.

409
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,120
Do you expect me to lose that
right before my eyes?

410
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
Someone might have killed Dad.

411
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,450
Who cares about some money?

412
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,650
"Some money"?

413
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,120
It's not like we can save the dead.

414
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,050
If we can't do that, we should
at least get money out of this.

Mom.

416
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,150
No, wait.

417
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,620
If the will isn't found,

418
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,140
you'll end up taking
25 million dollars.

419
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,360
That sounds much better.

420
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,560
- Mom, did you...
- Did I what?

421
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,130
Listen to you.

422
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,130
Do you think I stole his will?

423
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,970
Anyway,
I think that jerk is the guy...

424
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,710
who did that to you.

425
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,810
I don't think so.

426
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,410
I thought about it, but Hae Joon
isn't a type who'd do that.

427
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,180
Who do you think it might be?

428
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,920
That woman?

429
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,350
I heard something too.

430
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,660
There were
many suspicious things about her.

431
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,780
I heard...

432
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,890
you're very good at playing golf.

433
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,290
So?

434
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,060
Is it fun?

435
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,590
I played a few times,
but it wasn't fun at all.

436
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,700
What was that? A hole-in-one?
I heard you did that a few times.

437
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,910
Is that funny?

438
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,910
I won't answer that.

439
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,910
I can see your intention
behind that question.

440
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,910
What intention?

441
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,810
I was just asking.

442
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,190
You should at least
try to beat around the bush.

443
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,320
She's so annoying.

444
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,260
My gosh.

445
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,050
It was you, wasn't it?

446
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,180
What?

447
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,950
The sole of my shoe!

448
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,450
Your sloppiness is why
the police caught you five times.

449
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,390
What did you say, you jerk?
You jerk. Take this.

450
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,360
Darn you!

451
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,730
You little jerk.

452
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,930
- Do you want to die?
- What are you doing?

453
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,270
This jerk...

454
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,270
He stole the will.

from 5 Years Ago Left Unresolved")

(I miss my dad too!)

457
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,170
Hey, where did you hide it?

458
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,580
Where did you hide it?

459
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,180
Tell me now.

460
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,050
Darn it.

461
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,120
Hey, you better tell me soon.

462
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,540
You idiot. Even if you find that,

463
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,780
it won't be good for you at all.
Why are you trying so hard?

464
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,980
Just pretend to look for it
and stop.

465
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,390
That jerk, Dokko Chul,
stole the will.

466
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,920
And he framed me for it?

467
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,190
He's unbelievable.

468
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,130
You don't have
to look for it so hard.

469
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,560
That jerk, Hae Joon, is smart.

470
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,630
He probably
got rid of the will already.

471
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,670
There's no way
he didn't get rid of it.

00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,240

No, you cannot leave with that.

00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,020
- Move, Mom.
- Hey!

479
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,290
You would have to step on me
if you want to go.

480
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,330
Mom!

00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,990
Hey, if you take that outside,

00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,630
you'd be kissing goodbye

- Do you get that?
- So what?

484

Without that, you'll get
25 million dollars.

485
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,000
We should get rid of it.

486
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,080
Hey, let's rip this into pieces
and flush them down.

487
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,880
- Don't be ridiculous. Move.
- Give me that. Give it to me.

488
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,000
- Give me that now!
- Why? Stop that!

489
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,470
- Give me that.
- Stop!

490
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,110
I heard a loud noise.

491
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:24,450
(Will)

492
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,160
It is the original will.

493
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,700
As long as I don't find
any foul play,

494
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,900
it will proceed as it says here.

495
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,140
Thank you.

496
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,510
Doesn't this feel like a game?

497
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,250
"Find the missing will."

498
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,020
I don't want you to nag.
I was just saying.

499
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,430
But once the culprit
behind the sleeping pills is caught,

500
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,990
there will be a scene.

501
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,380
So far, we found
four sleeping pills.

502
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,840
There's one more person involved.

503
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,310
It's obvious. It's Hae Joon
or Aunt Sul Young.

504
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,830
And this too.

505
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,540
- Sun.
- Yes?

506
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,110
On Dad's birthday, Hae Joon gave
him chocolate for his present.

507
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,480
- Chocolate?
- Yes.

508
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,580
Uncle always ate chocolate after
taking his medication at night.

509
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,350
Right. But I doubt he ate
all 12 pieces of the chocolate.

510
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,550
But where's the leftover?

511
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,250
I should send this photo
to Hae Joon.

512
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,820
If he feels guilty, he'll react.

513
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,790
And this photo too.

514
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,430
Aunt Sul Young
is giving Uncle a macaron.

515
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,470
What if the sleeping pill was in it?

516
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,540
I'm going to send
these photos to both of them.

517
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,480
"I know what you did
on his birthday."

518
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,210
Will they react as expected?

519
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,550
We have nothing to lose.

520
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,050
You're right.

521
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,020
(Sending the scheduled
text messages)

522
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,160
Done. Now, we just have to wait
and see their reactions.

523
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,300
(The text messages are
scheduled to be sent.)

524
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,720
I came down to tell you
I got your text message.

525
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,520
You can eat the macaron...

526
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,090
or send it to a lab.
Do whatever you want.

527
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,770
For your information,

528
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,060
your dad enjoyed
this macaron very much that day.

529
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,900
I thought you'd be curious.

530
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,710
Are there any other questions?

531
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,010
Ask them in person
instead of sending me text messages.

532
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,080
I don't think Aunt Sul Young
was the last one.

533
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,230
If it was Hae Joon,

534
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,800
how did he get rid of the chocolate?

535
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,020
Do you think
Hae Joon was already here?

536
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,890
Gosh, this is getting hard.

537
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,200
How long do we have
to stay in here like this?

538
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,060
Let's wait a bit longer.

539
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,350
He's here.

540
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,970
What?

541
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,680
Gosh!

542
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,560
How many times must I tell you?
I got it directly from Europe.

543
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,230
Exactly. Why did you leave
such expensive chocolate there?

544
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,430
I don't need to answer that.
Give it back.

545
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,770
Then, eat it in front of us.

546
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,170
I don't like sweets.

547
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,230
Happy?

548
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,110
Hey!

549
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,420
Here's the chocolate
you didn't get to finish.

550
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,220
Gosh. Hey.

551
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,590
Wake up.

552
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,760
You gave this chocolate
to Mr. Yoo on his birthday.

553
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,900
You deliberately
added sleeping pills in it, right?

554
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,030
Hold on.

555
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,910
Let me make a report
that will get your attention.

556
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,610
Instead of making a report,
answer our questions diligently.

557
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,440
I'm sure you'll find it interesting.

558
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,980
You did give him sleeping pills.

559
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,550
Bit Na, that was an accident.
I wasn't trying to do that.

560
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,290
This is your voice, isn't it?

561
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,060
That jerk.

562
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,460
Dokko Chul.

563
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,370
The night before Mr. Yoo died,

564
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,870
you switched his medication,
correct?

565
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,210
What can you tell
from that blurry photo?

566
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,070
You can't do that.

567
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,540
We improved the quality.

568
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,850
We did confirm that the medication
you're holding is the sleeping pill.

569
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,280
All right. What do you say?
Will you keep lying to us?

570
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,920
And you were the one who stole
the will from Mr. Yoo's safe.

571
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,490
I didn't steal it.
I just borrowed it briefly.

572
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,760
I was going to put it back.

573
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,600
You added the sleeping pill
in the burdock tea Mr. Yoo drank?

574
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,700
Yes.

575
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:28,040
My gosh, that jerk. Yoo Hae Joon!

576
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,210
"Hae Joon, that jerk."

577
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,960
("Path", Working title)

578
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,140
If they didn't know about his
allergic reaction to sleeping pills,

579
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,500
- isn't that manslaughter?
- They can get out on probation.

580
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,430
Are you the judge?
What happens to the inheritance?

581
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,730
Will the killers get
the inheritance too?

582
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,730
- That's so sad.
- I'm a lawyer.

583
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,540
Anyone who murdered the deceased...

584
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,580
will lose their rights as the heir.

585
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,810
The others should get the money
equally except for these people.

586
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,010
I'm hanging up.

587
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,250
Aren't you worried about your dad?

588
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,780
This isn't the first time.
Why would I worry about him?

589
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,140
I can't believe
I'm in here with my nephew.

590
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,010
You're a law student. How could
you end up here out of all places?

591
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,310
By the way,
did you really attack Bit Na?

592
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:19,680
No, I didn't.

593
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,460
Didn't you attack her?

594
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,120
You little punk. Have you gone mad?

595
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,020
How dare you make
such an accusation?

596
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,060
It's hot in here. Get away from me.

597
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,500
It's an etiquette to stay 1m away
from other people in here.

598
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,000
Gosh, don't make it obvious
that it's your first time here.

599
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,270
Are we good now?

600
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:41,800
Don't block the door over there.

601
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,540
Gosh. Come on.

602
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,750
Ms. Park.

603
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,250
I heard you added the sleeping pill
in In Ho's loach soup.

604
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,350
How could you do that?

605
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,600
Look who's talking.

606
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,420
You and I aren't in the same league.

607
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,830
How are we different?

608
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,600
I'm his family,
but you're a stranger to him.

609
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,200
Family, my foot.

610
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:15,400
Mr. Yoo didn't accept you
as his family.

611
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:19,850
What did you say?

612
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:23,710
Isn't it worse to put sleeping pill
in his food when you're his family?

613
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,020
It's better that a stranger
secretly fed him sleeping pills.

614
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,180
So are you saying
your action is justified?

615
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,020
I didn't say that.

616
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,390
I'm already livid as it is.

617
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,590
Stop it.

618
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,210
If you tell me to stop,

619
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,530
do I have to stop?

620
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,530
What's this?

621
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:21,300
Someone sent this letter
to my family.

622
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,310
(Will)

623
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,650
Where did you get this?

624
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,520
I got it from my mom.

625
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,150
Why didn't you give it to me
when you first got it?

626
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:40,920
I wanted to find the person...

627
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,130
who sent the letters myself.

628
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,760
Go on.

629
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:49,900
Did you find anything?

630
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,400
Let us handle the case now.

631
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,310
The one who sent the letters
is the real culprit.

632
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,310
The others were only deceived
by the culprit.

633
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,920
I'm not saying
that they are innocent.

634
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,090
But the real culprit is the one
who sent the letters.

635
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:12,990
Ms. Yoo. This won't
be enough to do anything.

636
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,190
Until we find more concrete
evidence, please wait.

637
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,000
You're not going to wrap up
the investigation here, right?

638
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,080
When I call out your name,
raise your hand.

639
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,170
Number one.

640
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:33,510
Who was the first one
to enter Mr. Yoo's room that night?

641
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,120
Ms. Kim.
What time did you enter his room?

642
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,650
- Around 2 a.m.
- Tell me the exact time.

643
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,490
2:01 a.m.

644
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,890
Mr. Dokko, when did you go in?

645
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:50,990
2:30 a.m.

646
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,540
Then, Ms. Kim was 1st to go in.
And Mr. Dokko was 2nd.

647
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,580
And that's when Mr. Dokko
took the will out from the safe.

648
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,740
And Ms. Park was third to go in.

649
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,440
You're not going to tell us
when you went in?

650
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,710
By the looks of it, I think
he was the third one to go in.

651
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,830
Right. Mr. Moon
was the last one to go in.

652
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,690
He said he took off his cardigan
and wiped the fingerprints.

653
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,700
But seeing how
his fingerprints were wiped too,

654
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,120
he probably went in before Mr. Moon.

655
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,660
And Ms. Park entered
before Mr. Moon.

656
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,290
Ms. Park Jin Sook.

657
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:30,000
Then, Mr. Yoo was 3rd.
Ms. Park was 4th.

658
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,310
And Mr. Moon was
the last one to go in.

659
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:35,410
The estimated time of death
was around 11:30 p.m. to 12:00 a.m.

660
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:38,210
So everyone went in
after he had died.

661
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,910
Okay. Now, let's check the time
he consumed the sleeping pills.

662
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:45,110
Ms. Park was first...

663
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,750
to give him sleeping pills...

664
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,250
by blending the pill
into his loach soup around 9:30 p.m.

665
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:52,520
He really didn't have
a lot of the soup.

666
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,500
He barely had 1 or 2 spoonfuls
of the soup.

667
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,630
He barely ate it.

668
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,260
Don't be ridiculous.
I saw him eat at the table.

669
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:02,430
He finished everything in his bowl.

670
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:05,730
He ate every drop of it
and didn't leave anything.

671
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:09,170
Right. I saw him too.
He enjoyed the soup very much.

672
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,580
You were the first one to
secretly feed him a sleeping pill.

673
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,560
Mr. Dokko, you were second.

674
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,750
Why am I second?

675
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,060
All right.
I added the sleeping pill...

676
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,350
in the medication
he was going to take.

677
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:27,060
But she said she added
the sleeping pill in his medication.

678
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,830
And since In Ho took the medication,

679
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:33,600
she and I would both be third.
That's only right.

680
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,660
Then, both of you can be second.

681
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,000
Gosh.

682
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,140
When he took the medication,
he also drank the burdock tea.

683
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,410
So Mr. Moon was third.

684
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:43,570
No. When he took the medication,

685
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,210
he...

686
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,640
drank the burdock tea too.

687
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,060
All three of us would be second.

688
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,150
Let us do our job. Please be quiet.

689
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,790
What? The order is very important.
Why would I stay quiet?

690
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:58,020
You're not supposed
to violate our rights as suspects.

691
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,770
Right. This is very important.
You can't do a sloppy job here.

692
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,330
You ought to be more thorough
for cases like this.

693
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:05,640
Shouldn't we call lawyers now?

694
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,500
Yes, sure. Ms. Kim, Mr. Dokko,
Mr. Moon, you're all second.

695
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,760
Are you happy?

696
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,800
Mr. Yoo, you're last.
No objections, right?

697
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,790
You put sleeping pills in it
and gave him the chocolate.

698
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:24,280
You knew that the deceased ate
chocolate after taking medication.

699
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:27,380
Gosh.

700
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,990
Hey, you'd better answer him.

701
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,190
We told him the truth.

702
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,770
Will you not cooperate with him?

703
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,420
Do you think we don't know
how to plead the Fifth?

704
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,870
I'll plead the Fifth.

705
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,040
Scratch all the statements
I made so far.

706
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,000
We can't just do that
because you ask us to.

707
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,100
It's only fair that
either we all tell the truth...

708
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,850
or we all plead the Fifth together.

709
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,350
Only he's getting away with it.

710
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:53,020
What if we get framed for the crime?

711
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,250
- Right. Erase what I told you.
- Yes, do it.

712
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,890
- I know you can't do that, but...
- Just this once. Please.

713
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,290
- Detective Kang, do something!
- I know, but...

714
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,380
- Erase the statement this once.
- You know what? That punk...

715

("5 Suspects Arrested for Giving
Sleeping Pills to Murder Yoo")

716
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,500
(Chip In)

717
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,620
Five suspects who chipped in
to murder the painter, Yoo,

718
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,450
by secretly giving him
sleeping pills...

719
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:01,040
were arrested without a warrant.

720
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,880
After bidding farewell to my love,

721
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,050
I will always remember...

722
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,180
that he is with me even if he
may not be here physically with me.

723
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,120
- I have something to tell you.
- If you want to accuse me,

724
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,500
- bring me evidence.
- You're way too focused...

725
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,850
on Aunt Sul Young.

726
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,270
Why don't we gather
all of his paintings...

727
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:15,770
and sell them at a memorial exhibit?

728
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,140
Gosh, we'd make a fortune.

729
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,040
Don't say something
like that carelessly. Okay?

730
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,330
You want to frame one of us
as the person who sent the letters?

731
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,230
Once we get the inheritance,
we can chip in and give some money.

732
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:25,480
Aunt Sul Young, do you think
there's a mastermind behind them?

733
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,870
I'm sure you want to frame me.

734
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,400
I bet you're dying to make me...

735
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,950
- the culprit.
- What's your deal?

736
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:32,540
How could you be so brazen?

737
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:38,380
