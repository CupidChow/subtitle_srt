1
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:15,062
September 5, 2019.

2
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:16,761
I'm driven mad with anger.

3
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:19,367
I thought In Ho would
pass away from this world soon,

4
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:21,132
but he has fully recovered.

5
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:23,201
The doctor said this was a miracle,

6
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:25,872
but I wanted to shout out,
"This is a disaster!"

7
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:29,642
June 12, 2019.

8
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:34,482
Sul Young moved in
to look after In Ho.

9
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:37,151
I wonder how she feels.

10
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:41,182
In Ho had an affair
and a child with another woman.

11
00:00:41,786 --> 00:00:45,792
But he doesn't know Sul Young was
once pregnant and had a miscarriage.

12
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:47,527
(Did Sul Young truly forgive In Ho?)

13
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:50,832
Did Sul Young truly forgive In Ho?

14
00:01:15,586 --> 00:01:17,651
Is there a guardian you can contact?

15
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:19,662
No.

16
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:23,532
You had...

17
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:26,162
a miscarriage.

18
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:32,002
I don't think you'll be able
to have another baby.

19

(Uncontested Divorce Form)

20
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:26,222
(Yoo In Ho, Ji Sul Young)

21
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:58,397
(In Ho had an affair
and a child with another woman.)

22
00:02:58,397 --> 00:03:00,097
(But he doesn't know Sul Young was
once pregnant...)

23
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,192
(and had a miscarriage.)

24
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:09,201
(Did Sul Young truly forgive In Ho?)

25
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:22,782
(Did Sul Young truly forgive In Ho?)

26
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:54,312
Where are you going? Hold on.

27
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:56,912
Where are you taking this?

28
00:03:57,657 --> 00:03:59,726
- This should be destroyed.
- What?

29
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:01,551
I should destroy this.

30
00:04:01,726 --> 00:04:03,692
Oh, my! What are you doing?

31
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:04,851
Bit Na!

32
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:07,421
What are you doing?

33
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:15,402
What's going on?

34
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:18,631
Have you gone mad?
Do you know how expensive this is?

35
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:21,041
Gosh. You...

36
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:24,171
Wait. What's this painting?

37
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:05,371
(CHIP-IN)

38
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:10,787
Why did you destroy that painting?
Why?

39
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,882
(Final Episode)

40
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:14,981
I just don't know what's going
through your mind these days.

41
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:17,191
I really don't.

42
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:21,361
How much did you know about Dad?

43
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:24,592
Why are you asking that
out of the blue?

44
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:28,902
Why did you love someone like him?

45
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:33,272
Not only was he hypocritical
but inhumane as well.

46
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:37,512
He's no longer my dad.

47
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:39,712
What are you talking about?

48
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:46,421
Is there something you know?

49
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:49,452
And that painting
you just destroyed...

50
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:52,127
What's that painting anyway?

51
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:53,997
Why was it behind ours?

52
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,322
It's so unsettling.

53
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:59,561
What's that painting?
Why did Sul Young bawl?

54
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:06,445
Where are you going?

55
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:07,642
I'm going to get some fresh air.

56
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:09,472
At this hour?

57
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:11,317
I'll go with you.

58
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:13,811
I'm going to be in the garden.
You can sleep first.

59
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:16,082
My gosh.

60
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:20,152
I really don't get it.

61
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:30,491
I'm going on a business trip.

62
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:32,662
For how many days this time?

63
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:34,902
Three days.

64
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:39,202
Why do you go
on so many business trips?

65
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:41,472
Why?

66
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:44,317
Are you going to corner me
like last time...

67
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:45,912
and suspect me for cheating?

68
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:59,351
I don't see the point
in living like this.

69
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:03,061
Let's put an end to this.

70
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:07,632
Are you going to leave me
when I'm dying?

71
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:09,972
Didn't I tell you?

72
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:13,171
I want to die by your side.

73
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:18,611
You want to die by my side?

74
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:22,547
How do you think
things would've been...

75
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:23,712
if we were parents?

76
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:32,392
I've told you many times
that I wanted a kid.

77
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:35,191
At times like this,
I resent you for saying no.

78
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:41,502
If we had a kid...

79
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:04,652
Why are you giving that to me?

80
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,532
You always annoy me like this.

81
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:14,362
Did you think I'd be thankful...

82
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:18,201
and shed a tear
if you gave that to me?

83
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:22,441
Or did you expect me to be moved
and turn myself in?

84
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:25,571
It's not like that.

85
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:26,941
What is it?

86
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:29,647
Are you going to use that
against me and abuse me...

87
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,352
like your dad did?

88
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:37,291
Just like how he abused Jeong Wook?

89
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,232
You're just like him.

90
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:47,301
I'm not going to turn myself in.

91
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:51,206
Since I know that was why
you came here,

92
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:52,372
I vehemently refuse to do so.

93
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:53,602
I won't.

94
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:58,112
I'll leave you to decide.

95
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,211
Whether you do it or not,

96
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:03,912
I don't care anymore.

97
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:07,652
Just be straightforward
like your mom!

98
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:11,291
You say that it's my decision,

99
00:10:11,996 --> 00:10:13,591
but you're just
slyly controlling me.

100
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:17,032
You remind me of your dad,
and it disgusts me!

101
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:52,061
Mr. Moon Jeong Wook passed away
a few hours ago.

102
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:53,961
What?

103
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:56,431
Jeong Wook died?

104
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:58,971
We'll only find out the cause
of death through an autopsy.

105
00:10:58,976 --> 00:11:01,471
But we found him dead
in his own car,

106
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:03,142
and we also found this.

107
00:11:09,787 --> 00:11:11,112
Did you find...

108
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:13,856
a suicide note?

109
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:14,951
A suicide note?

110
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:19,421
Did Mr. Moon seem any different
after the live broadcast?

111
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:23,191
Well... I...

112
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:28,394
How much are you keeping from us?

113
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:24,774
(Ji Sul Young)

114
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:35,524
Help... Help me...

115
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:52,339
(Sul Young successfully
switched out...)

116
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:53,574
(the letters In Ho made
with the ones she made.)

117
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:15,894
You were the monster.

118
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:22,003
You were...

119
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,174
the true monster.

120
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:57,233
So Jeong Wook...

121
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,274
is dead?

122
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:18,199
- Ms. Park, what's wrong?
- Yes?

123
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:19,398
They're gone.

124
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:20,493
What are?

125
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:23,969
Where did all the paintings go?

126
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:27,008
I swear they were here last night.

127
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:28,268
I think we were robbed.

128
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:30,103
"Robbed"? Gosh.

129
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,574
I think I know...

130
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:33,603
who did it.

131
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:40,014
What does that say?
"Don't 'looc' for me."

132
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:42,983
He stole all of them?

133
00:15:42,988 --> 00:15:44,654
Gosh, that conman.

134
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:47,324
I knew he'd cause trouble
sooner or later.

135
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:49,853
We have a problem.

136
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:51,524
Attorney Jin.

137
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:53,764
Why are you here
this early in the morning?

138
00:15:53,868 --> 00:15:55,264
I lost the will.

139
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:57,939
What? You lost the will?

140
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:00,664
Last night,
a thief broke into my office.

141
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,133
And they only stole the will.

142
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:08,579
I think I know who did that.

143
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:10,973
- Sorry?
- Dokko Chul!

144
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:23,324
Are you here to see how
a conman's daughter looks?

145
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:25,329
He's always scamming people.

146
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,924
I'm too used to that to get hurt.

147
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:30,493
You're right.

148
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:33,238
It doesn't suit us to be friendly.

149
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:35,164
We need to be cold
toward each other...

150
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,103
like how we were
when we first arrived here.

151
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:41,949
- And...
- What now?

152
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:43,304
I'm sorry...

153
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:45,713
for not telling you.

154
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:51,184
I knew you trusted me.

155
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:54,358
I was scared you'd no longer do so
if I told you.

156
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:56,524
Of course, I wouldn't have.
How could I?

157
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,024
Then I guess I did the right thing.

158
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:04,194
I'm sorry.

159
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,669
You were the only one
among them who I trusted.

160
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:09,564
And this is what you give in return?

161
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:12,774
If you're done talking, leave.

162
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:27,454
It was difficult for me
to open up...

163
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,454
about the assault case.

164
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,964
I think I had wanted to forget
about that as well.

165
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:43,873
I had denied doing it
for a long time...

166
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:46,603
that I had started to believe it.

167
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:51,544
Up until he brought it up,
I had forgotten about it as well.

168
00:17:56,518 --> 00:17:59,383
Isn't it so stupid of me
to want to erase something...

169
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:01,353
I've done in the past?

170
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:04,693
I'm guilty of doing that as well.

171
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:07,224
It's about my dad.

172
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:12,193
At times, I want to deny the fact...

173
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:15,433
that my dad is a conman.

174
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:39,454
We dug the area
you had told us about...

175
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:41,324
and found a body.

176
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:43,494
How did you know?

177
00:18:48,308 --> 00:18:49,764
This is my painting!

178
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:52,504
It's my painting. I painted this!

179
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:56,443
Your dad is buried near the factory.

180
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:01,683
Judging by the skeleton,

181
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:04,454
he must've been here
for a very long time.

182
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:21,704
I'll be quick. You can stay here.

183
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:22,869
Can I come with you?

184
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:23,974
Not today.

185
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,974
Don't go anywhere and stay here.

186
00:19:32,848 --> 00:19:36,083
I was... I was too late.

187
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:40,454
I came too late.

188
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:43,754
I'm sorry.

189
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:47,863
Dad...

190
00:20:21,828 --> 00:20:25,298
We were around Dokko Chul
for too long...

191
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:27,068
that we forgot he's a conman.

192
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:28,338
Exactly.

193
00:20:28,338 --> 00:20:30,439
Once a conman, always a conman.

194
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:33,204
By the way, is there no way
to receive the inheritance...

195
00:20:33,238 --> 00:20:35,277
without the will?

196
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:36,774
If there's no will,

197
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:38,748
Yoo Bit Na and Yoo Hae Joon...

198
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:41,244
may receive 50 percent each.

199
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:42,643
"50 percent"?

200
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:44,454
How much is that?

201
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:47,014
25 million dollars?

202
00:20:47,088 --> 00:20:49,359
Does that mean
the rest won't receive any of it?

203
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,024
Nothing's for certain as of now.

204
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:53,258
There may be a change
in the amount of inheritance,

205
00:20:53,258 --> 00:20:56,527
so I'm afraid I'll have to stop
the execution of the will for now.

206
00:20:56,528 --> 00:20:58,439
I agree.
We should be careful about this.

207
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:01,863
Dokko Chul, that darn scumbag.

208
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:05,274
I ought to give him a beating.

209
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:06,603
Gosh.

210
00:21:07,008 --> 00:21:10,044
Gosh, why is the inside of my ear
so itchy?

211
00:21:12,578 --> 00:21:13,673
Over here.

212
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:19,919
Were you the one who mentioned
the memorial exhibition?

213
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,258
Yes, that's me.

214
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:23,558
I'm Mr. Yoo's bereaved family.

215
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:24,724
You are?

216
00:21:25,298 --> 00:21:29,093
I'm the late Yoo In Ho's
only brother.

217
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:35,363
("New Earth")

218
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:45,219
Where did you find this?

219
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:46,343
Reveal the Truth.

220
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:52,554
What? A memorial exhibition?

221
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:56,629
I'm certain
this is Dokko Chul's doing.

222
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:59,229
I bet he's trying
to sell the paintings.

223
00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:02,169
That fraud even took everything
that was meant for Bit Na.

224
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:04,199
But she'll still get
25 million dollars...

225
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,294
once the will is gone for good.

226
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:08,163
That's that.

227
00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:10,439
Those paintings
will be worth a lot too.

228
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:12,578
Goodness, you're awfully greedy.

229
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:14,034
Why is that greed?

230
00:22:14,248 --> 00:22:16,004
She's taking what's meant for her.

231
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:31,123
Did I ever tell you?

232
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,954
I don't care
about Uncle In Ho's assets.

233
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:35,623
Me neither.

234
00:22:35,998 --> 00:22:39,093
I hope everything he made
in such a way would disappear.

235
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:40,464
I don't even need a penny.

236
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:42,704
Should we make them disappear?

237
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:45,403
We don't have to
let the adults benefit.

238
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,704
Got a plan?

239
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:49,103
Yes.

240
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:01,853
I thought I should see you...

241
00:23:02,629 --> 00:23:04,524
before I head over
to the police station.

242
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:08,893
I'm going to turn myself in.

243
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:12,433
May I...

244
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:14,564
ask you why?

245
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:22,143
I've always lived my life
within the lines.

246
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:25,913
I've never crossed street lane lines
even as I drove.

247
00:23:27,988 --> 00:23:29,784
But I realized that...

248
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:34,054
I certainly crossed over a line
I shouldn't cross as a human.

249
00:23:35,488 --> 00:23:37,758
The more I tried to hide my sin,
the more hideous I became.

250
00:23:37,758 --> 00:23:38,994
I know it's late,

251
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,964
but I want to
stop living a hideous life.

252
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:49,633
Before you go,

253
00:23:51,078 --> 00:23:52,704
there's something
we must do together.

254
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:56,974
Yes, it's me.

255
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:01,183
I'm going to sell everything,
so bring everything in the storage.

256
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,843
It's fine. Don't worry about that.

257
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,883
All right. Okay, I got you. Okay.

258
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:13,123
All done.

259
00:24:18,969 --> 00:24:20,064
It's good.

260
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:22,863
Let me try this one.

261
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,873
Have some water too.

262
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:29,974
Thanks.

263
00:24:38,219 --> 00:24:40,054
There's something
I need to tell you.

264
00:24:40,318 --> 00:24:43,824
Don't be scared. Go ahead.

265
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:01,074
What do you want?
You never came to see me first.

266
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:02,403
Is that so?

267
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:10,784
I'm going to stop
the memorial exhibition.

268
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,324
I'm all for it.

269
00:25:15,488 --> 00:25:16,784
And one more thing.

270
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:19,954
- Water.
- What?

271
00:25:22,268 --> 00:25:25,863
Wait, so we can't get a penny
of his inheritance?

272
00:25:26,939 --> 00:25:29,863
- No.
- Not even a penny from his fortune?

273
00:25:32,238 --> 00:25:33,534
Including this house?

274
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:35,143
Most likely.

275
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:37,443
Is that impossible?

276
00:25:37,949 --> 00:25:39,343
This is impossible.

277
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:41,214
Ms. Park...

278
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:46,754
Don't look at me like that.
You'll make me feel weak.

279
00:25:50,488 --> 00:25:51,824
Don't do that.

280
00:25:51,998 --> 00:25:54,923
Will you please let me eat?
Let me eat!

281
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:58,139
It'll be sad to move out
of this house, but okay.

282
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,268
Are you sure?

283
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:01,238
I'm sick of having a conman
as a dad.

284
00:26:01,238 --> 00:26:04,103
I'll do anything
to teach him a huge lesson.

285
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:07,304
Okay.

286
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:24,088
Like I mentioned last time,

287
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:26,828
please be mindful of the arrangement
since he has a lot of artwork.

288
00:26:26,828 --> 00:26:28,128
Of course, we will.

289
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:31,093
But what about
the other bereaved family members?

290
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:33,369
They left it to me.

291
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:35,909
I've always had good connections
when it comes to cultural business.

292
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:38,508
Oh, I see.

293
00:26:38,508 --> 00:26:40,679
Wait, did I tell you?

294
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,348
There's someone who's going around
saying they're In Ho's family,

295
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:44,748
so I've been getting headaches.

296
00:26:44,748 --> 00:26:45,943
Is that so?

297
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:47,518
Just in case someone comes by...

298
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:50,518
saying they're In Ho's family
and wants to see you,

299
00:26:50,518 --> 00:26:52,318
you should never meet them.

300
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:54,088
Okay. Don't worry about it.

301
00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:55,224
All right.

302
00:26:55,629 --> 00:26:58,054
No. I'm totally against this idea.

303
00:26:58,258 --> 00:26:59,423
Mom.

304
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:02,629
No matter what you do,
I'll stop you.

305
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:05,068
I'm going to give it back to society
even if I don't do this.

306
00:27:05,068 --> 00:27:07,498
Then just give it back to society.

307
00:27:07,498 --> 00:27:09,969
That's much better than
blowing it up without any meaning.

308
00:27:09,969 --> 00:27:11,479
How is this meaningless?

309
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:12,833
Then what's the meaning?

310
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:15,649
And everyone
in this house is crazy...

311
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:17,074
for going along
with this child's play.

312
00:27:17,248 --> 00:27:18,679
Just blame me
if you want to say something.

313
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,173
How can I not blame them?

314
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,784
They should be stopping you,
not encouraging you.

315
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:25,219
Mom, please.

316
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:26,913
Will you please get a grip?

317
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:29,724
- Mom!
- Stop calling me!

318
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:35,123
That's an expensive painting.
Be careful.

319
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:37,738
And make sure
you hang that up properly.

320
00:27:37,738 --> 00:27:41,304
That's good. But this is...
One second. Hey.

321
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:45,238
Hey, why are you leaving
so much space between the paintings?

322
00:27:45,238 --> 00:27:46,639
You need to place them closer.

323
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:50,443
It's better to have this much space
for the spectators to look at these.

324
00:27:51,348 --> 00:27:54,419
No one comes to look at these
to a memorial exhibition.

325
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:55,488
They come to buy it.

326
00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:58,383
There are many more coming,
so put them closer to each other.

327
00:27:58,488 --> 00:28:00,359
Over there too. Put those closer.

328
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,729
I'm checking back in an hour.

329
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:02,954
- Yes.
- Yes.

330
00:28:29,848 --> 00:28:31,083
Mom, what are you up to?

331
00:28:33,758 --> 00:28:35,784
What is this? Goodness.

332
00:28:36,629 --> 00:28:37,954
I can see right through you.

333
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,853
No means no.

334
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,798
Just lie down. Lie down.

335
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:47,139
What's with you?
I'm allergic to cucumbers.

336
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:48,139
Really?

337
00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:50,863
I'm not changing my mind
no matter what you do.

338
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:01,984
Mom.

339
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:05,183
I have a lot to be sorry for you.

340
00:29:05,689 --> 00:29:07,254
Is that so?

341
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:15,593
I'm sorry I was born
as your daughter.

342
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:17,264
You.

343
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:20,538
That's cheating.

344
00:29:20,538 --> 00:29:22,564
And I'm sorry
I'm moving ahead with this plan.

345
00:29:22,838 --> 00:29:25,133
Stop making me feel weak.

346
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:28,474
I'll be a good daughter from now on.
Just this once, please.

347
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:32,214
Please do as I ask just this once.
I ask of you. Please?

348
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:35,284
You brat.

349
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:38,353
You came after my weakest spots.

350
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:40,518
Mom.

351
00:29:40,518 --> 00:29:41,959
Whatever. Forget it.

352
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:44,524
- Mom, come on.
- My goodness.

353
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:48,028
- Why is your hand so tense?
- Gosh.

354
00:29:48,028 --> 00:29:49,123
Does that feel good?

355
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:50,929
I think I suddenly got sick.

356
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:52,869
Hey, why are you so weak?

357
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:53,969
You come here.

358
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:56,534
- I'll do it for you.
- Stay still. What about your arms?

359
00:29:58,609 --> 00:30:00,804
You're in charge of the director's
office on the second floor.

360
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,748
And make sure you use
the big stairs...

361
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:04,979
- instead of the small ones...
- Let me tell you once again...

362
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:06,343
that I'm against this plan.

363
00:30:12,088 --> 00:30:15,083
Hey, what if your mom
ends up ruining the plan?

364
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:17,083
Should we leave her out of this?

365
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:20,494
She'll get angrier and ruin it
for good if we leave her out.

366
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:22,764
Hey, you two.

367
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:25,734
If you're going to talk, speak up.
Stop whispering.

368
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:30,163
Tell us for sure if you're
joining us or if you aren't.

369
00:30:30,238 --> 00:30:31,879
If you aren't, you can stay out.

370
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:35,173
Who are you to tell me
to stay out of this?

371
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:38,943
Once again,

372
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:40,974
I'm against this plan.

373
00:30:42,018 --> 00:30:44,853
But I'm not staying out of this.

374
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:47,954
I'm doing this against my will.

375
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:50,024
Make sure you remember that.

376
00:30:50,988 --> 00:30:52,123
You wench.

377
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:55,193
Keep going.

378
00:30:55,328 --> 00:30:57,423
How are we going to
evade the employees?

379
00:30:57,498 --> 00:30:59,964
Ms. Park will be in charge of that.

380
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:01,238
On the first floor...

381
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:02,633
Should we use sleeping pills?

382
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:06,074
People slip it into drinks
in movies.

383
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,449
Don't talk about sleeping pills.

384
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:13,143
I still wake up in the middle of
the night when I hear of it.

385
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:14,889
Don't even joke about it.

386
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:16,149
Be serious.

387
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:18,159
I'm trying to lighten the mood.

388
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,413
It's not fun at all
to see everyone so tense.

389
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:21,883
It's not fun.

390
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:30,863
Okay, fine. I'll be serious.

391
00:31:40,894 --> 00:31:42,094
Are we all ready?

392
00:31:42,094 --> 00:31:43,729
We're about to have
a lot of visitors.

393
00:31:43,763 --> 00:31:46,004
- Of course.
- Like I mentioned last time,

394
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:48,459
be careful of those
who claim to be his family.

395
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:51,572
Don't worry.
I won't fall for anyone.

396
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:52,898
Sounds good.

397
00:31:53,573 --> 00:31:55,037
All right.

398
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:40,083
Goodness, sir.

399
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,222
- Yes, hello.
- Hello.

400
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:42,847
Let me show you the way.

401
00:32:47,492 --> 00:32:49,728
Thank you for coming, sir.

402
00:32:49,992 --> 00:32:51,863
- Is your business going well?
- Thanks to you.

403
00:32:51,863 --> 00:32:54,628
You look younger and younger
each time we meet, ma'am.

404
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:58,168
There's only one way
to divert his attention.

405
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:00,468
Jin Sook, go!

406
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:06,777
Ready, action.

407
00:33:18,523 --> 00:33:19,958
Thank you for coming.

408
00:33:20,192 --> 00:33:22,257
I'll show you the way.
This way, please.

409
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:25,827
Let's go.

410
00:33:48,323 --> 00:33:49,448
Hey.

411
00:33:50,793 --> 00:33:52,692
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

412
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:55,158
Why did you ruin the painting?

413
00:33:55,323 --> 00:33:56,962
Did you eat something weird?
What's with you?

414
00:33:56,962 --> 00:33:59,033
My gosh, what are you going to do?

415
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:00,563
- What are you talking about?
- What's going on?

416
00:34:00,563 --> 00:34:02,033
- I'm sorry.
- No, she's...

417
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:03,702
- He ruined this painting.
- my sister, and...

418
00:34:03,702 --> 00:34:05,303
- I was so shocked.
- No, I'm her brother,

419
00:34:05,303 --> 00:34:07,142
but I didn't do it. You can
look at the security footage.

420
00:34:07,142 --> 00:34:08,303
I'm so sorry.

421
00:34:08,303 --> 00:34:10,043
He just ruined the painting.

422
00:34:10,043 --> 00:34:11,373
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

423
00:34:11,373 --> 00:34:12,942
Hey, what's with you? Sun, hey.

424
00:34:12,942 --> 00:34:14,142
- I told you...
- No, I'm her brother.

425
00:34:14,142 --> 00:34:15,813
- to stop doing that outside.
- You can look at it.

426
00:34:15,813 --> 00:34:17,283
- I'm her brother. Wait.
- My gosh.

427
00:34:17,283 --> 00:34:18,412
- I told you to stop.
- Fine, I'll leave.

428
00:34:18,412 --> 00:34:20,223
You. Hey, I'll see you later.

429
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:22,648
I told you not to do that!

430
00:34:27,823 --> 00:34:29,688
Mom, why are you following me?

431
00:34:30,763 --> 00:34:32,898
Stop ruining the plan and go.

432
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:36,327
Hey, there's an employee.

433
00:34:37,303 --> 00:34:38,398
Smile.

434
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:41,867
May I help you?

435
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,137
Hello.

436
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:46,712
This is Yoo Bit Na,

437
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:48,913
- Mr. Yoo In Ho's daughter.
- I see.

438
00:34:48,913 --> 00:34:51,082
- Hello.
- Hello.

439
00:34:51,082 --> 00:34:54,878
If it's all right,
may we meet the director?

440
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:57,351
I have something to say
to the director.

441
00:34:57,352 --> 00:34:58,493
The director?

442
00:34:58,493 --> 00:34:59,958
Yes, this is very urgent.

443
00:35:01,022 --> 00:35:03,387
Yes, of course. This way, please.

444
00:35:09,062 --> 00:35:12,767
I'm Mr. Yoo's only blood,
his biological younger brother.

445
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:15,668
That's why he left
all these paintings with me.

446
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:19,168
That's why I can explain
every single one of them to you.

447
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:23,947
Now, this painting.
This is a very precious one.

448
00:35:23,953 --> 00:35:26,223
He painted this
right before he got famous,

449
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:27,752
so not a lot of people
know about it.

450
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:30,021
This is a piece you need to get.

451
00:35:30,022 --> 00:35:32,447
The price will skyrocket.

452
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:36,927
In that case,
please look at this one.

453
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:40,533
It's a piece that most art lovers
have seen once or twice,

454
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:42,298
so I'll skip the explanation.

455
00:35:43,772 --> 00:35:44,927
What do you think?

456
00:35:48,203 --> 00:35:51,407
I see you're a quiet type.

457
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:54,677
In that case,
let's move onto the next one.

458
00:36:00,922 --> 00:36:04,752
Right, I'll tell you about this one.
This piece is...

459
00:36:04,752 --> 00:36:07,763
Excuse me, someone claiming
to be Mr. Yoo's daughter is here.

460
00:36:07,763 --> 00:36:08,858
Is that so?

461
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:12,588
Goodness, hey.

462
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:15,958
She wants to look at this piece,
so please give her some assistance.

463
00:36:16,402 --> 00:36:18,528
Something just came up. I'm sorry.

464
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:21,738
My gosh!
Please take good care of her.

465
00:36:22,243 --> 00:36:24,172
This is a piece...

466
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:27,978
that includes the joy and sorrow
which Mr. Yoo has felt.

467
00:36:29,283 --> 00:36:31,478
- Are you all right?
- I'm sad.

468
00:36:33,053 --> 00:36:36,217
It seems like this painting
includes all of your sadness too.

469
00:36:36,723 --> 00:36:39,017
I can feel Mr. Yoo's heart.

470
00:37:03,852 --> 00:37:04,947
Who are you?

471
00:37:06,482 --> 00:37:07,878
Let's move on.

472
00:37:12,323 --> 00:37:16,433
This piece is
the final work of Mr. Yoo,

473
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:18,033
his will.

474
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:19,663
Take a look at this condition.

475
00:37:19,663 --> 00:37:21,633
Whoever that reads this will...

476
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:23,732
cannot inherit
any of his inheritances.

477
00:37:23,732 --> 00:37:27,303
Can't you see
how eccentric and witty he is?

478
00:37:27,303 --> 00:37:29,137
He has an awful temper.

479
00:37:29,303 --> 00:37:30,938
You're right. Let's go.

480
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:35,338
(Please do not touch.)

481
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:51,557
I see.

482
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,028
You're with our subcontractor.

483
00:37:55,102 --> 00:37:56,967
The card key sometimes doesn't work.

484
00:37:58,602 --> 00:38:00,772
I'm going out for a cup of coffee,

485
00:38:00,772 --> 00:38:02,137
so please keep an eye on everything.

486
00:38:02,973 --> 00:38:04,068
Sure.

487
00:38:04,113 --> 00:38:05,208
Right.

488
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:08,438
Do you want some coffee too?
Maybe an Americano?

489
00:38:08,643 --> 00:38:09,907
Iced tea, please.

490
00:38:10,383 --> 00:38:11,478
Peach-flavored.

491
00:38:11,513 --> 00:38:13,177
Oh, iced tea.

492
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,988
(Control Room)

493
00:38:20,323 --> 00:38:21,488
Darn it.

494
00:38:40,643 --> 00:38:43,378
(Staff Only)

495
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:46,081
Here's
the family relation certificate...

496
00:38:46,082 --> 00:38:48,378
and a copy of
my resident registration.

497
00:38:48,752 --> 00:38:50,688
I'm his daughter.

498
00:38:51,053 --> 00:38:52,553
Take a look.

499
00:38:52,553 --> 00:38:54,787
She looks exactly like him.

500
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:58,493
Then what's your relationship
with him?

501
00:38:58,493 --> 00:38:59,657
Me?

502
00:39:00,163 --> 00:39:03,298
I'm a woman who was
passionately in love with him.

503
00:39:04,602 --> 00:39:07,743
I cannot condone an exhibition
that's held without permission...

504
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:09,372
from his immediate family.

505
00:39:09,372 --> 00:39:10,767
Please stop it immediately.

506
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:15,378
Are you disregarding
what the bereaved family is saying?

507
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,453
How can you hold an exhibition
without the family's approval?

508
00:39:18,453 --> 00:39:20,082
You need to stop this immediately.

509
00:39:20,082 --> 00:39:21,878
Why do my hands feel so...

510
00:39:22,553 --> 00:39:23,648
I'm sorry.

511
00:39:24,593 --> 00:39:26,017
By any chance,

512
00:39:26,922 --> 00:39:29,458
did you meet with Mr. Yoo's brother?

513
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:33,028
I think I saw him out front.
Isn't that so?

514
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:35,363
Didn't he say
he does business in culture?

515
00:39:35,363 --> 00:39:37,933
- Goodness.
- Did he ask you to invest?

516
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:39,203
How did you know?

517
00:39:39,203 --> 00:39:42,197
Can't you see he has a straw on you
to extract everything from you?

518
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:44,668
Gosh.

519
00:39:45,243 --> 00:39:46,907
He's a criminal
with five previous convictions.

520
00:39:47,243 --> 00:39:48,677
Four in fraud.

521
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:51,783
He recently conned his friends,

522
00:39:51,783 --> 00:39:54,378
so they're dying to catch him.

523
00:39:56,752 --> 00:39:59,622
Director, he's not someone
you should associate with.

524
00:39:59,622 --> 00:40:01,022
He's dying...

525
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:03,458
to sell these paintings
and run away with the proceedings...

526
00:40:03,962 --> 00:40:05,327
I mean, he's that desperate.

527
00:40:05,692 --> 00:40:07,128
He's not in his right mind.

528
00:40:07,763 --> 00:40:08,863
Is that so?

529
00:40:08,863 --> 00:40:09,967
Yes.

530
00:40:15,073 --> 00:40:16,537
What did I tell you?

531
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:20,608
There are many others like them
who pretend to be his family.

532
00:40:21,113 --> 00:40:24,152
It would've been really bad
if you didn't tell me before.

533
00:40:24,152 --> 00:40:25,847
Goodness.

534
00:40:25,953 --> 00:40:28,478
I went around looking for you,
and we finally meet here.

535
00:40:28,752 --> 00:40:31,548
Director, the man with
four previous fraud convictions.

536
00:40:31,852 --> 00:40:33,993
I don't have
four previous fraud convictions.

537
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:35,893
Do you want to get locked up
for defamation?

538
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:38,163
You're spitting out lies
without even flinching.

539
00:40:38,163 --> 00:40:40,402
Can't you see?
He's obviously a conman.

540
00:40:40,402 --> 00:40:42,832
Look at him. My gosh.

541
00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:44,303
Where did you buy this fancy suit?

542
00:40:44,303 --> 00:40:46,703
Come on.
Don't put your hands on my suit.

543
00:40:46,703 --> 00:40:49,812
Please don't fight here.
Why don't we talk about it outside?

544
00:40:49,812 --> 00:40:51,807
- Let's go out.
- Fine, let's go out.

545
00:40:51,973 --> 00:40:53,343
- What a nice suit.
- Gosh.

546
00:40:53,343 --> 00:40:54,878
I can't believe you.

547
00:40:59,053 --> 00:41:00,318
What brings you here?

548
00:41:01,323 --> 00:41:03,993
I was instructed to turn off
all the lights at 10 a.m.

549
00:41:03,993 --> 00:41:05,922
- The lights in the art gallery?
- Yes.

550
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,458
You want me to turn off the lights?

551
00:41:08,922 --> 00:41:10,192
That doesn't sound right.

552
00:41:10,192 --> 00:41:13,358
There's a special event. You can
confirm it with the director.

553
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:15,157
Okay. I'll do that.

554
00:41:33,453 --> 00:41:34,577
Hi.

555
00:41:36,692 --> 00:41:37,818
Hello?

556
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:40,422
Yes. Right.

557
00:41:40,422 --> 00:41:43,557
Yes, I instructed
all the lights to be turned off.

558
00:41:43,663 --> 00:41:46,863
Yes. Please do it exactly at 10 a.m.

559
00:41:46,863 --> 00:41:49,057
Have a good day. Thank you.

560
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:24,267
(The program is being installed.)

561
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:30,542
You stole all the paintings
from the house.

562
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:32,112
It's considered theft.

563
00:42:32,113 --> 00:42:34,082
I'll sue you for it.
Just so you know.

564
00:42:34,082 --> 00:42:36,042
Goodness, this is ridiculous.

565
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:38,847
I have no idea who you are.

566
00:42:39,212 --> 00:42:41,217
- Call the police now.
- What?

567
00:42:41,553 --> 00:42:44,588
I know you're just a conman,
but you should learn how to spell.

568
00:42:44,852 --> 00:42:48,517
"Don't 'looc' for me."
It ends with a K, not a C.

569
00:42:49,093 --> 00:42:50,863
Aren't you embarrassed
to face your daughter?

570
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:52,728
What? My daughter?

571
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:55,203
I'm a bachelor.
I don't have a daughter!

572
00:42:55,203 --> 00:42:56,298
A bachelor?

573
00:42:57,203 --> 00:42:59,267
Now, you're lying
about your daughter too?

574
00:43:01,502 --> 00:43:04,537
I'll leave today, but you shouldn't
con people like this.

575
00:43:04,843 --> 00:43:06,907
I'll be watching you. Okay?

576
00:43:06,913 --> 00:43:08,643
You're unbelievable.

577
00:43:08,643 --> 00:43:10,747
How dare you talk to me like that?
I don't even know you. Okay?

578
00:43:18,823 --> 00:43:21,517
(The program is being installed.)

579
00:43:36,942 --> 00:43:38,413
(Yoo In Ho's Memorial Exhibition)

580
00:43:38,413 --> 00:43:39,812
- You're here.
- Hello.

581
00:43:39,812 --> 00:43:41,513
- The ambiance here is nice.
- Hello.

582
00:43:41,513 --> 00:43:43,278
- How have you been?
- Hello.

583
00:43:48,883 --> 00:43:50,048
Take a seat.

584
00:43:51,093 --> 00:43:53,017
- Let us begin.
- I hope this goes well.

585
00:43:53,522 --> 00:43:55,163
We will now begin the auction...

586
00:43:55,163 --> 00:43:57,258
for the late painter,
Yoo In Ho's paintings.

587
00:43:57,292 --> 00:43:58,488
Here's the first painting.

588
00:44:03,872 --> 00:44:07,338
It's one of Yoo In Hoo's
most famous pieces.

589
00:44:07,743 --> 00:44:08,967
It's called "The Trap".

590
00:44:10,312 --> 00:44:11,907
I'm finally seeing it in person.

591
00:44:12,872 --> 00:44:14,537
- The starting bid is...
- What a superb painting.

592
00:44:15,383 --> 00:44:16,577
100,000 dollars.

593
00:44:17,683 --> 00:44:18,878
110,000 dollars.

594
00:44:20,053 --> 00:44:22,278
120,000 dollars,
130,000 dollars.

595
00:44:23,922 --> 00:44:26,517
Anyone for 140,000 dollars?
150,000 dollars.

596
00:44:26,962 --> 00:44:29,093
Starting now, I will raise
the price by 50,000 dollars.

597
00:44:29,093 --> 00:44:30,228
200,000 dollars.

598
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:32,758
- What?
- What?

599
00:44:33,332 --> 00:44:34,997
- 0 dollars?
- 0 dollars?

600
00:44:35,203 --> 00:44:37,068
- 0 dollars?
- Why is it 0 dollars?

601
00:44:37,872 --> 00:44:38,967
0 dollars?

602
00:44:40,372 --> 00:44:42,767
- What's going on?
- What?

603
00:44:43,042 --> 00:44:44,907
Hey, what's going on?

604
00:44:45,343 --> 00:44:46,467
What happened?

605
00:44:54,422 --> 00:44:57,488
Is that all? Do it again.
Come up with a new idea too.

606
00:44:57,652 --> 00:44:59,418
Don't you think
you're getting lazy these days?

607
00:44:59,522 --> 00:45:02,393
When people have enough food
and a roof over their heads,

608
00:45:02,393 --> 00:45:03,562
it shows in their art.

609
00:45:03,562 --> 00:45:05,688
I can't even see
your true intentions here.

610
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:08,728
Why are you looking at me like that?
Are you upset?

611
00:45:09,303 --> 00:45:12,033
Please let me go now.
I'm begging you.

612
00:45:12,033 --> 00:45:13,303
It's been 15 years.

613
00:45:13,303 --> 00:45:15,338
I worked long enough for you.

614
00:45:15,402 --> 00:45:17,307
I want to live my own life too.

615
00:45:17,712 --> 00:45:19,807
Do you think
a murderer has a right to do so?

616
00:45:20,613 --> 00:45:23,077
Do you think people will acknowledge
you as their fellow human being?

617
00:45:23,953 --> 00:45:26,613
I understand that
the statute of limitations is over,

618
00:45:26,613 --> 00:45:28,953
but the moment people find out
that you killed a man,

619
00:45:28,953 --> 00:45:31,252
This isn't right.
Something is wrong here.

620
00:45:31,252 --> 00:45:32,692
Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

621
00:45:32,692 --> 00:45:35,117
I should say that I did it
out of my loyalty to you.

622
00:45:35,192 --> 00:45:36,962
Our people have a soft spot
when it comes to affection.

623
00:45:36,962 --> 00:45:40,358
And people will believe me
exactly what I tell them.

624
00:45:41,232 --> 00:45:43,163
You really don't want to hold
a memorial exhibit?

625
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:45,372
Fine. Let's sell off the paintings.

626
00:45:45,372 --> 00:45:47,243
- What?
- I'm getting a headache.

627
00:45:47,243 --> 00:45:49,973
That's not me.
I never said anything like that.

628
00:45:49,973 --> 00:45:51,568
Someone is setting me up.

629
00:45:51,613 --> 00:45:54,008
Holding a memorial exhibit
is the best way to do it.

630
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,751
We can do more
than selling forgeries.

631
00:45:56,752 --> 00:45:59,778
Besides, you said our paintings
are just like the real ones.

632
00:46:02,622 --> 00:46:03,752
- It's simple.
- What is this?

633
00:46:03,752 --> 00:46:05,148
I'm being set up.

634
00:46:05,622 --> 00:46:08,163
- I can't believe this.
- What's going on?

635
00:46:08,163 --> 00:46:11,093
At this exhibition, there are
no paintings done by Yoo In Ho.

636
00:46:11,093 --> 00:46:12,988
- What did she say?
- What?

637
00:46:13,393 --> 00:46:14,898
- What? Is that true?
- No.

638
00:46:14,933 --> 00:46:17,497
Hey, turn this off.
I told you to turn it off!

639
00:46:17,803 --> 00:46:20,643
All he ever did was paint over
the sketch, done by his manager,

640
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:21,803
- Moon Jeong Wook.
- Turn this off.

641
00:46:21,803 --> 00:46:23,102
That's not true.

642
00:46:23,102 --> 00:46:24,513
There are people who claim...

643
00:46:24,513 --> 00:46:26,513
- to be his bereaved family.
- Yoo In Ho had been living...

644
00:46:26,513 --> 00:46:28,913
- his whole life stealing...
- This is not true!

645
00:46:28,913 --> 00:46:30,783
- his paintings and ideas...
- You saw them earlier.

646
00:46:30,783 --> 00:46:32,582
- Hurry!
- because Moon killed his brother.

647
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:36,283
- We'll continue the auction.
- Unbelievable.

648
00:46:36,283 --> 00:46:37,453
You wanted to buy this
for 200,000 dollars, right?

649
00:46:37,453 --> 00:46:39,887
Are you kidding me? Unbelievable!

650
00:46:40,163 --> 00:46:43,657
That is why
all of his so-called paintings...

651
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:45,387
are 0 dollars.

652
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:48,827
None of the paintings here
can be his paintings.

653
00:46:48,832 --> 00:46:52,327
It's real! This is all real!
It's a real painting!

654
00:46:52,332 --> 00:46:54,703
- Hey!
- He's a con artist.

655
00:46:54,703 --> 00:46:56,798
- He wasn't a painter.
- How dare you!

656
00:46:56,872 --> 00:46:58,708
He was a con artist.

657
00:46:59,473 --> 00:47:00,907
Ma'am! This is...

658
00:47:11,323 --> 00:47:13,247
My toes are killing me.

659
00:48:07,743 --> 00:48:09,608
(He was a con artist.)

660
00:48:12,752 --> 00:48:15,778
(He was a con artist.)

661
00:48:25,863 --> 00:48:27,497
Thank you for letting me
have some time.

662
00:48:29,033 --> 00:48:30,668
Even if I couldn't empathize
with you,

663
00:48:32,703 --> 00:48:34,367
I wanted to
at least understand you.

664
00:48:35,942 --> 00:48:37,608
But I couldn't.

665
00:48:39,513 --> 00:48:40,637
Was that...

666
00:48:41,712 --> 00:48:43,238
the only way?

667
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:47,617
Don't try...

668
00:48:48,982 --> 00:48:50,517
to empathize or understand me.

669
00:48:51,022 --> 00:48:52,548
The more you try,
the harder it will be on you.

670
00:49:01,332 --> 00:49:02,497
I'm just...

671
00:49:04,402 --> 00:49:05,827
a criminal.

672
00:49:13,783 --> 00:49:15,208
The weather is great today.

673
00:49:16,513 --> 00:49:17,778
It's almost making me cry.

674
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:23,548
I want you to enjoy your life.

675
00:49:24,792 --> 00:49:27,088
Don't waste your life
on hatred like me.

676
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:43,137
You know what?

677
00:49:43,542 --> 00:49:45,467
You're smart,
so I'm sure you'll find your way.

678
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:02,962
It has been confirmed that
the late painter, Yoo In Ho,

679
00:50:02,962 --> 00:50:05,992
was murdered by a theater director,
Ji Sul Young, his ex-wife.

680
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:09,263
It turns out the criminal activities
done by the Chipped In Quintet...

681
00:50:09,263 --> 00:50:11,298
who were arrested two weeks ago
were planned by Ji.

682
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,602
Ji confessed to the police...

683
00:50:13,602 --> 00:50:16,867
that she planned everything
with Yoo's manager, Moon.

684
00:50:17,413 --> 00:50:20,542
Moon was a ghost painter who had
drawn all of Yoo's paintings...

685
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:22,283
for the past 15 years.

686
00:50:22,283 --> 00:50:25,548
Recently,
he was found dead in his car.

687
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,343
With all the inheritance
you gave up,

688
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:53,672
I was able to cover the lawsuit
for compensation and damage...

689
00:50:53,672 --> 00:50:56,037
from the clients
who bought Mr. Yoo's paintings.

690
00:50:56,582 --> 00:50:59,778
And as a result,
the only inheritance left now...

691
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:01,818
is this house.

692
00:51:02,122 --> 00:51:03,217
All right, then.

693
00:51:10,093 --> 00:51:13,228
So this is the end.

694
00:51:13,493 --> 00:51:15,497
Should we be relieved that...

695
00:51:15,602 --> 00:51:17,057
we still have this house?

696
00:51:33,283 --> 00:51:34,978
What will you do now?

697
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:38,292
Well, I got my severance pay.

698
00:51:38,292 --> 00:51:39,993
And I'm healthy.

699
00:51:39,993 --> 00:51:41,688
I'll look for a job.

700
00:51:42,223 --> 00:51:45,033
But what will you do?

701
00:51:45,033 --> 00:51:46,628
I heard you went bankrupt.

702
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:50,827
You little...

703
00:51:55,002 --> 00:51:57,738
I'll find a way, probably.

704
00:52:02,482 --> 00:52:03,577
All right.

705
00:52:05,652 --> 00:52:07,283
I guess Hae Joon already left.

706
00:52:07,283 --> 00:52:09,648
Yes. He left early.

707
00:52:10,723 --> 00:52:12,847
Where are you going, Ms. Park?

708
00:52:13,993 --> 00:52:15,188
Do you need a ride?

709
00:52:15,263 --> 00:52:18,327
Well, I guess I can ride with you.

710
00:52:20,663 --> 00:52:22,398
Hey. Ms. Park.

711
00:52:22,633 --> 00:52:24,497
You should load your own stuff.

712
00:52:24,602 --> 00:52:26,097
Ms. Park. Goodness.

713
00:52:26,172 --> 00:52:29,467
Ms. Park. Load your stuff. Gosh.

714
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:32,637
Load your own stuff! Do it!

715
00:52:38,752 --> 00:52:40,407
Let's never see each other again.

716
00:53:37,843 --> 00:53:40,738
(A month later)

717
00:53:44,413 --> 00:53:46,177
There won't be a second time.

718
00:53:47,723 --> 00:53:50,048
They make me write so many things.

719
00:53:53,393 --> 00:53:55,088
I'm working at a convenience store.

720
00:53:56,462 --> 00:53:59,228
It's killing me. I've never
had a part-time job before.

721
00:54:00,633 --> 00:54:02,732
Perhaps, life is hard these days.

722
00:54:02,732 --> 00:54:04,668
There are so many awful customers.

723
00:54:05,232 --> 00:54:07,997
But I won't let them
just walk all over me.

724
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:13,508
Bit Na is busy
with her school these days.

725
00:54:13,812 --> 00:54:16,537
There are so many assignments
for nursing students.

726
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:17,947
She's busy.

727
00:54:18,482 --> 00:54:20,077
You're still chatty.

728
00:54:22,922 --> 00:54:24,247
Don't come back again.

729
00:54:24,792 --> 00:54:26,318
It's not a good place to visit.

730
00:54:27,393 --> 00:54:28,588
If...

731
00:54:32,133 --> 00:54:34,097
If I never showed up...

732
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:37,767
If I never intervened in your life,

733
00:54:39,303 --> 00:54:41,438
this wouldn't have happened.

734
00:54:43,172 --> 00:54:44,537
Don't be arrogant.

735
00:54:46,743 --> 00:54:48,307
I made the decision.

736
00:54:49,183 --> 00:54:51,108
All the decisions were mine.

737
00:55:08,133 --> 00:55:09,898
I wanted to see her too.

738
00:55:10,002 --> 00:55:12,097
There's a conversation
only for adults.

739
00:55:12,272 --> 00:55:13,628
You can visit her some other time.

740
00:55:24,183 --> 00:55:26,708
We should sell this car now.

741
00:55:28,082 --> 00:55:29,217
Even this car? Darn it.

742
00:55:31,122 --> 00:55:33,017
We won't make much from this car.

743
00:55:33,223 --> 00:55:35,818
I know that,
but it costs a lot to maintain it.

744
00:55:35,863 --> 00:55:37,393
The gas and the insurance.

745
00:55:37,393 --> 00:55:39,363
Then, why did you give up
your inheritance?

746
00:55:39,363 --> 00:55:40,827
Then, we wouldn't
be worried about money.

747
00:55:43,062 --> 00:55:44,073
Are you sad we gave it up?

748
00:55:44,073 --> 00:55:47,097
Yes, I am. To be honest,
I'm really disappointed.

749
00:55:48,243 --> 00:55:50,573
If we didn't give up that money,
we could've bought buildings...

750
00:55:50,573 --> 00:55:53,568
and lived our lives in luxury
like queens.

751
00:55:54,712 --> 00:55:56,438
I can't believe
I'm a part-timer at my age.

752
00:55:57,082 --> 00:55:58,177
Why?

753
00:55:58,752 --> 00:56:00,648
I like this version of you more.

754
00:56:05,652 --> 00:56:07,017
What a smooth talker.

755
00:56:27,212 --> 00:56:29,812
"The ones who give up a lot..."

756
00:56:29,812 --> 00:56:32,953
"will gain a lot in return."

757
00:56:32,953 --> 00:56:35,723
"When you do not own anything,"

758
00:56:35,723 --> 00:56:39,823
"you will finally have
the whole world to yourself."

759
00:56:39,823 --> 00:56:42,657
"That is the fruit
of possessing nothing."

760
00:56:44,363 --> 00:56:48,798
Well, I wasn't trying to have
the whole world to myself.

761
00:56:54,843 --> 00:56:56,467
Possess nothing.

762
00:57:06,812 --> 00:57:08,883
Tae, Jung, Tae, Se, Moon, Dan, Se,

763
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,723
Ye, Sung, Yeon, Joong,
In, Myung, Sun,

764
00:57:10,723 --> 00:57:12,692
Kwang, In, Hyo, Hyeon,
Sook, Gyeong, Yeon,

765
00:57:12,692 --> 00:57:14,723
Jung, Soon, Heon, Cheol, Go, Soon.

766
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:16,117
Tae, Jung, Tae.

767
00:57:18,433 --> 00:57:21,002
Well, doesn't everyone know this?

768
00:57:21,002 --> 00:57:22,798
I just know the basics.

769
00:57:33,272 --> 00:57:36,008
(Late Yoo In Gook)

770
00:57:43,323 --> 00:57:48,017
(I love you.)

771
00:58:05,413 --> 00:58:08,438
- What's that?
- What is that?

772
00:58:08,482 --> 00:58:10,143
- That's awful.
- That's so weird.

773
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:11,913
- Mine is better than yours.
- My gosh.

774
00:58:11,913 --> 00:58:13,953
Hey, once I color it,
it'll look amazing.

775
00:58:13,953 --> 00:58:16,053
- No.
- Gosh, that looks awful.

776
00:58:16,053 --> 00:58:18,453
- My gosh.
- You're so bad at drawing!

777
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,188
Hello.

778
00:58:24,263 --> 00:58:26,863
Okay. I got a 50-dollar bill.

779
00:58:26,863 --> 00:58:28,827
It's ripped. Okay.

780
00:58:31,772 --> 00:58:34,697
All right. Here's your change.

781
00:58:37,843 --> 00:58:42,938
It's 49.75 dollars.

782
00:58:48,553 --> 00:58:49,978
I'm missing 20 cents.

783
00:58:50,283 --> 00:58:52,048
The coins fell.

784
00:58:54,962 --> 00:58:57,117
Bye.

785
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,231
Do you think
only you can be rude to me?

786
00:59:01,232 --> 00:59:03,228
I can be rude too!

787
00:59:29,223 --> 00:59:30,517
Ji Woo.

788
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:33,927
- Mom!
- Did you have to wait long?

789
00:59:34,062 --> 00:59:36,057
- Do you want some ice cream?
- Sure.

790
00:59:37,062 --> 00:59:38,767
All right. Here's your ice cream.

791
00:59:39,102 --> 00:59:40,767
I'll open it for you.

792
00:59:40,872 --> 00:59:42,097
Here. Open wide.

793
00:59:42,542 --> 00:59:45,137
No, it's mine. Stop that.

794
00:59:45,672 --> 00:59:47,473
Where should we go
after eating this ice cream?

795
00:59:47,473 --> 00:59:48,807
How about a zoo?

796
01:00:03,422 --> 01:00:04,528
Bit Na.

797
01:00:05,462 --> 01:00:06,628
Bit Na.

798
01:00:10,163 --> 01:00:11,367
You're all right.

799
01:00:11,902 --> 01:00:13,367
You'll be okay.

800
01:00:14,172 --> 01:00:16,137
I want you to enjoy your life.

801
01:00:17,102 --> 01:00:19,668
Don't waste your life
on hatred like me.

802
01:00:25,453 --> 01:00:28,022
A zoo? What do you want
to do at the zoo?

803
01:00:28,022 --> 01:00:29,383
I want to ride a horse.

804
01:00:29,383 --> 01:00:31,517
Then, should we go
while we eat our ice cream?

805
01:00:31,553 --> 01:00:33,192
Well, okay.

806
01:00:33,192 --> 01:00:35,818
Sure. Give that to your dad.

807
01:00:35,893 --> 01:00:37,758
All right. Let's get going now.

808
01:00:37,962 --> 01:00:39,688
- Okay. Let's go!
- Let's go.

809
01:00:39,962 --> 01:00:42,057
- Let's go.
- We're going to have so much fun.

810
01:00:42,133 --> 01:00:43,798
Let's go!

811
01:00:55,743 --> 01:00:57,208
(Thank you for watching CHIP-IN.)
