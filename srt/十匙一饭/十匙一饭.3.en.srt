(Episode 3)

6
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,680
How was Dad?

7
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,310
Why do you ask?

8
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,850
Now that he's gone,

9
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,880
I've realized
I don't know much about him.

10
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,750
Had he been feeling
quite ill lately?

11
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,190
Yes, he did.
He was very cranky as well.

12
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,670
He scolded me often too.

13
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,660
I wrote so many written apologies
this month.

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,830
Anything else?

15
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,500
Like what?

16
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,270
Never mind.

17
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,880
Here you were.

18
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,660
Yes. Your dad liked
taking care of his garden.

19
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,950
He said it cleared up his mind.

20
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,590
How was Dad before he died?

21
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,830
I couldn't even take care of him
despite his illness.

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,930
He was in a lot of pain.

23
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,770
The last stages of cancer
are always so painful.

24
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,900
Anything else?

25
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,710
Let's see...

26
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,880
I'm not sure.

27
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,180
Did he really not know?

28
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,150
Did Dad keep it a secret
even from him?

29
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,900
What did you find in the safe?

30
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,100
I didn't open it.

31
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,240
Ms. Kim.

32
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,170
Are you pleading the Fifth?

33
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,610
It doesn't matter.
There's evidence on your palms.

34
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,980
My gosh. How is this evidence?

35
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,420
You have no proof
that this is from the safe.

36
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,420
I'm Jin Yeon Hee,
Mr. Yoo's attorney.

37
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,420
I should've come here sooner.

38
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,360
I apologize for coming
after he has passed away.

39
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,160
By the way,

40
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,000
I heard his will has disappeared.

41
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,940
What will happen now?

42
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,570
Mr. Yoo has the part
with his message,

43
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,470
and I have the latter part
regarding the distribution.

44
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,220
Let me read you the will.

45
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,060
"Please liquidate my house,"

46
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,260
"real estate, artwork, stocks,"

47
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,330
"savings,
and marketable securities..."

48
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,500
"and distribute the money as below."

49
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,300
"Yoo Bit Na, 10 percent."

50
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,200
"Ji Sul Young, 10 percent."

51
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
"Kim Ji Hye, 10 percent."

52
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
"Yoo Hae Joon, 10 percent."

53
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,240
"Dokko Chul, 10 percent."

54
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,510
"Dokko Sun, 10 percent."

55
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,050
"Park Jin Sook, 10 percent."

56
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,280
"Moon Jeong Wook, 10 percent."

57
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,390
"Please donate
the remaining 20 percent..."

58
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,490
"to Ingook Foundation."

59
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,900
However, there is a condition.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,670
"Whoever reads my will
before it gets announced..."

61
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,170
"will be excluded."

62
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,040
Whoever read the will...

63
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,280
will not receive any inheritance.

64
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,920
If any of you are proven guilty
of being involved in his death,

65
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,820
you will be excluded,

66
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,420
and the money will be distributed
to the rest evenly.

67
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,030
How could he give equal amounts
to those who aren't his family?

68
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,430
This is what he wanted.

69
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,060
Aunt, why aren't you saying
anything?

70
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,870
What can I say
when this was what he wanted?

71
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,010
She's right. It's what he wanted.
We should understand.

72
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,010
Excuse me. Does that mean...

73
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,580
I get to receive
some of his inheritance?

74
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,750
That is correct.

75
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,790
If we're done here, may I leave?

76
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,320
No. Here is the condition.

77
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,400
This will is only effective
if we have both mine...

78
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,370
and his message.

79
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,100
If either of the two is missing,
the will becomes...

80
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,940
null and void.

81
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,070
"Null and void"? Then is there
another version of the will?

82
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,710
- No.
- Then?

83
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,180
The civil code will be applied.

84
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,550
In this case,

85
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,750
his daughter, Bit Na,
will inherit everything.

86
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,160
How... How come?

87
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,760
If there is an immediate heir...

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,300
That's just the law.

89
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,300
You study law, right?
Do explain this to the others.

90
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,770
10 days from now,
his will will be carried out.

91
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,810
If Mr. Yoo's will isn't returned,

92
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,950
all of the inheritance
will go to Ms. Yoo Bit Na.

93
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,580
I'll see you in 10 days.

94
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,690
So...

95
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,990
if the will doesn't get returned,

96
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,600
we won't receive his inheritance.

97
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,930
Is that it?

98
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,430
Yes.

99
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm so dumbfounded.

100
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,100
He said he'd give us
his inheritance...

101
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,910
then backed out.

102
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,340
How could he toy with us like this?

103
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,760
I'm not surprised by what he wrote.

104
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,890
He always startled those
around him like that...

105
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,960
ever since he was young.

106
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,310
(Ingook Foundation)

107
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,690
(We couldn't find any matches.)

108
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,570
Who do you think has the will?

109
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,170
You heard her.

110
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,070
We can only receive his inheritance
once the will is returned.

111
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,310
Does it even matter? He's dead.

112
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,340
That's not what I meant. Listen.

113
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,710
I never knew...

114
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,920
he was so pretentious.

115
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,760
Darn it.

116
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,780
What are you doing?

117
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,520
What do you think? I'm cleaning.

118
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,590
Are you sure you weren't looking
for his will?

119
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,090
Don't be ridiculous.

120
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,570
Why would he ask me that
when it was obvious?

121
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,550
What?

122
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,850
Is it clogged?

123
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,790
This never happened.

124
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,100
Goodness.

125
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,350
Oh, dear.

126
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,560
Is there something
you want to say to me?

127
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,190
No.

128
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,630
Never mind, then.

129
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,730
If there is,
feel free to let me know.

130
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,170
Wait.

131
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,740
His lips were blue.
That means he was poisoned.

132
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,410
It's highly likely
that they injected him with poison.

133
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,750
Let's look around the house
for murder weapons or evidence.

134
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,490
You found something even greater
than the will.

135
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,620
Really?

136
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,420
Whoever took the will
probably disposed of it already.

137
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,290
- Really?
- You bet.

138
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,630
- Listen carefully.
- Okay.

139
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,160
Let's use this to disqualify Bit Na.

140
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,170
Put this in her room.

141
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,800
I can't do that.

142
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,900
Five million dollars.

143
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,910
You'll be getting
five million dollars.

144
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,380
I'm not done cleaning just yet.

145
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,490
- Gosh.
- I left my phone.

146
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,920
Oh, really?

147
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,830
I think you've cleaned enough.

148
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,360
I feel uncomfortable
if I stop midway.

149
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,730
I'll be done soon, so wait outside.

150
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,660
Why did he hide the fact
that he had completely recovered?

151
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,760
There must be a reason.

152
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,900
Is it possible...

153
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,470
that someone who knew
he had made a full recovery...

154
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,300
killed him?

155
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,820
All right. Det. Kang,
search Dokko Chul's room.

156
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,920
Yes, sir.

157
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,560
(Introduction to Nursing)

158
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,090
I have a question.

159
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,140
Did Dad take his medication
every day?

160
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,870
Have you ever spoken
with his doctor?

161
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,840
Or have you accompanied him
to the hospital?

162
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,310
Why are you asking?

163
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,810
It sounds like...

164
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,550
you're wondering
if I had neglected him.

165
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,920
Yes.

166
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,090
You're right.

167
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,160
You were...

168
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,160
more uninterested in him
that I had thought.

169
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,770
Then what do you know about him?

170
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,570
What about your mom?

171
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,340
Right. Your mom...

172
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,740
probably knows more
about his inheritance than I do.

173
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,420
Until the very end, he wanted me.

174
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,490
If he had ever loved someone,
that would've been me as well.

175
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,790
The bond we had shared
doesn't deserve...

176
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,160
to be looked down by you.

177
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,300
What's the point of being
by his side until the end?

178
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,500
You didn't know his condition.

179
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,810
Ms. Yoo.

180
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,180
We found this syringe in your bag.

181
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,180
What?

182
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,750
Please come with us to the station.

183
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,190
(Continuing our victorious history)

184
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,330
I'm going to take a cab.
Would you like to join me?

185
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,570
I have to stop by somewhere.
Go first.

186
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,800
They told us to stay
at In Ho's place for the time being.

187
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,140
I'll be there.

188
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,270
I will, so go ahead first.

189
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,380
If it's because you don't want
to come with me...

190
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,480
Exactly.

191
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,950
Did I have to say that out loud?

192
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,850
Do as you wish, then.

193
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,080
Do you think I wanted you
to come with me?

194
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,220
I just didn't want you
to waste any money.

195
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,450
You see, I may be stingy...

196
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,090
when it comes to buying side dishes,
but not with cabs.

197
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,430
Go on, then.

198
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,670
Bit Na!

199
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,100
What? Why is she here?

200
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,510
Bit Na, why are you here? Why?

201
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,010
Let her go! Why are you here?

202
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
- Goodness.
- Bit Na!

203
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,550
What a mess.

204
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,520
Bit Na.

205
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,950
Come on, now.

206
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,820
What's going on?

207
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,560
They found a syringe in my bag.

208
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,320
"A syringe"?

209
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,660
What syringe?

210
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,760
What are you talking about?

211
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,870
You're the one who injected
Mr. Yoo with nicotine,

212
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,640
right?

213
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,770
"Nicotine"?

214
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,470
That's why he passed away?

215
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,080
We'll only know for sure
once the autopsy report comes out,

216
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,710
but we found nicotine
in his needle mark.

217
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,850
It wasn't me.

218
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,950
Then why was this syringe
in your bag?

219
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,560
Something's wrong.

220
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,230
It was you, wasn't it?

221
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,930
You're the one who put the syringe
in Bit Na's bag,

222
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,370
wasn't it?

223
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,400
Didn't I warn you last time...

224
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,870
that I wouldn't sit still
from now on?

225
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,180
You won't? Then what will you do?

226
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,410
Tell me.

227
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,110
Gosh.

228
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,350
Answer me.

229
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,760
How dare you push me?

230
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,860
Hey! Come here!

231
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,300
Just wait and see.

232
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,030
You just wait.

233
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,920
Sun, we haven't seen each other
in days,

234
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,250
so how could you not say hi?

235
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,660
Your life is going to be rosy
from now on.

236
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,960
I looked into it,
and if Bit Na is disqualified,

237
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,170
I'll be the next in line.

238
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,800
We'll be hitting the jackpot.

239
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,900
What about Bit Na?

240
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,310
Since she's involved
in your uncle's death,

241
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,810
she won't inherit any money
and will be put behind bars.

242
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,710
Why won't you believe me?

243
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,720
We have 50 million dollars now.

244
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,420
It was you, wasn't it?

245
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,720
Gosh, what do you mean?

246
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,120
You're the one
who framed my daughter.

247
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,090
Gosh, what kind of nonsense
are you spewing this time?

248
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,560
You were happy about getting
all the money...

249
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,560
once Bit Na went to prison.

250
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,170
When was I happy?

251
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,200
You were the one
who stole the will too, right?

252
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,810
Wasn't it you?

253
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,450
You wanted Bit Na
to inherit everything,

254
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,080
but you've failed.

255
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,550
Just wait and see.

256
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,720
You'll be back behind bars soon.

257
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,090
Is that so?

258
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,260
Prison feels more like home
than my own house.

259
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,260
That's great. I wish you luck.

260
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,760
You scumbag.

261
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,460
Darn it. Let me go.

262
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,800
You...

263
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,900
Let go!

264
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,800
You study nursing, right?

265
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,740
Yes.

266
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,280
Then you must be good at injections.

267
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,950
I'm merely a freshman.

268
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,850
Tell me everything you did
the day Mr. Yoo passed away...

269
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,620
in chronological order.

270
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,490
Or you can tell me how you got
your hands on the nicotine.

271
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,860
The mere fact that you found
a syringe in my bag...

272
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,030
doesn't give you the right
to keep me here.

273
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,300
It does if that syringe
turns out to be the murder weapon.

274
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,530
I don't always lock my door,

275
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,000
so anyone could've come in.

276
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,610
I think it's unreasonable for you
to keep me here...

277
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,810
just because of that.

278
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,490
(Villager 4:
Everyone, have you heard?)

279
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,150
What will happen...

280
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,920
to Bit Na now?

281
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,220
What do you think?

282
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,720
The police are involved,
so she won't get the inheritance,

283
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,660
then she'll pay for her crime.

284
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,330
Then what will happen
to our inheritance?

285
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,400
So that's what you were after too.

286
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,070
When it comes to the inheritance,
you'll get a few bucks...

287
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,970
if his will turns up.

288
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,780
If it doesn't show up,

289
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,710
I get to keep everything.

290
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,320
Wait, how does that happen?

291
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,820
It's...

292
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,890
You wouldn't understand anyway.
Anyway, there's this thing.

293
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,500
Once I get the inheritance,
I'll pay a handsome severance pay.

294
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,030
So don't worry about it.

295
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,830
Ms. Park, this apple is great.

296
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,140
That jerk. Did you just fool me?

297
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,040
Darn you.

298
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,850
You jerk! How dare you deceive me?

299
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,020
Lower your voice.

300
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,590
You said I'll get some inheritance
once Bit Na gets detained.

301
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,320
That's why
I did something like that.

302
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,490
I told you not to speak of that.

303
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,130
How can I not bring it up?

304
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,130
Dokko Chul is the only one
who's benefitting from my actions.

305
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,400
It's more than meets the eye.

306
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,940
Goodness, what are you saying?

307
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,210
You need to trust me
and give it some more time.

308
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,350
I'll make sure you get 10 percent.

309
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,710
Goodness.

310
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,980
Bit Na.

311
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,780
"Bit Na"? My Bit Na?

312
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,950
Bit Na?

313
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,890
Bit Na is here?

314
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,590
Goodness, Bit Na. You're here.

315
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,330
Goodness, you're here. My Bit Na.

316
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,160
Let's go inside. Come in.

317
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,700
Move.

318
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,770
It must've been tough.

319
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,510
My Bit Na is here.

320
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,380
Food, please. I'm hungry.

321
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,180
- Food. Food, please.
- All right.

322
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,450
Sit here. That's it.

323
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,490
Hey.

324
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,530
How did you get out?
Didn't you do that to him?

325
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,370
I guess someone used a syringe
because I got into a nursing school.

326
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,500
Dad was killed
with a nicotine injection.

327
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,770
So how did you get out?

328
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,980
Because I'm innocent.

329
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,920
They found someone else's
fingerprint on the syringe.

330
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,590
They'll find out soon,
so we'll have to wait.

331
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:39,000
Ms. Park, can you give me
a lot of rice? Pile up the bowl.

332
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,540
Yes, you should eat a lot.

333
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,970
I never felt full when I ate there.

334
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,440
Thank you.

335
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,080
Eat more meat. This one. And beans.

336
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,320
Who put you up to it?

337
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,730
What are you talking about?

338
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,460
Leaving a syringe...

339
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,500
in my room.

340
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,300
I'm sure you didn't do it alone.

341
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,170
I don't know
what you're talking about.

342
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,010
We'll see once we find out
whose fingerprint it is...

343
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,280
on that syringe.

344
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,940
Hey.

345
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,390
So you planned this by yourself?

346
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,020
Yes, I planned that by myself...

347
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,760
after I found it in the drain
while cleaning up the bathroom.

348
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,730
But why?

349
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,800
I thought your mother would
give up his will.

350
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,700
- What?
- Once that happened to you,

351
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,870
I figured your mother would
give up his will. That's why.

352
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,540
If she can't take his fortune,

353
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,140
she'll at least try to take
her share of five million dollars.

354
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,920
I almost went to prison
because of you.

355
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,890
Are you going to report me?

356
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,960
I'll see.

357
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,600
I asked all of you to come...

358
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,840
because of the footsteps we heard
on the day my dad passed away.

359
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,140
You all said you heard it, right?

360
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,680
You're not even the police.
Are you trying to question us?

361
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,620
I can always call them
if you'd like.

362
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,720
You two heard it too, right?

363
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,120
And you too.

364
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,100
Who do you think it was?

365
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,170
I believe that person
injected nicotine in him.

366
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,070
Hey, wait.

367
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,510
We can't say everyone
who went out at night...

368
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,040
might be the culprit.

369
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,780
Someone could've gotten thirsty
and went to the kitchen.

370
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,690
In that case, speak up
if you came out that night...

371
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,650
to grab some water or whatnot.

372
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,530
Uncle In Ho was terminally ill.
Why would anyone kill him?

373
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,670
He would've been up there
in a short while anyway.

374
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,910
That little...

375
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,080
Well, I guess it could happen
if someone was that resentful.

376
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,950
Ms. Park.

377
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,080
Yes?

378
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,920
What did you witness
a few months ago?

379
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,620
Well...

380
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,520
It's...

381
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,690
For a while, Mr. Yoo's medicine...

382
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,860
had been thrown away
in the garbage can.

383
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,370
What? Then he threw them away
without taking them?

384
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,940
- I guess.
- Why did he do that?

385
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,000
Was he trying to die or what?

386
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,640
Because...

387
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,140
he was fully healed.

388
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,140
What?

389
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,110
What are you talking about?
He was fully healed?

390
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,790
The one who injected nicotine knew
he was fully healed.

391
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,160
I told the police about this.

392
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,890
And they'll find out whose
fingerprints are on the syringe.

393
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,930
(Certificate of Diagnosis)

394
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,000
(The patient above has made
a complete recovery.)

395
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,970
But there's no way...

396
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,300
you two wouldn't know.

397
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,810
Who always got his medicine
from the pharmacy?

398
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,280
Then you must have
talked to the doctor.

399
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,250
What did the doctor say?

400
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,760
Was he actually taking
anticancer drugs until his birthday?

401
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,360
Did you ever realize that
he was getting better?

402
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,160
Right, well.

403
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,400
About a month ago,

404
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,870
he went into a shock in a seizure.

405
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:09,940
So I thought his condition was
definitely getting worse.

406
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,880
He went into a shock?

407
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,080
Yes.

408
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,950
Did he take...

409
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,320
sleeping pills?

410
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,320
Say something.

411
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,690
I knew.

412
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,300
Mr. Moon.

413
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,530
Yes, I knew.

414
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,370
But I didn't kill him.

415
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,440
There's no reason to.
He was my only friend.

416
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,180
And I'm sorry I couldn't tell you
that he was fully healed.

417
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,350
But that's what he wanted.

418
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,350
He loves...

419
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,820
putting on the weirdest pranks.

420
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,760
Then you injected nicotine
into my brother?

421
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,630
What are you talking about?
Why would I do that?

422
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,430
I just knew he was fully healed.

423
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,900
Really?

424
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,740
I'm telling you.

425
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,950
I'm sorry to visit so late.

426
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,150
We found something important that
the bereaved family should know,

427
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,790
so please do understand
our discourtesy...

428
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,190
in visiting you at this hour.

429
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,330
Mr. Yoo In Ho did not pass away
from the nicotine injection.

430
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,230
It looks like someone gave him
an injection after his death.

431
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,500
The nicotine was injected
after he died?

432
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,630
Why?

433
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,370
We'll have to
investigate that further.

434
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,970
What about the fingerprint
on the syringe?

435
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,010
We did not find
any fingerprints on the syringe.

436
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,680
Then how did he die?

437
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,090
From anaphylaxis shock
due to sleeping agents.

438
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,160
In a word, he was
allergic to sleeping pills.

439
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,030
Some people are allergic to
milk or nuts, right?

440
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,530
In Mr. Yoo's case,
it was sleeping pills.

441
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,160
So...

442
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,870
he died because of sleeping pills?

443
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,970
Yes.

444
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,170
He showed an allergic reaction
to sleeping pills,

445
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,710
then passed away
from anaphylaxis shock.

446
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,080
However, people with an allergy
go into a shock right away,

447
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,940
but Mr. Yoo was an unusual case.

448
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,550
He went into a shock
an hour after he took the pills.

449
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,590
He doesn't take sleeping pills.

450
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,790
No matter how much
he couldn't sleep,

451
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,260
he never took any sleeping pills.

452
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,660
Are you saying...

453
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,960
he didn't take any sleeping pills?

454
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,330
Yes.

455
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,100
He said sleeping pills
force people to sleep...

456
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,330
and breaks the balance
of the human body.

457
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,840
He didn't like how I took them.

458
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,840
Right, if he had taken it before,

459
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,380
he probably knew
he was allergic to it.

460
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,810
There's a high possibility
he didn't know about his allergy.

461
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,280
Then...

462
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,150
is the culprit the one
who gave him sleeping pills?

463
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,790
No way. Could it be me?

464
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,460
If someone gave it to him
with the intention to kill him,

465
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,960
then yes, of course.

466
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,460
I killed Mr. Yoo?

467
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,200
What in the world is going on?

468
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,610
We found a great quantity of
sleeping agents in Mr. Yoo's body.

469
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,940
These pills require a prescription.

470
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,880
And if the pills were 5mg,
he probably took 10,

471
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,350
and if the pills were 10mg,
he probably took about 5.

472
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,820
I only fed him one.

473
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,290
What's going on?

474
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,060
We have Mr. Yoo's autopsy report.

475
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,830
(Autopsy Result)

476
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,800
My dad...

477
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,500
died from the side effects
of sleeping pills?

478
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,170
It looks like someone injected him
with nicotine after his death.

479
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,750
Ms. Yoo?

480
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,550
Yes?

481
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,350
We need additional investigation
on this part.

482
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,120
You may go.

483
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,800
Detective.

484
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,010
So? Did you find out anything?

485
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,080
Mr. Moon knew Dad was fully healed.

486
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,620
And...

487
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,420
he went into a shock a month ago.

488
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,260
Please look into that a little more.

489
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,600
I'll do that.

490
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,270
Sleeping pills.

491
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,340
When did he take sleeping pills?

492
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,680
He must have taken them
with something else.

493
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,550
What was the last dish he had?

494
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,520
Loach soup?

495
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,770
Mom, is something going on?

496
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,340
No, nothing is going on.

497
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,240
Mom, why are you crying?

498
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,650
I'm too happy that you returned.

499
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,720
Why are you happy about my return?

500
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Of course, I should return.

501
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,220
Mom, be honest.

502
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,390
Something is going on, right?

503
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,160
No, nothing is going on.

504
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,900
Did you steal his will?

505
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,270
No! It wasn't me!

506
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,540
Then why are you crying?

507
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,800
I cry whenever I want to cry!

508
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,510
Why won't you even let me cry?

509
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,310
If you're going to cry, cry louder.

510
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,880
It makes me concerned
if you muffle your voice.

511
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,300
I have...

512
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,040
something to say to you.

513
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,980
On that day,

514
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,480
on your dad's birthday,

515
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,650
I received a letter.

516
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,300
(If I, Yoo In Ho, die,
please carry out...)

517
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,040
(the things I've requested.)

518
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,140
Then...

519
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,910
you did give him sleeping pills.

520
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,110
- That's...
- How is one pill...

521
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,380
much different from five?

522
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,980
You did that.

523
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,290
Bit Na.

524
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,090
How can you do that to Dad?

525
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,730
Mom, are you out of your mind?

526
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,230
Bit Na, that was an accident.

527
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,500
I wasn't trying to do that.

528
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,310
This is driving me insane.

529
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,410
It's driving me insane too.

530
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,420
Don't do anything for now.

531
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,490
I'll look into it.

532
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,480
(Yoo In Ho's Atelier)

533
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,250
Bit Na.

534
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:13,650
I'm going to step out for a moment.
You stay home, okay?

535
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,820
Mom.

536
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,120
When will we go and see Dad?

537
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,220
Your dad? Next time.

538
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,490
Let's see him next time.

539
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,530
Mom.

540
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,710
I miss Dad.

541
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,770
"The cause of death
for Mr. Yoo In Ho wasn't poisoning."

542
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,970
"It was caused by
the side effects of sleeping pills."

543
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,140
"The suspect, Dokko,
is Mr. Yoo's younger brother."

544
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,310
Hey. What's that?

545
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,280
What do those people know about me?

546
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,510
Send me that too.

547
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,310
Don't you know Social Media Squad
is digging this case?

548
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,580
These people are faster
and scarier than the police.

549
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,220
I can't believe these people.

550
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,990
Isn't this an infringement
of my privacy?

551
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:30,990
Don't they know the era we live?
I should sue all of them. Darn it.

552
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,130
As for another suspect, Kim,

553
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,560
she's a mistress who carried...

554
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,500
Mr. Yoo's child 20 years ago.

555
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,000
Kim declared bankruptcy a while ago.

556
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,300
Bankruptcy?

557
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,040
I knew she'd go bankrupt...

558
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,640
when she took taxis
as if it didn't cost a dime.

559
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,010
Hey.

560
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,750
I heard your mother
declared bankruptcy.

561
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,220
Yes.

562
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,050
She was going to stay here
after going bankrupt.

563
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,120
Change the interior design? Gosh.

564
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,560
Tell me the truth.

565
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,460
Isn't this why you and your mother
came here from the start?

566
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,770
- Uncle.
- Give up your inheritance.

567
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:15,370
If you don't want us to suspect you,
give it up.

568
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,210
Yes, give it up.

569
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,780
You can only prove your innocence
if you give up your inheritance.

570
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,960
I won't give up my inheritance.

571
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,330
No, I can't.

572
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,400
The inheritance will go
to people like you, so I can't.

573
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,900
Never.

574
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,040
How dare she talk to us like that?
Hey. You stop there.

575
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,540
Hey.

576
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,050
Gosh. That little brat
was so stubborn.

577
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,750
Ji Hye seems clueless.

578
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,150
I think that girl planned
the whole thing.

579
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,620
Bit Na was first in line
to receive the inheritance.

580
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,730
This is a big if.
I'm sure this isn't the case.

581
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,560
But you were second in line
to receive the inheritance.

582
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,670
What? What are you implying now?

583
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,140
How many times must I tell you?

584
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,170
I'm not interested
in my brother's money.

585
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,280
I just want to find out
why my brother died.

586
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,870
- What are you doing?
- Oh, this?

587
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,940
One of my friends works at a lab.

588
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:59,840
Even if the plates are washed,
by wiping it with a cotton swab,

589
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,210
I could find out about the food
that was on the plates before.

590
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,900
It's hard to clean the blades
in blenders.

591
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,630
It's highly likely that
food residue might remain.

592
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,570
Gosh.

593
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,970
Are you suspecting me?

594
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,870
Do you think I might have
done something to him?

595
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,410
We'll know
once the results come out.

596
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,330
Hold on.

597
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:30,070
- I forgot my phone here.
- Okay.

598
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,740
Hey, look what I have.

599
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,910
Do you want to watch it with me?

600
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,120
You should think very carefully...

601
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,330
whether you'll talk to me
or the police.

602
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,440
On Dad's birthday,
didn't you go into his room?

603
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,440
Yes.

604
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,940
I also entered Mr. Yoo's room.

605
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,780
But I didn't see anything.

606
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,800
"How to open a secret safe"?

607
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,300
(Will)

608
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,510
"Will"?

609
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:46,040
"If I, Yoo In Ho, die,
please carry out..."

610
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,940
(It will be divided evenly
among other heirs.)

611
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,810
Darn it.

612
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:16,970
Are you grinding Korean peppers?

613
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:22,580
Gosh, you startled me.
I didn't hear you coming.

614
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,180
Why are you so surprised?
Did you do something wrong?

615
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,450
Don't be absurd.
I'm so busy right now.

616
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:34,390
I should help you out then.

617
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,150
No matter how hard I looked for it,
the will wasn't there.

618
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,820
I really didn't see anything.

619
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,830
- I didn't.
- You have to say that.

620
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:15,200
If you come clean and say you read
the will, you won't get anything.

621
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,830
So you could not have seen it.

622
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:20,200
It's not that.

623
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:30,950
Ms. Park.

624
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:37,720
Come in.

625
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,430
I need to tell you something.

626
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,240
Can we go for a walk?

627
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,360
Now that this brat...

628
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,330
has something on me,

629
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:27,040
she wants me to do
all the dirty work.

630
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:30,410
I thought she was innocent,

631
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,340
but I knew it. The apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

632
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:40,220
Do you still want to blame me
for not being attentive?

633
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,720
That I didn't know
he made a full recovery?

634
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:44,990
I'm sorry if I offended you.

635
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,660
A misunderstanding
doesn't offend me.

636
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,760
I just know...

637
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,790
that you don't trust me yet.

638
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,800
You will still think that I knew...

639
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,900
that he wasn't sick anymore.

640
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,670
That's right.

641
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,280
But he loved you.

642
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,980
I wanted to keep my manners.

643
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,090
Is that necessary?

644
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:26,430
My gosh. Darn it.

645
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,630
I have to know what I'm looking for.

646
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,230
Darn it.

647
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,070
Goodness. My back. Oh, my.

648
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,910
Gosh, this is so annoying.

649
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,240
Let's see.

650
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,050
What's this?

651
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:50,190
Why would she put an ink pad here?
It's not some treasure.

652
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,820
All right.

653
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,290
This is driving me crazy.

654
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:01,060
What on earth
does she want me to find?

655
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,670
I must know what I'm looking for
to find it. You know?

656
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:09,000
Should I go through her trash too?
Yes, do it. Go through the trash.

657
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,960
So this is why it was necessary.

658
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,470
You should have come out sooner.

659
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:41,840
I had to find something
before I left the room.

660
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,640
It was clean.
I didn't see anything suspicious.

661
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:45,870
Gosh.

662
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:49,850
We didn't find anything with this.

663
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,720
"Villagers".

664
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:59,090
"Gemma? Why would Gemma do that?"

665
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,890
"Where did she get the poison?"
Gosh.

666
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,700
Darn it.

667
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:12,000
Dad took five sleeping pills.

668
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,840
But I only found two pills so far.

669
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,070
Did 1 person give him
3 sleeping pills?

670
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,040
Or did three people give
him the pill one each?

671
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,110
(Kim Ji Hye)

672
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:22,010
Or is the person
who sent the letter...

673
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,650
controlling other people?

674
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,500
I have questions.

675
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,870
Who got this letter?

676
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,670
What on earth is that letter about?

677
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,810
I got it.

678
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,180
But I didn't read it.
I just tossed it somewhere.

679
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,820
You got it?

680
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,080
Yes.

681
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,320
I did too.

682
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,690
I got it too and I read it.

683
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:08,260
Did you go to his room
to read the will?

684
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,820
Why would I?

685
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,160
It wouldn't have changed anything
even if I did.

686
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,200
You too?

687
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:24,310
- Then, did you also...
- How could I believe what it said?

688
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:26,340
It could have been a prank.

689
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,250
Are you serious?

690
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:41,420
I neither read nor received
any letters like that.

691
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,860
But you went to the safe that night.

692
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,260
The special paint got on your hands.

693
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,560
Why do you keep
accusing an innocent man?

694
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,530
That's not where
I got the paint on my hands.

695
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:51,970
Me too.

696
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,880
You too?

697
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,720
(Moon Jeong Wook)

698
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,790
Gosh, greed is a hard thing to tame.

699
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,760
I wanted the money
after getting a letter like that.

700
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:29,140
I'm getting old,
but I didn't achieve anything.

701
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:32,970
I was staying at my friend's house
without having any money.

702
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:39,180
I thought I would be able to
stop living off other people.

703
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:46,490
So I put the sleeping pill into
the burdock tea he was going...

704
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,590
to drink after dinner.

705
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,000
So...

706
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,610
you put the sleeping pill
in the tea he was going to drink?

707
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:06,810
You jerk.

708
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:08,080
Then, what about the will?

709
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,880
Did you see the will in the safe?

710
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,750
By the time when I got there,

711
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,820
the will was gone.

712
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,930
I got scared
that I might be framed as the thief.

713
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:28,360
So I erased my fingerprints
on the safe.

714
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:40,710
That's why no fingerprints
were found on the safe.

715
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,150
Then, Ji Hye and I went
to the police station for no reason.

716
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,380
I'm sorry.

717
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:49,920
Let's hand him over to the police.

718
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,050
Wait.

719
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,290
You.

720
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:56,260
You didn't get one?

721
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:57,290
No.

722
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:58,660
How can I believe you?

723
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,360
You're the only one
who didn't get the letter.

724
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:03,930
What are you implying?

725
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,040
You're acting like a detective,
but did you send out the letters?

726
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,640
- Hae Joon.
- Hey.

727
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:12,010
Uncle keeps saying
that he didn't get it,

728
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,540
but I think he did.

729
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,510
You're the only one
who didn't get the letter.

730
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:18,450
Getting the letter doesn't
make us guilty.

731
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:19,950
But you're questioning us
as if we are.

732
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,650
Did you really not send the letters?

733
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:25,890
Yes. It must be you.

734
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:28,020
It's odd how you're the only one
who didn't get it.

735
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,460
You must have sent them.

736
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,830
What are you talking about?

737
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:34,560
She didn't do it. Why are you
accusing an innocent girl?

738
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:48,540
We're already on edge as it is.

739
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,080
But she's making it worse.

740
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,750
Gosh, she's so immature.

741
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:52,950
Right.

742
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,850
It's because
she's blinded by her own greed.

743
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,020
She wants to get people
disqualified for reading the will,

744
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,650
so she can take a bigger cut.

745
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,290
But she used to be innocent.

746
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,230
Innocent, my foot.

747
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,400
She's gone mad because she's
seeing dollar signs everywhere.

748
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:11,670
I can't let this slide.

749
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:14,170
I must do something about this.

750
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:18,270

751
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:21,240
Isn't it like a game called
"Find the Missing Will?"

752
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,280
The letter.

753
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,250
That's when everything began.

754
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:27,820
Mr. Yoo adopted Mr. Yoo Hae Joon
as his son before his death.

755
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:32,220
Ms. Yoo Bit Na and Mr. Yoo Hae Joon
will inherit 50 percent each.

756
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,220
- What is he going to do?
- The sock is covered in blood.

757
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,520
You prepared
more surprises than I thought.

758
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,760
I'm seriously going to kill you.

759
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,160
The culprit is one of us anyway.

760
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,160
What's with you all?

761
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,900
It's not like we can save the dead.

762
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,130
The least we can do is
get money out of this.

763
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:45,530
The real culprit is
the one who sent the letter.

764
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,270
This is the real culprit.
