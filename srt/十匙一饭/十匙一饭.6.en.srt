00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:12,256
(15 years ago)

2
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:28,147
I'll be quick. You can stay here.

3
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:29,822
Can I come with you?

4
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:30,976
Not today.

5
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:32,877
Don't go anywhere and stay here.

6
00:02:19,461 --> 00:02:20,961
(I miss my dad too!)

7
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:22,556
("The Missing Case of the CEO
of Ingook Closed Unresolved")

8
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:45,317
Wasn't it enough that
I looked after you for 15 years?

9
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:47,116
Please, I ask of you.

10
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:49,586
I want to live my own life now.

11
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,856
Please give me that voice recorder.

12
00:02:52,092 --> 00:02:54,826
How long will you use that
to hold me down?

13
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:57,932
Be quiet. Stop talking nonsense
and go to your room.

14
00:02:57,932 --> 00:02:59,027
In Ho.

15
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:00,727
I told you to go to your room.

16
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:13,947
(CHIP-IN)

17
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,467
Dad,

18
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,907
who in the world are you?

19
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:56,787
(Episode 6)

20
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:05,296
But why?

21
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:07,527
Why did he do this?

22
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:11,736
Do you think Uncle In Ho knew
he would die when he set this up?

23
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:14,037
If he knew, that means
he killed himself.

24
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,806
Why would someone who came back
to life try to kill himself again?

25
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:20,176
That doesn't sound right.

26
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,986
(Map to the safe)

27
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:55,651
Maybe this was just Uncle's game.

28
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:58,147
I think everything was a setup
starting from his will.

29
00:04:58,922 --> 00:05:01,986
It was a game to see
who's interested in his will.

30
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:05,056
If it wasn't, why was his will
covered in fluorescent paint?

31
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:08,256
He could always write another will,

32
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:10,796
and he was never going to
give anyone his money.

33
00:05:11,302 --> 00:05:13,696
But Uncle died in the process.

34
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:17,796
Wait, then was his death
a part of this game?

35
00:06:43,922 --> 00:06:46,417
I'll be quick. You can stay here.

36
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:05,077
We found the map
on Aunt Sul Young's computer.

37
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:09,077
That means she knew
about Uncle's plan.

38
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:11,046
Hae Joon and Mr. Moon too.

39
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:15,186
They were close with Dad,
so they could be in this as well.

40
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:17,992
Your mom and my dad
are probably innocent, right?

41
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:19,256
Uncle hated them.

42
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:21,256
Let's show them.

43
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,356
The video?

44
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:26,097
They probably know more than us
about Uncle.

45
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:27,796
They knew him longer than we did.

46
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:32,042
And since my dad has scammed
many people, he'll be good at this.

47
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:33,767
Let's just say that
he has a sixth sense.

48
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:41,882
So the one who sent
the letters was...

49
00:07:41,882 --> 00:07:44,946
Isn't it obvious?
It was that geezer.

50
00:07:44,982 --> 00:07:46,986
Why are you venting at me?

51
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:50,292
If he wanted to go insane,
he should've done it alone.

52
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,091
Why did he get us involved...

53
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:54,787
and make the police suspect us
of attempted murder?

54
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:57,926
Why in the world did he do that?

55
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:00,397
There must be a reason.

56
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:03,667
We don't know yet.
We're going to look into that.

57
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:05,767
We called you guys over
so you could help us.

58
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:08,566
He had a helper.

59
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:11,042
We know for certain
that one of them helped him,

60
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:12,441
but there could've been more.

61
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:13,647
"A helper"?

62
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:15,977
And who is that?

63
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:23,347
I was told that you have a map
to the safe on your laptop.

64
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:26,116
It's in your room, right?
We'll be confiscating it.

65
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,831
Please come with us
to the station...

66
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:32,657
to find out
if you sent those letters or not.

67
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:01,887
She's the one who wrote them,
isn't she?

68
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:04,997
I knew it.

69
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:07,831
She has a creepy vibe.
I knew she was up to something.

70
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:10,936
She's not the type
who'd do a sloppy job like this.

71
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:14,037
How can you say that
when the police just took her?

72
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:15,912
She acted all smart.

73
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:17,576
She outsmarted herself.

74
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:20,037
So she got caught
helping my brother.

75
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:24,247
That ill-tempered man...
I've given it some thought.

76
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:30,086
I think he did kill himself.

77
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:31,857
What?

78
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:34,392
He knew he was allergic
to sleeping pills...

79
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:36,456
and used that knowledge
to commit suicide.

80
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:39,857
Then why did he get
the others involved?

81
00:09:40,402 --> 00:09:41,932
Maybe he wanted us to conspire...

82
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:43,936
so that he wouldn't have to
give us his inheritance.

83
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:45,497
Perhaps, he wanted
to give it all to you.

84
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:47,841
You're the only one
who didn't get a letter.

85
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:49,367
Why do you think so?

86
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,182
Then he could've just given
the inheritance to her...

87
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:52,381
from the get-go.

88
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:54,481
He enjoys being cruel.

89
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:56,611
He loves tormenting others...

90
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:59,046
and ultimately having his way.

91
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,387
This is just between us.

92
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:03,762
He always enjoyed doing such things.

93
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:05,822
He intentionally hinted
where the safe was...

94
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:09,456
and observed whether
I'd take the will or not.

95
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:14,997
Okay.

96
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:18,696
Let's say
we assisted in his suicide.

97
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:21,442
Then doesn't that make us guilty
as well?

98
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,367
That's correct.
We're all guilty of murder.

99
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:24,812
Is that right?

100
00:10:24,812 --> 00:10:28,111
I'm quite knowledgeable
in this field. Ask me anything.

101
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:29,976
I'm better than most attorneys.

102
00:10:30,782 --> 00:10:32,777
Will everyone get
the same punishment?

103
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:35,991
That's called aiding and abetting.

104
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:37,221
According to the criminal law...

105
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:40,556
Then if all those people are exempt,

106
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:42,956
how much will we be getting?

107
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:45,201
That's not the main issue here.

108
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:47,032
Of course, it is.

109
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:49,772
Ji Hye, a person has died.

110
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:51,237
Is money still that important?

111
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:54,007
Yes, he's right.

112
00:11:01,782 --> 00:11:04,182
Every time I get in an argument,

113
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:06,181
you never side with me.

114
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:10,046
Uncle is an ex-convict.
Five fraud convictions, at that.

115
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:13,521
I need to treat him well
so he won't scheme anything.

116
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:15,686
We never know when he'll betray us.

117
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:19,432
You're right.
That's the type of human he is.

118
00:11:19,432 --> 00:11:21,631
- Yes.
- You're so meticulous.

119
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:22,796
See?

120
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:30,167
How could you deceive
your own brother?

121
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:32,277
Give me back my money.

122
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,981
Be patient. I'll give it back soon.

123
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:36,706
Give it back right now!

124
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:38,552
If you don't,
my company will go under.

125
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:39,716
In Gook.

126
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:41,787
You shouldn't have done this either.

127
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:44,716
I'm going to report you guys
this instant.

128
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:46,292
In Gook!

129
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:47,591
- Hey!
- Stop!

130
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:48,926
In Gook!

131
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:51,157
In Gook.

132
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:52,857
Hey.

133
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:56,497
I'll be quick. You can stay here.

134
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,072
Can I come with you?

135
00:11:58,072 --> 00:11:59,436
Not today.

136
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,206
Don't go anywhere and stay here.

137
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:13,887
In Gook.

138
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:15,417
Open your eyes, In Gook.

139
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:19,686
In Gook, open your eyes.

140
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,686
You jerk.

141
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:24,226
I... I didn't...

142
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,596
I...

143
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:30,326
In Gook.

144
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,716
What is it?
Why did you call me over?

145
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:21,216
I gave it some thought.

146
00:13:23,121 --> 00:13:25,617
I know a way for us to keep
our share of the inheritance.

147
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:28,162
Forget it.
You're up to something again.

148
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:29,326
That's not it.

149
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:31,696
Forget it then.

150
00:13:34,402 --> 00:13:35,527
What is it?

151
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:37,542
I won't tell you.

152
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:40,267
Come on, tell me.
You made me curious.

153
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:46,277
Go get that video.

154
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:47,576
Why?

155
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:49,881
We need it in our possession...

156
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:51,922
in case we need to reveal it.

157
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:53,552
We don't know what'll happen
in the future.

158
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:55,446
Then I'll ask Bit Na...

159
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:57,561
You shouldn't.

160
00:13:57,562 --> 00:13:58,621
I shouldn't?

161
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:01,787
Bit Na and Sun aren't interested
in the inheritance.

162
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:04,101
They're just determined
to solve this case.

163
00:14:04,101 --> 00:14:05,762
You're right.

164
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,302
We should keep the video...

165
00:14:07,302 --> 00:14:10,471
and reveal it at the right time
in order to clear our names.

166
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:12,302
If they don't release it,

167
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:14,537
we'll be in a pickle.

168
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:17,481
We need to be on our toes...

169
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,142
if we want to protect
the inheritance.

170
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:20,851
That's not easy to do, though.

171
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:23,407
Are you going to give up
on the inheritance like this?

172
00:14:23,682 --> 00:14:25,417
- I shouldn't.
- Exactly.

173
00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:44,167
(Recipient: Yoo Bit Na)

174
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:50,566
Gosh.

175
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:52,007
Darn it.

176
00:14:53,512 --> 00:14:55,206
My fingers are going to cramp up.

177
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:01,987
Hurry, hurry.

178
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,292
- Did you transfer it?
- Not yet.

179
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:06,422
Why are you taking so long?
Hurry up!

180
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:08,762
Gosh, I can't focus! Be quiet!

181
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:10,426
It's getting transferred.

182
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:15,667
Okay. 87 percent.

183
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:17,601
96 percent. 98 percent.

184
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:19,471
It's here. I got it.

185
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:21,241
- You did?
- Yes.

186
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:22,367
Look.

187
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:27,377
This is it.

188
00:15:29,081 --> 00:15:31,017
(The drive has been formatted.)

189
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:33,946
What? Why did you erase it?

190
00:15:34,422 --> 00:15:36,322
Oh, no. I made a mistake.

191
00:15:36,322 --> 00:15:38,762
Mistake, my foot!
That was intentional.

192
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:40,831
It's safer for us to have it...

193
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:42,792
instead of them.

194
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:45,201
If they reveal it at the wrong time,

195
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:46,997
it'll only cause us trouble.

196
00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:51,037
Bit Na will get furious
when she finds out.

197
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:53,696
I have a plan.

198
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:57,012
Do you?

199
00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:58,182
I'm telling you.

200
00:15:58,182 --> 00:15:59,377
I can't trust you.

201
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:06,017
Keeping your mouth shut
won't do you any good.

202
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:09,822
The map to the safe
was found on your laptop.

203
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:11,357
Did you draw it yourself?

204
00:16:17,762 --> 00:16:20,826
Then do you know who drew it?

205
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:26,871
Ms. Ji, this will only put you
at a disadvantage.

206
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,637
Someone could've used my laptop.

207
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:33,277
Does finding that map...

208
00:16:33,782 --> 00:16:35,607
give you the right to suspect me?

209
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:41,652
Since we found this
on your laptop...

210
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:43,117
I didn't draw it.

211
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:46,621
Where are you going?

212
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:48,887
We're not done here.
Please sit down.

213
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:52,397
Bring me an arrest warrant.

214
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:01,711
(Drive)

215
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:03,037
(Empty)

216
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:05,381
Did the video file disappear?

217
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:07,042
(Empty)

218
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,481
Yes. It's not in the trash either.

219
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:10,817
Gosh, did my dad do this?

220
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:13,417
I'm suspicious of him.

221
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:16,286
Or is Hae Joon still listening in?

222
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:19,016
Maybe he heard about the file
and deleted it.

223
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:03,502
Since you two already read the will,

224
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:06,072
you're still disqualified
despite not being in the quintet.

225
00:18:06,072 --> 00:18:08,436
Gosh, we didn't read it.

226
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:10,706
We didn't. Really.

227
00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:13,137
If we're done, I should get going.

228
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:16,047
- Wait, what if...
- What if...

229
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:22,746
What if we found out
who sent the letters?

230
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:25,921
Did you?

231
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:27,286
In that case,

232
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:29,486
will we get our share
of the inheritance?

233
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:33,062
We were duped into reading the will,

234
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:35,202
so maybe you could make
an exception.

235
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:38,436
No, that doesn't matter.
You're permanently disqualified.

236
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:41,572
Your shares will be divided evenly
among the family members...

237
00:18:41,572 --> 00:18:44,036
and Ingook Foundation.

238
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:45,676
"Ingook Foundation"?

239
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:48,446
Do you mean the foundation
that's receiving 20 percent of it?

240
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,252
I'm really curious.

241
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:54,391
What kind of foundation is that
to be receiving that much money?

242
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:55,847
I don't know either.

243
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:57,617
Goodbye, then.

244
00:18:57,962 --> 00:19:00,756
Attorney Jin, hear me out.

245
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:02,361
I didn't read it!

246
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:04,627
Me neither. I promise.

247
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:06,756
Gosh, what a cold woman.

248
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:11,567
My gosh.

249
00:19:12,272 --> 00:19:14,067
She startled me.

250
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:20,976
Jin Sook.

251
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:22,512
How did you get out?

252
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:24,012
Don't you know?

253
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:27,446
I heard the map to the safe
was found on Ms. Ji's laptop.

254
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:28,851
So that's how you got out.

255
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:31,117
You little...

256
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:33,186
What will you do now?

257
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:36,431
I gave a false testimony
because of you two.

258
00:19:36,431 --> 00:19:40,131
And now, I'll be fined
for obstruction of justice!

259
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:42,931
And I heard it'll be
tens of thousands!

260
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,001
"Tens of thousands"?

261
00:19:44,002 --> 00:19:46,171
You shouldn't complain to us.

262
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:49,212
We're permanently disqualified
due to another reason.

263
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:51,377
We're irritated as is.

264
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:53,776
Then whom should I complain to?

265
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:55,381
You told me to turn myself in.

266
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:57,151
You said I could receive
the inheritance if I did that.

267
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:58,847
When did I say that?

268
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:00,577
Do you have proof?

269
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:08,032
I shouldn't have trusted
a conman in the first place.

270
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:11,756
Tell me. Did he say that or not?

271
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:16,127
- I didn't hear anything.
- You...

272
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:18,141
Goodness.

273
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:21,941
You told me to do that!

274
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:24,512
Ms. Park, this is assault.
Paying a fine won't cut it.

275
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,341
- Don't be a fool.
- Fine.

276
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:29,052
I'll go to prison then.

277
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:31,347
Let go! Ms. Park!

278
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:35,091
- Let me go!
- How dare you?

279
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:36,186
Gosh!

280
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:16,847
In Gook.

281
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:18,620
You shouldn't have done this either.

282
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,986
I'm going to report you guys
this instant.

283
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:22,462
In Gook!

284
00:22:22,462 --> 00:22:23,831
- Hey!
- Stop!

285
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:25,057
In Gook!

286
00:22:34,272 --> 00:22:35,637
What's that voice recorder?

287
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:38,436
What?

288
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:40,676
It's nothing.

289
00:22:43,411 --> 00:22:45,077
You were about to throw it away.

290
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:47,716
Let me listen to it.

291
00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:49,921
It's really nothing.

292
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:51,617
I said, let me listen to it.

293
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:59,357
How could you deceive
your own brother?

294
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:00,956
Give me back my money.

295
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:03,601
Be patient. I'll give it back soon.

296
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:05,397
Give it back right now!

297
00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:07,171
If you don't,
my company will go under.

298
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:08,266
In Gook.

299
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:10,637
You shouldn't have done this either.

300
00:23:11,312 --> 00:23:13,637
I'm going to report you guys
this instant.

301
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:15,212
In Gook!

302
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:16,552
- Hey!
- Stop!

303
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:17,706
In Gook!

304
00:23:19,052 --> 00:23:20,147
In Gook.

305
00:23:20,722 --> 00:23:21,817
Hey.

306
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,456
This is a trap that In Ho set up.

307
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:27,357
I didn't do it.

308
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:29,792
How could you say that
after listening to this?

309
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,702
You know what kind of person he is.

310
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,627
He schemed this all along,

311
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:37,127
and I was just his pawn.

312
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:39,067
You're still lying.

313
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:44,006
I've paid my dues.

314
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:46,907
No one can spit at me.

315
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:49,847
I was a living dead.

316
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:57,147
Do you know how guilty I felt...

317
00:23:57,552 --> 00:23:58,986
throughout my entire life?

318
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:01,117
Do you?

319
00:24:04,762 --> 00:24:06,827
I saw you and Uncle...

320
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:09,926
carry my dad's body outside.

321
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:11,936
I saw you...

322
00:24:12,072 --> 00:24:13,637
with my own eyes.

323
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:17,637
You don't have the right to live.

324
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:22,377
Hey, what are you doing?

325
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:24,347
Where did you bury him?

326
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:27,347
- I have nothing to do with this.
- Where did you bury him?

327
00:24:29,822 --> 00:24:31,756
No, don't do this.

328
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:34,157
You won't solve anything like this.

329
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:36,327
Don't be reckless.

330
00:24:36,331 --> 00:24:37,430
Let go.

331
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:39,202
I'm going to kill him
and end everything.

332
00:24:39,202 --> 00:24:40,557
Snap out of it!

333
00:24:40,802 --> 00:24:43,127
You're only harming yourself.

334
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:47,137
I'm sure there's another way.

335
00:24:47,341 --> 00:24:50,167
There is none.

336
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:51,476
No.

337
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:53,307
I'm certain.

338
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:05,921
Attorney Jin doesn't know either.

339
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,391
Why is that foundation
receiving 20 percent of the share?

340
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:09,992
That's 10 million dollars.

341
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:12,827
It's a hefty sum.
Aren't you guys curious?

342
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:15,627
Maybe it's
a charitable organization.

343
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:17,026
No, it's not.

344
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:19,341
Mr. Yoo created that foundation...

345
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:22,266
after his younger brother
went missing.

346
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:25,006
Why are you coming down from there?

347
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:28,006
It was dusty, so I cleaned it.

348
00:25:28,512 --> 00:25:29,907
Do you have a problem with that?

349
00:25:30,252 --> 00:25:31,347
Well done.

350
00:25:32,252 --> 00:25:34,052
But why were you eavesdropping?

351
00:25:34,052 --> 00:25:35,486
I wasn't!

352
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:39,486
Everyone here thinks...

353
00:25:39,962 --> 00:25:42,361
I'm eavesdropping
whenever I hear something.

354
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:44,762
Could you continue
what you were saying?

355
00:25:44,762 --> 00:25:47,732
Seeing how they're treating me,
I don't want to tell you.

356
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:49,901
I doubt she knows anything.

357
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:51,571
She probably
just said it mindlessly.

358
00:25:51,572 --> 00:25:54,042
You're right. She's just blabbering.

359
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:57,706
Do you know
what you guys take me for?

360
00:25:58,242 --> 00:25:59,577
A folding screen.

361
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:02,552
You're not aware
that I'm in the room...

362
00:26:02,552 --> 00:26:05,847
and talk about anything
and everything.

363
00:26:08,022 --> 00:26:10,117
You don't treat me
like a human being.

364
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:12,792
"A human being"? That's not true.

365
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:14,522
Don't lie.

366
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:16,191
Even just now,

367
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:18,032
you had no idea I was there.

368
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:19,926
Especially you two.

369
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:22,202
You treated me...

370
00:26:22,202 --> 00:26:24,597
as if I was disposable.

371
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,436
Ms. Park, when did we?

372
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,466
"You treated me
as if I was disposable."

373
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:33,837
We did. We did treat her that way.

374
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:37,547
In Gook.

375
00:26:37,812 --> 00:26:39,317
Open your eyes, In Gook.

376
00:26:40,722 --> 00:26:43,246
In Gook. In Gook, open your eyes.

377
00:26:44,091 --> 00:26:47,216
You jerk.
What have you done to my brother?

378
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:49,831
I... I didn't...

379
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:50,926
Darn it.

380
00:26:50,931 --> 00:26:52,297
- In Gook.
- I...

381
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,956
In Gook.

382
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:57,297
Open your eyes, In Gook.

383
00:27:02,072 --> 00:27:04,107
Mr. Moon killed my dad,

384
00:27:04,512 --> 00:27:06,236
and Uncle In Ho
helped Mr. Moon bury him.

385
00:27:06,812 --> 00:27:09,206
In Ho covered up
your father's death?

386
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:14,016
No. Something isn't right.

387
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:18,387
You know how much he cherished
your dad better than I do.

388
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,426
He may have been
cold and inconsiderate,

389
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:22,986
but he wouldn't do that.

390
00:27:24,861 --> 00:27:27,232
What would he get
from doing something like this?

391
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:28,466
My dad's assets.

392
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:33,897
Uncle In Ho got all of his assets
after my dad passed away.

393
00:27:55,663 --> 00:27:59,369
Ms. Park, you must be sulking
because of what just happened.

394
00:27:59,788 --> 00:28:02,653
But that's that, and this is this.

395
00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:06,528
Ms. Park, we aren't doing this
only for our sake.

396
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,868
If we find out what kind of
foundation it is,

397
00:28:07,868 --> 00:28:10,193
you might end up
getting some inheritance.

398
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:14,163
Jin Sook. Tell me what you want.

399
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:16,732
Yes, what do you want, Ms. Park?

400
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:20,572
The fine.

401
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:24,413
- We'll pay that fine for you, okay?
- Why?

402
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:28,082
Are you insane?
Do you know how much that is?

403
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,413
Just let it slide.

404
00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:33,923
Then you can
sign a contract on that.

405
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,393
Okay?

406
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:44,532
His insomnia began 15 years ago.

407
00:28:45,568 --> 00:28:47,237
He couldn't sleep at night,

408
00:28:47,237 --> 00:28:49,502
so he stayed up for days.

409
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:51,802
Come to think about it now,

410
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,443
it's not that he couldn't sleep.

411
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:56,272
He didn't.

412
00:28:57,618 --> 00:28:59,917
He must've been afraid
that he might slip...

413
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:02,413
and mention what he did
to your dad in his sleep.

414
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:04,683
So?

415
00:29:06,427 --> 00:29:09,853
He also soundproofed his room
15 years ago.

416
00:29:10,397 --> 00:29:11,552
He didn't...

417
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:14,492
block out sounds from coming in.

418
00:29:15,397 --> 00:29:18,562
He blocked what he might say
from getting out.

419
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:21,838
He probably wanted to
hide his crime...

420
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:23,433
that badly.

421
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:29,713
I'm sure he had a rough time too.

422
00:29:30,947 --> 00:29:32,782
He must have
lived in pain all alone...

423
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:35,383
in his room
that's more like a coffin.

424
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:36,982
So what?

425
00:29:37,618 --> 00:29:39,282
Do you expect me to forgive him?

426
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:42,153
Don't ever forgive him.

427
00:29:43,028 --> 00:29:44,552
You don't have to
understand him either.

428
00:29:46,427 --> 00:29:50,992
I hope you would feel less angry
to know that...

429
00:29:51,568 --> 00:29:54,163
he was also punished in a way.

430
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:56,832
I don't feel any less angry.

431
00:29:58,707 --> 00:29:59,802
All right.

432
00:30:02,377 --> 00:30:05,042
Don't you want to know more
about Ingook Foundation?

433
00:30:10,987 --> 00:30:13,022
Ingook Foundation bought up...

434
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:14,782
In Ho's paintings.

435
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:16,792
What?

436
00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:21,393
Did you buy out all of my paintings
that were in the auction?

437
00:30:21,427 --> 00:30:22,532
Of course.

438
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:25,032
So?

439
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:27,802
When should we sell those?

440
00:30:28,538 --> 00:30:29,633
Just wait.

441
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:32,742
The price will skyrocket soon.

442
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:36,613
"Just wait.
The price will skyrocket soon."

443
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:40,343
It didn't start off by doing that.

444
00:30:41,018 --> 00:30:44,312
I believe they supported people
and donated at first.

445
00:30:44,487 --> 00:30:48,222
But at one point in time,
they began to do that.

446
00:30:51,098 --> 00:30:55,197
Man, he was doing
the dirtiest things in the back.

447
00:30:55,197 --> 00:30:57,562
And what did he call me? A conman?

448
00:30:58,838 --> 00:31:02,933
Is that how he raised
the prices for his paintings?

449
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:04,232
Probably.

450
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:06,472
But Dad's paintings were
already expensive.

451
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:08,177
He didn't have to do that.

452
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:10,913
There's no end to human greed.

453
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:16,482
Then why did he leave money
to that foundation after his death?

454
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,453
He can't tamper with the price
after he dies.

455
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:29,093
Even if I die,

456
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:31,933
could you operate the foundation?

457
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:33,832
Me?

458
00:31:34,008 --> 00:31:36,933
When a painter dies, the price of
his paintings equal his fame.

459
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:39,072
If you keep doing
what we've been doing,

460
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:42,242
the price of my paintings
will skyrocket once I die.

461
00:31:42,348 --> 00:31:44,413
Then people will
talk about me for ages.

462
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:52,552
A true artist...

463
00:31:53,157 --> 00:31:55,693
"Is made after his death."

464
00:31:57,727 --> 00:32:00,927
That means no one can
touch his money...

465
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:02,792
even if Moon Jeong Wook
takes 20 percent of the profit.

466
00:32:02,868 --> 00:32:06,103
You're right. It's not like
the dead will watch over him.

467
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,308
Then how much will he be getting?

468
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:11,703
If we do a rough calculation,

469
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:15,048
he'd be getting
over 15 million dollars.

470
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:17,913
It's worth assisting his suicide
for 15 million dollars.

471
00:32:18,018 --> 00:32:19,683
What? 15 million dollars?

472
00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:21,917
But if he gets caught,

473
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:23,818
he'll be sent to prison
before he gets his hands on it.

474
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:26,052
I'm sure he was confident
he wouldn't get caught.

475
00:32:28,088 --> 00:32:30,358
In Ho was filthy rich,

476
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:32,467
but he never sent me
any money in custody...

477
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:34,427
while I, his brother,
was stuck in prison.

478
00:32:34,427 --> 00:32:36,197
I had no money to buy
long johns in winter,

479
00:32:36,197 --> 00:32:38,137
so I sent him a letter
begging for money,

480
00:32:38,137 --> 00:32:41,032
but he never even gave me a reply.

481
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:43,133
Dear my brother, In Ho.

482
00:32:43,137 --> 00:32:46,673
In Ho, it's me, Chul,
your only brother.

483
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:48,008
The sun has been setting earlier,

484
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:51,018
and the icicles out in the window
are becoming longer and longer.

485
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:53,042
It's awfully cold in here.

486
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:56,957
If you could show me
your gracious mercy...

487
00:32:56,957 --> 00:32:59,427
and send me just
one set of long johns,

488
00:32:59,427 --> 00:33:03,752
I think I will get the energy
to live a good life once again.

489
00:33:04,627 --> 00:33:06,368
I know you're a famous and busy guy,

490
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:09,893
so you can always
just send me money to buy it.

491
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,663
I haven't told you to this day,

492
00:33:13,237 --> 00:33:15,008
but to get
my child-rearing expenses,

493
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,237
I had to turn in a plan
the month before.

494
00:33:17,237 --> 00:33:20,903
And he never sent me
a penny more than what I needed.

495
00:33:21,677 --> 00:33:24,717
And one time,
I added the numbers wrong...

496
00:33:24,717 --> 00:33:26,443
and added a few dollars.

497
00:33:26,647 --> 00:33:28,417
Then he threatened me and said...

498
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:29,987
he'll cut down the expenses
if I keep doing that.

499
00:33:29,987 --> 00:33:32,683
(March 2010,
child-rearing expenses plan)

500
00:33:32,727 --> 00:33:35,522
Her numbers are
never off by a small amount.

501
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:39,798
(Total: 9,955 dollars,
not 9,958 dollars)

502
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:42,098
But you got as much as you wanted.

503
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:45,298
I'm talking about
how tough it was to get it from him.

504
00:33:45,298 --> 00:33:46,937
Why don't you understand?

505
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:48,133
You were bad at school, weren't you?

506
00:33:48,308 --> 00:33:49,637
If he gave you that much money,

507
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:51,407
I'd write up 10 of those.
Why can't you do that?

508
00:33:51,407 --> 00:33:52,848
If he told me to do it,

509
00:33:52,848 --> 00:33:55,717
I could do it every single day,
not once every month.

510
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:58,812
You two are nothing compared to me.

511
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:02,082
I've worked here
for 20 years, right?

512
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:04,582
But I only got a raise once.

513
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,222
- Just once over 20 years?
- Yes.

514
00:34:07,457 --> 00:34:08,457
When?

515
00:34:08,457 --> 00:34:11,423
On the day when he was
diagnosed as terminally ill.

516
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:14,663
I'll give you a raise.

517
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:18,792
By how much?

518
00:34:19,368 --> 00:34:20,633
I'll add...

519
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:25,102
14.74 dollars a month.
What do you think?

520
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:29,042
All right, fine. Goodness.

521
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:30,513
I'll add...

522
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:34,443
14.84 dollars a month. Happy now?

523
00:34:36,518 --> 00:34:37,613
Okay.

524
00:34:38,157 --> 00:34:40,283
Wow, he gave you a raise
when he was about to die.

525
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:42,423
He's just too awful.

526
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:44,697
That makes me feel furious.

527
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:47,792
So why did you
stick around for 20 years?

528
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:50,832
- I wonder.
- He called me his family,

529
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:53,337
and he deceived me by saying...

530
00:34:53,337 --> 00:34:55,502
he'll leave me a fortune
once he dies.

531
00:34:55,808 --> 00:34:59,042
But who knew
he'd actually die like this?

532
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:21,493
In Ho, shouldn't we call the police?

533
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:28,463
I can't do this.
I have to report this to the police.

534
00:35:32,177 --> 00:35:34,446
We must bury everything
that's happened today.

535
00:35:34,447 --> 00:35:36,642
We must take this to our graves.
Understood?

536
00:35:38,018 --> 00:35:40,517
Think carefully
unless you want to ruin your life.

537
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:43,153
I know it was an accident,
but you still killed a man.

538
00:35:43,157 --> 00:35:44,312
Besides,

539
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:47,022
I covered up my brother's death.

540
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:51,823
If you can face the finger-pointing
from the people,

541
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:54,062
turn yourself in.

542
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:04,162
This jerk switched the will.

543
00:37:05,337 --> 00:37:06,562
No way.

544
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:10,202
Darn it.

545
00:37:10,538 --> 00:37:12,332
I have to tell Bit Na.

546
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:15,403
If she finds out I stole the video,
she'd go berserk.

547
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:17,343
What do I do?

548
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:23,387
Why are you so startled?

549
00:37:23,387 --> 00:37:24,887
No, I wasn't startled.

550
00:37:24,887 --> 00:37:28,252
You opened the door so loudly,
so I just got scared for a second.

551
00:37:28,688 --> 00:37:30,553
You should be more ladylike.

552
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:35,697
- Give me that.
- Hey, stop it.

553
00:37:35,697 --> 00:37:38,732
Don't use your muscles on me.
Let go of me.

554
00:37:40,637 --> 00:37:42,808
- Mom!
- There's no time to scold me.

555
00:37:42,808 --> 00:37:45,432
That's not important. Watch it.
Talk to me after you watch it.

556
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,348
Mr. Moon took Dad's will?

557
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:21,702
Yes, that's right. He was behind it.

558
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:23,513
Isn't this shocking?

559
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:35,223
Have you seen Mr. Moon?

560
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:37,022
Why do you ask?

561
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:46,363
I think Mr. Moon assisted Dad.

562
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:50,502
Did you wiretap us because...

563
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:52,573
Dad asked?

564
00:38:52,578 --> 00:38:55,042
Why would I do anything
for that jerk?

565
00:38:57,118 --> 00:38:58,372
Did something happen?

566
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:03,182
Do you think Mr. Moon helped Uncle?

567
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:07,682
I get the feeling...

568
00:39:09,058 --> 00:39:11,223
he might have fooled all of us.

569
00:39:28,507 --> 00:39:36,553
(Recipient: Yoo Bit Na)

570
00:39:37,357 --> 00:39:40,752
Do you really think
Mr. Moon helped Dad kill himself?

571
00:39:41,427 --> 00:39:44,223
He moved Dad's will
from the clock to the safe.

572
00:39:44,628 --> 00:39:48,328
Right.
Uncle left the will in the clock,

573
00:39:48,328 --> 00:39:50,493
but Mr. Moon moved it to the safe.

574
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:52,332
What if Dad never asked him
to do it?

575
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,002
Then, Mr. Moon did it
behind Uncle's back?

576
00:39:58,337 --> 00:40:01,308
What's important is that
if everyone knew the will was...

577
00:40:01,308 --> 00:40:03,772
in the clock, no one
would have fed him sleeping pills.

578
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:06,947
When the will was moved to the safe
in Dad's room,

579
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:09,288
people thought
about feeding him sleeping pills...

580
00:40:09,288 --> 00:40:11,287
because they had to put him sleep.

581
00:40:11,288 --> 00:40:14,223
Are you saying that Mr. Moon
switched places with that in mind?

582
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:17,297
(Ji Sul Young)

583
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:19,593
The file that was found
on her laptop...

584
00:40:20,297 --> 00:40:22,127
was a map to the safe.

585
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,263
So did they work together
to plot this?

586
00:40:25,538 --> 00:40:26,963
It's highly likely.

587
00:40:32,107 --> 00:40:34,903
It's the only painting
he didn't paint in this house.

588
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:39,113
He was never interested
in other painters' art.

589
00:40:39,748 --> 00:40:42,343
But do you know why he hung
this painting in the living room?

590
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:44,952
It was a warning.

591
00:40:46,328 --> 00:40:49,823
It was a warning
to the painter of this piece.

592
00:40:51,427 --> 00:40:54,622
Why isn't the sun
in the painting red?

593
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:02,732
The red sun
we commonly know of is fake.

594
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:04,973
In fact, the sun is blue and white.

595
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:09,912
The painter wanted us
to see the real colors of the sun.

596
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:14,513
How fascinating.

597
00:41:16,157 --> 00:41:17,713
But the truth is,

598
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:23,923
the painter all of a sudden
developed a paint allergy.

599
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:27,292
But for some reason,

600
00:41:27,728 --> 00:41:30,963
red was the first paint to
give him the allergic reaction.

601
00:41:32,137 --> 00:41:35,438
So the painter
couldn't use red paints.

602
00:41:35,438 --> 00:41:39,303
And as a desperate attempt
to paint, he chose those colors.

603
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,403
Of course,

604
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:45,713
the painter never admitted
the paint allergy to the public.

605
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:49,553
So what I just told you...

606
00:41:51,688 --> 00:41:53,383
might not be the truth.

607
00:42:46,047 --> 00:42:47,243
Yes, Producer.

608
00:42:47,808 --> 00:42:49,912
You told me to call you
if I had anything else to share.

609
00:42:56,487 --> 00:42:59,113
You can listen to the whole story
of what happened to Mr. Yoo In Gook.

610
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:03,053
The statute of limitations
for the case has passed.

611
00:43:03,328 --> 00:43:04,923
Mr. Yoo In Gook's death...

612
00:43:05,598 --> 00:43:07,963
might be connected to In Ho's death.

613
00:43:09,498 --> 00:43:11,732
You're saying those two cases
could be connected?

614
00:43:55,648 --> 00:43:58,018
So Uncle was the one
who plotted the whole incident.

615
00:43:58,018 --> 00:44:01,613
But Mr. Moon knew about it and
changed the location of the will.

616
00:44:02,047 --> 00:44:05,182
Aunt Sul Young drew the map
to the safe, the new location.

617
00:44:05,357 --> 00:44:08,452
And she knew about his allergic
reaction to the sleeping pills.

618
00:44:08,788 --> 00:44:10,952
My gosh, why is this so complicated?

619
00:44:13,828 --> 00:44:17,533
Who do you think
was the first one to plan this?

620
00:44:18,768 --> 00:44:19,903
Uncle?

621
00:44:20,808 --> 00:44:23,137
Then, Dad was the first one
to plan this.

622
00:44:23,137 --> 00:44:24,808
And someone who found out
about his plan...

623
00:44:24,808 --> 00:44:26,872
used his plan against him...

624
00:44:27,478 --> 00:44:28,903
and killed Dad?

625
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,243
This is giving me the chills.

626
00:44:31,748 --> 00:44:34,243
That means Uncle was murdered.

627
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:06,482
I handed over the recorder
to the police.

628
00:45:07,148 --> 00:45:10,153
The statute of limitations
passed anyway.

629
00:45:10,757 --> 00:45:13,252
Wait. But still.

630
00:45:14,257 --> 00:45:16,752
That's not what's important now.

631
00:45:18,927 --> 00:45:20,093
For the time being,

632
00:45:20,628 --> 00:45:22,993
you must go into hiding.

633
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:26,463
Do so until our plan is complete.

634
00:45:50,257 --> 00:45:53,323
The painting in question
is not my piece.

635
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:56,223
I hope the truth will be uncovered
as soon as possible.

636
00:45:56,268 --> 00:45:59,498
They conducted an X-ray test
to sort out the forged painting,

637
00:45:59,498 --> 00:46:03,708
but the result showed a possibility
the sketch was done by one person.

638
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,507
Today at 10 p.m., "News Table"...

639
00:46:05,507 --> 00:46:08,573
will give you a full account
of the late Yoo In Ho's incident.

640
00:46:16,958 --> 00:46:19,182
My gosh, that sly geezer.

641
00:46:19,288 --> 00:46:20,682
Where is he hiding?

642
00:46:20,728 --> 00:46:21,823
Ms. Park.

643
00:46:22,228 --> 00:46:23,958
Are you sure you didn't see
that jerk, Moon Jeong Wook?

644
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:25,458
I have no idea.

645
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:27,162
He's been gone since yesterday.

646
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:31,093
My gosh.
Where could I find that jerk?

647
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:44,113
Bit Na.

648
00:46:44,378 --> 00:46:48,142
You have a mail.

649
00:46:49,587 --> 00:46:51,252
(Recipient: Yoo Bit Na)

650
00:47:47,677 --> 00:47:49,243
What is it?
Why are you so surprised?

651
00:47:52,978 --> 00:47:54,343
It's you in the photo.

652
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:56,682
(June 30, 2020)

653
00:47:57,418 --> 00:47:58,713
This date...

654
00:47:58,717 --> 00:47:59,923
What is it?

655
00:48:11,368 --> 00:48:12,633
On the night of In Ho's death,

656
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:16,062
you were at his studio?

657
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:18,732
What is it?

658
00:48:35,927 --> 00:48:38,752
Why can't you answer me?
Were you in his studio?

659
00:49:04,887 --> 00:49:06,522
Thank you for coming.

660
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:08,022
This way.

661
00:49:19,467 --> 00:49:20,832
Dad sent me...

662
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:24,002
a text message.

663
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:41,252
He told me he needed
to talk to me in secret.

664
00:49:41,987 --> 00:49:43,323
The message told me...

665
00:49:44,328 --> 00:49:46,252
to be in his studio at 4 a.m.

666
00:49:46,828 --> 00:49:47,923
Go on.

667
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,792
He didn't come down,

668
00:49:51,038 --> 00:49:53,768
so I went upstairs
and saw that he was sleeping.

669
00:49:53,768 --> 00:49:55,363
And then, I got out.

670
00:50:08,748 --> 00:50:09,843
Nice to meet you.

671
00:50:31,277 --> 00:50:32,308
You were the one...

672
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:33,978
- who injected him with nicotine.
- What?

673
00:50:33,978 --> 00:50:35,973
Why are you accusing her
out of nowhere?

674
00:50:37,378 --> 00:50:41,182
Given the time, that's when
someone injected him with nicotine.

675
00:50:41,217 --> 00:50:43,142
And Bit Na was there.

676
00:50:43,487 --> 00:50:45,252
Am I making stuff up?

677
00:50:57,368 --> 00:51:00,162
I came here today...

678
00:51:00,538 --> 00:51:03,337
to share everything I know
about the late artist,

679
00:51:03,337 --> 00:51:05,573
Yoo In Ho's forgery case.

680
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:09,473
Actually, all of his paintings
which people loved him for...

681
00:51:10,148 --> 00:51:11,872
were mine.

682
00:51:12,777 --> 00:51:15,642
For the past 15 years,

683
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,653
I have been living...

684
00:51:19,257 --> 00:51:20,952
as his slave.

685

(CHIP-IN)

686
00:51:24,357 --> 00:51:26,027
If that's true, it's very shocking.

687
00:51:26,027 --> 00:51:28,567
I painted everything myself.

688
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:30,668
Of course, I was the one
who came up with all the ideas.

689
00:51:30,668 --> 00:51:32,737
- Where did you bury my dad?
- I was going to turn myself in.

690
00:51:32,737 --> 00:51:34,107
Your world will be
more painful than now.

691
00:51:34,107 --> 00:51:35,768
You were going to keep it a secret
unless the photos came, right?

692
00:51:35,768 --> 00:51:37,038
Are you putting on an act?

693
00:51:37,038 --> 00:51:39,578
Your mother's assault charge
was actually yours, right?

694
00:51:39,578 --> 00:51:40,808
Don't you dare attack Bit Na.

695
00:51:40,808 --> 00:51:42,542
I don't care who you are.
I won't let it slide.

696
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,518
Obviously, this is your script.

697
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,587
- Isn't this your murder plan?
- Stop it already!

698
00:51:46,587 --> 00:51:48,648
The person who threw
the pottery over her head...

699
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:50,383
and hit her with a golf club...

700
00:51:50,587 --> 00:51:52,812
And the person who injected In Ho
with nicotine...
