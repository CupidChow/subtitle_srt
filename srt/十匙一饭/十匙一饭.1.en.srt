00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,080
(Secret)

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,500
(Key)

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,000
(Many images of keys,
key images)

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,510
(Yoo Hae Joon)

5
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,730
(Chip In)

6
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,840
Don't be so grumpy
on Dad's birthday this year,

7
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,060
and be good.

8
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,140
If you talk to him nicely...

9
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,070
and show him a little smile,
then he'll give you all his money.

10
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,570
Why can't you do that?

11
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,850
If I were you, I wouldn't
stop doing that after 10 times.

12
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,320
I'd do it 100, no, even 1,000 times.

13
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,610
Are you insane?

14
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,320
Why would I smile
to get money from Dad?

15
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,190
Good for you.

16
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,290
Mom.

17
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,060
Don't talk to him about money.

18
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,720
This time, I won't hold myself back.

19
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,600
If I don't do it, will you?

20
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,530
You pester Dad so hard to get money
only to let your boyfriend take it.

21
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,100
Do you want to do that again?

22
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,970
It's not like this is a first.

23
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,470
Doesn't your pride get crushed
when you beg him for money?

24
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,140
We can't spare to have pride
in this situation.

25
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,900
You'll know when you turn my age.

26
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,680
I'll never live like you
even when I reach your age.

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,250
I said that too.
I said I won't live like my mom.

28
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,010
Well,

29
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,180
I am living a different life
from your grandmother.

30
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,960
This time,
I'm going to make it clear to Dad.

31
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,230
That he doesn't need to
send money to support me.

32
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,760
You.

33
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,090
You're just saying that, right?

34
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,300
To surprise me.

35
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,010
I'm 20 now.

36
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,610
I'm an adult.

37
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,140
It's absurd to take
child-rearing expenses at this age.

38
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,350
It's not like I used that money.

39
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,410
What will you do
about your college tuition?

40
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,720
I already made that money
and paid the tuition.

41
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,390
If that doesn't work out,
I'll take out a student loan.

42
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,220
A loan? You have no idea
how scary money can be.

43
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,220
I did that because I already know...

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,630
how scary money can be.

45
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,150
If I made easy money,
I thought I might blow it all...

46
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,530
like you did.

47
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,230
You and I have no time to bicker.

48
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,940
I don't know how that woman
convinced your dad...

49
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,700
since she moved in two years ago,

50
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,540
but he totally lets her rule.

51
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,040
You and I need to work together
to show them what we have.

52
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,430
Are you going there to pick a fight?

53
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,670
My goodness.

54
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,420
You get oddly sensitive and fussy
whenever we go to his place.

55
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,250
You can't even sleep at night.

56
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,340
Do you hate his place that much?

57
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,330
(Episode 1)

58
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,270
Where... Where should I look?

59
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,530
You can relax and look ahead.

60
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,740
Okay.

61
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,280
That day was...

62
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,310
Well,

63
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,410
it was two days before
Mr. Yoo's birthday.

64
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,520
By Mr. Yoo,

65
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,150
do you mean Painter Yoo In Ho?

66
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,060
Yes. That was the day...

67
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,760
when all of his family was
to gather together.

68
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,670
Ever since he was
diagnosed as terminally ill,

69
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,770
he must have grown weaker at heart.

70
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,370
It was the first time
he invited the entire family.

71
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,100
But...

72
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,940
how could
something like that happen?

73
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,120
My goodness.

74
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,000
It's been a while.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,370
Do you have trouble
with your eyesight?

76
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,970
I'm here too.

77
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,840
There's a water leak at our place.

78
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,750
May we stay for a few days
while we do some construction work?

79
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,820
We have a lot of luggage.

80
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,650
It'd be great
if you can help us out.

81
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,060
That rude brat.

82
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,620
Honestly speaking, I know...

83
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,060
what I did 20 years ago was wrong,
having an affair with her husband.

84
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,720
But Mr. Yoo and I were...

85
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,870
really in love.

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,900
Passionately.

87
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,770
What's so great about her?

88
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,880
You brought so much luggage.
How long will you be staying?

89
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,550
Do I need your permission
on how long I can stay?

90
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,980
It just makes my life more difficult
with so many guests around.

91
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,090
"Guests"?

92
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,520
You have a funny way
of saying things.

93
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,130
To be frank,
Bit Na is the only one...

94
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,900
who's registered as Mr. Yoo's child.

95
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,030
Do you honestly have no idea...

96
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,770
who the real owner is
and who's a guest here?

97
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,900
Wait, you have to help me
move these bags!

98
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,530
Ms. Park.

99
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,740
Hey, lady!

100
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,650
She's a maid here,
not the lady of the house.

101
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,520
"Ms. Park"?

102
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,240
Ms., my foot.

103
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,110
My gosh!

104
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,820
What is this?

105
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,350
Who's that?

106
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,260
Did you see a ghost or something?

107
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,490
You seem way too shocked.

108
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,600
There's no reason
to hide anything from him.

109
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,590
Even Mr. Yoo
doesn't treat him like a brother.

110
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,510
He has five previous convictions.

111
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,100
Did you get released?

112
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,730
When did you get released?

113
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,880
Why?

114
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,240
If you had known,
would you have picked me up?

115
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,020
It has been two months.

116
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,050
I've been to prison many times,

117
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,090
but I can never get used to having
no one there for me when I leave.

118
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,790
Man, Sun of all people
should've been there.

119
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,660
It's not like
you've been to a great place.

120
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,590
There are people living there too.

121
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,760
Don't be so hard on me.

122
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,900
You're looking pretty great.

123
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,530
I've recently started
a cultural enterprise.

124
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,230
Goodness, did you just move in?

125
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,880
Right.

126
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,340
There's a water leak at my house.

127
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,610
We're going to change the interior
while we work on the repairs.

128
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,320
I heard Scandinavian design is
really big these days.

129
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,740
Scandinavian design is
a bit tacky now.

130
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,590
I want to go with
the Northern European style.

131
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,220
But you should stick
with something that's popular.

132
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,830
- Northern European style.
- Scandinavian is better.

133
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,830
They're both absurd.

134
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,670
Even I know that Scandinavia
is in northwestern Europe.

135
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,570
So Bit Na and her mom
arrived the earliest that day?

136
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,710
Yes.

137
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,640
Can you tell me about them?

138
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,950
Ji Hye is materialistic and greedy
to the bone,

139
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,780
but her daughter
is the complete opposite.

140
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,890
The others would ask me
to do all sorts of favors.

141
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,030
But Bit Na has never asked me
to wash even her socks.

142
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,630
She speaks her mind...

143
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,420
and does everything herself.

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,290
Hey, Sun.

145
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,160
We should at least greet each other.

146
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,110
You know, we should ask each other
how we've been doing.

147
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,410
We should make small talk.

148
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,850
You're in college now.
You should dress up better.

149
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,670
Your fashion is terrible.

150
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,720
When are you leaving?
I hope it's sometime soon.

151
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,190
I'm not planning to stay here
for long,

152
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,660
but I also don't want
to be chased off.

153
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,780
Do as you please.

154
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,030
My daughter!

155
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,100
How long has it been?

156
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,970
How could you not visit me
at least once?

157
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,340
She's my daughter. She's 18.

158
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,900
I'm 20.

159
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,360
You are?

160
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,240
Gosh, time sure does fly. Goodness.

161
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,300
Gosh, you're all mature...

162
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,380
Right. Being nonchalant
is the trend nowadays.

163
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,390
She sure is trendy.

164
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,780
Trendy, my foot.
She's just impudent.

165
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,350
Bring my luggage to my room.

166
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,460
Who does she think I am?

167
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,650
My gosh.

168
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,630
It's true
that they weren't on good terms.

169
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,290
Whom are you talking about?

170
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,410
Bit Na and Sun.

171
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,840
After all, they're relatives,
but they were so cold.

172
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,600
Sul Young.

173
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,010
How's my brother?

174
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,590
- He's struggling a lot.
- Gosh.

175
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,460
Poor him.

176
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,480
By the way,
he's written his will, right?

177
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,890
He should get that done
while he's still alive.

178
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,070
What's it to you?

179
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,670
There's Bit Na.

180
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,470
As if In Ho would let her inherit
everything.

181
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,910
Don't you know his temper?

182
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,340
These are Chaga mushrooms.
They're for him.

183
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,450
And please put in
a good word for me.

184
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,000
- I'm running a cultural enterprise.
- They're braised short ribs.

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,570
In Ho's works are scarce
in the market.

186
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,200
There's no set price.

187
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Really?

188
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,340
There aren't many Korean painters
who have his style.

189
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,840
It's a unique style
of abstract expressionism.

190
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,870
"Abstract expressionism"?
What does the latter mean?

191
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,970
Does he write these days?

192
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,380
You're so dense.

193
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,160
Oh, my!

194
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,690
Hello, Mr. Yoo. Sit down.

195
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,880
Thank you for inviting us.

196
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,200
What made you invite all of us over?

197
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,890
In Ho, how are you feeling?

198
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,970
During the beginning stages,
the cancer is pretty much benign.

199
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,810
But I heard it's really painful
during the final stages.

200
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,970
What is it?

201
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,770
Do you want me to die early
and give you my inheritance...

202
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,710
since I'm terminally ill anyway?

203
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,150
It's hurtful to see you
twist my words like that.

204
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,780
It wasn't easy for me to bring
those medicinal mushrooms.

205
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,350
I heard your final days
are even more painful...

206
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,220
if you eat a lot of good food.
What is it?

207
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,460
Do you want me to die
a painful death?

208
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,980
Come on, now.

209
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
It's salty.

210
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,370
Yoo In Ho
is a world-renowned artist.

211
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,470
Don't you know him?

212
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,810
He's a terrible geezer.

213
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,970
He's a dictator.

214
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,210
Ms. Park.

215
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,220
Why is this so salty?

216
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,880
I seasoned it the way I always have.

217
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,420
Please submit a written apology.

218
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,550
Sorry?

219
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,960
You've written one before.

220
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,620
You always make me write
those written apologies.

221
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,700
Yes, sir.

222
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,600
Mr. Yoo, try this.

223
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
This one's seasoned just right.

224
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,080
Seeing how you're brown-nosing me,
you must need some money again.

225
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,010
It's not like that.

226
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,720
Don't lie.
This isn't my first rodeo.

227
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,480
You've squeezed...

228
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,950
almost an entire building's worth
of money out of me.

229
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,480
I'm not falling for it this time,
and that's the end of it.

230
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,690
Don't exaggerate now.

231
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,290
Ji Hye, let me know
if you need some money.

232
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,330
I can make you earn tenfold.

233
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,490
These days,
art makes a lot of money.

234
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,440
You scumbag. I told you
not to scam under my roof.

235
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
In Ho, this isn't a scam.
It's an investment...

236
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,100
Get out of here
if you're going to continue.

237
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,180
In Ho, why are you
shutting me down like that?

238
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,500
You're nothing but a con-man.
I shouldn't have invited you.

239
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,460
Sun, why is your makeup so thick?
Wash it off.

240
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,790
I'm not just saying this
because she's my daughter,

241
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,190
but she looks beautiful.

242
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,800
Didn't you hear me?

243
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,040
Let me help you.

244
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,170
That was fast.

245
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,270
Uncle, I'm home.

246
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,310
I'm sorry for being late.

247
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,580
Hi, Sun.

248
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,880
Hey, are you not feeling well?

249
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,160
I'll eat later.

250
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,250
No.

251
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,070
Oh, I'm done. Sit here.

252
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,130
Mr. Moon is my uncle's friend
and manager.

253
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,380
He's kindhearted...

254
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,080
but a bit too much,
so I can see through him.

255
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,950
He's a pushover.

256
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,950
Sit here. I'm done.

257
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,690
- Where are you going?
- Thank you for the meal.

258
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,880
Where are you going?

259
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,660
What an impudent brat.

260
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,990
I might die as early as tomorrow,
but you refuse to even look at me.

261
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,040
I'm looking at you now.
You're happy, right?

262
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,340
How dare you say that?

263
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,870
I'm not the type
who cherishes my family anyway.

264
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,910
So you should all quit thinking
that you'd get my fortune.

265
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,180
Bit Na.

266
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,700
So? How are you doing
at the law school?

267
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm doing fine.

268
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,500
Laws are closely connected
to our lives.

269
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,070
It's very fun to learn.

270
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,000
Then why are your grades so low?

271
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,580
If you get such low grades
once again,

272
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,370
I'm no longer going to pay
your tuition.

273
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,420
Okay.

274
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,470
Hae Joon.

275
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,100
He's In Ho's brother's son,
and In Ho cherishes him the most.

276
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,610
Perhaps,

277
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,270
he might love him more than
he loves his own daughter.

278
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,910
("Path", Working title)

279
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,560
(Ji Sul Young)

280
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,260
My gosh!

281
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,640
Are you a ghost or something?
What are you doing here?

282
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,370
Have you written your apology?

283
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,880
I should write it now.

284
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,180
How about you just work
somewhere else?

285
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,010
Cut that nonsense and go to bed.

286
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,380
I mean,

287
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,250
why are you still around
when he treats you so badly?

288
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,500
I know what your intentions are.

289
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,360
Well, tell me then!

290
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,570
You didn't have to shout.

291
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,130
How would you know my intentions
when even I don't know them?

292
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,110
He asked you to submit
a written apology...

293
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,970
just because the food was salty.

294
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,350
Was he always like that?

295
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,780
Yes.

296
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,550
Then why did you continue...

297
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,220
to work for him
for the past 20 years?

298
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,560
Well... When he wasn't feeling well,

299
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,530
he was very cranky.

300
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:07,260
But he treated me just like
he treated his family members.

301
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,140
I don't think he was
very affectionate toward them.

302
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,940
That's true.

303
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,830
By any chance,

304
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,340
did you refuse to quit...

305
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,680
because of what he said?

306
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,550
- Sorry?
- Mr. Yoo...

307
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,980
often told those around him...

308
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,150
that he'd give his fortune to you.

309
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,720
I was wondering if that was why
you didn't quit.

310
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,200
All right, then.
Let's go back to the story.

311
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,400
I heard there was an incident
the next morning.

312
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,910
I don't understand
why such a thing happened...

313
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,710
to Bit Na, of all people.

314
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,370
Bit Na.

315
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,140
Are you okay?

316
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,970
What is this? Are you hurt?

317
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,220
My gosh.

318
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,160
So none of you saw it?

319
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,830
This isn't a palace.

320
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,870
How could there be no witnesses?

321
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,670
Let me see.

322
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,670
Darn it. Who in the world did this?

323
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,380
Look at how thick this is.
She could've gotten seriously hurt.

324
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,610
- Look.
- Hold on.

325
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,270
Isn't this the gift that I gave
Mr. Yoo last year?

326
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,880
I knew it.

327
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,740
It was you, wasn't it?

328
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,490
It's obviously a cheap one.

329
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,310
No, it wasn't.

330
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,420
Someone almost got injured.

331
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,390
The price doesn't matter.

332
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,490
Guys, let's check
the CCTV footage first.

333
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,900
All the CCTV cameras
are directed outside.

334
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,790
None of them record
what's going on inside the house.

335
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,970
Let's call the police first.

336
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Hey, In Ho is going to hate it
if he sees the police here.

337
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,850
Are you sure it's not you
who hates them?

338
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,820
You and your words...

339
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,820
- Let's call the police first.
- It won't make a difference...

340
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,310
unless the suspect comes clean...

341
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,960
or if they find fingerprints
on this.

342
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,130
They will find them.

343
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,230
What if you're wrong?
What will you do?

344
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,530
I'll bet my car...

345
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,260
that we won't find anything on it.

346
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,500
But then again, none of you
would be interested in my car.

347
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,000
Whoever gets his inheritance
can buy any car...

348
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,110
Oh, right.

349
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,580
Why did he invite us over?

350
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,570
Is it related to his inheritance?

351
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,350
He probably just missed you guys.
It's simple as that.

352
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,450
I heard his latest painting
was worth a million dollars.

353
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,250
I wonder if his paintings
are part of his inheritance.

354
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,560
By the way,
is it true that they're worth...

355
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,820
a million per piece?

356
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,400
He sure has an innate talent
for making loads of money.

357
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,700
If it's really innate,

358
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,210
he must've inherited that talent
all to himself...

359
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,830
unlike someone.

360
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,070
This house, the paintings...

361
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,850
How much are they worth in total?

362
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,250
They're probably worth
tens of millions, right?

363
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,720
Really? If I get his inheritance,
this car would mean nothing...

364
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,860
Gosh, who's responsible for this?

365
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,050
Darn it.

366
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,400
Bit Na.

367
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,140
You should be careful
for the time being.

368
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,730
If it's impossible,
try not to make any enemies.

369
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,770
You think I made enemies?

370
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,110
Not with your words.

371
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,880
But with your actions, yes.

372
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,320
You treat us all
as if we're your enemies.

373
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,720
After what happened to me,
they're still not my enemy?

374
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,460
There may be just one enemy for now,
but it may increase...

375
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,750
exponentially.

376
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,250
And could that enemy be you?

377
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,870
What would I gain from doing that?

378
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,560
You'll be getting rid
of the heiress.

379
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,680
Why do you think you'll receive it?

380
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,270
I've never thought
that you'd inherit it.

381
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,450
Which is exactly why
I wouldn't do such a thing.

382
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,220
Take good care of your wound.

383
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,580
It shouldn't get infected.

384
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,430
I almost died back there.

385
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,750
Do you still want to stay?

386
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,490
You know that your dad
may pass away at any time.

387
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,800
Let's keep him company
until his birthday tomorrow.

388
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,670
Is that more important than this?

389
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,560
That's not what I meant.

390
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,300
If you want, you can stay.

391
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,610
I'm leaving.

392
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,350
You can't go.

393
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,120
Hey, if you hold out until tomorrow,

394
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,220
you may get a million
or even 10 million dollars.

395
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,690
Mom!

396
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,780
Hey.

397
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,630
Just think about this.

398
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,230
We're so close
to hitting the jackpot,

399
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,730
so how can you just leave?

400
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,470
You and everyone here aren't sane.

401
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,170
Do you really not get
why I got injured?

402
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,260
It's all because
of that inheritance.

403
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,830
There's no proof.

404
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,770
You've all gone mad over money.

405
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,070
Our entire family
is fighting over money.

406
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,950
Is this normal?

407
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,920
Please do this for me. Please?

408
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,420
Whoever did this to you...

409
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,760
won't be able to do it again
since there are people watching.

410
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,600
You can just stay by my side.

411
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,260
Mom.

412
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,930
I'm begging you.

413
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,970
I'm going to kneel, okay?

414
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,440
Look at me. I'm kneeling.

415
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,260
- Gosh.
- Bit Na.

416
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,500
Bit Na.

417
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,730
Bit Na. Please?

418
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,170
What is it?

419
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,830
Do you think glaring like that
will help you find the culprit?

420
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,050
Goodness.
Doesn't that hurt your eyes?

421
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,850
How could you be
in the mood for jokes...

422
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,690
when someone almost died?

423
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,480
Right. Your daughter almost died.

424
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,550
But you still can't leave
in case you'll upset In Ho, right?

425
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,320
Right, you chose money
over your own daughter.

426
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,770
Had that happened to Sun,

427
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,200
I would've left this place
in a heartbeat.

428
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,910
I knew it. It was you.

429
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,580
You wanted us to leave.

430
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,280
Don't just talk nonsense
without any proof.

431
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,970
I know very well
what kind of human being you are.

432
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,450
You'd give up
on that hefty sum of money?

433
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,010
Don't be ridiculous.

434
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,510
What are you rambling on about?

435
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,780
Think about it.

436
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,920
You've committed
money-related frauds five times...

437
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,020
and even went to prison.

438
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,290
And yet, you'd leave this place
just like that?

439
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,250
That's just ludicrous.

440
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,020
What? "Ludicrous"?

441
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,640
Gosh, you make it sound like
you're all innocent.

442
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,500
I didn't assault anyone unlike you.

443
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,180
You with a previous conviction
of assault shouldn't say that.

444
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,210
What?

445
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,820
I mean, you were his mistress,

446
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,950
so why did you assault his wife?

447
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,320
Why would you bring that up?

448
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,560
There are levels to crimes.

449
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,560
A scam and an assault
are very different.

450
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,100
Scamming is an intellectual crime.

451
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,900
An assault is a simpleton's crime
that only makes use of your body.

452
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,600
Stop talking so smoothly,
you con man.

453
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,440
It's much better than
an ignorant assailant.

454
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,910
I was put on probation!
I didn't go to prison!

455
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,970
It's only because
In Ho used money to get you out!

456
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,980
- "Money"?
- Yes!

457
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,340
She's completely impossible.

458
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,180
I mean, she seduced
a happily married man...

459
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,680
and had a child with him.
She isn't the ordinary type.

460
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,450
She'd sell her soul for money
if she could.

461
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,920
And her daughter is very weird too.

462
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,160
Well, I feel bad
something like that happened to her.

463
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,220
Man.

464
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,700
Are you all right?
I heard you almost died.

465
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,830
You wanted to have small talks
as cousins. Isn't this it?

466
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,970
How is my near-death experience
a small talk?

467
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,680
But you didn't die.
Isn't everything okay, then?

468
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,190
- Hey!
- That's the price...

469
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,480
for joking around
with a person's life.

470
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,750
I just went easy on you.

471
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,730
Aren't you cold?

472
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,240
I'm counting my days until I die,
but this is still all right.

473
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,180
Stop saying that you'll die.

474
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,210
You're just like your father.

475
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,150
I often heard that
my father was a handsome man.

476
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,980
And he always had women in his life
thanks to his looks.

477
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,790
That's exactly like me too.

478
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,690
What? You punk.

479
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,050
You can take after everything else
about him but that.

480
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,780
That's what I regret the most
in my life.

481
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,250
If you...

482
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,290
really want to love someone,
love only one person...

483
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,320
with all of your heart.

484
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,170
I'll give that a thought.

485
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,300
Hey, do you have any liquor
around here?

486
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,330
It's bad for his stomach cancer,
so I put everything away.

487
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,400
Do you have anything hidden away?

488
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,540
That's my emergency stash.

489
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,570
Why would I give you
something like that?

490
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,910
It looks like you aren't taking
any sleeping pills today.

491
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,010
I'm trying to cut back.

492
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,720
The doctor told me to do so too.

493
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,290
Figures. I'm sure
it's not good for you.

494
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,450
You should just quit taking it
with this chance.

495
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,320
I'll take my time to do that.

496
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,560
I don't like anything
about this place.

497
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,030
Why? What? You got a problem?

498
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,160
No, not that.

499
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,590
I have something to say.

500
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,090
Go ahead.

501
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,820
I have to ask you
for your understanding.

502
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,850
Tomorrow is his birthday, right?

503
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,990
And?

504
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,320
We'll have reporters here
for an interview.

505
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,500
So?

506
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,270
I hope you can
stay away from the interview.

507
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,590
Bad news. I'll make sure I show up.

508
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,470
Don't you think...

509
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,930
it'll be weird to have
both of us in the same room?

510
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,140
Then you can stay away.

511
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,720
I don't want
the reporters to gossip later on.

512
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,340
If someone wants to gossip,

513
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,460
they will gossip
regardless of my presence.

514
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,920
And if someone did something
to become a gossip,

515
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,880
then it's only natural
that people would gossip.

516
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,150
I don't think...

517
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,470
I did that deed.

518
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,090
"That deed".

519
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,200
Exactly.

520
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,570
I did that deed,
so I'll hear them gossip.

521
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,780
Anyway, I'll make sure
I show up at the interview.

522
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,870
That's all.

523
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,230
It's night.

524
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,360
An old saying says anything can
listen to you by day and night.

525
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,810
I'll let it slide just this once.

526
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,310
But you better
get rid of that habit from now on.

527
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,870
Give me a cup of tea in my room.

528
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,910
In this house full of secrets,

529
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,380
everyone has their ears and eyes...

530
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,260
on each other.

531
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,720
There are those
who want to hide themselves.

532
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,640
And there are those...

533
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,020
who dig up secrets
as if it's a treasure hunt.

534
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,850
If I get caught now,
everything will be over.

535
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,850
I'm hanging up.

536
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,830
That absurd woman.

537
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,900
Who is she to tell me not to come?

538
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,010
What a huge snob.

539
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,410
Whose eyes were those
which were staring at me...

540
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,220
this morning?

541
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,580
And what...

542
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,760
are they trying to now?

543
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,750
That was a good sleep.

544
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,110
What's that?

545
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,630
"Kim Ji Hye"?

546
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,450
Please look over here too.

547
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,820
Does it look good?

548
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,520
All right.

549
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,990
Over here.

550
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,670
Thanks to him, I'm trying
to bring out my artistic side too.

551
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,100
That's right.

552
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,310
My gosh. Mr. Yoo is...

553
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,570
Hey.

554
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,980
You should do something too.

555
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,820
Look at him.

556
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,280
He's making a fuss with his
congratulatory video and whatnot.

557
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,490
Why do you think he's doing that?

558
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,700
He's young, but he's trying
to get some of the inheritance.

559
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,130
He knows he can take or lose
millions of dollars...

560
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,430
depending on his actions.

561
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,570
I'm fulfilling my duty
by staying here instead of leaving.

562
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,740
My duty to you, not to Dad.

563
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,640
- You're doing this for me?
- Yes.

564
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,550
Then, do it right.

565
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,150
You should go and flatter him.
Or give him a shoulder massage.

566
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,490
All right. Fine. Sit here.
You're unbelievable.

567
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,490
You guys make a beautiful couple.

568
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,970
You got a divorce 20 years ago.

569
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,890
But you are continuing
your relationship as lovers.

570
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,870
Did you think about, perhaps,
reuniting with one another?

571
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,840
The form doesn't matter.

572
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,350
I married her 25 years ago.

573
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,080
Ever since then,
I have always considered her...

574
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,820
as my first and last life companion.

575
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,080
What a load of nonsense.

576
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,530
Who is she?

577
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,470
I will move onto the next question.

578
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,510
I'll season the food.

579
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,610
One of you will be my assistant.

580
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,010
And one of you will prepare
the ingredients, serve them,

581
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,850
wash the dishes, and check
if everything is going smoothly.

582
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:38,690
Do you see the painter over there?
It's his birthday.

583
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,080
The lady next to him
is the lady of the house.

584
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,660
And...

585
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,760
the woman over there thinks
she's the lady of the house.

586
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,070
She's a fake.

587
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,030
"A fake"?

588
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,370
I know that you're curious
and intrigued,

589
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,660
but stop it there.

590
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,340
Anyway, the fake lady of the house
is under the impression...

591
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,410
she has the control over the house,

592
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,350
so if she bosses you around,
just handle it quietly.

593
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,850
Let's get to work.

594
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,120
Why are they looking
at me like that?

595
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,430
He always thinks about art.
Art takes up all of his time.

596
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,990
A lot of your fans want to see
a joint project by the two of you.

597
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,240
And I'm one of the fans.
Do you have any plans for that?

598
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,510
You got me. I only thought
about spending my life with her.

599
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,350
Working with her never crossed
my mind. Goodness.

600
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:39,740
Both of us strive for perfection.

601
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,740
If we do work together,
I doubt we'll ever finish.

602
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,660
I didn't think about that.

603
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:52,300
In that case, let me ask you this.
I bet you get this question a lot.

604
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,310
Thank you so much for today.

605
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

606
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,810
Hopefully, I can show you
my appreciation with a good article.

607
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,110
Thank you.

608
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,550
Sure. Thank you.

609
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,890
- Thank you, sir.
- Sure.

610
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,550
By the way...

611
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:29,800
I guess you want to say something
about my comment earlier.

612
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,760
If you are going to do it,
make it quick. I'm in a hurry.

613
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,430
From now on, I want you
to be careful with your words.

614
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,680
She's so annoying.

615
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,780
So you're telling me
that you witnessed...

616
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,010
Kim Ji Hye and Ji Sul Young
have a fight.

617
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:50,510
It wasn't a fight. It was more like
an attempt to provoke each other.

618
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,090
Ms. Ji doesn't...

619
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,930
raise her voice whenever
she wants to unlike somebody.

620
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,550
By "somebody", do you mean...

621
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,390
Who do you think?
I'm talking about Bit Na's mom.

622
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,240
It's Ms. Kim Ji Hye.

623
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,010
Except for these two, did
anyone else have a fight that day?

624
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,800
Please tell me.
Who else had a fight?

625
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,390
It's about that forgery case.

626
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,600
Oh, right. How's that going?

627
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,370
The paintings are
all scattered around.

628
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,800
I gave you plenty of time
to look into it.

629
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,740
You still haven't gotten any leads?

630
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,420
- Is this the best you can do?
- I'm sorry.

631
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,990
I don't want your apology.
My credibility is on the line here.

632
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,080
Until when will you
just sit around and wait?

633
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,830
Your problem is that
you never do your job right.

634
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,430
No wonder
this is the life you end up with.

635
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,870
Bring me the ledger
of the foundation.

636
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,370
Seeing how you are awful
at your job,

637
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,740
I can't trust you
with my foundation.

638
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:19,830
The foundation is named after me.
I can't disgrace my name.

639
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,510
Okay.

640
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,970
I need more than just your words.
Bring it to me now!

641
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,490
Honey.

642
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,600
It's your birthday today.
Let's talk about this later.

643
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,620
- You...
- Honey.

644
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,170
Look at the photo.

645
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,990
Do you remember
when the photo was taken?

646
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,430
Mr. Yoo, you must be thirsty.
This is for you.

647
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,850
(Happy Birthday Uncle)

648
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,600
Why don't we go around the room...

649
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,740
and say a few words
to celebrate Uncle's birthday?

650
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,800
You're awful at hosting the party.

651
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,410
Give me the microphone.

652
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,890
All right, everyone.
You've been waiting for a long time.

653
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:13,520
Starting now, we will have
a birthday party for In Ho.

654
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,680
Let's give him a big hand.

655
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,200
To start the party,

656
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,230
I will sing a song for In Ho.

657
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,270
All right. 1, 2...

658
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:23,570
Stop it. Be quiet.

659
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:31,710
All right. I will deliver
a congratulatory speech I wrote.

660
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,310
I stayed up all night to write it.

661
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,470
Give me that.

662
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:41,240
My dear In Ho, happy birthday.

663
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,320
I met you at the age of 20
and gave birth to Bit Na.

664
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,550
That's enough.

665
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:49,760
I don't regret it.

666
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,910
Aunt Sul Young.
Why don't you go first?

667
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,200
Well, I just want him
to stay healthy. That's all I want.

668
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,780
Same here. I just want you
to be healthy too.

669
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,640
My gosh.
You guys all stole my lines.

670
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,350
Stay healthy.

671
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,490
All right. I want you to do
something about your nasty temper.

672
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,760
What did you say?

673
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:25,530
My gosh.

674
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,620
Uncle, happy birthday.

675
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,570
Thank you.

676
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:31,870
You have a talent
for killing the mood.

677
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,800
All right. Why don't you
lighten the mood, Bit Na?

678
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,510
Happy birthday.

679
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,740
You little brat.

680
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,180
Do you want to die?

681
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,280
What?

682
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,320
Why don't we hear
from the man of the hour?

683
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,930
A year ago, I was diagnosed
with a terminal illness.

684
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,260
You all worked hard to make a good
impression on me over the year.

685
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,940
I called you all here because
I'll announce my will tomorrow.

686
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,670
I will give our inheritances
as I see fit.

687
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:12,370
I don't want you to talk back
or complain about it.

688
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,370
It's my money.
I'm doing what I want.

689
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,890
Why don't we take a photo?

690
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,760
- Sure.
- Okay.

691
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,160
- We should take a group photo.
- Sure.

692
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,300
Gather around.

693
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,660
All right. This is my spot.

694
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,430
- All right, then.
- That's you.

695
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,010
- Right here?
- Yes.

696
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,640
In 1, 2, 3.

697
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,760
In Ho, this is my present for you.

698
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,300
This will even make a corpse
walk out of the coffin.

699
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,530
This is it.

700
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,100
I'll leave it here.

701
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:19,580
Mr. Yoo, this is my present.

702
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,080
It's from an expensive brand.

703
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,510
If you open it, I'm sure
you'll be very surprised.

704
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,010
Uncle, happy birthday.

705
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,010
And this too.

706
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,050
That's so black. It's creepy.

707
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,330
Isn't that too much?

708
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:45,930
Honey, why don't you open
the presents?

709
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,170
He got this for you.

710
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,660
- Yes. Open it.
- Gosh.

711
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:56,100
It's a great present.

712
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,300
What? Gosh.

713
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,800
I didn't do that. No!

714
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,490
- No!
- My gosh.

715
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:16,760
Goodness.

716
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,280
In Ho.

717
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,510
Honey.

718
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,970
In Ho.

719
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,220
In Ho!

720
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,580
Bit Na.

721
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,470
What a way to end a birthday party.

722
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:50,700
That was so crazy.

723
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,570
Quiet down.

724
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,410
It's okay. They can't hear me.

725
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,800
But it was pretty entertaining.

726
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,510
- Right?
- My gosh.

727
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,050
Mom, what's wrong with your foot?
Did you hurt your foot?

728
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,180
Oh, this? I sprained it earlier.

729
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,820
Be careful.

730
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,620
Let's go.

731
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,620
Did you see his face earlier?

732
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,780
Stop it.

733
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:19,050
Go wash up. I'll put out
clean clothes for you.

734
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,910
Shouldn't you at least comfort me?

735
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,300
Will you feel better...

736
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:38,470
even if I try to comfort you?

737
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,580
You're right.

738
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,720
Oh, right.

739
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,050
Should I tell you something
that will make you feel better?

740
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,390
Your birthday...

741
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,370
will be remembered forever...

742
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,640
whatever happens.

743
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,530
Come in.

744
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,710
Thank you.

745
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,140
You can put them over there.

746
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:11,620
Okay.

747
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,020
Honey, go and wash up now.

748
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,450
So you're telling me...

749
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:19,820
Mr. Yoo and Ms. Ji
had a fight, correct?

750
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:23,530
I'm not sure
if that's the right word.

751
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:26,720
Well, they were cold to each other.

752
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:30,500
Was that the case usually?

753
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,810
Usually, they were
the most affectionate couple.

754
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:38,810
Even Mr. Yoo who had a temper
was very gentle to Ms. Ji.

755
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:41,780
That day, I caught them
out of the blue.

756
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:45,620
It's understandable.
Bit Na and her mother were there.

757
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,250
So I think both of them
were a bit on edge.

758
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:52,180
But still, who knows what really
goes on between couples?

759
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,890
You're lucky.

760
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,190
You were supposed to work
until midnight,

761
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,260
but you ended at 10 p.m.
because of that ruckus.

762
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,100
- You can go.
- Thank you.

763
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,100
Everyone gets to leave this place
except for me.

764
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:11,910
Gosh.

765
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,140
What are you doing here?

766
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,280
My goodness. Gosh.

767
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,850
Didn't you have some pills
to cure a hangover or something?

768
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:26,760
You never take pills to sober up.

769
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:30,660
Do you want me
to make some honey water?

770
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:34,600
Gosh, no. It's all right. I'm fine.

771
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,530
Gosh, I didn't put that in the box.

772
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,870
Who put that in my present box?

773
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,470
What on earth is he plotting?

774
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:00,260
So Mr. Dokko Chul's behavior
was a bit fishy?

775
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,690
Yes. The way he behaved
was very awkward.

776
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,930
He was rushing.

777
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,070
Did anything else happen that night?

778
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:10,570
Well...

779
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,180
Goodness.

780
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,050
Gosh.

781
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,680
Why are you sighing
on In Ho's birthday?

782
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:38,330
Why do you care if I sigh or not?

783
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,460
You have no idea how exhausting...

784
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,830
my job is because
you never lift a finger to help.

785
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:46,490
Do you have sweet sparkling wine
like champagne?

786
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,330
I'm tired. Don't talk to me.
And get out of my way.

787
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,070
Goodness.

788
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:06,120
Hold on. I'll bring that to him.

789
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:08,990
You said you were tired.

790
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:16,370
And I need to talk to In Ho as well.

791
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,470
It's so obvious.

792
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:27,410
She's probably going
to ask for money.

793
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:45,600
I needed to talk to Chul.

794
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:48,200
You don't have to
explain that to me.

795
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,220
That's for In Ho, right?

796
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,490
Yes.

797
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:55,100
I'm sure today was exhausting
for you. Thank you for your service.

798
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,760
Don't mention it. Goodnight.

799
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:04,910
In what way
did Ms. Ji act suspiciously?

800
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,510
You know,

801
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:10,410
I have known Ms. Ji for 17 years.

802
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,490
But she has never...

803
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:15,160
talked to Dokko Chul in private.

804
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,260
Both of them couldn't care less
about each other.

805
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,930
But that day, for some reason,

806
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,390
she talked to him.

807
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,740
I was very surprised.

808
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,370
Ms. Ji.

809
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,370
Here's your morning coffee.

810
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,450
Gosh, it's so aromatic.

811
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,080
Have a cup of coffee.

812
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,740
Ms. Ji.

813
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,850
Ms. Ji?

814
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:07,330
She's some big shot artist.

815
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,080
Is Dad feeling better?

816
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,880
I'm on my way to wake him up now.

817
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,090
I wake him up every morning,

818
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,580
but he scolds me every morning.

819
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,160
Today...

820
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,390
Yes, you should wake him up.

821
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,630
That will make him feel better.

822
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:32,720
What?

823
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,930
Please do this for me.

824
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:37,930
Well...

825
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,970
You can do it.

826
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,660
Wake up.

827
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,780
Wake up. It's eight o'clock.

828
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:56,470
Dad.

829
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,030
Dad!

830

(CHIP-IN)

831
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,870
Dad!

832
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,910
Honey!

833
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:57,040
I'm suspicious of poisoning,

834
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,580
and there are circumstances
that show he was murdered.

835
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,910
That means one of us is the culprit.

836
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,810
So you heard something last night?

837
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,610
- I heard footsteps.
- I heard it too.

838
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:06,150
Me too. It sounded like
it came from Bit Na's room.

839
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,490
Aren't you honestly the most
interested in Uncle's inheritance?

840
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:11,450
I know. You killed Bit Na's dad!

841
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,820
Do you have evidence?

842
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:18,890
