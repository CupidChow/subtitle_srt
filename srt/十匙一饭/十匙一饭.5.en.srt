1
00:00:07,428 --> 00:00:10,097
Five suspects who chipped in
to murder the painter, Yoo,

2
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:12,727
by secretly giving him
sleeping pills...

3
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:14,068
were arrested without a warrant.

4
00:00:14,068 --> 00:00:16,068
- Do you feel bad for him?
- Why did you do that?

5
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:19,777
They were Yoo's family and friends
who were at his birthday party.

6
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:22,778
They are charged with a suspicion
for giving sleeping pills to Yoo,

7
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:25,447
who's allergic to sleeping agents,
on the day he passed away.

8
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:29,588
They stated that they did not know
about his sleeping pill allergy.

9
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:32,318
The police stated
they will request an arrest warrant,

10
00:00:32,318 --> 00:00:35,787
but their specific allegation is
still ambiguous at this point.

11
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:38,127
If the police cannot prove
reasons for detaining them,

12
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:40,627
they will be freed after 48 hours,
the limit they can be detained...

13
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:41,728
without a warrant.

14
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,728
The core issue of this case is this.

15
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:45,997
Can the five "chip in" murderers...

16
00:00:45,997 --> 00:00:48,497
be charged with homicide?

17
00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:50,938
The five are his mistress,
his half-brother, his nephew,

18
00:00:50,938 --> 00:00:53,038
his friend, and his maid,

19
00:00:53,038 --> 00:00:54,938
all of whom are very close to him.

20
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:57,648
Therefore, some people suggest
that he was murdered...

21
00:00:57,648 --> 00:01:00,548
over debt or grudge
involving his love affair.

22
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:02,178
They didn't plan on doing this,

23
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:04,947
but they gave him
one sleeping pill each...

24
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:06,118
and killed him.

25
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:08,288
I believe
this is an unprecedented case.

26
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:11,357
I believe we should
put our focus on Dokko Chul.

27
00:01:11,357 --> 00:01:13,628
He has five previous charges.
Isn't that evil?

28
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:15,657
In the end, it's money.
I think it's a money problem.

29
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:17,797
It was 100 percent his love affair.

30
00:01:17,797 --> 00:01:20,268
His wife and mistress were
in the same place.

31
00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:22,398
This is just... May I swear on TV?

32
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:24,607
The five suspects
who chipped in and murdered Yoo...

33
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:26,437
were all released...

34
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:28,538
after 48 hours of their arrest.

35
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:31,848
The court rejected the request
for their arrest warrant,

36
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:35,273
so the five will be questioned
without physical restraint.

37
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:37,642
- Take photos of the murderers!
- Take more photos!

38
00:01:37,717 --> 00:01:39,413
That's enough. Stop it.

39
00:01:39,988 --> 00:01:41,758
- What's with you?
- Stop it.

40
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:44,458
- Move aside.
- Stop filming!

41
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,958
People don't die...

42
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,497
after taking one sleeping pill,
do they?

43
00:01:49,497 --> 00:01:52,523
I really had
no intention of doing that.

44
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:54,493
It's not like
I can turn my heart inside out.

45
00:01:54,637 --> 00:01:56,568
It's really unfair.

46
00:01:56,568 --> 00:01:59,607
It's not like
a sleeping pill is poison.

47
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:02,837
Who would've thought
that he could die?

48
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:06,177
I was wrong.
Yes, what I did was wrong.

49
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:10,413
But still, I didn't know
something like that would happen.

50
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:12,883
All I did was
give him one sleeping pill.

51
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:17,483
I have nothing to say.

52
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:18,953
Oh, and one more.

53
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:21,722
I heard the side effects
kick in even worse...

54
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:24,363
if you turn it in to powder
and give it to him, but I...

55
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:26,763
didn't give it to him as powder.

56
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:30,338
She's right. If he had
a powdered pill with a hot drink,

57
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:31,338
he would be a goner.

58
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:32,733
He'd die at once.

59
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:35,273
Goodness.

60
00:02:36,877 --> 00:02:40,377
Why is the lady who crushed it
and added the pill...

61
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:43,287
into his hot soup suddenly sighing?

62
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:45,548
If we gave him a sleeping pill,
it's all the same.

63
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:46,657
Why do you nitpick over that?

64
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:48,683
The one who crushed it
in a blender is...

65
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,183
this lady right here.

66
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:52,357
I found out that...

67
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:55,157
no matter how vulnerable he is
with sleeping pills,

68
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:57,222
he wouldn't die after one pill.

69
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,527
I was the first one. Yes.

70
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:02,168
I was the first person
to give him a sleeping pill.

71
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:05,467
These people who gave it to him
much later killed him.

72
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:07,738
I have nothing to do with this!

73
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:10,148
Why are you getting worked up
and showing that off?

74
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,847
We need to nitpick over this.

75
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:14,948
Goodness, you must be glad
you were the first one.

76
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:16,588
The first one is at fault.

77
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:18,948
- If you didn't give it to him...
- You started everything off.

78
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,358
But you all gave it to him.

79
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:22,157
- It's the same.
- But you were the first.

80
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:24,287
You were the first one
who gave it to him.

81
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,858
- I got a call.
- But you gave it to him later.

82
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:29,293
- Hey, Bit Na. Yes?
- I need to nitpick over this.

83
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:31,523
Right now?

84
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:33,532
Okay.

85
00:03:34,738 --> 00:03:35,833
Hey.

86
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:39,402
The funeral service is
about to start. We have to go.

87
00:03:39,738 --> 00:03:40,833
Let's hurry.

88
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:42,673
- Goodness.
- Let's go.

89
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:44,972
Viewers, see you next week.

90
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:46,072
Ads, cue.

91
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:48,442
See you again in 60 seconds.

92
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:53,187
Can we use this on the show?

93
00:03:53,187 --> 00:03:55,912
They're talking over each other,
and they keep fighting.

94
00:03:56,358 --> 00:03:59,622
Isn't it the most interesting
to watch someone fight?

95
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:02,858
If we show that on TV,
our ratings will go up,

96
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:04,863
but they'll take all the criticism.

97
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:07,463
- I'm thankful.
- You're right.

98
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,733
- Okay, then. Good work.
- Good work.

99
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:21,472
(CHIP-IN)

100
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:26,243
Our dear father,

101
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:29,952
Yoo In Ho, Andrea, a brother
who walked his journey in you...

102
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:31,952
with our congregation...

103
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,522
has passed away in peace.

104
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:39,022
Please show mercy...

105
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:40,832
when you judge his spirit.

106
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:43,433
Let him be freed of sin,
overcome death,

107
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:45,533
reconcile with the father,

108
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:48,072
sit on the shoulders
of our good shepherd...

109
00:04:48,177 --> 00:04:50,303
to follow our everlasting king,

110
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:54,613
and enjoy endless joy
in the midst of all the saints.

111
00:04:55,217 --> 00:04:59,243
The son lives forever
with his father and spirit...

112
00:04:59,518 --> 00:05:02,452
as the lord of all,

113
00:05:02,588 --> 00:05:04,822
and he will reign
until the end of time.

114
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:06,353
Amen.

115
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:09,752
The representative of the bereaved
family will share a word.

116
00:05:19,938 --> 00:05:21,973
As I send my beloved one away,

117
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:27,872
I still cannot believe
he isn't in this world anymore.

118
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:32,743
Although he isn't with me now,

119
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,522
I'll remember that
I will always be with him.

120
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:54,372
He was...

121
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:57,603
more passionate about his work
than anyone I knew.

122
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:02,572
He was always faithful
to those who were with him.

123
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:05,913
I'm sure...

124
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:09,287
he'll be thankful and glad to see...

125
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:12,353
everyone whom he loved here.

126
00:06:12,628 --> 00:06:14,192
You're annoying.

127
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:18,962
I thank you instead on his behalf.

128
00:06:19,427 --> 00:06:20,762
Thank you.

129
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:06,043
(3 days ago)

130
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:23,553
Why aren't you asleep?

131
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:25,353
I can't sleep.

132
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:29,892
Let's check each person...

133
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,363
and see which one
had the motive to kill Uncle In Ho.

134
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:40,808
(Moon Jeong Wook)

135
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:41,876
(Yoo Hae Joon, Park Jin Sook)

136
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:43,072
What about Ms. Park?

137
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:46,242
She destroyed
raw chicken into pieces...

138
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:48,342
on the day he asked her
to turn in a written apology.

139
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:04,293
What about Mr. Moon?

140
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:06,933
Mr. Moon?

141
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:16,332
What about Hae Joon?

142
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:18,602
Doesn't he seem weirder and weirder?

143
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:20,078
He seems normal,

144
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:22,242
but he does something insane
like tapping on others.

145
00:09:22,948 --> 00:09:24,617
I remember how eerie it was...

146
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:27,617
to see his cold face
behind Uncle In Ho...

147
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,283
because he talked
in such a sweet voice.

148
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,023
It's the supposition.

149
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:52,242
Then is your mom next?

150
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:54,712
We should do this fair and square.

151
00:09:56,578 --> 00:09:57,886
It's true that she loves money,

152
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:00,183
but she's not someone
who'd be this systematic.

153
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,112
My dad loves money too,

154
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:05,783
and I could see him doing this.

155
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,322
But his specialty is scamming,
so he's never committed murder.

156
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:15,192
We can't think
of the motive for murder.

157
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:16,832
We're stuck.

158
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,606
Let's look around the house later.

159
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:21,778
Perhaps, we could find traces
of the culprit...

160
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:23,003
when they wrote the letters.

161
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,023
(Will)

162
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:43,293
(If you press them in order,
the wall will open...)

163
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:46,492
Did they get all the letters
from magazines?

164
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:15,192
The magazines in Hae Joon's room
weren't ripped or cut out.

165
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:17,462
I didn't find anything
in Mr. Moon's room either.

166
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,362
Where should we look next?

167
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:33,547
"They're family,
so they had to know."

168
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:35,246
"No, they didn't."

169
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:37,183
There are split opinions.

170
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:38,986
Even if they knew,

171
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:42,486
that's something they were aware
of in their minds,

172
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:45,783
so it's not easy to prove this.

173
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,357
Anaphylactic shock
which was mentioned...

174
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:48,827
in the autopsy result...

175
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:51,726
is an allergic reaction
that's similar to ones you get...

176
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:54,732
if you consume foods
such as peanuts or peaches.

What's unique about this...

178
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:59,663
is that it pertains to medication,
not food.

such serious shock,

- they could die...

I'm sorry, but I refuse
to do any interviews.

183
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:11,383

(July 9, Thursday)

186
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:42,572
When did the culprit
write the letters?

187
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:46,712
Do you think they wrote them
before the party or on the day of?

188
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,153
It would've taken some time
to make the keys.

189
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:50,423
You're right.

190
00:12:51,257 --> 00:12:52,722
Who in the world sent them?

191
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:55,457
It could be one of us.

192
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,423
We could be acting innocent.

193
00:12:58,698 --> 00:13:00,067
It's not me. You?

194
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:01,192
Me neither.

195
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:07,533
It could be 1 of the 5 members
who chipped in.

196
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,777
That makes sense.

197
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:12,173
That culprit was involved
in the murder alongside the others,

198
00:13:12,178 --> 00:13:14,173
but no one suspects them
of sending the letters.

199
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:16,572
That's very original.

200
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:18,247
Do you think the sender knew...

201
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:20,312
that those five would feed my dad
sleeping pills?

202
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:23,557
Perhaps. But this is what
I'm the most curious about.

203
00:13:23,558 --> 00:13:25,082
Why didn't you get one?

204
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:27,722
You're right.

205
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:29,852
Why didn't I get one?

206
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:46,043
I'll eat a bit later.

207
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:16,072
Do you think the culprit
is 1 of the 5 members?

208
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,242
I'm sure the police will find out.

209
00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:22,513
Why are you asking me that?

210
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:25,413
- Just because.
- "Just because."

211
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:29,852
Is there anything you do
for a reason?

212
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,707
Do you suspect...

213
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,472
any of your family members
of sending the letters?

214
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:53,773
So you didn't find anything unusual,
is that right?

215
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:55,442
Yes.

216
00:14:55,918 --> 00:15:00,513
I heard Mr. Yoo experienced a shock
about a month ago.

217
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:03,783
That's correct.

218
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:05,982
Could you elaborate
on that incident?

219
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:09,096
There was nothing special about it.

220
00:15:09,097 --> 00:15:11,527
I knew it was anaphylactic shock,

221
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:13,562
so the symptoms were the same.

222
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:25,342
I asked Mr. Yoo's doctor
about the shock as well,

223
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:28,442
but there was nothing unusual
in his medical records.

224
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,612

230
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:56,273
Yes.

231
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:59,503
I heard that he had a shock
a month ago.

232
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,183
It was a house call.

233
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:09,952
I didn't record it
because there was nothing abnormal.

234
00:16:10,688 --> 00:16:13,797
For more details, you should ask
his family members...

235
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:15,352
who were present that day.

236
00:16:18,597 --> 00:16:20,163
They won't tell me.

237
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:26,003
This is all I can tell you.

00:23:05,937 --> 00:23:07,933
Was my dad the only one
who had this?

356
00:23:10,578 --> 00:23:12,603
He was very thorough.

357
00:23:12,978 --> 00:23:16,242
Whenever he revised his will,
he got rid of the previous one...

358
00:23:16,377 --> 00:23:18,383
even though
it was no longer effective.

359
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,088
So of course, there's only one copy.

360
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:22,413
Did anyone ask you about his will?

361
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:25,657
No, no one.

362
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:30,153
Did my dad ever tell you
about someone reading his will?

363
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:37,907
When did he write this?

364
00:23:37,907 --> 00:23:39,238
The first version was written
after he found out...

365
00:23:39,238 --> 00:23:40,863
that he was dying.

366
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:42,732
Then he revised it
about six months ago.

367
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:45,573
He started from scratch.

368
00:23:46,907 --> 00:23:48,913
Then he revised it several times
afterward as well.

369
00:23:57,088 --> 00:23:59,883
To be honest, there's one thing
that's bothering me.

370
00:24:02,097 --> 00:24:03,792
Recently,

371
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:06,792
Ms. Ji mentioned registering
their marriage.

372
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:08,768
"Registering their marriage"?

373
00:24:08,768 --> 00:24:10,833
Mr. Yoo was flustered.

374
00:24:11,538 --> 00:24:13,962
It's not normal for a couple
to get married...

375
00:24:14,377 --> 00:24:16,333
when one of them is dying.

376
00:24:32,088 --> 00:24:33,183
Excuse me.

377
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,123
Could I speak with you...

378
00:24:36,728 --> 00:24:38,823
in private?

379
00:24:43,238 --> 00:24:44,403
To be frank,

380
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:47,302
the shock he experienced
a month ago...

381
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:49,277
was also caused by sleeping pills.

382
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:50,373
What?

383
00:24:50,578 --> 00:24:54,447
He had anaphylactic shock...

384
00:24:54,447 --> 00:24:58,212
which was also his cause of death.

385
00:24:58,617 --> 00:25:02,782
He even told me that
Ms. Ji had fed him sleeping pills.

386
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:05,952
Then why...

387
00:25:06,758 --> 00:25:08,353
Ms. Ji asked me...

388
00:25:08,828 --> 00:25:12,492
not to write that part
in his medical records.

389
00:25:13,298 --> 00:25:15,363
I didn't think it was a big deal...

390
00:25:15,437 --> 00:25:18,732
because Mr. Yoo never took
sleeping pills to begin with.

391
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:22,532
I had no idea this would happen.

392
00:25:22,707 --> 00:25:24,407
What was the cause
of his allergic reaction?

393
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:27,813
The results show that
it was due to sleeping pills.

394
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:29,647
But Mr. Yoo had refused them...

395
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:32,813
when I had prescribed some
in the past.

396
00:25:32,818 --> 00:25:34,242
It's strange.

397
00:25:35,318 --> 00:25:37,657
That was the cause
of his allergic reaction?

398
00:25:37,657 --> 00:25:41,022
He showed severe allergic reaction
to them.

399
00:25:41,197 --> 00:25:44,867
He could be in shock
after taking just one pill.

400
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,792
You must be careful.

401
00:25:48,498 --> 00:25:49,867
I'm truly sorry.

402
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:53,702
It was so severe that even one pill
could be fatal.

403
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:55,377
I should've told him sooner.

404
00:25:55,377 --> 00:25:57,403
I'm truly sorry.

405
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:34,573
I have something to say.

406
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:42,712
What was that?

407
00:26:59,238 --> 00:27:01,232
I bet you wanted to kill him.

408
00:27:02,377 --> 00:27:05,373
He had an affair and even
had a child out of wedlock.

409
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:09,772
As time passed, you probably became
more furious than forgiving.

410
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:13,643
But seeing how you wanted
to register your marriage...

411
00:27:13,718 --> 00:27:16,252
and become a truly married couple,

412
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,383
I think there's something
I don't know.

413
00:27:18,927 --> 00:27:22,123
Or perhaps, you were willing
to do that much...

414
00:27:23,197 --> 00:27:24,323
because...

415
00:27:25,397 --> 00:27:26,623
you loved him.

416
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:28,437
Don't beat around the bush.

417
00:27:28,437 --> 00:27:30,393
You knew he was allergic
to sleeping pills...

418
00:27:30,597 --> 00:27:32,462
when he had a shock
a month ago, right?

419
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:39,008
You fed him the pills...

420
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:41,712
and asked his doctor
to keep it a secret.

421
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:45,712
Will you still feign ignorance?

422
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,052
Why did you feed him those pills?

423
00:27:49,088 --> 00:27:50,782
Is that what you're curious about?

424
00:27:52,488 --> 00:27:54,083
You sent the letters,

425
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:55,952
didn't you?

426
00:27:57,127 --> 00:27:58,768
Don't you think
it's a bit reckless...

427
00:27:58,768 --> 00:28:00,722
for you and your mom to do this
without any solid proof?

428
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:08,738
Fine. He was struggling to sleep,

429
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:10,838
so I gave him some sleeping pills.

430
00:28:10,838 --> 00:28:12,403
That was a month ago.

431
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:16,542
But you think I'm the one
who sent them because of that?

432
00:28:16,748 --> 00:28:19,318
If you want to accuse me,
bring me proof.

433
00:28:19,318 --> 00:28:21,452
If you can't find one,
at least make it.

434
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:23,883
What is it?

435
00:28:24,187 --> 00:28:25,722
Do you not have the guts?

436
00:28:28,397 --> 00:28:29,722
I won't do that.

437
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:32,692
In the movies,
they lose the culprit...

438
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:35,433
by doing so.

439
00:28:39,738 --> 00:28:43,433
Those who didn't receive much love
growing up tend to act strong.

440
00:28:43,578 --> 00:28:46,042
I can sense that in you.

441
00:28:46,177 --> 00:28:48,472
They have a hole in their bodies.

442
00:28:49,818 --> 00:28:51,383
I don't like them.

443
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,143
They expect you to fill it up.

444
00:28:56,058 --> 00:28:59,482
But then again, your mom was busy
going out with men.

445
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:03,292
And your dad never looked for you.

446
00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:05,923
I pity you.

447
00:29:18,578 --> 00:29:19,742
Is that what you think?

448
00:29:20,578 --> 00:29:22,712
I think I grew up pretty well.

449
00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:27,813
I knew there was someone
who wanted the opposite,

450
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,157
so I did my best to grow up well.

451
00:29:30,157 --> 00:29:31,752
I wanted to disappoint that person.

452
00:29:35,298 --> 00:29:37,757
You claim to have grown up well
in your own words.

453
00:29:37,758 --> 00:29:39,563
How can I not laugh?

454
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:43,937
You, who don't know
anything about the real world,

455
00:29:43,937 --> 00:29:45,633
thinking only your mom is right?

456
00:29:48,107 --> 00:29:50,772
You're still the same
back then and even now.

457
00:30:09,697 --> 00:30:10,823
Let me off.

458
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,502
Help me!

459
00:31:00,078 --> 00:31:01,442
Help!

460
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:49,566
Ms. Park.

461
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:51,905
You haven't made any food
or done the laundry.

462
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,080
Are you really
going to be like this?

463
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,580
I wonder who told me to quit.

464
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,451
Then get out of this house
so we won't have to see you.

465
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:00,675
I'll leave
once I get my severance pay.

466
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,215
Severance pay, my foot.

467
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:05,330
If you aren't going to move out,
at least get some groceries.

468
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,696
What is this?
There's nothing to eat here.

469
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,065
Shouldn't you at least work
as much as that bread?

470
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,040
This bread? You can
take it off from my severance pay.

471
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,411
It's not like I want to stay.

472
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:18,635
My gosh.

473
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,635
It's not like
your severance pay is worth a lot.

474
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:23,976
In that case,

475
00:32:24,381 --> 00:32:26,315
you can pay me.

476
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,556
Ms. Park, do you know
the type of person I hate the most?

477
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,355
Someone who asks me for money.

478
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,691
I'm a type who steals money,

479
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:40,631
not someone who gives.

480
00:32:40,631 --> 00:32:42,560
Good for you, man.

481
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,595
A man with five fraud convictions.

482
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:48,996
You said one has to be smart
to con someone else.

483
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:51,306
I can be pretty smart, you know.

484
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:59,375
I should stop talking with you.
I should stop doing that.

485
00:33:35,351 --> 00:33:37,315
Bit Na. Hey.

486
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,315
What happened just now?

487
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:43,085
She did something, didn't she?

488
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,585
Right?

489
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:45,990
It's nothing.

490
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,155
If it's nothing, why did you
stop the car with your body?

491
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:50,726
What if you got hurt again?

492
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:55,796
Aren't you going to tell me?

493
00:33:56,371 --> 00:33:57,810
I won't tell anyone.

494
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,306
You can tell me.

495
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:03,181
The late master artist
Yoo In Ho was...

496
00:34:03,181 --> 00:34:05,980
caught up in a controversy
when many paintings...

497
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,651
in similar styles were found.

498
00:34:07,651 --> 00:34:10,490
At that time, Yoo claimed
the paintings were forged,

499
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:14,186
and that he will cooperate
with the police investigation.

500
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,830
But today,
just a day after Yoo's funeral,

501
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,925
a new controversy was found.

502
00:34:19,031 --> 00:34:22,261
They conducted an X-ray test
to sort out the forged painting,

503
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:26,140
but the result showed a possibility
the sketch was done by one person.

504
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,770
- What's going on?
- For this test, X-ray, and...

505
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,270
Is she saying he did the sketch
for those fake paintings or what?

506
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,436
That's what she said, right?

507
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:35,206
That can't be right.

508
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,405
They just had a similar style.

509
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:39,675
That was good.

510
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,916
That's it.

511
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,385
It's because they had
a similar style?

512
00:34:46,421 --> 00:34:47,516
What?

513
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,255
That's odd.

514
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:54,496
The sketch you brought.
Where did you find that artist?

515
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,631
If those passed the X-ray test,
it means it's like the real ones!

516
00:34:57,631 --> 00:34:58,830
This is amazing.

517
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,770
I want to sit that person down
and make them draw all the time.

518
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,436
How much do you get from that?

519
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,376
Did you make sure
the deal went well...

520
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,135
with the paintings I gave you?

521
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,175
Yes, of course.

522
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,345
Don't ever bring that up
so thoughtlessly again. Okay?

523
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:19,485
And refrain from talking to me.

524
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:22,916
Fine.

525
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,230
Why don't we gather
all of his paintings...

526
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,325
and sell them at a memorial exhibit?

527
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,566
Gosh, we'd make a fortune.

528
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,095
You already made enough
after the last deal.

529
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,965
Don't be so greedy.

530
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:39,106
- Greedy for what?
- My gosh!

531
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:41,980
Why are you eavesdropping on us?

532
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,111
I wasn't eavesdropping!

533
00:35:44,111 --> 00:35:46,720
I just stopped by
while I was passing.

534
00:35:46,721 --> 00:35:48,016
Anyway,

535
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,816
what were you two up to?

536
00:35:50,991 --> 00:35:52,551
Why are you so surprised?

537
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,356
We aren't up to anything.

538
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,361
You just said it.

539
00:35:56,361 --> 00:35:58,086
"Don't be so greedy."

540
00:35:58,091 --> 00:36:01,361
I heard what you said
loud and clear.

541
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:04,901
Ms. Park, you need to learn
to mind your own business.

542
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:08,235
And you said you'll quit.
Why are you taking the laundry down?

543
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,505
It's mine.

544
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:13,536
I'm not working for anyone.

545
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,695
Yes.

546
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,126
Really?

547
00:36:42,071 --> 00:36:43,365
I'll talk to you later.

548
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,575
I think it came with my laundry.

549
00:36:50,651 --> 00:36:52,410
Thank you.

550
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,580
You don't have to thank me.
You know...

551
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,675
Hey, wait.

552
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:57,786
It wasn't just us.

553
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,056
The one who sent that letter
started everything.

554
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,290
I just wanted to see his will.

555
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,059
Like what they said,

556
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,861
if someone out there
wrote this letter,

557
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:09,901
that person would be the mastermind.

558
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:11,896
And if they can prove it,

559
00:37:12,071 --> 00:37:14,695
they may be freed of their charges.

560
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:28,416
There's no need
for us to go around in a group.

561
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,690
We're all on our own now.

562
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:32,086
What do you mean?

563
00:37:32,091 --> 00:37:34,520
If one of us confesses and say
that they sent the letter,

564
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,991
then everyone's focus
will be put on that person.

565
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:39,261
Then the other four can be
freed from people's interest,

566
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:41,655
and avoid any legal punishment.

567
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,755
He's right.

568
00:37:43,031 --> 00:37:44,531
The attorney said...

569
00:37:44,531 --> 00:37:47,965
we may not face
any legal punishment.

570
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,040
Then are you saying
we should turn one of us...

571
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,080
into the one
who sent us that letter?

572
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,111
Precisely.

573
00:37:54,111 --> 00:37:56,806
And let's promise to chip in
and give some of his inheritance.

574
00:37:58,281 --> 00:38:00,120
Not only does the plan sound absurd,

575
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,120
but who would volunteer
to play that part?

576
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,991
You just have to go
and play innocent.

577
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:08,120
If you say you didn't know
he was allergic to sleeping pills,

578
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,155
what can the police do?

579
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:13,255
Wow, Ms. Park, you know
a thing or two about the law.

580
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,425
You can say that to the police.

581
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,370
Are you out of your mind?

582
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,836
Are you telling me to take the fall
for you guys? Goodness.

583
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:30,575
Why are you looking at me?

584
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,215
I will never do it!

585
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,890
Ms. Park. Look,
we don't want to do this either.

586
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,991
Ji Hye and I are parents.

587
00:38:38,991 --> 00:38:40,520
And Hae Joon has
his whole life ahead of him.

588
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,985
Don't you think it'd be the best
if the eldest one takes the fall?

589
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,191
I won't do it.

590
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:47,631
What if I really get locked up?

591
00:38:47,631 --> 00:38:48,755
Jin Sook.

592
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:52,870
If you insist that you didn't know
he was allergic to sleeping pills,

593
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,410
you can get released. That's what
you said. Your words, not mine.

594
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,536
Right?

595
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,306
Sit down.

596
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,680
We will all chip in...

597
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,881
and give your portion
of the inheritance.

598
00:39:06,881 --> 00:39:08,151
That's right.

599
00:39:08,151 --> 00:39:09,180
If you put up with it
for a few days,

600
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,651
you'll get five million dollars.

601
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:13,615
Think about it.
It's five million dollars.

602
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,295
My goodness.

603
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,905
Can we really do this?

604
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:31,505
Give her five million dollars?

605
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:34,175
Gosh, I don't want
to share that much.

606
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:41,445
Hey.

607
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,715
What are you up to these days?
I barely get to see you now.

608
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:45,916
I'm not doing anything.

609
00:39:49,591 --> 00:39:53,126
Actually, you're right.
Are you up to something?

610
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,726
You were all huddled up together.
I think you're plotting something.

611
00:39:57,801 --> 00:40:00,741
We didn't do such a thing.
You're suspecting me again.

612
00:40:00,741 --> 00:40:03,606
I'm so humiliated, being called
the Sleeping Pill Quintet.

613
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,436
It's not like we're Eagle Five.

614
00:40:06,211 --> 00:40:08,235
Thinking about them
gives me the shudders.

615
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:11,810
Mom, I won't just stand by you
if you cause...

616
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,146
trouble again.

617
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,750
I know what I did was wrong,

618
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,845
but that's no way
to talk to your mother.

619
00:40:18,191 --> 00:40:21,191
I had you when I was your age
and went through so much.

620
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:23,991
Gosh, that again. Don't you
get sick of telling me that?

621
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:26,226
I'll keep telling you that
until you finally acknowledge me.

622
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,566
I was able to search all the rooms
except for Aunt Sul Young's.

623
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,766
She never leaves her room.

624
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,275
"Fire!" Should I shout that out?

625
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:42,505
Will she come out then?

626
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,230
(How to draw a map to the safe)

627
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:03,571
Click on the paper-shaped icon.

628
00:41:03,571 --> 00:41:04,996
Paper-shaped icon.

629
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,301
Where's the paper-shaped icon?

630
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:10,235
It all looks like paper.
My gosh, this is...

631
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:13,036
Launch Paint first.

632
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,706
I know that too.

633
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,410
I used to go to a computer class
10 years ago.

634
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,405
If you just let me be,
I can figure it out.

635
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,845
All right.
The screen for the Paint...

636
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:27,491
It's... Gosh.
The computer mouse isn't working.

637
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:30,025
I can't drag it. You know?

638
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:41,896
She didn't close her laptop.

639
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,215
- Cut!
- What?

640
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,491
Jin Sook, you can't scowl
at the detective like that.

641
00:42:00,491 --> 00:42:01,790
Are you shooting a laser beam?

642
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,631
You can't provoke the detective.

643
00:42:03,631 --> 00:42:07,200
But earlier, you said that
I shouldn't look so intimidated.

644
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,301
Earlier, I could tell
that you were acting.

645
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:10,430
It was your awful acting.

646
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,330
Gosh. Then,
what do you want me to do?

647
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,741
Must we go through this?
Must I really pretend I did it?

648
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:15,836
Inheritance!

649
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,810
Don't you remember
how much that was?

650
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,370
So you're okay not getting
a cent of that inheritance?

651
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,075
She has a point, Ms. Park.

652
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,646
If you pretend to have sent
the letters, you'll make a fortune.

653
00:42:24,781 --> 00:42:28,250
Don't think about anything else.
Just focus on the money you'll get.

654
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,376
How much was that?

655
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,146
- 5 million dollars.
- 5 million dollars.

656
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,761
Great. You're the one
who sent the letters.

657
00:42:37,761 --> 00:42:39,761
- You must make yourself believe it.
- Right.

658
00:42:39,761 --> 00:42:42,729
Then, you'll naturally feel guilty.

659
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:45,401
And you're regretting it a lot.

660
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:48,266
All right. Get into your role.
Action.

661
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:50,711
- Ms. Park.
- Yes.

662
00:42:50,711 --> 00:42:52,540
When did you send the letters?

663
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,376
Around 5 a.m.

664
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,151
- You're good.
- That was excellent.

665
00:42:58,151 --> 00:42:59,551
- I did well, right?
- That was much better.

666
00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:01,350
- You're good.
- Jin Sook, you have a talent.

667
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:05,186
Actually, I always dreamed
of becoming an actress. My gosh.

668
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,551
- Next question.
- Let's do the next question.

669
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:08,120
- Here's the next question.
- Okay.

670
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,591
- Make yourself believe it. Start.
- All right.

671
00:43:09,591 --> 00:43:10,686
Let's try again.

672
00:43:11,191 --> 00:43:13,155
She locked every folder.

673
00:43:13,261 --> 00:43:14,795
That's why
she didn't bother to close it.

674
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,700
(Trash)

675
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,795
(Map of the safe)

676
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:21,066
What?

677
00:43:21,401 --> 00:43:23,639
(Map of the safe)

678
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,166
(Map of the safe)

679
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,345
No way.

680
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:42,615
(How to open a secret safe)

681
00:43:42,961 --> 00:43:44,186
They are identical.

682
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,496
My gosh.

683
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:08,675
Hello, babies.

684
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:13,151
We're moving.
Let's move out of here.

685
00:45:13,151 --> 00:45:16,281
Yes. Stealing
other people's stuff is bad.

686
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:18,520
But think about it. Without
some comfort from you guys,

687
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,721
I wouldn't have
been able to put up...

688
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:24,485
with all the scolding
and his harsh words.

689
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,726
There's a reason for everything.

690
00:45:27,901 --> 00:45:29,655
Right? Don't you agree?

691
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:31,830
He cared about me too.

692
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,896
I'll take you guys
since he cared about me.

693
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:40,106
Jin Sook, eat the chocolate bar
if your blood sugar is getting low.

694
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,235
And there's a sausage,
your favorite.

695
00:45:44,881 --> 00:45:47,746
Insist that you didn't know
he was allergic to sleeping pills.

696
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:49,416
I'm sure you'll get out soon.

697
00:45:49,421 --> 00:45:50,516
Okay.

698
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:54,821
Don't get so scared. It's not
your first time going there.

699
00:45:54,821 --> 00:45:57,086
The police station grows on you
when you keep going back.

700
00:45:57,961 --> 00:46:00,255
Won't this make things
worse than it is?

701
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,961
You always kill the mood at the end.

702
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:04,870
If you're going to pout,
go back to your room.

703
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:07,465
Anyway, once I get back,

704
00:46:07,971 --> 00:46:10,836
don't forget what you promised me.

705
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,405
All right. March out
with a serious face. Action.

706
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,881
- There you go.
- Nice. Go.

707
00:46:19,881 --> 00:46:23,345
Jin Sook, make yourself believe it.
Gosh, you're so cool.

708
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:31,655
(Map of the safe)

709
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,766
(How to open a secret safe)

710
00:46:52,151 --> 00:46:53,976
(We always need someone
who's on the borderline.)

711
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,781
"When it comes to theater,"

712
00:46:56,781 --> 00:46:58,885
"we always need someone
who's on the borderline."

713
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:01,655
"If you've never been on one before,
you wouldn't know..."

714
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,925
"the risky and nervous feeling..."

715
00:47:04,361 --> 00:47:07,996
"or the temptation and comfort
on the other side."

716
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:13,766
Those who didn't receive much love
growing up tend to act strong.

717
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:16,295
I can sense that in you.

718
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:18,005
I don't like them.

719
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,675
They expect you to fill it up.

720
00:47:20,711 --> 00:47:22,376
Ms. Ji asked me...

721
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:25,910
not to write that part
in his medical records.

722
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,746
Mr. Yoo was flustered.

723
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:30,175
It's not normal for a couple
to get married...

724
00:47:30,691 --> 00:47:32,586
when one of them is dying.

725
00:47:33,991 --> 00:47:35,586
(We always need someone
who's on the borderline.)

726
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:45,465
So you're the one who sent
the letters to the family?

727
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,941
When did you send the letters?

728
00:47:48,941 --> 00:47:50,336
At 5 a.m.

729
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:53,806
Do you even know
how to draw the map to the safe?

730
00:47:53,881 --> 00:47:56,111
Do you think I'm stupid?

731
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:58,905
Do you think old people
don't know how to work the computer?

732
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:01,275
Gosh.

733
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,646
Hello?

734
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,056
Detective Hong?

735
00:48:07,191 --> 00:48:08,485
I found the evidence.

736
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,825
The person who sent the letters...

737
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,126
is Ji Sul Young.

738
00:48:18,531 --> 00:48:19,996
It took quite a long time.

739
00:48:23,441 --> 00:48:25,166
Well, I don't know
when it started, though.

740
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,635
What do you mean?

741
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:29,135
I can tell how hard
you must have been thinking...

742
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:31,045
about this.

743
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,476
"What's the most painful way
to die?"

744
00:48:34,551 --> 00:48:35,916
That's what you thought about.

745
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:41,516
And your conclusion was
letting my dad die...

746
00:48:41,721 --> 00:48:44,825
in the hands of his close friends
and family.

747
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,396
How fascinating.

748
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,200
So you have the evidence, right?

749
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,396
You bet.

750
00:48:51,401 --> 00:48:52,496
You love...

751
00:48:53,301 --> 00:48:54,865
evidence.

752
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,365
Well, which one
should I show you first?

753
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:03,011
Should I show you the map
of the safe I found on your laptop?

754
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:05,075
The same map that was in the letter?

755
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,620
Or should I start
with Ms. Jin's statement...

756
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,091
that you wanted to marry him
when he was dying?

757
00:49:11,091 --> 00:49:12,416
Or...

758
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:16,155
how about his doctor's statement
that you fed him a sleeping pill...

759
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:19,586
and asked his doctor
to keep it off the record?

760
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,126
Which one do you prefer?

761
00:49:24,531 --> 00:49:27,071
The file on my laptop
has nothing to do with me.

762
00:49:27,071 --> 00:49:28,766
If not you, whose file is it?

763
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,706
Why can't you answer me?

764
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,606
Do you think you won this game...

765
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:38,606
with just that?

766
00:49:39,381 --> 00:49:41,345
Is that why you're accusing me?

767
00:49:41,821 --> 00:49:43,646
I'm sure you want to catch me.

768
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,385
I bet you want to make me...

769
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,715
the culprit
whatever it takes for you.

770
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:51,086
Suit yourself.

771
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,456
I have nothing to be scared about.

772
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:55,925
What's your deal?

773
00:49:57,671 --> 00:49:59,195
How could you be so brazen?

774
00:50:01,341 --> 00:50:02,766
Don't get all worked up.

775
00:50:04,071 --> 00:50:07,080
When you were young,
you never got worked up this easily.

776
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,810
This is why a living environment
is crucial for kids.

777
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,545
Don't deflect my questions.

778
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:15,146
You're changing the topic
because you're cornered.

779
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,215
Why? Why am I cornered?

780
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:20,916
Then,

781
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,761
did you think
I would be tremble in fear...

782
00:50:24,761 --> 00:50:26,856
because of your useless evidence?

783
00:50:30,401 --> 00:50:32,496
Perhaps, that's when it all started.

784
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,735
How you ended up
with a nasty temper.

785
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,166
Kids who remember
being abandoned by their parents...

786
00:50:39,341 --> 00:50:41,036
tend to go astray.

787
00:50:41,611 --> 00:50:44,206
You do remember that
your mother abandoned you, right?

788
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:46,275
Was that...

789
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,350
when you were about eight years old?

790
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,246
You were abandoned
in front of this house.

791
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:53,715
You must have remembered it
every time you came here.

792
00:50:54,261 --> 00:50:55,385
I'm curious...

793
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:58,525
as to what crossed your mind...

794
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:00,626
when you passed by this house.

795
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,255
What came to your mind?

796
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,766
Bit Na. Here's your doll.

797
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:09,936
This is the house.

798
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,735
Go inside.

799
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:15,976
Mom, how many days
will you be away for?

800
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,135
A fortnight.

801
00:51:17,881 --> 00:51:19,175
I'll be back in a fortnight.

802
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,246
Mom.

803
00:51:25,091 --> 00:51:27,016
You have to promise me.

804
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,856
Promise.

805
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:31,556
You have to come back
after a fortnight.

806
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,726
Okay.

807
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:35,356
I promise.

808
00:51:42,241 --> 00:51:44,571
The woman, so-called your mother,
abandoned you.

809
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:48,111
The man, so-called your father,
wasn't happy to see you.

810
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:49,206
Oh, right.

811
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:51,505
Don't call me a liar for this.

812
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,405
This is a fact.

813
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,345
Back then,

814
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:58,421
I observed everything
right by his side.

815
00:51:58,421 --> 00:51:59,586
Stop it.

816
00:51:59,921 --> 00:52:01,655
I must have hurt you.

817
00:52:05,761 --> 00:52:07,896
The more you provoke me,

818
00:52:08,961 --> 00:52:11,195
the more pain
you'll inflict upon yourself.

819
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:12,766
Okay?

820
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,365
So don't get fresh with me.

821
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,566
And stop this prank too.

822
00:52:20,071 --> 00:52:22,206
Don't fool yourself.
You were a nobody to him.

823
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,646
You were just
his pathetic live-in girlfriend.

824
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,921
You begged for his love
for over 20 years,

825
00:52:27,921 --> 00:52:30,345
but to him, you were
never good enough to marry.

826
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,945
On papers, you have no ties to him.
You were just someone he lived with.

827
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,726
Mark my word.

828
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,255
This isn't the end.

829
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:46,965
Good luck.

830
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,166
I'll keep watching.

The person who sent the letters...

835
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:49,175
was Dad?

836
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:51,505
No way.

840
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,870
What kind of man was my dad?

841
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,100
- The person who sent the letters...
- It was that old geezer.

842
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,941
If he was going crazy,
he should've left us out of it.

843
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:51,211
Then, was this Uncle's game?

844
00:57:51,211 --> 00:57:54,306
Then, was his death
a part of the game too?

845
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,381
- What is this?
- I'll sue.

846
00:57:56,381 --> 00:57:57,910
- You've been informed.
- In Ho!

847
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:00,405
- Hey.
- Calm down. What's wrong with you?

848
00:58:03,051 --> 00:58:05,445
No. That can't be true.

849
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,956
