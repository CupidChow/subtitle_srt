00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,590
(CHIP-IN)

2
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,380
(Episode 2)

3
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,240
Dad!

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,640
What's this sound?

5
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,370
What's going... What is this?

6
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,450
(24 hours ago)

7
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,000
That was a good sleep.

8
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,470
What's that?

9
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,220
"Kim Ji Hye"?

10
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,380
(Will)

11
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,610
(If I, Yoo In Ho, die,
please carry out...)

12
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,080
(the things I've requested.)

13
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,450
There's a condition?

14
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,090
What? They covered it up.

15
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,920
(Condition)

16
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,160
"A Secret Safe"?

17
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,200
(If you press them in order,
the wall will open,)

18
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,370
(and the secret safe
will reveal itself.)

19
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,380
So this is the key to that safe?

20
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,020
I'm not the type
who cherishes my family anyway.

21
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,250
So you should all quit thinking
that you'd get my fortune.

22
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,220
They want me to open it myself
if I'm that curious.

23
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,100
So you found that letter
in front of the door...

24
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,640
when you woke up?

25
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,810
How many times
do I need to repeat myself?

26
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,150
It was right in front of my door.

27
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,150
This will be aired nationwide.

28
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,150
Please be more sincere.

29
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,790
Fine.

30
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,830
One of them must've sent it to me.

31
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,030
Who? Why?

32
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,530
What did they want to achieve? What?

33
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,770
Have some.

34
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,650
It seems like something
that wily fox would do.

35
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:09,090
Darn it. That scumbag even went
to prison for committing fraud.

36
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,160
The most important part
of the letter was covered.

37
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,860
It sounds like something he'd do.

38
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,300
- Sun, this is the tastiest.
- I'll have it myself.

39
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,430
You're good with chopsticks.
Good. Eat up.

40
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,570
She may be young,
but she isn't naive.

41
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,070
- She could outsmart most adults.
- Eat up.

42
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,550
The culprits are usually the ones
who look the most kindhearted,

43
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,150
but then they stab you in the back.

44
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,950
I'm suspicious of him as well.

45
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,190
I have absolutely no idea
what's going through his mind.

46
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,530
Look at that.

47
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,240
I forgot about her.

48
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,170
She's always here.

49
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,010
It'd be the easiest for her
to take the will out of the safe.

50
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,220
Who in the world was it?

51
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,730
The chopsticks are really heavy,
so I'm stretching.

52
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,560
Are you counting?

53
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,730
What do you mean?

54
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,900
Are you taking a census?

55
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,600
You've been counting heads
all this time.

56
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,300
Is he the one who sent it?

57
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,110
Did anything in particular happen
this morning?

58
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,710
Yes.

59
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,920
Thanks to my constipation,
I had it rough this morning.

60
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,220
Darn it. He's so disgusting.

61
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,760
Could he be acting like that
on purpose?

62
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,660
- I'm suspicious of him.
- Gosh, my stomach.

63
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,830
Do you have something to say to me?

64
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,140
That fox would never confess
even if she sent it.

65
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,140
Even if I did,

66
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,280
we're not close enough
to make small talk.

67
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,550
I knew it. I suspect her the most.

68
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,690
What was that?

69
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,250
Is there something on my face?

70
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,820
What? Yes.

71
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,520
Your beautiful face.

72
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,760
Beautiful face, my foot.

73
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,630
He's a boring kid
who goes to law school.

74
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,160
He could've done it.

75
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,800
Who was it?

76
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,380
- Gosh.
- What are you doing?

77
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,710
Nothing.

78
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,980
You've been acting weird
since this morning.

79
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,620
I can notice that much.

80
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,220
Hey, don't waste your time
observing me.

81
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,050
Spend that time thinking...

82
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,950
about how you can earn
extra points from your dad.

83
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,800
So you never found out who sent it?

84
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,640
No. I'm not a shaman.
How could I have found them?

85
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,370
Ms. Kim, please be sincere.

86
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,840
I am being sincere.

87
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,550
What do you want?
Should I sincerely kneel?

88
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,980
By the way,

89
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,950
in movies,

90
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,860
mansions like this one
always had a safe.

91
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,990
Does In Ho have one as well?

92
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,730
Even if he did,
do you think he would've told me?

93
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,200
Right.

94
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,500
Never mind.

95
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,860
Is there something valuable
in his room?

96
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,190
Why isn't he coming out?

97
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,410
Bit Na!

98
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,910
Bit Na!

99
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,950
Come here.

100
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,820
What is it?

101
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,250
Hurry.

102
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,730
Hurry.

103
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,260
What is it?

104
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,130
You should go out for a walk
with your dad.

105
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,770
Why all of a sudden?

106
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,540
It's his birthday.

107
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,240
Consider it your gift to him and go.

108
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,270
Bit Na, please.

109
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,440
He's resting since he's feeling ill.
Don't be ridiculous.

110
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,510
You brat.

111
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,480
Mom.

112
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,920
You better not cause any trouble.

113
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,890
What's gotten into you today?

114
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,560
I've warned you.

115
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,420
I might cut off our relationship.

116
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,530
She's uselessly sharp-eyed.

117
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,440
You got a divorce 20 years ago.

118
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,270
But you are continuing
your relationship as lovers.

119
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,310
Did you think about, perhaps,
reuniting with one another?

120
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,210
The form doesn't matter.

121
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,920
I married her 25 years ago.

122
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,520
Ever since then,
I have always considered her...

123
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,120
as my first and last life companion.

124
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,530
What a load of nonsense.

125
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,100
The woman over there thinks
she's the lady of the house.

126
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,330
I think I've lived my life
to the fullest.

127
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't know how he feels...

128
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,540
Why are they looking
at me like that?

129
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,810
I've been inspired by him
many times.

130
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,140
He loves art.

131
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,310
He always thinks about art.
Art takes up all of his time.

132
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,700
This one must be it.

133
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,770
What was the order again?

134
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,370
First one...

135
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,530
"Made in China"?

136
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,600
Ms. Park, please come
to the back garden this instant.

137
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,100
I have something urgent to tell you.

138
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,800
How dare this witch...

139
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,840
order me around?

140
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,180
How dare she?

141
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,080
Gosh, I almost had a heart attack.

142
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,020
Goodness.

143
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,490
Gosh.

144
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,600
What are you doing here?

145
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,270
I was looking for In Ho,
but he's not here.

146
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,610
He's in the living room.

147
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,910
Oh, I see.

148
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,740
Why did I not see him?

149
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,430
How can I get my hands on the will
without his knowing?

150
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,120
It looks like you aren't taking
any sleeping pills today.

151
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,280
I'm trying to cut back.

152
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,220
The doctor told me to do so too.

153
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,520
Right.

154
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,390
Ji Sul Young.

155
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,760
She takes sleeping pills.

156
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,230
Yes. A single pill will do.

157
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,390
These are probably
just for decoration.

158
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,430
I bet she didn't read all of them.

159
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,460
This...

160
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,000
This is a limited edition.

161
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,640
Gosh, In Ho.

162
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,310
You're such a miser to me,

163
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,210
but you spend your money on her.

164
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,180
Where is it?

165
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,780
"Zoled".

166
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,010
These must be the sleeping pills.

167
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,050
Oh, no. Darn it.

168
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,560
There's no place to hide.
What should I do?

169
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,160
Darn it.

170
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,540
Darn it!

171
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,490
My goodness.

172
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,130
Oh, dear.

173
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,800
Why is this house so big?

174
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,630
My gosh.

175
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,640
Over there.

176
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,390
I guess you want to say something
about my comment earlier.

177
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,250
If you are going to do it,
make it quick. I'm in a hurry.

178
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,190
From now on, I want you
to be careful with your words.

179
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,260
She's so annoying.

180
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,240
Stop.

181
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,170
You said it was urgent...

182
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,170
and told me to see you
at the back garden.

183
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,480
The dishes are too salty
for me as well.

184
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,640
Please pay more attention
to them today.

185
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,380
That's why I texted you.

186
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,780
What did you say?

187
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,550
Mr. Yoo has stomach cancer.
Be more considerate.

188
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,860
Darn it!

189
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,400
Gosh, my foot.

190
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,170
Darn it.

191
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,450
Zoled.

192
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,950
Yes.

193
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,250
So you stole
Ms. Ji's sleeping pills...

194
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,820
so that you could feed them
to Mr. Yoo?

195
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,960
Ms. Kim?

196
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,340
Are you grinding Korean peppers?

197
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,310
Gosh, you startled me.

198
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,450
I didn't hear you coming.

199
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,950
Why are you so surprised?

200
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,180
Did you do something wrong?

201
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,520
Don't be absurd.
I'm so busy right now.

202
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,030
Come on. Go over there.

203
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,770
Don't bother me.

204
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,300
I just wanted to see
if it tasted salty or not.

205
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,670
I should help out.

206
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,620
Come and eat!

207
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,590
Come eat!

208
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,190
Hurry up.

209
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,030
Where's Bit Na?

210
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,470
Hurry up.

211
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,540
Oh, my.

212
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,210
Look at the photo.

213
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,980
Do you remember
when the photo was taken?

214
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,760
Mr. Yoo, you must be thirsty.

215
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,580
My goodness!

216
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,080
- Darn you!
- What is this?

217
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,190
- Honey.
- In Ho!

218
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,820
In Ho! In Ho!

219
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,980
Wait, I'll take it to him.

220
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,580
You said you're tired.

221
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,090
I have to speak to Bit Na's dad too.

222
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,130
It's so obvious.

223
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,030
She's going to talk about money,
as always!

224
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,060
In Ho.

225
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,100
Ji Hye is here.

226
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,970
You should take your medicine.

227
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,670
Here.

228
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,040
- Open your mouth.
- I'll do it myself.

229
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,380
It's okay. Open your mouth.

230
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,880
I said I'll do it myself.

231
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,250
Open up.

232
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,150
Opened.

233
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,620
Goodness, you're so good.

234
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,190
You took that so well.
And some water.

235
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,320
No.

236
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,500
Goodness.

237
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,730
My gosh, you spilled some water.

238
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,870
Goodness.

239
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,940
Gosh, In Ho. You're so cute.
You spilled water.

240
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,320
Yes, you need to see this
and be heartbroken...

241
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,620
to understand how I feel.

242
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,360
Will you please leave?

243
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,300
In Ho, Ji Hye will be leaving now.

244
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,370
Stop pretending like
you're his lawful wife.

245
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,540
Both you and I never made it
on his family register.

246
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,890
So when you took
Mr. Yoo's medicine to him,

247
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,020
you threw in an extra sleeping pill
that was in your pocket?

248
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,290
That's how you gave him
that sleeping pill, right?

249
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,300
Ms. Kim Ji Hye?

250
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,400
Yes.

251
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,310
Did you volunteer to
take the medicine to him...

252
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,240
instead of his maid
because you planned on doing that?

253
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,340
Yes.

254
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,380
That sleeping pill
worked like a charm.

255
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,650
He's sound asleep.

256
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,960
Let's see. What?

257
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,670
No way.

258
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,470
Let's see.

259
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,570
(1: Attorney Jin Yeon Hee will
execute this will.)

260
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,410
(2: The heirs will be excluded
if they break the below condition.)

261
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,450
(Condition: Do not read the will
before the attorney's execution.)

262
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,280
(The portion excluded
from breaking this condition...)

263
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,250
(will be divided evenly
among other heirs.)

264
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,790
Darn it!

265
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,910
Darn it. What a cheap condition.

266
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,030
So the condition
of taking the inheritance was...

267
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,270
that I won't receive anything
if I take a peek at his will...

268
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,040
before it's executed?

269
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,100
Darn it!

270
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,540
That means
my inheritance is all gone.

271
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,780
Everything was a trap.

272
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,380
Someone who didn't want me to take
his inheritance is behind this.

273
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,640
Dad!

274
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,110
What's this sound?

275
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,250
- What?
- What's going...

276
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,220
What is this?

277
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,730
No.

278
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,970
Was it the sleeping pill I gave him?

279
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,070
It can't be...

280
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,400
No way.

281
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,870
It was just a sleeping pill.

282
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,110
No.

283
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,050
Honey...

284
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,190
What if what I gave him yesterday...

285
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,220
wasn't a sleeping pill?

286
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,320
Honey.

287
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,960
Honey!

288
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,030
What if everything was
designed by that woman?

289
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,970
What if she switched out
her sleeping pills with poison...

290
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,070
knowing that I will
steal one of the pills?

291
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,580
No, honey...

292
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,740
A needle mark.

293
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,870
Why didn't you...

294
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,750
tell the police everything
at that time?

295
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,460
I had no idea what was going on.

296
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,520
How could I tell them?

297
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,120
If I had told them,

298
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,650
I knew they would
frame me as the culprit.

299
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,160
Who was the first person
to find his dead body?

300
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,870
Me.

301
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,750
Did you hear any strange sounds
from his room last night?

302
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,670
He's sensitive to sounds,

303
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,990
so he can't sleep
with the smallest noise.

304
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,060
That's why his room is soundproof.

305
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,950
What? No.

306
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,350
I heard someone
walking down the hall last night.

307
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,150
But you didn't?

308
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,030
Well, I...

309
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,360
I took a sleeping pill
and went to sleep.

310
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,240
I think I heard something too.

311
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,940
It sounded like
someone walking around.

312
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,280
Wasn't it you?

313
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,280
What are you talking about?
Why would I walk around at night?

314
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,110
Wasn't it you?
You used to sleepwalk as a kid.

315
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,120
I got better ages ago.

316
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,380
Don't try to point
the finger at her.

317
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,650
You felt guilty,
so you're blaming her for that.

318
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,520
Why would I feel guilty?

319
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,650
One second.

320
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,180
So all of you
heard something last night?

321
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,590
I also heard...

322
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,900
someone's footsteps.

323
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,190
Me too.

324
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,530
I think it came from Bit Na's room.

325
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,010
Once we fall asleep,

326
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,540
we both sleep like a log
and wouldn't even know...

327
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,900
if someone abducted us.

328
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,910
She's nothing like me
in other ways,

329
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,810
but that's the one thing
she took after me.

330
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,720
Are you going to do an autopsy?

331
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,880
Is there a reason why we should?

332
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,120
His lips were blue.

333
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,060
That means he was poisoned.

334
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,860
He may not have passed away
because of his condition.

335
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,970
Wait, then are you saying
he was murdered?

336
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,870
An autopsy? You should
give that another thought.

337
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,880
That's like killing someone twice!

338
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,940
His only immediate family
in this house is me.

339
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,220
So I'll make a request
as his bereaved family.

340
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,590
Please do an autopsy on him.

341
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,680
We plan on doing that too.

342
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,360
I'm suspicious of poisoning,

343
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,620
and there are circumstances
that show...

344
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,450
he was murdered.

345
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,070
Do you have
any security cameras in the house?

346
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,690
No, it's installed outside.

347
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,700
May we check the footage now?

348
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,610
- Are you writing this down?
- Yes, sir.

349
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,030
What on earth is going on?

350
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,230
He said he'll disclose
his will today.

351
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,470
What's going to happen?

352
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,570
That's not the problem right now.

353
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,040
I'm just curious.
It's out of curiosity.

354
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,010
His will won't be disclosed today.

355
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,080
Oh, the attorney called me,

356
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,410
and I told her to come
after the case gets wrapped up.

357
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,350
Why did you do that?
Just tell her to come.

358
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,820
Man, we can only find out about
the will after the attorney comes.

359
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,090
Man.

360
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:10,800
We checked the security footage,
and last night, no one else...

361
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,700
came into this house.

362
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,120
What?

363
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,740
That means one of us is the culprit.

364
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:21,280
Wait, how can this be?

365
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,760
There's nothing in his studio
on the first floor.

366
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,160
It might be hidden
behind the paintings or something.

367
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,360
Check everywhere.

368
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,450
Yes, sir.

369
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,600
You aren't allowed to be here.
Please leave.

370
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,260
Okay.

371
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,970
(National Forensic Service)

372
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,550
There's a high possibility that
he was injected with poison.

373
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,030
Let's search around the house...

374
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,600
and see if we can find
any weapons or clues.

375
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,700
Yes, sir.

376
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,970
You're his only direct family?

377
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,850
Back when he was alive,

378
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,220
I thought I was the only one
who was like his family.

379
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,780
But after he passes away,
you're his only family.

380
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,510
I apologize if I offended you.

381
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,990
You think you've done your share
as his daughter...

382
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,190
by only showing up
a few times in a year,

383
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,200
but I checked in on him
whenever I could,

384
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,890
yet you can confidently claim
that you're his family...

385
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,390
because of that family register.

386
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,740
It was a pressing situation,

387
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,660
so I had to put it that way.

388
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,640
I'm grateful that
you looked after him...

389
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,910
and took care of him
more than anybody else.

390
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,150
You want to say that...

391
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,250
I only looked after him
because I'm after his inheritance.

392
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,420
It's not like that.

393
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,150
You think everyone here is...

394
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,510
hyenas who came around
smelling his inheritance.

395
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,910
If you think everyone is like that,

396
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,760
doesn't that make you the most
interested in Uncle's inheritance?

397
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,730
You couldn't be his daughter
while he was alive,

398
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,990
so if you want to play the part
now that he's gone, go ahead.

399
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,700
You must've been really shocked.

400
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,680
It must be so tough.

401
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,820
It's not just me.

402
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,780
It's tough for everyone.

403
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,260
All right.
We took a look around the house.

404
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,760
I need to question
each family member now.

405
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,990
So you finished eating dinner
at around 10 p.m.?

406
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,430
- Yes.
- Do you remember anything else?

407
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,140
I fell asleep right away.

408
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,470
What was Mr. Yoo like?

409
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,720
My husband?

410
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,390
It's difficult to define him
in a word.

411
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,260
He was an uncanny man.

412
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,370
It has been a while...

413
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,570
since Mr. Yoo and I talked.

414
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,910
Well, it seemed like
he wanted to avoid me.

415
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,030
Are we done?

416
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,950
Yes.

417
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,590
She seems suspicious.
She was acting weird too.

418
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,950
She could be shocked
from Mr. Yoo's sudden death.

419
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,890
That could be the case.

420
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,240
When can we see the autopsy result?

421
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,100
It'll take about two weeks.

422
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,760
What about the investigation result
for his room?

423
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,570
- Not yet.
- Then when will it come out?

424
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,870
Ms. Yoo Bit Na?

425
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,850
May we ask you some questions now?

426
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,970
Yes.

427
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,220
Please tell us about Mr. Yoo In Ho.

428
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,660
I don't know much about him.

429
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,600
Aren't you his daughter?

430
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,180
We didn't have
a good father-daughter relationship.

431
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,990
My family isn't
really interested in me.

432
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,090
And I'm not interested
in them either.

433
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,660
He was grumpy on the outside,
but deep down,

434
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,280
he was a kind brother.

435
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,390
He was very kind
to his blood-related family.

436
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,260
He seemed bad-tempered,

437
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,570
but he was a good man.

438
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,430
He was more than my friend.

439
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,010
We were almost
like a family to each other.

440
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,350
To me,

441
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,350
he was like my father.

442
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,900
From what I have gathered,
that family has a lot of drama.

443
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,890
It's much more entertaining
than a regular novel.

444
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,070
Really? It did seem that way.

445
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,320
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

446
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,070
I drew lines
for his love interest...

447
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,200
and dotted lines
for blood relatives.

448
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,180
Ji Sul Young, his ex-wife. Age, 51.

449
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,010
She's a successful theater director.

450
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,550
25 years ago, she married Yoo In Ho.
But they got a divorce 20 years ago.

451
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:23,220
They got divorced because of her.
Do you see the line here?

452
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,220
He had an affair with Kim Ji Hye.

453
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,450
Kim Ji Hye. Age, 42.

454
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,260
At one point,
she was a successful model,

455
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,830
but she gave birth to Yoo Bit Na
from her affair with Yoo In Ho.

456
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,050
And he got a divorce
with his ex-wife, Ji Sul Young.

457
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,630
But why was his ex-wife
from 20 years ago at his house?

458
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,320
That's the highlight of their story.

459
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,440
Instead of marrying Kim Ji Hye
who gave birth to his daughter,

460
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,540
he made her into a single mother.

461
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,740
And Yoo Bit Na became a love child.

462
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,780
What a scumbag.

463
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,380
And Yoo In Ho reunited
with his ex-wife 17 years ago.

464
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,550
Since then, they had been lovers.

465
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,750
A year ago, Ji Sul Young
moved into Yoo In Ho's house...

466
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,740
and started to live with him.

467
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,160
She went back to her ex-husband
who cheated on her...

468
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,320
and had a child outside
their marriage? Unbelievable.

469
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,390
They belong in Hollywood.

470
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,620
And Dokko Chul is
his blood relative. Age, 48.

471
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,230
Yoo In Ho's mother had him
from her second marriage.

472
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,890
He's Yoo In Ho's stepbrother
from a different father.

473
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,100
But Dokko Chul's father,
Yoo In Ho's stepfather,

474
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,800
physically abused Yoo In Ho
when he was young.

475
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:23,680
That may be why Yoo In Ho
and Dokko Chul were on bad terms.

476
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,970
And Dokko Chul's daughter,
Dokko Sun. Age, 20.

477
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,320
Her father has five priors.

478
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,220
Because he was often locked up
in prison and was never home,

479
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,090
she grew up in Yoo In Ho's house
ever since she was young.

480
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,350
He despised his stepbrother,
but he still took in his niece.

481
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,180
And we have Moon Jeong Wook.
Age, 58.

482
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,700
He had been friends
with Yoo In Ho since college.

483
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,770
Back then, he used to draw,
but he quit when he was in a slump.

484
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,340
Starting 15 years ago,
he's been working as Yoo's agent.

485
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,390
He's been living off Yoo's house.

486
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,410
And lastly, we have Yoo Hae Joon.
Age, 25.

487
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,510
He's the son
of Yoo In Ho's late brother.

488
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,780
He visited Yoo In Ho
to celebrate Yoo's birthday.

489
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,410
He's a law student.

490
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:03,320
And Yoo In Ho was supporting him
with all of his tuition.

491
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,390
What kind of man is Yoo In Ho?

492
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,190
Well, their opinions of him
were worlds apart.

493
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:14,390
Some people said that
he was kindhearted and generous.

494
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:17,230
And some said
that he was grumpy, bad-tempered,

495
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,550
and self-centered.

496
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,320
If you have something to say...

497
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,740
Wait, no.
We don't talk to each other.

498
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,510
You know why I'm doing this.

499
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,950
I do.

500
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,680
You do?

501
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,450
If it's because I drank
the liquor you hid,

502
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,490
I understand.

503
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,050
I know.

504
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,780
I know everything.

505
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,990
You killed In Ho!

506
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:52,720
Do you have proof?

507
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,180
Proof?

508
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,820
Fine. I'll get proof.

509
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,870
I'll get to the bottom of this.

510
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,410
Mom, what is this about?

511
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,200
You know something, don't you?

512
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,390
I don't know anything.

513
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,760
If you know something,
share it with me.

514
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,200
Who knows?

515
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,510
I might be able to help you.

516
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,100
You're not making any sense.

517
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,320
Does he know something about this?

518
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,510
The letter...

519
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,890
Did he send it to me?

520
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,200
This is driving me crazy.

521
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,530
Mom, what were
you talking about earlier?

522
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,800
What do you mean she killed Dad?

523
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,200
Mom.

524
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,970
- It's speculation for now.
- What?

525
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,370
Then what is it that you know?

526
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,620
Mom.

527
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,990
Let's talk tomorrow.
I have an awful headache.

528
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,800
What on earth happened?

529
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,370
I need to know what's going on too.

530
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,990
- Hello.
- Hi.

531
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,800
How can I help you?

532
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,240
Oh, right.

533
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,550
Please check
if these are really sleeping pills.

534
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,820
Pardon?

535
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,620
Please check
if these are really sleeping pills.

536
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,950
Okay.

537
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,160
Yes, they are.

538
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:41,060
No. Don't just read what it says.

539
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,990
I want you to check
the pills inside.

540
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:50,140
My mother keeps putting
random pills in empty bottles.

541
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,870
I must check.

542
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,370
Okay. Sure.

543
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,350
Yes, they are sleeping pills.

544
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,280
They are?

545
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,370
Yes.

546
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:11,850
Do you have vitamin supplements?
Give me the most expensive ones.

547
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,390
I want some health supplements.

548
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,320
Red ginseng supplements are popular.
Bring me one of those too.

549
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,530
So I had nothing to do
with his death, right?

550
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,570
I've been driving myself crazy
like a fool.

551
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,240
Wait, that also means that...

552
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,700
she had nothing to do
with his death too.

553
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,100
I made a huge accusation yesterday.
What do I do?

554
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,680
Come on.

555
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,680
Do you have anything for headaches?
Get me something for my headache.

556
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:42,410
It hurts.

557
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:59,910
Do you want to take selfies now?

558
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,410
Don't make a fuss.

559
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,910
I hate it when you pretend
to be thoughtful and kind.

560
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,320
You're the biggest nightmare!

561
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,390
Why are you looking at me like that?

562
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,510
I don't remember anything
after I get drunk these days.

563
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:37,010
You should watch your liquor too.

564
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,470
So I'm the culprit?

565
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,700
Really?

566
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,950
You must explain to me
why you would accuse me...

567
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,410
of such a crime.

568
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:49,820
Sometimes,
people get drunk and cause a scene.

569
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,120
Why are you asking me
to explain myself?

570
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:56,160
If you feel wronged,
you can cause a scene too.

571
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,800
You'd better watch your tongue
from now on.

572
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,840
I will let this slide
just this once.

573
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,410
But I can't promise
how I will react next time.

574
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,140
Are you threatening me now?

575
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,240
No.

576
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,450
It's a warning.

577
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,490
That night, you said to Ms. Ji...

578
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:22,990
that she was the one
who killed Mr. Yoo In Ho.

579
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:26,850
Then, does it mean you just made
an accusation without any proof?

580
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,030
Well, I didn't have proof,

581
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,030
but you know, people have a hunch.

582
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,300
"A hunch"?

583
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,990
Yes.

584
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:28,370
If you were going to have a peek,
you shouldn't have gotten caught.

585
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,820
I guess there are still some people
who use keys to lock a safe.

586
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:57,840
Don't people use
fingerprints nowadays?

587
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,030
He's a painter.

588
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,970
His hands are probably wet
all the time.

589
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:02,410
I doubt he has any prints left.

590
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,100
You have a point.

591
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,070
We should open the safe, right?

592
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:08,910
Let's do that.

593
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,010
Once we open it,
we should be able to find clues.

594
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,760
My gosh.

595
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,040
Why are we all meeting up here?

596
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,370
Are we going to do a roll call
like in prison?

597
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:37,780
Let's wait.

598
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:39,700
I'm sure we're here for a reason.

599
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,950
What is this?
Why did you turn off the lights?

600
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,390
All right. I'm sorry.
But can everyone show me your hands?

601
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,780
Why?

602
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,930
- What are you doing?
- Wait.

603
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,320
Let me see.

604
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,610
I asked you a question.

605
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,740
I told you to wait.

606
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:14,180
My gosh. Come on.

607
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:24,950
Here.

608
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,260
What's this?

609
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,050
We just found out from the safe.

610
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:32,760
Mr. Yoo put special paint...

611
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,660
over an item in the safe.

612
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,340
Special paint?

613
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,200
Usually, people put this paint
on pipes to catch thieves.

614
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,640
It's my guess that Mr. Yoo put
the paint over something important.

615
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,350
It's not visible to the naked eye.

616
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,620
The paint only reacts
to UV lights like this.

617
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,780
Just like now.

618
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:56,990
Will you continue to deny
that you opened Mr. Yoo's safe?

619
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:58,390
Ms. Kim.

620
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,160
Mr. Dokko.

621
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,320
No, I didn't do anything like that.

622
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:08,970
Gosh, okay. I'll get in.

623
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,100
- Be quiet and get in the car.
- Come on.

624
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,970
- I told you I'm going.
- Get in now.

625
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,430
- Mom.
- Watch your head.

626
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,800
- Mom.
- Move back.

627
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:18,280
- Mom. What is this?
- Move back.

628
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,610
- Did you really do it?
- I told you to move back.

629
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,710
- Bit Na, I'm being set up.
- Gosh.

630
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,920
Someone used me.

631
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,180
Move back!

632
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,660
Someone plotted this! Oh, no.

633
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,180
Bit Na!

634
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,370
Someone else is the culprit.

635
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,050
The culprit framed my mom.

636
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,450
I must find any clues
the culprit left behind.

Dad made a full recovery.

647
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,060
Then, why did he die?

648
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,020
Is it possible
that someone who knew...

649
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,260
he made a full recovery killed Dad?

650
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,430
If Mr. Yoo's will isn't returned,

651

will go to Ms. Yoo Bit Na.

Isn't this why you
and your mother came back here?

655
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,940
Give up the inheritance. That's
how you can prove your innocence.

656
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,760
I won't give up the inheritance.
