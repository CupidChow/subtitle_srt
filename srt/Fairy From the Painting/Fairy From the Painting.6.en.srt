[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,070
I had a strange dream.

3
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,140
I was worried.

4
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,710
Is it still the dream

5
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,750
of the ancient woman?

6
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,509
Help!

7
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,229
Help!

8
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,910
Help me!

9
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,310
Let us out!

10
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,310
It's the girl I told you about.

11
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,030
I dreamed of her.

12
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,990
She seemed to be in danger. She was asking for help.

13
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,750
I don't know if this will happen.

14
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,670
Or why it happened.

15
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:12,860
After all,

16
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,390
I had once dreamed of a fairy.

17
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,150
Then,

18
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,550
someone who looks exactly like her appeared.

19
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,670
Freud believes

20
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,790
all dreams

21
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,750
are a form of wish-fulfilment.

22
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,270
It's an expression of your inner subconscious.

23
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,190
So this dream

24
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,190
represents my innermost thoughts and feelings.

25
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,270
Maybe you don't want to admit it,

26
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,150
but your heart is reminding you

27
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,350
that you care about her more than you think.

28
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,829
Not bad.

29
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,350
Every picture is good,

30
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:00,950
right?

31
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,390
Go back and create a copy for us.

32
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,990
I have to edit the photos and take selfies.

33
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,350
This is exploitation of labor.

34
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,910
You punk.

35
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,070
Didn't you buy your camera with my money?

36
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,830
Fine.

37
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,390
I'll go home and edit the photos well.

38
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,829
I guarantee the both of you will be satisfied.

39
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,180
Here.

40
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,870
If there's nothing else,

41
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,270
we'll go back first.

42
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,910
I still need to take him back to pack up.

43
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,710
Okay, go ahead.

44
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,870
I've already told him I'm on leave today.

45
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,430
Why did he call so many times?

46
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,550
What happened?

47
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,510
Who is it?

48
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,510
Who else could make a company's slave sigh like that

49
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,790
but her boss?

50
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,350
Forget it. Let's talk about it later.

51
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,990
Are you done?

52
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,870
We're leaving.

53
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,670
Okay.

54
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,670
Bye.

55
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,390
Bye.

56
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,870
Take care.

57
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,550
Let's go.

58
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,870
-Bye. -Bye.

59
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,310
Is it heavy?

60
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,260
Of course not.

61
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,790
I'll beat you.

62
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,870
My little backpack.

63
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,710
What's wrong?

64
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,030
Nothing.

65
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,350
Let's go. Get in the car.

66
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,950
Let's go. What's wrong?

67
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,270
Nothing.

68
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,070
Get in.

69
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:49,940
What are you doing, Xun Yuxuan?

70
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,750
Let's go.

71
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,030
I keep feeling

72
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,550
like someone is stalking me.

73
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,590
Stalking you?

74
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,270
Come on.

75
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,150
If anyone is being stalked, it's me.

76
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:02,700
Look at you.

77
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,590
You have nothing.

78
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,710
Your face is just average.

79
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,350
What's there to follow?

80
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,470
Just average?

81
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,110
Yaoyuan, let me tell you.

82
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,430
Spare the rod, spoil the child.

83
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,230
Go home!

84
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,110
Be gentle.

85
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,550
I'll beat you to death when we get home.

86
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,630
And you still dare to ask for food?

87
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,870
Mr. Gu, what do you need?

88
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,950
Get the car ready. We'll leave right away.

89
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:46,909
Yes, Mr. Gu.

90
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,070
Do you want to hand it over now

91
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,230
or fight me and then hand it over?

92
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,590
Did Gu Yancheng ask you to take this?

93
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,350
Hello?

94
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,110
Hello, Gu Yancheng, where are you?

95
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,990
In the car.

96
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,790
I'm asking for your location.

97
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:11,910
The company.

98
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,510
Okay.

99
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,430
Wait right there.

100
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,070
Mr. Gu, where should I drive you to?

101
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,870
Change of plan. I'm not leaving.

102
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,190
You can get off work now.

103
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,630
Don't you owe me an explanation?

104
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,270
Explain what?

105
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,350
The photos.

106
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,630
What photos?

107
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,270
Why did you send someone to spy on me?

108
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,710
I didn't.

109
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,420
Then why is my photo

110
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,740
in your phone?

111
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,910
Then who is this man?

112
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,900
This is my personal privacy.

113
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,270
Why should I tell you?

114
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,910
This is also my privacy.

115
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,710
No comment.

116
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,350
Do you know

117
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,190
taking photos without permission

118
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,670
is a serious invasion of another's privacy?

119
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,390
Do you know that if you're absent from work without reason,

120
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,870
I can fire you according to the contract?

121
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,150
I applied for leave!

122
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,270
I didn't receive it!

123
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,260
Okay.

124
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,830
Then you'd better fire me,

125
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,230
or I'll call the police.

126
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,590
If a man

127
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,870
wants to understand a woman,

128
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,990
then he must like her a lot.

129
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,270
Maybe you don't want to admit it,

130
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,990
but your heart is reminding you

131
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,380
that you care about her more than you think.

132
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,190
I'm really going to call the police.

133
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,100
Calm down.

134
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,710
Give me your phone.

135
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,190
Give it to me.

136
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,670
Give it to me.

137
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,830
No.

138
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,110
No way.

139
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,030
What a woman...

140
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,550
We're even now.

141
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,830
We don't owe each other anything.

142
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,830
Let's get off work.

143
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,030
Take me home.

144
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,150
Let's go.

145
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,540
Hello, honey.

146
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,190
You're looking for me at such a late hour.

147
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,870
Is there anything you want to ask me?

148
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,230
You're indeed my little sorceress.

149
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,670
I really need your analysis for something.

150
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,830
Go ahead.

151
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,910
Let me, the All-knowing Eye, answer your questions.

152
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,950
Well.

153
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,390
I have a friend,

154
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,510
she...

155
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,990
Your "friend".

156
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,470
Please continue.

157
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,470
Yes, my friend.

158
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,910
Her boss treats her like any other employee.

159
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,310
But recently he actually had someone follow her and take photos.

160
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,390
And at the end, they even kissed.

161
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,070
But her boss

162
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,110
didn't say anything.

163
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,310
What do you think this means?

164
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,710
Who kissed who first?

165
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,990
This is about my friend.

166
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,790
How would I know?

167
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,310
All I know is they kissed.

168
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,310
Then this is not sexual harassment.

169
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,510
It's...

170
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,910
It's what?

171
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,110
It's that he likes you.

172
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,310
He likes me?

173
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,950
I mean, my friend?

174
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,350
Let me guess.

175
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,500
In those stalking photos,

176
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,510
was your friend

177
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,950
with another man?

178
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,510
Right?

179
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,710
Yes, how did you know?

180
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,510
Isn't that obvious?

181
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,110
A jealous man can't think straight.

182
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,110
I see.

183
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,310
Bye.

184
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,830
He likes you.

185
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,910
A jealous man can't think straight.

186
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,950
He likes me?

187
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,230
I doubt it.

188
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,710
Why would I like

189
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,190
that annoying narcissist?

190
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,470
Calm down.

191
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,630
I need to calm down.

192
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,380
Wenwu.

193
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,590
Wenwu.

194
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,910
Boss,

195
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,070
we are definitely not compatible.

196
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,710
How about I move back home?

197
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,750
For my safety,

198
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,910
I have to stay away from you.

199
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:55,750
No.

200
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,110
Why?

201
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,790
You have a man at home. It's inconvenient.

202
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,550
Aren't you a man?

203
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,870
I'm your boss.

204
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,710
It's different.

205
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,070
Forget it.

206
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,430
I think I should take a few days off and stay in the hospital.

207
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,030
That's even worse.

208
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,230
No one will take care of you.

209
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,470
Well,

210
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,230
at my current state,

211
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,950
even if I moved back into your house,

212
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,350
I can't continue to work.

213
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,460
I can't let you take care of me.

214
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,710
I will take full responsibility

215
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,870
for today's accident.

216
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,430
Boss, let me ask you something.

217
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:28,990
What?

218
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,470
Don't tell me you like me?

219
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,270
Wait.

220
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,150
I'll ask the doctor if there are any precautions to take.

221
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,910
He doesn't admit or refuse.

222
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,950
What does it mean?

223
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,950
Will it hurt to give me an answer?

224
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,060
Do you need my help?

225
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,190
No, boss. Thanks.

226
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,500
Don't move.

227
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,230
Is your neck okay?

228
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,630
Yes, I'm fine.

229
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,750
Come down after you're done.

230
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,790
The food is ready.

231
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,230
Seriously.

232
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,700
What does Gu Yancheng want?

233
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,830
This is crazy.

234
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,750
I've really gone crazy.

235
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,830
Boss.

236
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,590
Did you make all these?

237
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,390
I told you,

238
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,870
I'll be responsible for you.

239
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,270
Thanks, boss.

240
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,510
Here.

241
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,820
Boss, you're a man of your word.

242
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,590
But can I ask you for a favor?

243
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,990
What?

244
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,830
Can you not be so nice to me?

245
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,310
You're suddenly so nice to me,

246
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,190
and taking such great care of me.

247
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,750
I'm not used to it.

248
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,310
I feel bad.

249
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,270
If you feel bad,

250
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,710
then just work hard for me.

251
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,830
Okay.

252
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,750
Don't feel guilty.

253
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,910
Try my cooking first.

254
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,580
This is

255
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,310
stewed spare ribs I made for you.

256
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,190
That is stewed oxtail with tomatoes.

257
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,350
Why are they all bones?

258
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,310
They're good for your bones.

259
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,110
What do you want to eat? I'll get it for you.

260
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,550
No, it's fine, boss.

261
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,590
Why don't I remove my neck brace?

262
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,980
You shouldn't.

263
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,620
The doctor said

264
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,500
you can't get hurt again.

265
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,710
Otherwise, it'll get worse.

266
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,510
Do you want to be paralyzed?

267
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,870
It's not that serious.

268
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,630
Unless

269
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,350
you want me to be responsible for you for the rest of your life.

270
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,190
No need for that.

271
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,589
No, thank you.

272
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,829
Here, have some ribs.

273
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,510
Have a tomato.

274
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,099
Okay, boss.

275
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,270
Don't just give me food.

276
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,230
Have some yourself, too.

277
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,109
Otherwise, I'll be too embarrassed to eat.

278
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:25,790
Alright.

279
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,069
That's enough.

280
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,870
Boss, you waste a lot of water washing your dishes like this.

281
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,470
The most important thing is to wash them clean.

282
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,830
Didn't you learn that

283
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,980
wasting water resources is wasting your life?

284
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,470
Alright, hurry and go to work. I'll wash them.

285
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,110
Don't move.

286
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,590
You must listen to me for these few days.

287
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,230
If you really want to work,

288
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,670
roll up my sleeves for me.

289
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,390
Okay.

290
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,550
-You... -Me...

291
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,590
-You go first. -You go first.

292
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,790
Boss,

293
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,910
you look handsome when you smile.

294
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,910
You should smile more.

295
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,430
Smile will make you more charming.

296
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,750
You're using the wrong word.

297
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,910
First of all, I'm not handsome.

298
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,470
I am very handsome.

299
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,030
Secondly,

300
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,710
whether I smile or not,

301
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,310
I am very charming.

302
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,510
Yes. Mr. Boss.

303
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,910
You're the most handsome

304
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,710
and charming man alive.

305
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,390
By the way,

306
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,940
what did you want to tell me just now?

307
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,630
I just wanted to say that

308
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,350
you will be late for work if you don't go now.

309
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,870
That's it?

310
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,470
What do you want to say to me?

311
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,150
Nothing.

312
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,020
I should go to work.

313
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,190
Mr. Gu.

314
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,310
Miss Yuxuan. Good morning.

315
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,300
Didn't we agree

316
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,670
not to be so polite to each other.

317
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,150
We are friends.

318
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,390
Look what happened to my neck.

319
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,870
And I need you to take over for me.

320
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,350
You just rest at home.

321
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,470
Don't go anywhere.

322
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,030
Okay?

323
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,870
Yes!

324
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,510
With this collar,

325
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,580
I can't go anywhere.

326
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,470
I'll just stay at home.

327
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,670
Let's go.

328
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,670
What?

329
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,270
Did you see it?

330
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,590
See what?

331
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,710
The latest gossip about me.

332
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,190
No.

333
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,780
Have you seen the first trending topic?

334
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,510
Have you read it?

335
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,790
Yes.

336
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,500
How do you feel?

337
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,580
What do you mean?

338
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:37,830
Didn't I tell you?

339
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,150
I have no feelings for you.

340
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,630
Who said anything about your feelings?

341
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,670
I'm asking you,

342
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,310
what do you think of this little boy?

343
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,790
I'm going to give him a chance.

344
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,390
I know I am not going to get a answer from you. Bye!

345
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,060
I will have me gossiped every day. You'll see!

346
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,550
Miss. Muyu.

347
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,070
All the other stars regard gossip as a PR crisis.

348
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,790
Why are you so happy?

349
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,510
Special situations

350
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,310
require special means.

351
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,990
Who is it?

352
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,230
Hello, delivery.

353
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,190
Mr. Gu's order.

354
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,710
Are you Mr. Gu's woman?

355
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,270
No!

356
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,110
Sorry, I went to the wrong door.

357
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,270
I am sort of.

358
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,550
That’s not right.

359
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,510
Mr. Gu said

360
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,550
the recipient should be his woman.

361
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,590
Then you can see me as his woman!

362
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,430
Give it to me.

363
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,820
I can't do that!

364
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,270
Yes means yes. No means no.

365
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,460
I'd better make a call to confirm.

366
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,590
Yes! Yes! Yes!

367
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,390
I’m Mr. Gu’s woman.

368
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,300
Just give it to me.

369
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,550
Enjoy your meal.

370
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,710
Thank you.

371
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,100
Hello.

372
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,150
Gu Yancheng!

373
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,510
What woman of Mr. Gu?

374
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,670
How dare you take advantage of me!

375
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,870
I'm doing this for your safety, okay?

376
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,950
And I thought you took advantage of me.

377
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,390
I'm not angry. How come you are angry?

378
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,950
By the way, I have something to do tonight.

379
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:31,950
You can have dinner by yourself.

380
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,310
I'll be back as soon as possible.

381
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,550
Come in.

382
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,190
Mr. Gu, this is my resignation letter.

383
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:07,750
Boss.

384
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,070
Boss!

385
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,870
Boss!

386
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,070
I feel better now.

387
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,100
I can work.

388
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,390
How about I take it off and show you?

389
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:15,860
No.

390
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,580
But I haven't been out for a week.

391
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,430
I want to go out for some fresh air.

392
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,430
Fresh air?

393
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,230
You can get some fresh air in the yard.

394
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,190
Boss,

395
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,550
please.

396
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,550
I love work.

397
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,270
Please let me work, okay?

398
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,390
No.

399
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,030
Why?

400
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,630
Just stay at home.

401
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,870
Don't go anywhere.

402
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,110
Do you hear me?

403
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,310
Yes.

404
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,340
Hearing is one thing.

405
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,910
Whether I can do it or not is another.

406
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,190
Huixin.

407
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,390
Do you know?

408
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,910
Gu Yanchen has been acting like a psycho these days.

409
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,790
He wouldn't let me go out.

410
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,980
And he would check on me from time to time.

411
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,910
He even asked the delivery man

412
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,910
to confirm my identity.

413
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,390
It's really scary.

414
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,310
Are you two going this far?

415
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,230
Are you really my best friend?

416
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,150
How can you say that when I'm already like this?

417
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,190
Of course, I am your sister from another mister.

418
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,230
So,

419
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,110
what exactly did this vicious Gu Yancheng

420
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,190
do to you?

421
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,390
Tell me.

422
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,350
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

423
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,710
No matter what,

424
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,260
I think he's my nemesis.

425
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,830
My patience for him is almost at my limit.

426
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,590
Then you and your friend

427
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,550
really live in different worlds.

428
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,790
Which friend?

429
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,430
The friend you said

430
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,020
was kissed by her boss.

431
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,070
Look, she was kissed.

432
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,740
Yet you're being abused.

433
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,910
There are no different worlds.

434
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,830
Let me tell you the truth.

435
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,590
The one who was kissed and the one who was abused

436
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,670
were all me.

437
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,110
You're finally telling me the truth.

438
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,590
I'm thinking about how long you can hide it from me.

439
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,670
After that,

440
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,870
what happened between you two?

441
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,740
What happened after makes me even angrier.

442
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,670
Can you believe it?

443
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,390
Later I asked him

444
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,110
if he really likes me.

445
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,950
But him!

446
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,140
He didn't say anything at all.

447
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,950
What does he mean?

448
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,590
Isn't he just acting like a rascal?

449
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,910
Stop laughing.

450
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,070
Xun Yuxuan.

451
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,430
Do you know how the dinosaurs died out?

452
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,230
A comet hit the earth.

453
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:25,060
It was because your reflex is too slow.

454
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,260
Do you still need to think?

455
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,750
Of course he likes you.

456
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,070
Really?

457
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,430
Think about it.

458
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,950
Since you met him,

459
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,620
he made you his driver,

460
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,750
and his assistant.

461
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,350
And finally, he let you live in his house.

462
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,580
What do these mean?

463
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,030
These mean he already likes you so much that he can't help it.

464
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,270
But...

465
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,430
are these special?

466
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,190
These are obviously

467
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,430
pure business matters between us.

468
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,550
You don't understand.

469
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,110
Gu Yancheng could actually do these

470
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,590
for you.

471
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,510
He really takes great pains.

472
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,670
I have changed my view on him.

473
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,990
Huixin.

474
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,270
I think

475
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,870
you don’t know Gu Yancheng well.

476
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,190
But I know men well enough.

477
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,910
If you don't believe me,

478
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,110
just see if he always tries to

479
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,140
stop you from being alone with other men.

480
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,110
Also,

481
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,150
you can provoke him in front of other men.

482
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,510
If he's competitive,

483
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,910
he definitely likes you.

484
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:39,910
Mr. Gu,

485
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,470
Mr. Wang's company hasn't advanced

486
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,700
the Yiyu Garden Project.

487
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,630
We called to ask about it.

488
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,430
They said that

489
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,910
Mr. Wang has communicated with you about the project,

490
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,350
and is waiting for your reply.

491
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,990
Is that right?

492
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,950
Yes.

493
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,190
Boss, you may need to make a decision as soon as possible.

494
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:03,060
Otherwise, the Wei Group has been eyeing us.

495
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,350
The longer we hesitate,

496
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,070
the more unfavorable it is to our company.

497
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:19,950
Go on.

498
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,790
Okay, let's take a look at

499
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,790
the case studies of landscape design,

500
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,510
site characteristics, and challenges.

501
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,870
The entire garden is about 32 kilometers

502
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,230
which is surrounded by high-intensity development cities.

503
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,740
With Shiliang River on its west...

504
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,550
Sorry,

505
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,310
the number you dialed is busy now.

506
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,870
Please try again later.

507
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,550
Sorry.

508
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,830
The subscriber you called is busy now.

509
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,230
Please redial later.

510
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,070
Sorry,

511
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,470
the subscriber you dialed...

512
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,070
Xun Yuxuan!

513
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,030
Boss, what brings you here?

514
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,910
I should be asking you.

515
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,390
You didn't answer your phone

516
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,820
and fooled me with your lame English.

517
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,470
You sent someone to follow me again!

518
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,510
I was trying to protect you.

519
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,830
Bro, this is a society ruled by laws.

520
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,990
It's not as dangerous as you think.

521
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,300
Do you think you are in a movie?

522
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,550
You are being ridiculous.

523
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:30,990
You're injured.

524
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,350
You can't act on your own.

525
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,110
Also,

526
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,910
why did you take off your neck brace?

527
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,750
What if you get hurt again?

528
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,310
If you want something to eat,

529
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,230
you can tell Steward Du.

530
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,470
If you want to go out,

531
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,670
you can tell me.

532
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:42,630
I don't care what you...

533
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,110
Master! Master!

534
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,750
Please stop nagging.

535
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,830
I'm sorry.

536
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,910
I'm going home now.

537
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,630
I'll put it on as soon as I get home, okay?

538
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,630
-Please, please! -No!

539
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:53,750
Is it that serious?

540
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,990
Do you have any treatment plan?

541
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,900
You must choose the best plan.

542
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,830
I'll pay, no matter how expensive.

543
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,030
Sir,

544
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,270
I mean,

545
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,590
you're making a fuss.

546
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,630
She's recovering well.

547
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,070
She's fine.

548
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,430
See? I told you I'm fine.

549
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,270
It's all your fault.

550
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,070
Miss,

551
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,990
you have to understand your boyfriend.

552
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,550
He's just too concerned.

553
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,030
Doctor, he's not my boyfriend.

554
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,350
Doctor, you're right.

555
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,150
It is me, her boyfriend,

556
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,430
who is being too concerned.

557
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,630
We'll be more careful next time.

558
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,710
-What are you talking about? -We'll leave now.

559
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:27,990
Go.

560
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:36,950
Gu Yancheng.

561
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,110
Say it!

562
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,190
Why do you always take advantage of me?

563
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,190
I'm doing this for your own good,

564
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,270
so that the doctor won't misunderstand you as frivolous.

565
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,710
This is a hospital.

566
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,510
They won't ask you to show your personality.

567
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,460
A man and a woman came to a hospital together.

568
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,100
And they are not together.

569
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,300
This is frivolous.

570
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,710
No.

571
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,430
He's so good at it.

572
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,670
I can't get distracted.

573
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,310
It was you who insisted on bringing me to the hospital.

574
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,070
I think you're the one who wants to flirt with girls.

575
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,030
You sound like you're in your energy.

576
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,030
Quite resonant.

577
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,390
Then I'll grant your wish.

578
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,270
You can get back to work now.

579
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,310
Now?

580
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,790
Mood swings.

581
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,230
Truly scheming.

582
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,110
What are you mumbling?

583
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,350
I said I love work.

584
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,510
Work makes me happy.
