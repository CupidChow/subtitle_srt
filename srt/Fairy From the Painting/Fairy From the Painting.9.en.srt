1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,940
I heard on the phone

3
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,229
that you didn't sign the contract yesterday, right?

4
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,710
Then what are you waiting for?

5
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,979
Pack up.

6
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,229
We're going to apologize now.

7
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,750
We must get this project.

8
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,509
Go.

9
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,229
Go pack up.

10
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,750
Mr. Gu, I'm sorry.

11
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,980
Our chairman said

12
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,590
since Mr. Gu has something more important

13
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,590
than Yiyu Garden,

14
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,940
you're not sincere enough

15
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,510
in our cooperation.

16
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,790
It's because we were really...

17
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,510
Mr. Wang, I know what you mean.

18
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,470
We're leaving.

19
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,670
Mr. Gu.

20
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,350
Are you really not going to fight for it?

21
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,350
There are things we can't deal with.

22
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,510
And it seems the chairman

23
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,750
attaches great importance to integrity.

24
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,550
I broke the contract first.

25
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:48,710
I can't blame others.

26
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:50,950
Let's go.

27
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,950
There will always be next time.

28
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,430
Goodbye.

29
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,390
Boss,

30
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,230
I won't go to the company with you today.

31
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,310
Come back early.

32
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,870
Bye.

33
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,270
Boss.

34
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,270
She has gone so far.

35
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,790
As a boss,

36
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,910
you're still standing here,

37
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,950
giggling like a fool.

38
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,110
If you keep staring like this,

39
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,110
I guess our employees will all know

40
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,990
there will be a Mrs. Gu soon.

41
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,670
What can I do for you?

42
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,310
Hello.

43
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,350
I'm the CEO's assistant of Gu Group.

44
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,750
I just came here with Mr. Gu.

45
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,950
I want to see Mr. Wang.

46
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,550
I need to call him first.

47
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,750
Thank you.

48
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,590
Okay. Got it.

49
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,380
Okay.

50
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,470
Sorry.

51
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,790
Mr. Wang can't see anyone now.

52
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,500
Can you call him again?

53
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,510
I really have something important to tell him.

54
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,830
I can tell him myself.

55
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,030
Sorry.

56
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,550
It's really inconvenient for Mr. Wang to meet guests.

57
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,750
Please find another time.

58
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,740
Please.

59
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,870
Please call him again.

60
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,420
Yes, I understand.

61
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,230
Please come in.

62
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,630
Thank you.

63
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,550
Thank you.

64
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,150
Mr. Wang, please.

65
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,110
Mr. Gu didn't mean to break the contract.

66
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,870
He had to leave

67
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,150
because something happened to his family.

68
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,470
So I beg you.

69
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,990
Please let me see your chairman.

70
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,390
The chairman never takes back his words.

71
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,230
I didn't expect that he would break his principles

72
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,870
for Gu Group this time.

73
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,909
You mean

74
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,670
the chairman agreed to cooperate?

75
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,790
I'm not sure.

76
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,990
You should ask him yourself.

77
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,910
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Wang. Thank you.

78
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:07,710
Please.

79
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,710
Please.

80
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,470
Just say what you want to say.

81
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,750
The chairman is listening.

82
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,700
Chairman,

83
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,510
thank you for giving me this chance.

84
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,790
I'm here to tell you

85
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,110
that Mr. Gu attaches great importance to Yiyu Garden.

86
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,630
He broke the contract

87
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,430
because someone didn't want him to sign it.

88
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,630
They kidnapped his sister on the way.

89
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,390
Don't worry.

90
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,710
Everything I said is true.

91
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,070
Because I was kidnapped too.

92
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,630
I called Mr. Gu in the car.

93
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,909
Although I lost my phone,

94
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,990
you can send someone

95
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,350
to check my call history

96
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,350
and see when Mr. Gu left.

97
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,750
Everything will be clear.

98
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,790
Chairman,

99
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,470
Mr. Gu

100
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,260
cares about you and Yiyu Garden very much.

101
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:16,950
He broke the contract because

102
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,790
he was afraid we would get harmed.

103
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,910
Is it wrong for him

104
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,150
to take on such a responsibility?

105
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,030
In other words,

106
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,300
Chairman,

107
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,870
are you really willing to sign the contract

108
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,350
with a person who doesn't care about

109
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,750
the life of his sister and his employee,

110
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,790
and focuses only on profits?

111
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,070
Do you really trust someone like that?

112
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,180
So please,

113
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,670
Chairman,

114
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,750
please give Gu Group another chance.

115
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,790
Miss Xun,

116
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,909
you can't stand it if you stay in this bowing position.

117
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,950
Don't make yourself suffer.

118
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,670
You may go back first.

119
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,860
I'll let you know if there's any news.

120
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,390
Miss Xun.

121
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,470
It seems that the chairman has something to tell me.

122
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,630
Wait for me outside.

123
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,390
Please.

124
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,230
Mr. Wang.

125
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,429
Miss Xun.

126
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,549
It's done.

127
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,710
Really?

128
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,669
The chairman said

129
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,350
you could tell Mr. Gu

130
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,309
to sign the contract again tomorrow.

131
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,750
Okay.

132
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,020
By the way,

133
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,780
he also said

134
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,390
you have to be there tomorrow.

135
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,430
Me?

136
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,870
Yes, you.

137
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,110
You have contributed a lot to the signing.

138
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,790
Go back and tell Mr. Gu

139
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,830
this good news.

140
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,950
Okay, thank you, Mr. Wang.

141
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,790
Thank you.

142
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,740
Boss, I'm back.

143
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,190
I have a gift for you.

144
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,990
What gift?

145
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,950
Here.

146
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,750
The latest one.

147
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,540
You bought it for me?

148
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,710
Not me but the company.

149
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,670
How can I contact you without your phone?

150
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,070
Thank you, boss.

151
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,750
In return,

152
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,540
I have a gift for you too.

153
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,070
What?

154
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,550
That mysterious chairman

155
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,020
agreed to sign the contract of the Yiyu Garden Project.

156
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:53,750
What?

157
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,030
Why are you so shocked?

158
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,390
As your assistant,

159
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,030
I'm not only good at driving.

160
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,870
I'm quite good at negotiating too.

161
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,910
Xun Yuxuan, thank you for being with me.

162
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,900
I told you

163
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,350
that as long as you were here,

164
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,590
I would always be by your side.

165
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,510
Thank you.

166
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,100
Mr. Gu.

167
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:40,980
Mr. Wang.

168
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,750
In the hotel,

169
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,350
judging from the relationship between you and Miss Xun,

170
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,950
I thought

171
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,540
it was only her appearance that attracted you.

172
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,310
But what Miss Xun did yesterday

173
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,990
was full of courage.

174
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,870
I finally know

175
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,140
why you like her so much.

176
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,550
As a man,

177
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,860
I have to say that you are really lucky.

178
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,670
Mr. Wang, it's not like that.

179
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,550
We were in the hotel that day because...

180
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,750
Because she is actually my fiancée.

181
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,550
Mr. Gu, please.

182
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,110
Boss,

183
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,750
didn't you go too far just now?

184
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,950
No. Otherwise,

185
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,670
how do you explain

186
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,550
what happened in the hotel that day?

187
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,710
Do you want him to misunderstand

188
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,750
that we have an affair?

189
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,230
I'm saying this to maintain your purity.

190
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,310
If you said so,

191
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,780
they would think I've lost my purity.

192
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,790
What? You are not satisfied with my explanation?

193
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,790
My purity is gone too.

194
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,270
Don't be shy.

195
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,150
You're young. I understand.

196
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:45,910
Alright.

197
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,980
The chairman is upstairs.

198
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,150
He wants to see you alone before signing the contract.

199
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,500
I won't go in for the time being.

200
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,590
Please.

201
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,380
Hello, Chairman.

202
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,550
Mr. Gu is here.

203
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:23,990
Bai Bin?

204
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,820
Why are you here?

205
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,830
Hello, Mr. Gu.

206
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,190
When we parted last time,

207
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,150
I sincerely hoped you could

208
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,310
get the Yiyu Garden Project successfully.

209
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,070
Congratulations.

210
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,550
Your wish has come true.

211
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,710
Have a seat, Mr. Gu.

212
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,910
Bai Bin.

213
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,150
No.

214
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,950
Chairman Bai.

215
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,340
Did you come to the company to experience life before?

216
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,150
Yuxuan, we are still friends.

217
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,790
Call me Bai Bin as usual.

218
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,990
Don't worry, Mr. Gu.

219
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,430
I did not plot anything,

220
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,990
nor steal company secrets.

221
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,540
And I won't do anything

222
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,750
that may harm Gu Group.

223
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,510
After all, I'm a decent businessman.

224
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,550
As a chairman of a company,

225
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,830
why did you deign to be my assistant?

226
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,750
It's just for personal matters.

227
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,630
It has nothing to do with Gu Group.

228
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,750
Bai Bin, why didn't you say you are the chairman?

229
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,670
I was so scared yesterday.

230
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,510
Is this a test you give us?

231
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,740
Sort of.

232
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,230
I just didn't expect

233
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,260
Mr. Gu

234
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,910
would send you, his assistant,

235
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,590
to fight for his last chance.

236
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,150
No, no.

237
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,030
It's not like that.

238
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,110
I came here on my own yesterday.

239
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,270
You know Mr. Gu.

240
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,990
He won't explain anything for himself.

241
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,150
Even if it's not his fault,

242
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,740
he won't say anything.

243
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,270
As his assistant,

244
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,500
and the one who knows the truth,

245
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,550
I need to explain it for him.

246
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,830
Does that mean

247
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,350
I wronged Mr. Gu?

248
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,950
I apologize.

249
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,550
Mr. Bai, you don't have to.

250
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,550
I broke the contract first. It's my fault.

251
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,350
Since we're all friends,

252
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,380
we will sign the contract

253
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,110
for sure.

254
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,950
Of course.

255
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,780
Yuxuan.

256
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,150
Wait for me.

257
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,950
I have something to discuss with Mr. Bai.

258
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:26,710
Got it.

259
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,630
What on earth do you want?

260
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,270
If you don't

261
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,670
give me a satisfactory answer today,

262
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,110
I won't sign the contract.

263
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,590
Mr. Gu, calm down.

264
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,260
I just want Yuxuan to be happy.

265
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,580
But

266
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,830
please don't refuse to sign the contract.

267
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,150
If Yuxuan knows

268
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,990
her efforts are wasted,

269
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,790
she would be very sad.

270
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,390
I think neither you nor I

271
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,590
want to see her sad.

272
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,310
What do you think, Mr. Gu?

273
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,830
Mr. Gu, glad to cooperate.

274
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,030
Glad to cooperate.

275
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,750
Boss, we've signed the contract.

276
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,340
Why do you look unhappy?

277
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,660
Do I?

278
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,430
I'm not.

279
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,500
Don't worry.

280
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,430
I believe you can do it.

281
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,590
How about a celebration tonight?

282
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,710
Let's have a seafood feast.

283
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,710
May I invite Huixin?

284
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,500
I don't think you really want a celebration.

285
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,260
What you want is me paying the bill.

286
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,430
You know me well.

287
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,830
But you said

288
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,950
you would reimburse me for my payment.

289
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,910
Why don't we do it now?

290
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,350
Okay.

291
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,630
Thank you, boss.

292
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,910
Please, boss.

293
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,310
What?

294
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,990
You said Bai Bin is the boss of the Yiyu Garden?

295
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,990
Surprised?

296
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,310
I looked the same as you.

297
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,140
Gu Yancheng

298
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,230
is the CEO of Gu Group.

299
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,750
He was born into a sculpturing family with a history of hundreds,

300
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,670
no, thousands of years.

301
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,589
And he's good at sculpting.

302
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,950
A sculpture randomly made by him

303
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,190
is worth millions.

304
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,780
The key is

305
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,829
he is really

306
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,390
handsome.

307
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,950
Bai Bin.

308
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,550
The big boss behind the Yiyu Garden.

309
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,670
I heard that in the downtown, there is a new mall

310
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,590
and a newly developed villa,

311
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,790
which are all invested by him.

312
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,500
He also enjoys high social status.

313
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,110
And he is as handsome as Gu Yancheng.

314
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,230
The key is he has revealed his identity

315
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,350
and helped you a lot.

316
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,590
It's obvious that he is trying to win your affections.

317
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,670
Don't talk nonsense.

318
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,310
Bai Bin and I are just friends.

319
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,270
We have no other relationship, understand?

320
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,870
So you mean

321
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,790
you've chosen Gu Yancheng?

322
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,830
Shut your gossipy mouth.

323
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,260
Gossiping is quite interesting.

324
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,510
Come on, let's eat as much as we can today.

325
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,790
Don't waste the buffet price of 380 yuan each.

326
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,430
You asked me to treat you to dinner.

327
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,230
Just a shabby place like here?

328
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,500
Boss, please be down-to-earth

329
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,910
and experience the real life.

330
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,150
Please have a feeling of the consumption level of ordinary people.

331
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,910
Three hundred and eighty yuan.

332
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,510
That's enough for me to buy groceries for a week.

333
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,430
Only in a place like this

334
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,670
can Huixin and I dare to eat with no concerns.

335
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,550
Am I right?

336
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,630
Alright, let's eat.

337
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,780
Thank you.

338
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:17,020
Boss, why do you only eat fish but not shrimps?

339
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,710
We took so many dishes of shrimps.

340
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,100
If you don't eat them,

341
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,470
we two can't consume them all.

342
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,710
It's too troublesome to peel the shrimp.

343
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,710
Here you are.

344
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,910
She can't hide her feelings for me anymore?

345
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,630
She doesn't even care if someone is there.

346
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,710
Boss,

347
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,990
you've been staring at the shrimp for so long.

348
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,070
I dare not put it in your plate.

349
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,070
Don't worry.

350
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,510
It is clean.

351
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,270
Enjoy it.

352
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,750
I can see it's quite clean.

353
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,580
I've never seen you so virtuous.

354
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,470
I don't like peeling shrimps, either.

355
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,910
Could you peel one for me?

356
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,590
Sure.

357
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,110
It's my boss' treat today.

358
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,830
So we must feed him well.

359
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,070
If you pay for this meal,

360
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,580
let alone this shrimp,

361
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,100
I'll peel all the shrimps for you.

362
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,180
It seems I have to

363
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,590
report on you to your dad, Mr. Xun, next week.

364
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,110
How dare you!

365
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,670
Where are you going?

366
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,300
It's going to be a three-day holiday next week.

367
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,190
Huixin and I plan to go back to my dad's for a few days

368
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,190
to spend some time with him.

369
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,220
Take me back with you.

370
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,470
What did you say?

371
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,910
He asked you to take him back.

372
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,870
You are pushing your relationship forward so rapidly

373
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,470
that you will meet each other's parents.

374
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,550
The company is on holiday.

375
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,150
I want to go and relax too.

376
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,660
No, no, no.

377
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,540
Absolutely not.

378
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,550
About our rumor last time,

379
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,500
my dad...

380
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,590
Anyway, not now.

381
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,670
Not now.

382
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:32,980
Leave it to me.

383
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,670
Here.

384
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,550
A little heavy.

385
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,230
Done.

386
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,670
Why isn't he here yet?

387
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,230
Mr. Gu didn't follow you?

388
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,580
I was wondering if he would come.

389
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,910
Don't mention him.

390
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,350
He has been nagging me for days,

391
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,830
but I turned him down.

392
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,710
Can't you take me back with you?

393
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,390
I really can't.

394
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,150
Surely you can't take me back with you?

395
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:06,870
No.

396
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,310
No.

397
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,390
I really can't.

398
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,870
I really can't take you home.

399
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,100
Boss, just focus on your work.

400
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,110
You...

401
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,750
Stop asking.

402
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,260
How many times have I told you?

403
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,700
I really can't.

404
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,190
I am not asking that.

405
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,670
Come back early.

406
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,430
Got it?

407
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,150
He doesn't understand.

408
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,390
My dad

409
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,070
is still mad at

410
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,190
our rumor.

411
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,270
He will definitely stir up trouble if he goes to see my dad.

412
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,830
Right.

413
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,940
He's here.

414
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,990
Sorry.

415
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,190
There was a traffic jam.

416
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,150
You're finally here.

417
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,710
Will this be appropriate if you start work?

418
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,500
None of your business.

419
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,070
By the way, what about your internship?

420
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,710
I had an interview.

421
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,230
But I haven't gotten further information yet.

422
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,670
Are you really not going back with us?

423
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,030
You are already back.

424
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,110
When our dad finds out,

425
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,150
he will scold you for not having him in your heart.

426
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,900
I didn't tell him that I would come back this time.

427
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,150
Don't let it slip.

428
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,350
Fine.

429
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,500
Take good care of the store for us.

430
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,110
Come on, bro.

431
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,310
Here.

432
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,870
Take care of the store.

433
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,190
We'll thank you after we come back.

434
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,390
Remember to lock the door.

435
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,110
Remember to pay me overtime.

436
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:27,820
You brat.

437
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,230
Go.

438
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,070
-Bye. -Bye.

439
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,510
Bye.

440
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,150
Bye.

441
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,230
Bye.

442
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,070
Isn't Xun Yuxuan living with you?

443
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,030
She went back to her father's place.

444
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,070
What?

445
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,470
Are you going to meet her parents?

446
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,350
I see.

447
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,350
So you're in love.

448
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,550
Do you think I'm like you?

449
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,470
It's for sculpturing.

450
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,910
I can't work without her.

451
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,030
Okay, you're here to make sculpture.

452
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,790
You are both pure and serious, okay?

453
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,700
Shut up.

454
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,070
Keep dreaming.

455
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,710
Coming.

456
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,190
Why do you always forget your keys?

457
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:19,870
Bai Bin?

458
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,780
Why are you here?

459
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,750
I'm investing in the resort here.

460
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,710
I have some work to do today.

461
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,910
I heard from Huixin that you came to accompany Mr. Xun.

462
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,590
So I came to visit you.

463
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,950
Come in.

464
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,070
My shoes...

465
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,190
It's okay.

466
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,750
You are busy but you still came for a visit.

467
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,990
Thank you so much.

468
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,950
I suppose that my dad went to the morning market.

469
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,950
Have a seat.

470
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,950
I'll get you a glass of water.

471
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,300
Make yourself at home.

472
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,870
Bai Bin, could you open the door?

473
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,430
It should be my dad.

474
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,470
Okay.

475
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,070
Why are you here?

476
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,510
Aren't you here too?

477
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:19,870
What's wrong?

478
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,980
Not my dad?

479
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,910
Why are you here?

480
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,950
What's going on?

481
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,230
Come in first.

482
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,190
We are here to find inspiration.

483
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,150
Yancheng needs to be inspired to make sculpture.

484
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,750
It is not good for him to always stay in the office.

485
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,990
I just took him out for a walk.

486
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,950
We just passed by.

487
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,150
Since you already have guests,

488
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,830
it won't be a burden to have two more of us.

489
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,550
No, no.

490
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,110
Leave now.

491
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,750
You can't be here.

492
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,030
Take him away. Go.

493
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,790
Why can't I be here while he can?

494
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,270
Don't you understand?

495
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,990
You have a "criminal record" from my dad's perspective.

496
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,910
What if he sees you

497
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,740
when he comes back?

498
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,550
Just leave.

499
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,390
No.

500
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,110
I won't.

501
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,470
He can stay here.

502
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,950
Why can't I?

503
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,390
You can't stay here.

504
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,110
Dad.

505
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,630
Why are you here?

506
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,430
Why is Bai Bin here?

507
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,710
He saw a photo from my Moments

508
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,830
that I came back with Yuxuan and asked me about that.

509
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,430
So I told him.

510
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,030
I didn't expect him to come.

511
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,350
I didn't expect you guys to join us too.

512
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,070
What should we do now?

513
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,590
Yeah.

514
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,110
What should Boss do?

515
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,790
Yuxuan.

516
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,070
Dad.

517
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,950
Why don't you introduce your guests to me?

518
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,750
This is

519
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,430
Mr. Gu Yancheng, CEO of Gu Group.

520
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,750
This is the partner of Gu Group,

521
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,550
and my friend, Mr. Bai Bin.

522
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,030
Are you Bai Bin?

523
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,750
Huixin has told me about you.

524
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,310
You helped out

525
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,820
with their flower shop, right?

526
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,470
Thank you.

527
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,340
You're welcome, Mr. Xun. It's not worth mentioning.

528
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,790
You young men don't understand.

529
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,190
It's trivial, but it shows your moral quality.

530
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,430
Mr. Gu, I know you.

531
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,870
My daughter comes from an ordinary family.

532
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,340
But it was because of you

533
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,220
that she hit the headline of tidbits.

534
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,310
Mr. Xun, this is a misunderstanding.

535
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,870
What misunderstanding?

536
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,830
Did I misunderstand that my daughter was your new lover

537
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,750
or that you touched her without permission?

538
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,750
Dad, it's been a long time.

539
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,270
Mr. Gu just helped me up.

540
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,830
The media made it up.

541
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,270
And I'm his assistant now.

542
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,030
This has been clarified long ago.

543
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,950
Can it be clarified?

544
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,550
Every time when I drink with my old friends,

545
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,750
they always ask me,

546
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,900
"When will your daughter

547
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,110
come back home with your rich son-in-law?"

548
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,270
It's embarrassing.

549
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,710
Stop talking nonsense.

550
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,950
Weren't you angry back then?

551
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,430
Why are you defending him now?

552
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,470
I'm his assistant now.

553
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,470
Do you understand?

554
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,230
He's my boss.

555
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,630
Can you be nice to him?

556
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,750
They are all guests.

557
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,070
Could you treat him well?

558
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,790
When did you start working for him?

559
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,190
Since a long time ago.

560
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,150
Got it.

561
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,990
I'll try my best.

562
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,820
Not just trying.

563
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,830
You must.

564
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,070
Otherwise,

565
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,950
I won't make your favorite braised fish for lunch.

566
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,430
What are you talking about?

567
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,590
Just a bowl of braised fish...

568
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:25,830
Braised fish?

569
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,430
Got it.

570
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,750
Mr. Gu.

571
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,190
I'm sorry to say that.

572
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,030
I apologize.

573
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,310
You don't need to, Mr. Xun.

574
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,950
Since you two are here,

575
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,710
let's have lunch together.

576
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,260
Sure.

577
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,430
You guys may have a chat.

578
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,550
I'll cook with Huixin.

579
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,750
Huixin.

580
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,860
Huixin, come and help.

581
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,110
Coming.

582
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,030
Coming.

583
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,500
Shao Jie, why don't you stay here

584
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,630
and chat with them?

585
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,390
I...

586
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,390
I think we have common interests.

587
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,710
And I'm very good at cooking.

588
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,830
May I help you two?

589
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,350
Let's go.

590
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:26,750
Alright.

591
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,780
Let's go.

592
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,910
Okay, you guys continue.

593
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,740
Have a good chat.

594
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,790
Dad, be nice.

595
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,230
Mr. Gu.

596
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,830
Why don't you have a seat?

597
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:49,340
Okay.

598
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,910
Mr. Xun,

599
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,430
I saw you came back with a fishing rod.

600
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,710
You like fishing, right?

601
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,270
Me too.

602
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,750
I didn't expect that.

603
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,950
Bai Bin, why do you have the same interest

604
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,270
as an old man like me?

605
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,390
I like fishing too.

606
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,670
Let me tell you.

607
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,550
I have many hobbies.

608
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,350
Since you two are here,

609
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,990
I must show you.

610
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,190
Let's go.

611
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,620
Bai Bin, have a look.

612
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:53,550
I like fishing and playing chess.

613
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,870
And now, when I have time,

614
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,270
I also go to the chessboard room.

615
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,270
Recently, I have been interested in traditional Chinese painting.

616
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,790
You see, I bought painting materials, including brushes, ink and paper,

617
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,870
to learn painting.

618
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,430
What a coincidence.

619
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,550
I can do all of these.

620
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,860
Perhaps there lives

621
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,870
an old man in my body.

622
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,910
That's great.

623
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,510
Mr. Gu, what's your hobby?

624
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,740
Sculpturing.

625
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,500
Isn't that your job?

626
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,030
I'm talking about hobbies.

627
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,470
Collecting antiques, playing golf and diving.

628
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,740
They all cost a lot.

629
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,430
Bai Bin.

630
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,350
You have an old man in your body and I am an old man myself.

631
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,910
It seems that we can be friends.

632
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,990
It's a deal, Mr. Xun.

633
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,230
I'll come often to fish, play chess and play cards with you.

634
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,550
You won't feel annoyed, will you?

635
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,990
No.

636
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,860
I've been practicing painting the shrimp of Qi Baishi recently.

637
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,750
Let me show you.

638
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:22,989
What do you think?

639
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,750
I think the strokes can be lighter.

640
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,860
You know a lot.

641
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,860
Another one here, right?

642
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,510
Yes.

643
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,469
You are really an expert.

644
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:44,110
You may draw some water plants.

645
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,030
Boring.

646
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,670
I thought you'd be scared.

647
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,860
Why are you sitting here alone?

648
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,110
Why don't you talk with them?

649
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,310
I don't know anything about Mr. Xun's hobbies.

650
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,470
Does that matter?

651
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,070
I don't know much about his hobbies too.

652
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,590
Are you angry because of this?

653
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,670
I'm not angry.

654
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,190
I'm just afraid that Mr. Xun may dislike me even more.

655
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,220
What matters is that I like you...

656
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,390
What did you say?

657
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,060
Say it again.

658
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,140
Nothing.

659
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,580
Forget it if you didn't hear it.

660
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,590
I won't say it twice.

661
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,430
Wash your hands. Time to eat.

662
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,230
Come on.

663
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,670
Let's eat.

664
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,830
Try it.

665
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,430
So many of you are here to have lunch with me, an old man, today.

666
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,460
We need to have a drink.

667
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,390
Right, Bai Bin?

668
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,670
-I'll get the wine. -No.

669
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,620
They have to drive back.

670
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,500
They can't drink.

671
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,070
They can stay here if they're drunk.

672
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,870
We don't have enough rooms.

673
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,110
They can't drink anyway.

674
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,270
You're not allowed to drink, either.

675
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,870
Alright.

676
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,790
Let's eat.

677
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,390
By the way, I just remembered

678
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,070
I wanted to invite you

679
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,540
to the resort I invested in.

680
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,430
It's facing the sea. The view is great.

681
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,590
It is now under the trial operation.

682
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,390
There aren't many people.

683
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,630
The point is

684
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,750
that I preserve my precious wine there.

685
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,270
Mr. Xun, could you bear it for a while?

686
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,230
We can drink a lot tonight.

687
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,230
You may live there.

688
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,790
It's your precious wine?

689
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,990
That's great.

690
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,910
But I can't stand it anymore.

691
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,110
We must get drunk now.

692
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,190
Don't say no.

693
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,470
I'll get the wine.

694
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,390
Don't you like diving, Mr. Gu?

695
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,590
There happens to be diving projects in the resort.

696
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,470
Mr. Gu, do you want to give it a try?

697
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,980
You can give me some suggestions.

698
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,390
Sure.

699
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,380
After all, I've invested in many projects.

700
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,910
What?

701
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:11,990
I didn't bring it.

702
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,710
Bring what?

703
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,190
A swimsuit! To go diving.

704
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,910
Don't worry. There are stores in the resort.

705
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,070
Just buy it there.

706
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,620
Yuxuan, how about bikinis?

707
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,470
No.

708
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,580
With your figure,

709
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,750
you won't look good in bikinis.

710
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,710
Yes.

711
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,390
You, playboy, have seen a lot.

712
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,830
My ordinary figure is not your type.

713
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,750
But don't look down on me.

714
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,990
You'd better cover your eyes this afternoon.

715
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,510
Don't let my beauty make you blind.

716
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,470
Huixin, what "beauty" and "blind"?

717
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,900
Of course it's about your good wine.

718
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,670
You have good taste.

719
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,590
Look.

720
00:37:59,110 --> 00:37:59,550
Have a look.

721
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,230
Pure wine.

722
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,590
I'll fill it up for you first.

723
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,510
Boss.

724
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,230
Bai Bin, this is for you.

725
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,430
Mr. Xun, cheers.

726
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,470
Help yourself.

727
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,710
Don't drink too much.

728
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,150
Cheers.

729
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,830
Cheers. Let's eat.

730
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,110
There are many styles.

731
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,150
Yuxuan, which one do you think is the best?

732
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,860
I think all of them are fine.

733
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,950
Which one do you like?

734
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,470
How about this one?

735
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,430
This one?

736
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,540
It looks good,

737
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,470
but doesn't it show too much cleavage?

738
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,110
How could you hide your good figure?

739
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,070
I don't think it suits me.

740
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,230
Okay.

741
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,790
I'll choose this one.

742
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,270
I'll try it on.

743
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:31,630
Okay.

744
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,190
Hurry up.

745
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,270
I'll wait for you.

746
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,670
Am I too conservative?

747
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,710
This one seems okay.

748
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,910
This doesn't suit you.
