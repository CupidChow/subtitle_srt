Good for you, Yao Yuan.

6
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,410
I'm your sister,

7
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,000
but you didn't tell me anything about her.

8
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,540
I'm telling you now.

9
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,490
What kind of attitude is that?

10
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,460
You're no longer that endearing boy after you grew up.

11
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,650
What are you doing?

12
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,520
They teamed up against me.

13
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,329

Just kidding.

Although I'm dating your brother,

you can't call me that.

27

Okay, future sister-in-law.

29

a sculpture company?

31
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,380
Why did you invest in the theater?

32
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,510
Because I have a business mind,

33
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,260
and

34
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,920
Yuxuan can dance now.

35
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,300
What?

Xun Yuxuan can dance now?

37
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,040
You've overcome your mental barriers?

38
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,200
Yeah.

39
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,050
I had someone to help me.

40
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,490
By the way,

42
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,130
I'll do a solo dance.

43

46

Of course.

47

Just wait to see

48

your sister's beautiful and elegant dance.

49
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,250
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.

50
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,150
In my brother-in-law's eyes,

51
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,970
you're the prettiest no matter what.

52
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,329
However,

53
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,600
you can't be more beautiful than my Wanning.

54
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,140
So gooey.

55
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,680
Just go eat.

56
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,050
Let's eat.

57
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,390
Are you ready?

58
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,150
Feed me.

59
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,530
I'm a little nervous.

60
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,090
Eat this.

61
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,180
Boss, everything is ready.

62

We can do it tonight.

63

If you fail again,

64
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,230
you know

65
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,460

66

Nothing will go wrong this time.

68

I didn't know you were coming back.

69
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,130
Have you eaten?

70
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,250
What are you going to do this time?

71
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,860
What are you talking about?

72
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,780
Running the company has kept me busy enough.

73
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,110
You'd better not do anything irreparable.

74
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,409
I won't cover for you this time.

75
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:41,970
You...

76
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,420
I only saw you dance when I was young.

77

don't be nervous on the stage.

Relax.

81
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,850
Why do I feel that you are more nervous than me?

82

That's not true.

83

What?

Kissing me has made you a coward?

101

Do you mean you agree?

102
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,170
I didn't say that.

103
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,210
I'm going to the bathroom too.

104

Looks like I stand a chance.

Yes.

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,150
The hit caused certain damage to his brain.

174
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,500
His life is not in danger,

175
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,570
but the rest

176
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,390
depends on how well he can recover.

177
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,880
So you mean

178
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,710
he may not wake up?

179
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,500
It's possible.

180
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,810
Even if he wakes up,

181
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,100
chances are that there'll be damage left.

182
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,030
Thank you, doctor.

183
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,890
Gu Yancheng.

184
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,080
Gu Yancheng, you must wake up. Do you hear me?

185
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,680
You promised

186
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,510
that we would be together forever.

187
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,770
I've already lost one of my closest family.

188
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,930
I can't lose you too.

189
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,030
You...

190
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,360
You can sense it when I'm in danger, right?

191
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,030
Do you know

192
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,260
how scared I am now?

193
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,910
Gu Yancheng,

194
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,540
I beg you.

195
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,990
Please wake up.

196
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,200
Okay?

197
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,560
Wake up, okay?

198
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,430
Muyu,

199
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,110
stay with her.

200
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,700
I'll take care of her, Grandpa.

201
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,970
Muyu, what should I do?

202
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,700
What should I do?

203
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,260
Sir, are you okay?

204
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,130
I'm fine.

205
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:09,050
Look into this accident immediately.

206
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,320
Find out whether it was an accident or someone was behind it.

207

Go.

[The heir of the Gu Group was severely injured in an accident and hasn't woken up yet.]

210
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,080
Recently, the famous sculptor Gu Yancheng was injured in an accident.

211
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,380
Our reporter asked for more information from the Gu Group,

212
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,740
but there is no response for now.

213
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,150
Find out

214
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,200
where is the theater where Gu Yancheng got injured.

215
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,330
Yes.

216
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,110
I know you.

217
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,840
You're a neat freak.

218
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,210
You have an obsession with cleanliness.

219
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,900
You should wake up and see yourself.

220
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,220
I'm wiping your hand,

221
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,110
but I'm doing it carelessly.

222
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,070
Please wake up soon, will you?

223
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,120
Here. The doctor said

224
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,470
you should drink enough water.

225
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,570
Come on.

226
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,950
Be good.

227
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,340
Drink it.

228
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,180
Just one sip.

229
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,060
You cared a great deal about

230
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,240
your appearance, didn't you?

231
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,220
You'd better wake up and look at yourself.

232
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,090
You're not handsome at all now.

233

I'll help you.

235
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,990
You must wake up tomorrow

236
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,250
and drink the water yourself.

237
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,440
Do you hear me?

238
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,220
If this continues,

before Gu Yancheng wakes up,

240
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,990
she'll collapse.

241
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,220
You're right.

242
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,760
I haven't told my dad about this.

243
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,820
Then don't tell him.

244
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:19,870
He'd be worried sick.

245
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,100
This accident was a big blow to my sister,

246
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,930
just like the accident that took our mother.

247
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,630
Don't worry.

248
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,540
Gu Yancheng will wake up.

249

I know him.

250
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,260
He's a strong-willed person.

251
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,410
I believe

252
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,710
they can get through this.

253
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:43,840
Well,

00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,720
go back to the company. They need you.

I'll come back to help you after work.

257
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,440
I'll ask my dad

258
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,440
to contact

259
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,050
famous brain doctors at home and abroad

260
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,260
to see if there's any solution.

261

You scared me.

Why did you come back suddenly?

267
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,100
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

268
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,040
If you hadn't done anything bad,

269
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,310
you wouldn't have to live with your conscience.

What do you mean?

271

Don't talk to your mom like that.

Everyone knows about it.

277
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,840
Shouldn't you explain to me

278
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,760
what you said to that guy the other day?

279

Muyu was kidnapped.

were you behind it?

How can you question me like this?

285
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,369
I'm your mother.

286

Mom!

Is it really worth it?

295
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,750
If it was really you,

296

turn yourself in.

297
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,990
Then I'll still be your son.

298

What if I refuse?

299
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,720
Are you going to

300
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,900
cut ties with me for outsiders?

301
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,550
Yes.

Don't you know why I did that?

I did it for you!

305
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,870
You really disappointed me.

306
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,940
For me?

307
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,300
For me. For me!

308
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,840
You've been using me as an excuse since I was young.

309
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,280
When I was a boy,

310
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,920
I didn't perform as well as Gu Yancheng in school.

311
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,780
You said I was too useless

312
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,230
to take over the Wei Group,

313
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,470
so I tried my best to catch up with Gu Yancheng.

314
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,860
I even regarded him as my enemy.

315
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,530
We could have been friends.

316
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,200
Because of you,

317
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,580
we drifted apart.

318
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,440
I like Muyu,

319
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,590
but I have to reject her

320
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,360
and hurt her again and again.

321
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,400
Because of you,

322
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,830
I can't be with the one I love.

323
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,030
Mom,

324
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,430
be honest with yourself.

325
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,380
Are you really doing this for me?

326
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,480
It's for your own vanity and desire!

327
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,580
You would do anything

328
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,930
as long as the Wei Group would benefit from it.

329
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,690
You hurt me.

330
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,870
You also hurt other innocent people.

331
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,360
I hurt you?

332
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,510
All that I've done for the Wei Group

333
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,270
is for you!

334
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,960
If it weren't for me,

335
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,390
the Wei Group wouldn't be what it is today.

336
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,220
If it weren't for me,

337
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,200
the Wei Group would have been in someone else's hands.

338
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,320
I know it's not been easy for you.

339
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,050
That's why I've always done as you said.

340
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,180
But now the Wei Group

341
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,920
is under your control.

342
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,070
No one can take it away.

343
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,130
Be greedy if you want,

344
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,840
but I'll no longer be your pawn.

345
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,230
I like sculpting

346
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,870
not because I want to win prizes.

347
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,460
If Gu Yancheng doesn't wake up,

348
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,150
I will withdraw

349
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,350
from the competition for Golden Sculpture Award.

350
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,260
You...

351
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:42,990
I dare you!

352
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,370
Let go,

353
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,530
Chairwoman Liu.

354
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,320
Otherwise, you will lose your son forever.

355
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,810
Why can't you understand me?

356
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,870
Why can't you understand why I did all those things?

357
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,450
Did I...

358
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,590
Did I really do something wrong?

359
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,820
Is it my fault?

360
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,850
What did I do wrong?

361
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,240
What did I do wrong?

362
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,660
I did something wrong?

363
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,380
Yuxuan, look what I brought you.

364
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,850
Yuxuan, listen to me.

365
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,230
If Gu Yancheng knows you wouldn't eat,

366
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,840
he will be worried.

367
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,460
I found a beautiful place in the yard.

368
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,060
Let's eat there, okay?

369
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,040
Let's go.

370
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,680
You keep an eye out for him.

371
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,030
Yuxuan.

372
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,910
Are you okay, Yuxuan? Yuxuan!

373
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,060
Go get the doctor.

374
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,550
I'll go get the doctor.

375
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,140
Yuxuan.

376
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,460
Yuxuan, what's the matter with you?

377
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,490
Don't scare me, Yuxuan.

378
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,460
-Doctor. -Yuxuan.

379
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,350
Yuxuan! Yuxuan!

380
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,850
Wake up, Yuxuan.

381
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,160
Grandpa, don't worry.

382
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,780
My sister will wake up.

383
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,160
Yuxuan.

384
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:07,960
You're awake.

385
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:11,810
Grandpa.

386
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,880
Yuxuan is awake.

387
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,380
She's awake.

388
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:15,980
Okay.

389
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,340
Good.

390
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,730
Good.

391
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,140
Grandpa.

392
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,660
Silly girl.

393
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,710
Promise me

394
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,000
to take care of yourself.

395
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,600
Yancheng hasn't woken up yet.

396
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,410
If you fall ill too at this moment,

397
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,910
I won't be able to take it.

398
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,060
Sorry, Grandpa.

399
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,100
Sorry for worrying you.

400
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,680
It's okay.

401
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,740
I'll have someone

402
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,520
to keep you company round the clock.

403
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,260
Go back and have a good rest.

404
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,690
Don't come back here

405
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:49,950
until you feel much better.

406
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,060
Grandpa,

407
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,990
let me stay here and take care of Yancheng.

408
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,330
I'll have my meals

409
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,140
and sleep on time.

410
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,510
I want to be the first person Yancheng sees

411
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,190
when he wakes up.

412
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,340
I've been to the hospital.

413
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,100
The Gu family is very cautious this time.

414
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,700
There are bodyguards inside and outside.

415
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,890
Irrelevant people are not allowed to go near the ward.

416
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,360
I've asked around.

417
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,680
Mr. Gu is still unconscious.

418
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,100
What about Yuxuan?

419
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,340
She has been taking care of Mr. Gu in the hospital.

420
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,840
Seems that she never left.

421
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,380
No wonder she didn't reply to any of my messages.

422
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,810
Gu Yancheng

423
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,630
is the only one in her mind now.

424
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:42,920
President,

425
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,320
do I still need to contact the Gu Group

426
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,490
and tell them you want to pay a visit?

427
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,200
No need.

428
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,710
Go back to work.

429
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:51,700
Yes.

430
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,150
I saw the news

431
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,550
and wanted to visit Gu Yancheng.

432
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,530
I was walking by and saw you.

433
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,410
Is he okay?

434
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,170
He's fine.

435
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,770
Sorry.

436
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,790
I haven't checked my messages lately.

437
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,530
Are you okay?

438
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,950
If you need any help,

439
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,560
you can tell me.

440
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,080
I know a brain specialist.

441
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,420
It's time to change Gu Yancheng's dressing.

442
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,170
I have to keep an eye on him.

443
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,260
I'm leaving.

444
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,310
Recently,

445
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,240
reporters visited

446
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,310
the set of The Light Chaser, a movie starring Gu Muyu.

447
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,490
Gu Muyu danced in the rain

448
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,880
and amazed everyone there.

449
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,060
Yancheng,

450
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,990
do you hear how great Muyu is?

451
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,230
After you wake up,

452
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,270
we can

453
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,520
watch her new movie together.

454
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,740
Have you heard that?

455
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,140
That patient woke up just now.

456
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,410
Of course.

457
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,780
He's the heir of the Gu Group.

458
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,770
He's so handsome.

459
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,890
Yuxuan, did you hear what they said?

460
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,290
Wait for me!

461
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,170
Yancheng!

462
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,100
Gu Yancheng.

463
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,310
You're finally awake.

464
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,040
Doctor, how is he?

465
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,400
Now that he woke up, he's fine.

466
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,670
But he needs to stay in the hospital for further observation.

467
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,400
We need to see if there are any residual problems.

468
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,120
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

469
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:38,780
Gu Yancheng.

470
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,430
You're finally awake.

471
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,560
You...

472
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,780
Miss, don't fling yourself at me like this.

473
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,420
Grandpa sent you here, right?

474
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,010
Gu Yancheng,

475
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,200
are you kidding me?

476
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,110
This joke is not funny at all.

477
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,960
Please behave yourself.

478
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,790
Your mission has failed.

479
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,950
I'm not interested in women now.

480
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,230
You...

481
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,830
don't remember me?

482
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,760
Why would I remember you?

483
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,590
It's me, Xun Yuxuan.

484
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,860
Never heard of that name.

485
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,720
Doctor.

486
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,880
Doctor, please check on him again.

487
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,230
Don't worry.

488
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,610
We'll give him

489
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,320
a thorough examination immediately.

490
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,800
Thank you, doctor.

491
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:28,590
Okay.

492
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,500
Thank you.

493
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,030
I wanted to ask this just now.

494
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,440
Why am I in the hospital?

495
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,350
What happened?

496
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:36,720
Yancheng,

497
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,870
can you recognize me?

498
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,950
Grandpa, I'm not stupid.

499
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,960
What about me?

500
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,440
Is this your girlfriend?

501
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,680
You remember?

502
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,760
Miss,

503
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,740
take my advice.

504
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,650
Stay away from him.

505
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,850
He's not a good man.

506
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,410
Miss? She's Huixin.

507
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,020
You had so many girlfriends.

508
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,050
I can't remember all their names.

509
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,940
Think hard. Who is she?

510
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,430
I don't know her.

511
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,440
How could you forget her?

512
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,780
She is Xun Yuxuan.

513
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,450
You...

514
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:13,940
Huixin.

515
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,660
Forget it.

516
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,430
It's not his fault.

517
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,290
Grandpa,

518
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,890
you guys must have a lot to talk about.

519
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,680
I'm going out for some fresh air.

520
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,000
Yuxuan. Yuxuan.

521
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,300
Yancheng,

522
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,910
are you okay?

523
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,710
Grandpa, I'm fine.

524
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,980
Yuxuan, are you okay?

525
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,410
Huixin,

526
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,880
I'm not fine at all.

527
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,090
My heart really hurts.

528
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,440
I feel so sad.

529
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,220
Gu Yancheng remembers everyone

530
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,380
except me.

531
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,130
It's as if I was completely erased

532
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,520
from his world.

533
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,380
You know what?

534
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,900
I'm so scared

535
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,740
that he never loved me.

536
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,700
That's nonsense.

537
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,020
Everyone could see that Gu Yancheng loved you so much.

538
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,480
He risked his life to protect you.

539
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,590
By the way,

540
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,570
he forgot me too.

541
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,060
Could it be

542
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,850
that he's lost the memories after a certain time?

543
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:48,930
Think about it.

544
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,690
When he woke up, he thought it was Grandpa who sent you here.

545
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,050
When did that thing happen?

546
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,080
It was before you knew him.

547
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,210
This proves that he only remembers

548
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,300
things before you met him.

549
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,660
The memories after that were damaged

550
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,410
or haven't recovered yet.

551
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,150
You're right.

552
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,380
I don't believe it's all fake.

553
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,700
I will make him remember me.

554
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,160
Good girl,

555
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,870
I support you.

556
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,330
Grandpa.

557
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,120
Yuxuan,

558
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,430
I know you feel heartbroken.

559
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,860
I was worried that you would give up.

560
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,310
Looks like I was overthinking it.

561
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,210
Yuxuan,

562
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,070
how do you want me to support you?

563
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,220
Tell me.

564
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,000
I'll arrange everything for you.

565
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,380
Thank you, Grandpa.

566
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,720
I've figured out what to do.

567
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:50,770
Okay.

568
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,380
Boss, the discharge procedures are done.

569
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,190
Mr. Gu.

570
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,640
Are you the new driver Grandpa hired?

571
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,670
Yes, Mr. Gu.

572
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,830
My name is Xun Yuxuan.

573
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,090
Are you so hellbent on getting close to me?

574
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,380
I don't need you to be my driver.

575
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,210
Let's get to know each other again.

576
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,530
My name is Xun Yuxuan.

577
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,760
From now on,

578
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,330
I'm your personal driver.

579
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
I don't need you to be my driver.

580
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,570
Even if you can't remember me,

581
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,780
you haven't changed a bit.

582
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:23,850
What did you say?

583
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:26,630
Nothing.

584
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,520
Mr. Gu,

585
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,430
from now on,

586
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,040
I'm an employee of the Gu Group.

587
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,280
I can't just leave.

588
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,130
I'll go get something from the trunk.

589
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,600
Since you can sense it when I'm in danger,

590
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,230
I'll let you feel

591
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,770
what destiny is.

592
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,260
The Gu Group won't accept

593
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,710
someone who can't even walk steadily.

594
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,060
How could you say that?

595
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,260
Are you trying to blackmail me?

596
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:57,880
No.

597
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,540
No.

598
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,270
Grandpa hired an idiot.

599
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:06,940
How is it?

600
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:07,790
Is everything going well?

601
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,090
Do I look like everything is going well?

602
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,889
It may be hard at first,

603
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:16,960
but don't give up.

604
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,820
He really didn't rush over to protect you?

605
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,360
It's strange.

606
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,409
He said

607
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,050
he could sense it when I was in danger.

608
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,659
Has that accident

609
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,780
affected the connections between you and him?

610
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,380
What are you going to do next?

611
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,800
I have plan B.

612
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,660
Fight fire with fire.

613
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,810
What's wrong with me?

614
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,530
I'll wait for you outside.

615
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:42,970
How did you get in?

616
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,810
What do you want?

617
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,900
Have you noticed

618
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,220
that I look a little different today?

619
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,640
Yeah.

620
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,930
What changed?

621
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,600
You are even more unabashed.

622
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:07,720
Forget it.

623
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,830
I shouldn't push him so hard.

624
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,810
I should do it step by step.

625
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,440
Mr. Gu,

626
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,650
I'm sorry.

627
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,550
I was too rude.

628
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,390
I'll leave now.

629
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:21,610
Wait.

630
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,860
Anything I can do for you?

631
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,130
As an employee of the Gu Group,

632
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,500
you should always look neat and clean.

633
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,880
Your hair shouldn't be unkempt.

634
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,550
Tie your hair when you go to work next time.

635
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,430
Yuxuan,

636
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,100
don't be sad.

637
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,380
He didn't mean it.

638
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,740
I'm not sad.

639
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,810
I'm very happy.

640
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,010
He has forgotten me,

641
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,280
but

642
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,380
he's still the man he used to be.

643
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,300
I'm confident

644
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,300
to bring back his memory.

645
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,870
I'm relieved

646
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,950
to hear you say that.

647
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,130
Well,

648
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,340
I'll leave and think about

649
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,100
what else I can do.

650
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:20,930
I'm leaving.

651
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,180
Who is that woman?

652
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,760
Do I really know her?

653
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:01,610
See for yourself.

654
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,390
These things belong to that woman?

655
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,120
It's very weird

656
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,690
that you loved Yuxuan so much

657
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,140
but you lost your memories

658
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,790
about her.

659
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,290
I found it weird too.

660
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,490
She does look like...

661
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,560
The Flying Fairy?

662
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:34,720
Yes.

663
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:37,980
So I think

664
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,370
this must be Grandpa's plan.

665
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,720
It seems that Yuxuan is right.

666
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,340
Although you lost some memories,

667
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,490
you haven't changed a bit.

668
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,250
Maybe

669
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,430
this is a test given to you and her by God.

670
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
I never knew you believed in God.

671
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,610
Don't snort.

672
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,650
We'll see about that.

673
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:01,680
By the way,

674
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,270
the competition for Golden Sculpture Award is approaching, right?

675
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,070
Yes.

676
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,140
Time is running out.

677
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,650
You'd been preparing for it before you were hospitalized.

678
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,320
It's okay.

679
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,530
Anyway, Elegant Gathering is almost done.

680
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,860
Elegant Gathering?

681
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,580
It seems

682
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,920
that you lost more memories than we thought.

683
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,430
Your time stopped before the 7th Golden Sculpture Award.

684
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,040
What's wrong with that?

685
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,830
That was five years ago.

686
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,790
You're going to attend the eighth competition.

687
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,100
Did I win the seventh award?

688
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,510
Yes.

689
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,000
Good.

690
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,640
Anyway, I'll win the award this time as well.

691
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:51,210
But before that...

692
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:53,730
The car...

693
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,790
Never mind.

694
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,860
Anyway, be careful when you drive.

695
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,530
What does that have to do with sculpting?

696
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,530
I have a personal driver.

697
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,790
Right. How could I forget that?

698
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,680
You have your muse.

699
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,750
What are you talking about?

700
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,310
I've decided

701
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:15,830
to spend all my time sculpting.

702
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,470
Start from tomorrow.

703
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:18,890
Okay.

704
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,730
But boss,

705
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,640
I have to give you a piece of advice.

706
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,730
Be good to your driver.

707
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,300
Otherwise, you'll regret it.

708
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,330
If you don't care about what you put her through now,

709
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,480
it'll be hard as hell when you try to win her heart back.

710
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,620
Mrs. Liu,

711
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,100
long time no see.

712
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,470
Yes, Mr. Gu.

713
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,840
Long time no see.

714
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,570
You should know

715
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,080
why I invited you here today.

716
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,450
My granddaughter was kidnapped.

717
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,670
My grandson and granddaughter-in-law are having a hard time.

718
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:18,760
You are the one to blame

719
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,260
for these things, right?

720
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,180
Mr. Gu,

721
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,160
there must be a misunderstanding.

722
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,970
Stop playing innocent.

723
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:31,070
I am innocent.

724
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,720
Do you have any evidence

725
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,960
for your accusation?

726
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:35,400
Evidence?
