1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,870
This one looks okay too.

3
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,070
This doesn't suit you.

4
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,030
What are you doing? You scared me.

5
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,310
You're like a shadow.

6
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,630
Besides, why doesn't this suit me?

7
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,870
I think I have a decent figure.

8
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,110
Wear that.

9
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,070
That suits you.

10
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,630
Isn't this

11
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,430
a little

12
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,550
too conservative?

13
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,550
You still don't trust my taste?

14
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,070
I do.

15
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,150
I'll take that one then.

16
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,510
Mr. Bai.

17
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,990
Mr. Shao,

18
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,870
if you keep staring,

19
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,790
your eyes will fall out.

20
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,590
Didn't you say that my figure is unimpressive?

21
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,630
I didn't say you look good.

22
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,430
I mean you are dressed redundantly.

23
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,870
Why did you add a coat?

24
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,750
I'm doing this for the sake of someone's eyesight.

25
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,860
I can't let you go to the beach still blinded by my beauty.

26
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,230
Where is Yuxuan?

27
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,430
She hasn't come out yet?

28
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,590
Is it

29
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,350
not pretty?

30
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,910
It's very pretty.

31
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,310
Not bad.

32
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,110
This elegant and feminine style suits you.

33
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,390
Unlike someone.

34
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,270
She's not sexy,

35
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,430
but she insisted on dressing sexy.

36
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,190
I'm not dressing sexy for you anyway.

37
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,070
The boss was right.

38
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,550
Everyone thinks this looks good

39
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,510
so I'm relieved.

40
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,829
My Boss picked this?

41
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,340
Why didn't I know

42
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,750
you like this kind of cute style?

43
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,150
The style is not important.

44
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,550
Then, what is important?

45
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,310
That she doesn't show a lot of skin.

46
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,390
Skin?

47
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,710
So you just don't want us to gawk at her.

48
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,070
Guard against playboys like you.

49
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,550
Yuxuan, let's go.

50
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,870
Dad.

51
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,630
Why are you drinking again?

52
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,350
I came here for this.

53
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,590
Such good wine.

54
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,230
Leave me alone.

55
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,470
Bai Bin.

56
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,190
Take them to play.

57
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,470
Yuxuan, just let uncle enjoy.

58
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,710
We're playing volleyball.

59
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,620
It’s all arranged.

60
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:51,909
Off you go.

61
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,230
It's a deal.

62
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,430
This is the last bottle.

63
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,390
No more.

64
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,630
It's such a good wine.

65
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,550
Let's...

66
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,310
Let's go.

67
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,070
Let’s go.

68
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,590
Let’s play volleyball.

69
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,420
I'm not good at volleyball.

70
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,870
How about I be the referee?

71
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,990
Split into two teams.

72
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,510
We're a team.

73
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,590
Okay.

74
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,830
Let's begin.

75
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,710
Come on, Yuxuan!

76
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,470
Come on, Yuxuan!

77
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,110
Nice!

78
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,990
Referee.

79
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,350
I suspect that my partner is going easy on the other team.

80
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,390
I request for a change of partners.

81
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,670
I agree.

82
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,260
Though it is out of character for someone like him.

83
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,750
Then...

84
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,550
I disagree.

85
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,420
Mr. Gu, are you afraid that

86
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,270
you can't defeat me in a fair competition?

87
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,260
Nonsense!

88
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:35,830
In that case,

89
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,100
let's exchange teammates and start over.

90
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,030
Sorry, boss.

91
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,190
Aren’t we playing doubles volleyball?

92
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,830
Do they not remember the rules?

93
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,830
Why are you also going easy on the boss?

94
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,390
I'm not.

95
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,909
Can't you tell?

96
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,990
You are looking at jealous men who can't think straight.

97
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,030
I can't be the referee for this game.

98
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,659
I'd better go swimming.

99
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,670
You can decide who wins or loses.

100
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,230
Well, I think

101
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,990
I'm not a part of this.

102
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,150
I'm going swimming too.

103
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,030
Who won?

104
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,790
Did I win?

105
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,030
What do you think?

106
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,510
Who plays volleyball like this?

107
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,070
You pissed the referee off.

108
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,630
It's late.

109
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,670
I'm going to check on the dinner

110
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,110
and accommodation arrangements.

111
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,510
Thank you, Bai Bin.

112
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,550
Thank you so much.

113
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,430
Not at all.

114
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,990
I'm more than happy to do so.

115
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,110
Bai Bin is such a good man.

116
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,070
He is a big boss,

117
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,270
yet he does not put on airs.

118
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,350
It's rare.

119
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,780
You think?

120
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,630
Boss, you're better and rarer.

121
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,070
How am I better? How am I rarer?

122
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,630
Everything's better.

123
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,100
And everything's rarer.

124
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,740
Besides, both your appearance and temperament

125
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,380
are one of a kind.

126
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,070
Good.

127
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,020
Let's go.

128
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,790
Take a walk with your one-of-a-kind boss.

129
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,110
Mr. Bai, this is today's menu.

130
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,110
Please have a look.

131
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,670
Okay.

132
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,030
Go back to work.

133
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,870
Yes.

134
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,910
It's the smell of the sea.

135
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,110
How did you smell that?

136
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,270
He's indeed a thoroughly straight man.

137
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,660
He's not romantic at all.

138
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,790
Did you know?

139
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,870
Sea snails can actually sing.

140
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,150
This is for you.

141
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,870
When you're in a bad mood,

142
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,540
you can put the sea snail by your ear

143
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,670
and listen to the sounds of the sea.

144
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,750
Then you'll feel much better.

145
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,750
Xun Yuxuan,

146
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,230
actually,

147
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,590
I've been...

148
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,300
Quick! Help!

149
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,270
Huixin!

150
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,270
Huixin!

151
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,470
-Huixin! -Huixin!

152
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,420
What happened to her?

153
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,590
I think she had leg cramps and drowned.

154
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,790
Huixin, I'm sorry.

155
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,510
I have no choice.

156
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,270
I wanted to test you.

157
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,790
I thought I might have judged you too soon.

158
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,470
But it turns out you're born to be a playboy.

159
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,550
You didn't have to be in such a rush

160
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,870
to give me artificial respiration.

161
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,470
By the way,

162
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,230
I came ashore first.

163
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,430
As we agreed,

164
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,870
you owe me a meal.

165
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,270
Yuxuan, I'm starving from all that swimming.

166
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,230
Let's go eat.

167
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,230
Let's go.

168
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,870
Real life is never like the movies.

169
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,710
Right, Boss?

170
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,070
Serves you right. Put it in the car.

171
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,470
How can you all be so heartless?

172
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,710
Old Xun,

173
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,310
didn't you promise me that you'd only drink a bottle?

174
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,350
Explain yourself.

175
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,710
Who promised you to drink only a bottle?

176
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,620
You, at noon.

177
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,990
One bottle, two bottles,

178
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,860
Three bottles!

179
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,060
You're pissing me off.

180
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,670
Do not think of drinking even a sip of wine tonight.

181
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,430
Do you hear me?

182
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,750
Let's go and eat.

183
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,870
I'll absolutely not drink red wine.

184
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,310
I'll drink white wine.

185
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:42,900
Uncle.

186
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,830
I have such a good daughter.

187
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,870
She cares so deeply for her father.

188
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,750
But she was without a mother since she was a kid.

189
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,270
I should have been the one taking care of her.

190
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,550
But I was busy as a taxi driver.

191
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,350
So, she had to take care of me

192
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,700
and our family instead.

193
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,420
You're not bad too.

194
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,550
You know how to take care of others too.

195
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,260
Give me your hand.

196
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,270
Bai Bin.

197
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,790
I'll hand my daughter to you.

198
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,590
Dad, what are you talking about?

199
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,750
You've got the wrong person!

200
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,630
Who is he?

201
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,230
Gu Yancheng, my boss.

202
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,620
Sorry.

203
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,470
My dad likes to spout nonsense when he's drunk.

204
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,580
It's okay.

205
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,870
Uncle can't eat in this state anyway.

206
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,470
Let's take him back to the hotel.

207
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,390
Okay.

208
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,510
Where is Bai Bin?

209
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,190
-Stop mentioning Bai Bin. -Are we not drinking?

210
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,630
-No drinking, not even a sip. -Uncle, let's go.

211
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,470
Stop talking.

212
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,270
Stop drinking so much.

213
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,070
These photos are good.

214
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,310
I can post them on Weibo.

215
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,110
Hello? Huixin.

216
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,470
Routine check!

217
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,900
Are you being a good caretaker of my flower store?

218
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,190
Don't worry.

219
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,540
I'm still at location.

220
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,470
By then,

221
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,110
you might have to pay me double for overtime.

222
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,740
No problem.

223
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,150
But you need to rely on your pretty face

224
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,310
to sell flowers to the ladies.

225
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,390
Okay, I got it.

226
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,310
Hello?

227
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,350
Hello, are you Yaoyuan?

228
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,110
Yes. And you are?

229
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,660
I'm HR from Fengshang Magazine.

230
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,470
You've passed the interview.

231
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,910
May I know when you can start working after the festival?

232
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,470
Anytime.

233
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,310
Then can you come in at 10 p.m. on Monday

234
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,550
to complete the official employment procedures?

235
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,150
I'll send the admission notice to your email later.

236
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,829
Sure, no problem.

237
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,990
Wait, I need to buy new clothes.

238
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,270
Boss, how much is this bouquet?

239
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,150
It's a joyous day for me today.

240
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,500
It's the last order before closing,

241
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,350
so I'll give you a big discount.

242
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,310
Thank you.

243
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,510
Here, let me wrap it for you.

244
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,140
Okay.

245
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,830
Cheers.

246
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,710
Cheers.

247
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,310
Let me tell you.

248
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,460
My gut feelings about others are extremely accurate.

249
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,950
Especially when it comes to

250
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,270
one's loyalty in love.

251
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,550
Don't be ridiculous. Stop fooling us.

252
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,190
Everyone, let's eat.

253
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,700
Ask Yuxuan if you don't believe me.

254
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,510
When I chat with my friends,

255
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,710
they all agree that my judgments are extremely accurate.

256
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,550
Which one of you is interested to try?

257
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,390
Now that you mention it, it really does seem that way.

258
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,660
At that time, everyone did agree with her judgments.

259
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,150
I'll give it a try.

260
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,750
As usual, Mr. Bai is calm and composed.

261
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,310
I think

262
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,270
Mr. Bai

263
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,510
is a very faithful person.

264
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,230
The kind to love only one person

265
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,870
for a lifetime.

266
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,750
You're exactly right.

267
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,030
Right?

268
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,500
This is my talent.

269
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,310
What do you think about me?

270
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,550
I can interrogate Mr. Gu

271
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,270
on Yuxuan's behalf.

272
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,630
May I ask you a question?

273
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,190
Did you have a relationship before?

274
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,710
No.

275
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,700
No?

276
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,070
I can guarantee

277
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,500
that my Boss has only ever held two women's hands.

278
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,630
Which two?

279
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,310
One is his mother, and the other is Muyu.

280
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,950
You're of no help.

281
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,310
What about me?

282
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,110
I don't have a girlfriend.

283
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,230
How about...

284
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,830
Are you kidding me?

285
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,830
You're all rotten.

286
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,990
Just eat your food.

287
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,910
Gu Yancheng.

288
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,540
Ruoxi.

289
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,190
Ruoxi.

290
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:24,790
Ruoxi.

291
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,950
Ruoxi.

292
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,340
I've finally found you.

293
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,580
Ruoxi.

294
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,860
Ruoxi.

295
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,590
Ruoxi.

296
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,190
Who is Ruoxi?

297
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,750
Could it be

298
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,150
that Gu Yancheng really has another woman in his heart?

299
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,910
Why isn’t Boss here yet?

300
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,070
Fairy.

301
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,980
Why hasn't Boss come down yet?

302
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,550
He just woke up.

303
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,110
We're leaving. Wait for him on your own.

304
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,590
Bai Bin, let's go.

305
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,030
Okay.

306
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,100
Uncle, this way.

307
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,390
What's going on?

308
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,270
Boss.

309
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,590
Why did you make Fairy angry so early in the morning?

310
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,510
How did I make her angry?

311
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,990
Then why did she leave us behind?

312
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,740
It must be because you got up late.

313
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,740
Hurry up.

314
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,670
Everyone has agreed

315
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,550
to go to the beach.

316
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:32,990
What's wrong?

317
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,990
You are in a bad mood early in the morning.

318
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,580
Did Gu Yancheng make you angry?

319
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,310
Huixin,

320
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,740
when you were talking about Gu Yancheng yesterday,

321
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,030
you said he has two relationships.

322
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,580
Is that true?

323
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,110
Are you thinking about that?

324
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,070
Don't think too much when dating.

325
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,830
Love is not about forever,

326
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,940
but about the present.

327
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,790
You like him and he likes you.

328
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,580
Isn't that enough?

329
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,980
But he has never directly said he likes me.

330
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,870
He only told me to stay by his side.

331
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,950
That's normal.

332
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,830
Men are always shy to express their love

333
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,980
directly.

334
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,860
Don't think too much.

335
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,510
Unless you have some serious qualms

336
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,870
about this relationship.

337
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,340
In that case,

338
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,910
you should consider carefully.

339
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,230
Consider what?

340
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,550
Looking for a boyfriend

341
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,550
is like eating durian.

342
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,190
You'll only know if you like it after you've tried it for yourself.

343
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,750
You can't refuse it from the beginning.

344
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,350
After trying it out, you might realize that

345
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,390
it is to your taste.

346
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,950
What are you talking about?

347
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,630
Keep your voice down.

348
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,870
If Bai Bin hears this,

349
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,430
it'll be awkward to even be friends in the future.

350
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,420
Xun Yuxuan,

351
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,910
you are really an amateur when it comes to relationships.

352
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,700
Can't you tell

353
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,710
that the way Bai Bin looks at you

354
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,390
is different?

355
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,470
I can't tell.

356
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,500
Fairy.

357
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,100
I knew you wouldn't abandon us.

358
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,590
I've already reprimanded Boss.

359
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,630
How can a big Boss get up late?

360
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,110
Are you angry?

361
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,140
I didn't mean to oversleep.

362
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,460
It won't happen again.

363
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,830
Don't misunderstand.

364
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,190
The boss has complete say over his schedule.

365
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,030
Why would I be angry with the boss?

366
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,230
You're making me face the sun so early in the morning.

367
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,870
I'm not even sobered up yet. This is too much sun.

368
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,070
Looks like Fairy is really angry.

369
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,470
I've tried my best.

370
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,390
It's up to you to deal with your own woman.

371
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,750
The main activities for today

372
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,310
are fishing and diving.

373
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,150
Uncle and I are definitely going fishing.

374
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,910
You can choose freely.

375
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,790
Follow us

376
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,310
or go diving with Mr. Gu.

377
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,110
'll follow Boss, of course.

378
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,310
I also choose diving.

379
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,910
I have never tried it before.

380
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,590
It's more reassuring to follow a diving professional like Mr. Gu.

381
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,270
I'm also a professional expert with a diving license.

382
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,230
You really know how to blow your own trumpet.

383
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,470
Yuxuan, let's go diving together.

384
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,590
I'm not going.

385
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,110
I’ll follow Bai Bin

386
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,870
and Old Xun on their fishing trip.

387
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,430
Let’s go.

388
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,910
Okay.

389
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,950
Okay, let's go.

390
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,510
Let's go fishing.

391
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,270
Let's go diving.

392
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,310
Bai Bin, help Yuxuan.

393
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,710
Okay.

394
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,550
Let's go.

395
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,190
Let's go.

396
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,430
Bye. See you later.

397
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,950
Bye. See you later.

398
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,190
Let's go.

399
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,190
Let's get changed into our diving gears first.

400
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,110
-Dear Sea. -Slow down.

401
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:56,270
-You're full of waves. -Slow down.

402
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:08,990
The sun is so bright.

403
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,350
Bai Bin,

404
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,110
why are you accompanying an old man like me?

405
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,590
Go talk to Yuxuan.

406
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,110
I'll watch your pole for you.

407
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,110
Okay, Uncle.

408
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,590
Yuxuan.

409
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,230
What's wrong?

410
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,750
This is not the Xun Yuxuan I know.

411
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:50,790
What am I usually like?

412
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,070
Gentle, kind,

413
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,590
considerate and full of perseverance.

414
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,790
Empathetic.

415
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,390
Gentle.

416
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,310
You're so generous with compliments.

417
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,950
For me, so long as I don't trouble others,

418
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,630
I'm satisfied enough.

419
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,630
Your friends are more than willing

420
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,830
to help you with your troubles.

421
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,260
Tell me.

422
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,630
Why are you unhappy?

423
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:19,950
Bai Bin,

424
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,310
You've been Gu Yancheng's assistant for five years.

425
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,950
Do you know

426
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,270
if there's anyone that he likes?

427
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,300
A woman

428
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,910
that he likes?

429
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,310
I think she's called

430
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,540
Ruoxi.

431
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,980
Do you know?

432
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,390
About such personal matters,

433
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,750
wouldn't it be better to ask Shao Jie?

434
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,270
I'm sure Shao Jie won't tell me the truth.

435
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,110
I'm just asking.

436
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,630
Forget it if you don't know.

437
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,590
Come with me.

438
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,590
Gu Group's sculpturing

439
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,790
has been famous for a thousand years.

440
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,790
Back then, the Gu family had three sons.

441
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,670
The youngest son was Gu Xu. He was very gifted.

442
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,590
When he was just starting to speak,

443
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,340
he was already playing with carving tools.

444
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,670
The flowers, plants, birds and human figures he carved

445
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,070
were lifelike.

446
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,390
When he was 15 years old,

447
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,990
he accidentally got the Flying Fairy painting.

448
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,790
The Flying Fairy?

449
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,860
It's strange.

450
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,630
The paper was very tough.

451
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,550
It didn't get damaged by fire,

452
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,150
nor was it ruined after a thousand years.

453
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,710
It doesn't seem to belong to the past.

454
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,990
But it was indeed a thing from a thousand years ago.

455
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:03,510
Gu Xu carved the fairy from the painting

456
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,020
out of white marble.

457
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,150
The fairy

458
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,430
is exquisite and lifelike.

459
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,670
Looking at that fairy,

460
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,820
it seemed as if she was going to rise up to the sky at any time.

461
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,830
Once this sculpture was released,

462
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,510
Gu Group's sculpturing

463
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,300
became famous, and that lasted for a thousand years.

464
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,910
It's no different today.

465
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,790
Hence, this sculpture

466
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,950
became the heirloom of our Gu family.

467
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,390
Only our descendants

468
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,470
can see the sculpture.

469
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,670
Yuxuan, isn't it strange

470
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,910
Old Master Gu tries so hard

471
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,820
to keep you in Gu Group?

472
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:54,910
Fairy. Fairy. Fairy.

473
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:02,110
Does this painting have anything to do with me?

474
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:09,510
Yuxuan, there's nothing more I can do from here on out.

475
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,390
You need to find it out yourself.

476
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,510
But remember,

477
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,310
no matter what happens,

478
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,230
I'll always be on your side.

479
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,590
My first diving was too adventurous.

480
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,830
One time, I almost pulled out the oxygen tube.

481
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,670
Luckily, Mr. Gu fixed it for me.

482
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,470
I think your fate is incompatible with the sea.

483
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,630
You'd better not go into the sea anymore.

484
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,710
You jinx!

485
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,430
You'd better believe

486
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,870
I'll push you down now.

487
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,110
Fine. I'll shut up.

488
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,630
I was wrong.

489
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,990
Always so negative.

490
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,150
Did you have fun, Mr. Gu?

491
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,070
Based on your professional taste,

492
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,510
what do you think of our diving facilities?

493
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,590
There's room for improvement.

494
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,590
Come often.

495
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:25,790
Okay.

496
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,020
Let's go diving together next time.

497
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,430
Let's talk about it when the time comes.

498
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,950
Fairy, were you scared?

499
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,670
I'm telling you, it's fine with boss here.

500
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,110
Shao Jie.

501
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,590
Why do you always call me Fairy?

502
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,710
Because...

503
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,870
Because you're pretty.

504
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,390
I see.

505
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,950
Why? Are you unhappy I praised her beauty?

506
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,790
-Do you think everyone is like you? -You're all back.

507
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,380
Time to eat.

508
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,630
Bai Bin, let's eat.

509
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,390
Let's go, Huixin.

510
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,710
Goodbye, uncle.

511
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,150
We'll visit you again next time.

512
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,310
Dad, go back. You don't have to see us off.

513
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,990
You really won't stay for one more day?

514
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,220
Didn't you agree to leave tomorrow?

515
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,180
Stop pretending.

516
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,630
Deep down, I know you actually want me to leave.

517
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,190
Then no one can control you.

518
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,060
You are really making me look bad.

519
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,070
Mr. Gu,

520
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,310
You are now the leader of Yuxuan.

521
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,510
I hope you can take good care of her.

522
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,500
It's not easy for a girl to be out in the world alone.

523
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,510
Don't worry, uncle.

524
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,340
-I will... -Dad, I've got it. Stop it.

525
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,540
I can take care of myself.

526
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,420
I have to see Huixin off.

527
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,150
It's not on the way, so I'm leaving.

528
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,710
Bye, dad.

529
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,310
Goodbye, uncle.

530
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,310
Bye.

531
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,630
-Goodbye, uncle. -Goodbye, uncle.

532
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,270
Have a safe drive.

533
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,630
Go back and coax her.

534
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,580
She doesn't look like Fairy now.

535
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,390
She looks like a grumpy woman.

536
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,350
Why didn't you answer my call?

537
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,590
Why are you here?

538
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,030
Since you didn't answer my call,

539
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,790
I went to your company to find you.

540
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,670
But no one knew where you were.

541
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,230
I just guessed

542
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,630
that you're here again.

543
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,150
Here.

544
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,550
I feel better after eating this.

545
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,910
Guess who!

546
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,620
Muyu, stop playing around.

547
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,140
You guessed it again.

548
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,270
Boring.

549
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,790
I...

550
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,110
What happened to your hand?

551
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,590
Did your mom beat you again because you didn't score better than my brother?

552
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,590
Are you stupid?

553
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,750
Why didn't you fight back?

554
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,710
She's my mom.

555
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,270
So what?

556
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,380
She still can't hit you.

557
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,470
This is abuse.

558
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,110
I'm fine.

559
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,100
I'm used to it. It doesn't hurt.

560
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,070
You don't feel hurt,

561
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,870
but my heart aches seeing you hurt.

562
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,070
Are you feeling better?

563
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,630
Much better.

564
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,470
Really?

565
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,030
Take this.

566
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,310
When you're in a bad mood,

567
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,470
you'll feel better after eating this.

568
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,590
I'm sorry.

569
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,470
Why are you apologizing?

570
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,350
Your kidnapping

571
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:01,910
was done by my mom.

572
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,190
In order to threaten your brother

573
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,710
to give up the Yiyu Garden Project.

574
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,950
That's it? No need to say sorry.

575
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,670
I have to thank her.

576
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,100
If it weren't for her,

577
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,910
you wouldn't even see me.

578
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,470
Muyu,

579
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,390
let's never meet again.

580
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,750
This is best

581
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,590
for you

582
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,350
and for me.

583
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,910
Why?

584
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,270
Just because my surname is Gu and your surname is Wei?

585
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,710
So what if our families are enemies?

586
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,550
Is my love for you wrong?

587
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,470
You're not at fault.

588
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,100
It's my fault.

589
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,670
I shouldn't have appeared in front of you

590
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,070
in the first place.

591
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,950
Can't we

592
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,910
go back to how we used to be in our childhood?

593
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,150
Time is like the river.

594
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,630
It will never flow backwards.

595
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:30,900
Muyu,

596
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,390
don't waste your time on me any longer.

597
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,710
You deserve a better person.

598
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,550
I won't come here ever again.

599
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,430
You shouldn't too.

600
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,630
Wei Haodong.

601
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,590
Xun Yuxuan?
