since my brother is so inflexible.

Okay?

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,350


184
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,280
How can I recover without you?

185
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,470


186
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,430


187
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,310
Gu Yancheng.

188
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,390


189
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,250
So that wasn't your confession.

190
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,270


191
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,240
So you don't like me.

192
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,410
You just need me.

193
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,590


194
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,830


195
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,590
Where are you going?

196
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:33,980
Home.

197
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,150


198
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,280
Why?

199
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,470


200
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,320
Why?

201
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,390


202
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,430


203
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,320
Mr. Gu.

204
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,830
Are you so reluctant to let me go?

205
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,950


206
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,040
Then answer me.

207
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,110


208
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,360
Why do you insist on letting me stay here.

209
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,500


210
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,630


211
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,460
Didn't we agree

212
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,860
that you would be here

213
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,870


214
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,770
before Steward Du came back?

215
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,870


216
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,490
I'm sorry.

217
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,630


218
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,300
I made you angry.

219
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,390


220
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:25,900
Don't go, okay?

221
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,030


222
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,420
Why?

223
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,670


224
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,950
Why me?

225
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,990


226
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,740
Gu Yancheng.

227
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,870


228
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,530
Let me help you tell the truth.

229
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,590


230
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,780
You let me stay here

231
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,790


232
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,110
because I look exactly like the fairy

233
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,190


234
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,180
in the Flying Fairy.

235
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,310


236
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:43,970
Because my existence

237
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,070


238
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,770
can make you carve again, right?

239
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,630


240
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,110


241
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,920
I guess I was right.

242
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,310


243
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,190
Sorry, Gu Yancheng.

244
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,500
I don't want to be

245
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,510


246
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,720
your tool.

247
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,830


248
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,260
I can't be with you anymore.

249
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,540


250
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,270
The Flying Fairy

251
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,340


252
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,290
is not what you think it is.

253
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,310


254
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,070
You're not a tool either.

255
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,150


256
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,490
Then what?

257
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,590


258
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,040
What are you going to tell me?

259
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,150


260
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,740
Didn't you and Grandpa Gu leave me here

261
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,710


262
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,030


263
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,090
because of that painting?

264
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,290
Isn't it because I look exactly like

265
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,270


266
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,630


267
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,520
the woman in that painting?

268
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,900
Yes. It's because you two look alike.

269
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,980


270
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,400
But it's definitely not about using you.

271
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,470


272
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,360
It's because

273
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,470


274
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,830


275
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,720
Gu's ancestral motto.

276
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,890
Gu's ancestral motto?

277
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,110


278
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,630
Yes.

279
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,870


280
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,380


281
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,240
According to Gu's ancestral motto,

282
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,580


283
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,430
we need to find the person in the painting

284
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,409
and protect her.

285
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,550


286
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,860
Gu Yancheng.

287
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,030


288
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,340
I'm Xun Yuxuan.

289
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,350


290
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,900
I'm not the one in the painting.

291
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,950


292
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,580
I don't need your protection.

293
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,790


294
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,700
Mr. Gu, I officially

296
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,770
resigned.

297
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,910


298
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,120
I'll go through the handover tomorrow.

299
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,230


300
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,510
Please leave now.

301
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,550


302
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,420
I need to pack.

303
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,540


304
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,690
♫The onlooker is the hurt protagonist♫

305
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,380
♫Take off your makeup and forget everything♫

306

♫It's not that I don't want to love again♫

♫I just don't want to cry again♫

308

♫The onlooker is the supporting role who expects love♫

♫Makeup's done and ready for the show♫

310

♫It's a pity that the plot is so good♫

311
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,010
♫In the end his romance was not part of the plot♫

Get in.

318
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,350


319
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,230
It's hard to get a taxi here.

320
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,080
No need.

321
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,470


322
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,510


323
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,230
Thank you.

325
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,750
Let me give you a ride,

326
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,230


327
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,310
so I can rest assured.

328
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,070


329
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,780
Even God doesn't help me.

330

331
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:49,980
Get in.

332
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,340
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

333
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,590


334
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,180
Good night.

335
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,350


336
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,310


337
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,040
Xun Yuxuan.

338
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,650
Why did you come back without telling me?

339
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,660


340
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,480
By the way,

341
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,740


342
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,610
I have good news for you.

343
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,620


344
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,620
I have passed the interview. I'll start to work tomorrow.

345
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,950


346
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,450
That's good. Good luck.

347
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,510


348
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,230
I'm going to bed first.

349
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,510


350
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,370
What's wrong?

351
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,500


352
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,240
Who bullied you?

353
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,310


354
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,350


355
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,170
No.

356
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,000
She is the one who usually bullies others.

357
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,190


358
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,310
This is your desk for now.

359
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,390


360
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,550
I'm the editor, Zhao Lin.

361
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,510


362
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,460
I'll guide you during the internship.

363
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,790


364
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,290
You can always ask me if you have any questions.

365
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,390


366
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,350
Please take care!

367
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,390


368
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:44,980
Don't worry.

369
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,070


370
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,110
I will take good care of you.

371
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,030


372
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,340
Mr. Zhao,

373
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,430


374
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,910
is there any work I need to do now

375
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,990


376
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,460
or anything to shoot?

377
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,590


378
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,070
Our magazine is going to celebrate the anniversary soon.

379
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,350


380
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,500


381
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,250
This is the guest list.

382
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,860
Just fill out the invitations

383
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,910


384
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,620
according to the list.

385
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,870


386
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,090
But...

387
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,270


388
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,940
isn't my job a photographer?

389
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,270


390
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,670


391
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,550
You're an intern.

392
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,560
You can't do important work right away.

393
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,710


394
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,950
Do as I say.

395
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,190


396
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,620
Got it?

397
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,830


398
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,240
Miss Lin.

399
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,550


400
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,220
I saw you arrange for the intern

401
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,230


402
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,400
to write the invitations.

403
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,590


404
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,780
Cool!

405
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,190


406
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,830


407
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,600
Of course.

408
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,310


409
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,080
I didn't come back from studying abroad

410
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,870
to do these things

411
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,030


412
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,040
for her.

413
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,380


414
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,390


415
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,210
Why didn't she ask the administrative department to do it?

416
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,260
She said that the administration department didn't have enough people.

417
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,310


418
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,350
They were in charge of the anniversary events,

419
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,430


420
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,420
so they didn't have time.

421
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,550


422
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,100
And the people we invited

423
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,190


424
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,410
were all prestigious.

425
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,670


426
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,570
If we handed it over to them, she was afraid that they might make mistakes.

427
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,870


428
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,810
Besides,

429
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,950


430
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,250
she said that the handwriting was more sincere.

431
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,260


432
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,380
If so,

433
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,460


434
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,630
why didn't she do it by herself?

435
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,870


436
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,550
She is the daughter of

437
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,590


438
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,000
the TB Group.

439
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,110


440
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,080
She really thinks she is capable?

441
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,270


442
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,320
If it weren't for her father who controls TB Group,

443
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,540


444
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,170
who would care about her?

445
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,230


446
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,340
Really?

447
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,500


448
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,970
Congratulations. You're fired.

449
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,020


450
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,310


451
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,110
Go to the HR department to get compensation.

452
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,350


453
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,370
Why can't anyone see my efforts?

454
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,430


455
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,300
Why? Why?

456
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,400
Miss. Lin.

457
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,750


458
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:23,720
Miss. Lin.

459
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,860


460
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,900
Who are you?

461
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,190


462
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,110
Hello, Miss. Lin.

463
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,270


464
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,590
I'm the intern of this company.

465
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,830


466
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,720
I want to talk to you.

467
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,910


468
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,180
Are you the company's employee?

469
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,390


470
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,080
Yes.

471
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,230


472
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,590
I'm the intern photographer.

473
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,750


474
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,150
My name is Yao Yuan.

475
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,260


476
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,060
I'm warning you.

477
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,310


478
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,460
Don't tell anyone what you saw just now.

479
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,750


480
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,600
If I find someone talking about this,

481
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,830


482
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,470


483
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,320
you will be fired immediately.

484
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,470
Don't worry, Miss. Lin.

485
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,750


486
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,930
Tell me. What do you want?

487
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,190


488
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,050
I admire your words just now.

489
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,230


490
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,560
Since you fired the person who was going to lead me,

491
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,670


492
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,970
can you just take me

493
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,990


494
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,450
so that I can learn from you?

495
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,510


496
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,720
You really know how to seize the opportunity.

497
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,870


498
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,080
Miss. Lin, you flatter me.

499
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,270


500
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,140
So your answer is...

501
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,110


502
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,650
Okay, deal.

503
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,910


504
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,760
You can be my assistant

505
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,830


506
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,080
for this anniversary celebration.

507
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,310


508
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,260
Thank you, Miss. Lin.

509
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,310


510
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,070
This is for you.

511
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,270


512
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,670
When you're in a bad mood,

513
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,950


514
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,330
you can put the conch shell next to your ear

515
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,590


516
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,510
and listen to the sound of the ocean.

517
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,750


518
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,540
It'll make you feel much better.

519
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,790


520
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:47,870
Hello?

521
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,070


522
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,380


523
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,250
Where are you now?

524
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,020
You came back to coax Fairy.

525
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,030


526
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,970
Why is she so angry that she's here to resign?

527
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,020


528
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,960
Come back quickly.

529
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,070


530
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,940
I'll stop her for you.

531
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,220


532
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,280
No need.

533
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,500


534
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,260
I don't think she wants to see me now.

535
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,510


536
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,560
What happened between you two?

537
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,790


538
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,790


539
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,530
I can't explain.

540
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,710


541
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,510
Let me think about it.

542
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,000
Help me deal with the company first.

543
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,109


544
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:24,869


545
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:24,710
Why?

546
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,630
Why?

547
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,910


548
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,250
Why me?

549
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,310


550
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,080
Gu Yancheng.

551
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,110


552
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,750


553
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,740
Gu Yancheng.

554
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,200
Let me help you tell the truth.

555
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,470


556
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,540
You let me stay here

557
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,590


558
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,490
because I look exactly like

559
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,590


560
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,450
the fairy in the Flying Fairy.

561
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,670


562
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,280
Because my existence can make you carve again.

563
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,390


564
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,270

595
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,450
How can you spray flowers like this?

596
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,590


597
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,410
If you keep spraying like this,

598
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,420


599
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,460
you'll kill the flower.

600
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,470


601
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,310
Sorry, Huixin.

603
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,770
I didn't mean it.

604

605
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,650
Huixin.

I think I'm seriously ill.

608

609
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,970
What's wrong?

610
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,110


611
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,450
Are you sick? Tell me.

615
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,710


616

618
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,880
stop missing Gu Yancheng.

619
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,300
There are so many men in the world.

620
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,390


621
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,180
Let's go.

622

623
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,210
There is one waiting for you outside.

624
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,390


625
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,700
Let's go.

626
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,590


627
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,300
Have a good chat.

628
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,390


629
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,320
I won't bother you.

630
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,550


631
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,280
Bye.

632
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,270


633
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,070
I heard

634

635
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,320
about your resignation.

636
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,710


637
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,470
Are you okay?

638
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,830


639
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,270
I'm fine.

640
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,590


641
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,740
It's just a job.

642
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,790


643
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,050
I can find another one.

644
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,150


645
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,200
Yes.

646
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,430


647
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,190
The Xun Yuxuan I know

648

649
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,410
is invincible.

650
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,590


651
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,780
But in front of me,

652
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,820


653
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,350
you don't have to force yourself to smile.

654
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,630


655
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,300
Bai Bin,

656

You are really my good friend.

658
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,470


659
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,230
Are you here to comfort me?

660
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,470


661
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:23,950
You're half right.

662
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,020


663
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,200
I'm here to invite you

664
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,430


665
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,610
to be my dancing partner tonight.

666
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,830


667
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,270
Dancing partner?

668
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,430


669
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,810
If you keep staying at the flower shop,

670
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,950


671
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,190


672
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,110
Huixin will be worried about you.

673
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,880
Why don't you go to the ball with me to distract yourself?

674
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,190


675
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,030
What do you think?

676
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,390


677
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,440
It's inappropriate

678
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,630


679
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,990


680
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,870
for me to go with you.

681
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,420
It's appropriate!

682
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,470


683
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,840
Why isn't it appropriate?

684
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,830


685
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,090
Just go!

686

687
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,810
If you stay here,

688

689
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,950
the flowers will be ruined by you.

690
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,070


691
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,630
If you feel uncomfortable,

692
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,830


693
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,120
Huixin can come with us.

694
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,270


695
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,870
Really?

696
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,190


697

I can go with you?

698

699
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,210
Yuxuan.

701
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,140
Just go.

702
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,190


703
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,560
I want to try on the dress and see the world.

704
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,590


705
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,150
Come on.

706
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,260


707
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:06,960
All right.

708

715

They said you wanted to see me.

716
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,550


717
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,270
Huixin and I are ready.

00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,170
The key is that the food at the reception is not delicious.

884
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,420
Speaking of which,

885
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,430

Gu Yancheng, what exactly do you want?

904
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,540
Why are you staring at me?

905
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,590


906
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,190
