Doctor.

She has been in a coma all night.

64
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,300
Why hasn't she woken up yet?

65
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,470


66
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,220
Don't worry.

68
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,120
Her test results show

70
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,520
there's nothing wrong with her body.

71

72
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,829
She fainted

74
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,820
only because her nerves were very high.

75
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,070


76
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,730
Plus,

78
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,579
She was a little tired these days.

79

80
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,050
So, it's normal for her to sleep longer.

82
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,520
Okay, thank you, doctor.

85
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,320
Mom, don't leave me.

86

87
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,100
I'll go to pick up Uncle Xun.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,810
So when Yuxuan wakes up,

90
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,700


91
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,700
she can feel more at ease seeing him.

92

93
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,920
Hello, boss.

94
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,380
Go get Huixin.

95
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,470


96

97
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,470
And send her to Haida Hospital.

99
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,180
Hurry!

100
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,610
Got it.

101
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,870


102
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,990


103
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,880
Why on earth do you want her so early in the morning?

104
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:56,870
How would I know where she is?

105
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,150


106
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,000
Stop it.

107
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,150


108
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,900
Speaking of which,

109
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,070


110
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,340
you still owe me a meal.

111
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,550


112
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,740
How about

113
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,860


114
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,350


115
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,340
you pay me back now?

116
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,910


117
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,730
OK.

118
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,420
I'll pay you back now. Let's go.

119
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,790


120
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,610
Fine.

121
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,830


122
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,610
You will be sorry for buying me this meal!

128
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,480
And this. This.

130
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,130
These four.

131
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,310


132
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,240
Aren't you going to rip me off?

133
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,470


134
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,370
Just these four dishes?

136
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,670
Except for the four dishes I just mentioned,

137
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,910


138
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,520
I want one of each of the rest.

139
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,670


140
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,510
Wait, and a bottle of sake.

141
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,670


142
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,010
The largest one.

143
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,150


144
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,400
Okay, please wait a moment.

145
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,550


146
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,470


147
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,380
I saw it first.

148
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,010
Don't you know ladies first?

149
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,230


150
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,870
Men are just as vulnerable, too.

151
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,070


152
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:34,470
Fine.

153

154
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,380


155
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,130
In that case,

156
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,210
we'll have to solve this problem in Uncle Xun's way.

157
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,470


158
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,040
The one who out-drinks the other can have the last piece.

159
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,150


160
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,990
Don't you know?

161
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,190


162
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:54,010
I'm known as the Winebibber in the Gu Group.

163
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,020


164
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,710
If you are the Winebibber,

165
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,980


166
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,740
then I'm Bacchus among the florists.

167
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,790


168
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,740
It seems that today

169

170
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,010
we have to bet on the honor of our companies.

171

172
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:03,900
In that case,

173
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,910


174
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,750
come on.

175

176

Here, use the bigger one.

177

178
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,710
Fill it up.

179
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,910


180
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,120
Cheers.

181
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,310


182
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,450
-Cheers. -Come on.

183

184
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,030
Come on.

185
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,110


186
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,870


187
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,010
Why did you bring me here?

188
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:03,560
I...

189
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,670


190
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,520
How would I know?

191
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,630


192
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,010
Didn't you bring me here?

193
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,230


194
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,370
You...

195
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,710


196
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,590


197
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,810
You, you...

198
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,110


199
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,150
You can't.

200
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,430


201
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,320
You... I...

202
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,790


203
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,600
Me...

204
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,420


205
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,120
Let me tell you.

206
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,910
I've never met anyone who can out-drink me.

207
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,990


208
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,740
From now on,

209
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,910


210
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,419
we are brothers.

211
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,549


212
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,140
Brothers?

213
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,270


214
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,580
What brothers?

215
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,860


216
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,340
We're sisters.

217
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,429


218
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,880
Good sisters!

219
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,070


220
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,020


221
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,890
Good sisters?

222
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,590
Fine. I can live with that.

223
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,710


224
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,260
My good sister, where do you live?

225
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,270


226
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,740
I'll send you back to sleep.

227
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,790


228
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,370
Sleep?

229
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,590


230
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,130
How about that?

231
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,390


232
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,420
I want to sleep there!

233
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,670


234
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,810
What? Are you scared?

235
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,990


236
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,140
Who says that?

237
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,270


238
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:09,590
Let's go.

239
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:09,750


240
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,940
Fine.

241
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,110


242
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:11,910
-Go. -Go.

243
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,990


244
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,350


245
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,080
-Go. -Go.

246
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,340


247
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,140
You are not that good.

248
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,740
Let me tell you, really. You can't out-drink me.

249
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,750


250
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,290
Sister, it's you who can't out-drink me.

251
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,300


252
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,580
Sister, you can't out-drink me.

253
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,590


254
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,460
You...

255
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,470


256
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,760
We keep drinking...

257
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,990


258
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,630


259
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,290
-It's you! -It's you!

260
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,730
It was you who wanted to sleep in the hotel.

261
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,910


262
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,260
Fine.

263
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,430


264
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:34,790
In that case,

265
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,110


266
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,220
let's forget

267
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,310


268
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,090
all about what happened last night.

269
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,310


270
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,990
I have to open my shop. I'm leaving.

271
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,390


272
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,260
Wait.

273
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,630


274
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,150
What?

275
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,390


276
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,440
You can't leave now.

277
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,590


278
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,430
Why?

279
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,590


280
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,930
I didn't even ask you to be responsible for me.

281
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,070


282
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,980
You want me to be responsible for you?

283
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,110


284
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,310


285
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,270
Boss wants us to go to the hospital.

286
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,540
To, to the hospital?

287
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,670


288
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,020
We don't have to go there, right?

289
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,110


290
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,120
Relax. It's not about us.

291
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,310


292
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,480
Come on, let's go. He's in a hurry.

293
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,470


294
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,690
What happened to Yuxuan?

295
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,910


296
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,070
Huixin, I have something to ask you.

297
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,230


298
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,330
Shao Jie, you stay here and look after her.

299
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,350


300
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,220
Mr. Gu, if you have any questions,

301
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,230


302
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,870
you can ask me now.

303
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,110


304
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,190
Is she not doing well lately?

305
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,510


306
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,640
What do you think?

307
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,910


308
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,350
Who made her sad and teary?

309
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,550


310
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,010
She couldn't eat or sleep well.

311
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,140


312
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,930
Aren't these all because of you, Mr. Gu?

313
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,150


314
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,190


315
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,440
Don't.

317
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,830


318
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,500
You should apologize

319
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,510


320
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,770
to Yuxuan.

321
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,110


322
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,200
But Mr. Gu,

323
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,500


324
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,400
what exactly happened to my Yuxuan?

325
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,550


326
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,910
She was fine last night.

327
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,110


328
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,470
She just fainted while dancing.

329
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,670


330
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:00,960
The doctor said

331
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,110


332
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,340
she fainted

333
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,390


334
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,220
due to high nerves

335
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,380


336
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,580
and overwork.

337
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,670


338
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,510


339
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,490
What? Dance?

340
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,070
You asked Yuxuan to dance?

341
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,150


342
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,380
Don't you know she can't dance?

343
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,470


344
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:11,700
What do you mean?

345
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,910


346
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,630
Yuxuan has PTSD

347
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,670


348
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,840
from dancing.

349
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,990


350
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,660
Yuxuan's mother

351
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,670


352
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,340
was a great dancer.

353
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,350


354
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,890
But she had an accident on the stage.

355
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,910


356
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,620
In the end, the emergency rescue failed, and she passed away.

357
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,630


358
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,590


359
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,390
At that time, Yuxuan was very young.

360
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,540
She used to learn to dance from her mother.

361
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,550


362
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,590
After that, she can't dance anymore.

363
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,790


364
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,670
Good for you!

365
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,900


366
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,870
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

367
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,150


368
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,960
I'm not feeling well. I'll go back first.

369
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,270


370
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,710


371
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,560
How come I didn't think of that before?

372
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,660
Have some more.

373
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,710


374
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,630


375
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,540
It'll help you recover soon.

376
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,060
It's you.

377
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,190


378
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,150
Who are you? Why are you here?

379
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,310


380
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:15,900
Xun Yuxuan.

381
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,150


382
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,800
The person he confessed to yesterday was you.

383
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,990


384
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,940


385
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,960
How did you know?

386
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,510
Yesterday, the magazine where I interned held an anniversary celebration.

387
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,750


388
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,210
I saw it with my own eyes at the hotel.

389
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,310


390
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,740
No wonder you always pull a long face at home.

391
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,950


392
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,390
So you had received a confession from a man.

393
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,500


394
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,630


395
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,350
Stop talking.

396
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,010
Don't worry.

397
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,020


398
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,900


399
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:35,720
Who is he?

400
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,080
It's okay. I'm here.

401
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,350


402
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,160
Sir,

403
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,230


404
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,010
it doesn't matter who I am.

405
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,020


406
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,610
What matters is that you can't force it.

407
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,750


408
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,090
Since our Yuxuan made no response to your feelings,

409
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,190


410
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,850
as a man,

411
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,070


412
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,900
you should know when to stop.

413
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,030


414
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,130
Your

415

416
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:56,870


417
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,620
Yuxuan.

418
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:57,810
Yes.

419
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,190


420
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,970
My relationship with her is not usual.

421
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,030


422
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,900
I will never allow other men

423
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,990


424
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,430
to bully her.

425
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,740


426
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,170
Alright, Yao Yuan.

427
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,230


428
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,140
Stop showing off.

429
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,230


430
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,940
He is Gu Yancheng from the Gu Group.

431
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,070


432
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,590
Mr. Gu.

433

434
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,170
What?

435
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,430

438
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,120
who comes from a family of carvers who have been carving for thousands of years?

440
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,180

450
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,990
Can I take a photo with you?

451
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,230


452
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,300
And take photos for you?

454
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,060
Brother?

455

How are you? Are you still feeling dizzy?

Much better.

How come you fell?

486

Why are you here? Young man.

487

We're here.

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,630


548
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,470


549
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,390
Okay, Mr. Gu.

550
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,320
I'm here. You can save your worries.

551
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,390


552
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,890
By the way, Mr. Gu,

553
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,030


554
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,260
don't forget your shooting.

555
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,470


556
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,280
What's wrong with you two?

557
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,470


558
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,120
Why are you so nice to him?

559
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,380


560
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,240
Dad.

561
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,310


562
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,310
It's about work. Work.

563
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,350


564
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,210
What did the doctor say?

565
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,270


566
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,670


567
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,590
I'm fine. All good.

568
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,020
Don't worry.

569
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,030


570
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,070


571
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,100
Catch one's heart,

572
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,990


573
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,910
and never be apart.

574
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,210
Mr. Gu,

575
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,510


576
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,560
my sister insisted on leaving the hospital.

577
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,660


578
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,060
So we went straight back to her home.

579
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,070


580
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,780
I'm afraid you won't see her at the hospital.

581
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,830


582
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,690
So I sent this message to tell you.

583
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,710


584
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,330
Thank you all.

585
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,630


586
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,460
Come on.

587
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,550


588
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,870
Have some fruit.

589
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,870


590
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,420
Eat.

591
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,470


592
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,480
Are you feeling better now?

593
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,550


594
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,620
If not,

595
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,630


596
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,780
we can go back to the hospital for a check-up.

597
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,950


598
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:47,870


599
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,840
Dad.

600
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,280
I'm really fine.

601
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,510


602
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,260
Look at me. I'm better than fine.

603
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,590


604
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,750
How about you all staying and having dinner here tonight?

605
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,110


606
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,900
I'll cook myself.

607
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,110


608
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,480
I have learned some new dishes.

609
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,630


610
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,960
Let me show you my skills.

611
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,950


612
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,770
You all can have something good.

613
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:01,830


614
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,050
-We're good. -We're good.

615
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,150


616
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,010
Don't be so polite.

617
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,109


618
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,020
You don't have to be.

619
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,109


620
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,310
Dad, see? I'm very strong.

621
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,349


622
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,220
I don't need to.

623
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,230


624
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,230
Yes, Uncle.

625
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,390


626
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,430
I'm on a diet.

627
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,510


628
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,260
I don't take dinner.

629
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,510


630
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,460
You? On a diet?

631
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,630


632
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,609
You have to eat dinner even if you want to lose weight.

633
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,750


634
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:17,900
Sit down.

635
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:17,910


636
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:18,460
Let me cook.

637
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:18,470


638
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,020
Sit still.

639
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,030


640
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,030


641
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:23,859
Xun Yuxuan.

642
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,930
Since Dad is here,

643
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,030


644
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,800
there must not be enough room at your place.

645
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,859


646
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,170
So I will pack my stuff

647
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,180


648
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:27,780
and go to stay at my office.

649
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,910


650
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,130
Enjoy your meal.

651
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,430


652
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,090
You...

653
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,230


654
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,260
All my ancestors, please bless me.

655
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,390


656
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,770
Please bless Uncle's new dishes.

657
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,870


658
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Bless them so they won't taste so bad.

659
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,980


660
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,730
I don't want to go back to the hospital again.

661
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,870


662
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,040
Maybe I should keep an eye on him.

663
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,190


664
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,510
I don't want to be hospitalized anymore.

665
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,750


666
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,780
Are you discharged?

667
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,790


668
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,730
Are you feeling better?

669
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,950


670
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,470


671
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,290
Have you eaten well?

672
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,370
Much better.

673
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,590


674
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,520
Mr. Gu is busy. Don't worry about me.

675
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,790


676
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,430
After all, I, Miss Xun Yuxuan, am indeed

677
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,500


678
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,120
no longer your employee.

679
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,230


680
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,510


681
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,280
Right.

682
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,350


683
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,140
I'm sorry.

684
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,440
Miss Xun Yuxuan.

685
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,550


686
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,490
You indeed don't work for me anymore.

687
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,590


688
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,220
You don't feel sorry at all.

689
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,230


690
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,330
But

691
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,470


692
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,470


693
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,060
she's the woman Mr. Gu wants.

694
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,110


695
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,950
Please tell her

696
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,190
she still owes Mr. Gu an answer.

697
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,300


698
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,040
Miss Xun Yuxuan said

699
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,270


700
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,870
she needs more time to think about it.

701
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,110


702
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,530
Good night, Mr. Gu.

703
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,870


704
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,310


705
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
What are you doing?

706
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,200
You haven't fully recovered yet.

707
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,310


708
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,520
I'm working out.

709
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,750


710
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,750


711
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,740
Working out?

712
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,490
Don't lie to me.

713
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,630


714
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,040
Huixin has told me everything.

715
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,110


716
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,760
She told me that you fainted because you were dancing.

717
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,030


718
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,840
Huixin is such a big mouth.

719
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,990


720
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,990
I told her not to tell you.

721
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,230


722
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,340
Dad.

723
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,670


724
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,720
Actually, that was an accident.

725
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,950


726
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,370
I always thought I'd recovered.

727
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,590


728
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,570
But I still can't face it.

729
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,990


730
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,810
But don't worry.

731
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,030


732
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,050
I have made an appointment with the doctor.

733
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,100


734
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,070
I'll see her tomorrow.

735
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100


736
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,330
Listen.

737
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,470


738
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,100
You can't leave any scars about that incident.

739
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,310


740
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,700
I don't want you to.

741
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,030


742
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,870
And I'm sure your mom won't want you to either.

743
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,070


744
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,170
We just want you to be well

745
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,340


746
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,110
and happy.

747
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,150


748
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,630


749
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,390
Okay.

750
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,600
I know, Dad.

751
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,630


752
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,550
Don't worry.

753
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,580


754
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,430
I will get better.

755
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,670


756
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,190


757
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,060
Sleep early.

758
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,530
So,

759
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,750


760
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,990
you can carve again?

761
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,110


762
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,770
And there are fewer and fewer dreams

763
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,990


764
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,120
about that ancient woman.

765
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,270


766
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,380
Dr. Lin.

767
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,390


768
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,860
I've figured out

769
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,070


770
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,260
why I keep dreaming about her.

771
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,390


772
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,110
Why?

773
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,190


774
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:13,930
Maybe

775
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,030


776
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,270


777
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,110
she was reminding me

778
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,210
not to miss my destined girl.

779
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,430


780
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,780
Yancheng.

781
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,950


782
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,250
Call me if something happens when you get back.

783
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,580


784
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,140
Yuxuan, what brings you here?

785
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,430


786
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,610
Why are you here?

787
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,910


788
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,430
Do you know each other?

789
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,630


790
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,590
Dr. Lin.

791
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,830


792
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,590


793
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,600
This is the girl I told you about.

794
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,620
Thank you.

795
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,630


796
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,520
Yuxuan.

797
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,830


798
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,120
You haven't been here for years.

799
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,350


800
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,910
How are you now?

801
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,180


802
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,860
Auntie Lin.

803
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,030


804
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,570
Actually, I came here

805
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,670


806
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,200
because I fainted again

807
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,270


808
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,070
while dancing.

809
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,270


810
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,470
Actually, the effect of our previous treatment

811
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,350


812
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,670


813
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,390
was quite good.

814
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,740


815
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:05,690
But,

816
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,890
I didn't expect that when I really face it,

817
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,990


818
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,150
I still can't accept it.

819
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,230


820
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,560
Yuxuan.

821
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,750


822
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,540
When facing fear,

823
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,780


824
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,430
the more you fear, the more fearful you would become.

825
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,670


826
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,320
As I told you before,

827
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,510


828
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,670


829
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,640
what you really fear is not dancing,

830
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,750


831
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,770
but your memories.

832
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:21,640
It's okay.

833
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,670


834
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,010
Let's start over. Take it slow.

835
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,270


836
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,970
You will overcome it one day.

837
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,070


838
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,190
Thank you, Auntie Lin.

839
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,430


840
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,010
By the way, Auntie,

841
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,270


842
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,780
Gu Yancheng is also seeing you?

843
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,870


844
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,220
Yes.

845
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,590


846
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,250
His condition is very special.

847
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,380


848
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,320
But he's gotten better recently.

849
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,510


850
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,410
That's good.

851
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,670


852
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,170
Yuxuan.

853
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,350


854
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,790


855
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,720
You seem to care about him a lot, right?

856
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,300
No, Auntie Lin.

857
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,310


858
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,080
What are you talking about?

859
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,390


860
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,780
Why would I care about him?

861
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,990


862
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,000
Okay, forget what I said.

863
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,270


864
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,260
Long time no see.

865
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,510


866
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,390
Let's go back to my home and have some crabs today.

867
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,590


868
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,370
Really?

869
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,550


870
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:04,840
Of course.

871
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,350


872
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,310
Thank you, Auntie Lin.

873
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,510


874
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,020
Let's go.

875
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,270


876
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,500
Let's go, Yuxuan.

877
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,590


878
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:10,930
Okay.

879
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,030


880
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,110


881
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,030
I heard it's the season for crabs.

882
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,570
Yancheng?

883
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,870


884
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,300
Why are you still here?

885
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,310


886
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,870


887
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,750
I was waiting for you.

888
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,310


889
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,230
Since we all know each other,

890
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,310
we're friends.

891
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,470


892
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,470


893
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,350
Yancheng.

894
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,390
Yuxuan is going to have some crabs with me at my home.

895
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,510


896
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,860
Do you want to join us?

897
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,870


898
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,610
It's my honor.

899
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,830


900
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,460
Let's go, Yuxuan.

901
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,510


902
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,990


903
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,810
Why is Gu Yancheng with my Aunt?

904
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,590


905
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,350
He's here for psychotherapy?

906
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,810
Miss Lin, you're here.

907
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,950


908
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,170
Dr. Lin just left.

909
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,270


910
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,110
Didn't you see her?

911
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,190


912
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,080
No.

913
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,190


914
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,390
It's okay.

915
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,710


916
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,350
I just dropped by to give her something.

917
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,430


918
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,350
You go ahead.

919
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,550


920
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,570
I'll go after I leave it in her office.

921
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,990


922
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,790


923
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,410
OK.

924
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,770
[Gu Yancheng]

925
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,090
Yuxuan, Yancheng, have a seat.

926
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,190


927
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,770
I'll go cook.

928
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,700


929
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,150
Auntie Lin.

930
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,230


931
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,660
With the two of us here,

932
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,670


933
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,030


934
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,930
how can we let you cook?

935
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,790


936
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,520
Actually, Mr. Gu is also good at cooking.

937
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,190
Why don't we ask him to cook for us?

938
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,230


939
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,000
He is my guest.

940
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,150


941
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,200
It's okay, Dr. Lin.

942
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,270


943
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,220


944
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,200
Let me do it.

945
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,240
But

946
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,470


947
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,530
I need to go grocery shopping.

948
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,550


949
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,680
Grocery shopping?

950
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:13,950


951
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:14,700
You come with me.

952
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,830


953
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:24,680
All right.

954
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,740


955
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,330
Mr. Gu, do your work.

956
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,580


957
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,270


958
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,280
As for me,

959
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,950


960
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,780
I'll go and chat with Auntie Lin.

961
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,530
You are not going to help me?

962
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,540


963
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,860
That was before I fainted.

964
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,990


965
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,350
I just recovered.

966
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,390


967
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,570
I'm afraid I can't cook.

968
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,710


969
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,440
I'll be tired.

970
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,550


971
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,060
Mr. Gu,

972
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,070


973
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,330
you just stay here and study the cookbook yourself.

974
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,340


975
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,150


976
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,190
You are so smart.

977
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,480
You'll be fine.

978
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,670


979
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,420
It's okay. You'll be fine soon.

980
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,430


981
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,870


982
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,620
I know.

983
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,220
I wonder how Yancheng is doing.

984
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,310


985
00:24:59,250 --> 00:24:59,930
I'll go take a look at him.

986
00:24:59,310 --> 00:24:59,990


987
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,720
It's okay, Auntie Lin.

988
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,790


989
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,830
Don't worry about him.

990
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,870


991
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,760
Yuxuan,

992
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,870


993
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,060
I'm worried about my kitchen.

994
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,220


995
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,600
This dish is really good.

996
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,750


997
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,470
Of course.

998
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,870


999
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
There's nothing I can't do well.

1000
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,950


1001
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,420
Let's try Mr. Gu's fish.

1002
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,550


1003
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,350
Mr. Gu,

1004
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,500


1005
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,270
is this sashimi?

1006
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,630


1007
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,050
No way.

1008
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,140


1009
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,870
How did you cook the fish?

1010
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,150


1011
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,500
Add 2,000 ml of water, put the fish in,

1012
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,510


1013
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,720
and put the pot on the stove.

1014
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,830


1015
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,900
Put in the side dishes and wait for 20 minutes.

1016
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,950


1017
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,060
Then...

1018
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,070


1019
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,540
You didn't really

1020
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,740


1021
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,370
put the pot on the stove for 20 minutes

1022
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,470


1023
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,210
and forget to turn on the fire, right?

1024
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,470


1025
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,850
I forgot to turn the fire on!

1026
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,110


1027
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,120
No.

1028
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,270


1029
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,020
It is the recipe that is too loose.

1030
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,150


1031
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,850
Then let us try your crabs.

1032
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,150


1033
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,480
Mr. Gu.

1034
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,670


1035
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,920
Did you make the wine-preserved crab

1036
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,180


1037
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,600
for us?

1038
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,750


1039
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,380
I'll go reprocess it.

1040
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,630


1041
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,530
We can eat the other dishes.

1042
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,710


1043
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,490
But this is really good.

1044
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,630


1045
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,020
Try it.

1046
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,350


1047
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,230
Thank you for driving me back.

1048
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,390


1049
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,660
It's okay.

1050
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,870


1051
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,850
You don't have to be so polite to me.

1052
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,030


1053
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,680
Are you still mad at me?

1054
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,950


1055
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,740


1056
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,450
I don't know.

1057
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,560
Actually, I've thought a lot.

1058
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,870


1059
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,120
There are many things

1060
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,190


1061
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:06,950
I want to tell you.

1062
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,070


1063
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,550
Are you still hiding something from me?

1064
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,910


1065
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,710
Of course not.

1066
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,070


1067
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,830
Just for you,

1068
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,070


1069
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,730
I don't want to hold it back anymore.

1070
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,910


1071
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,330
I want to tell you everything about me.

1072
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,550


1073
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,340
Do you want to hear it?

1074
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,550


1075
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,990
Yancheng, Yuxuan.

1076
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,270


1077
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,200
Uncle Du, are you back from your vacation?

1078
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,350


1079
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,290
Well, I'm back.

1080
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,670


1081
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,600
Someone has to take care of Yancheng.

1082
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,710


1083
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,250
I'm sorry, Yancheng.

1084
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,470


1085
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,070
I was cleaning.

1086
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,230


1087
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,360
I didn't expect you to come back so suddenly.

1088
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,590


1089
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,150
I was afraid to disturb you.

1090
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,150


1091
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,080
But I still disturbed you.

1092
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,270


1093
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,600
You two go on.

1094
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,710


1095
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,710
Go on.

1096
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,750


1097
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,310
I should go too.

1098
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,470


1099
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:03,410
Wait.

1100
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,420


1101
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,630
It's hard to get a taxi here.

1102
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,870


1103
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,710


1104
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,630
You can drive my car.

1105
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,750


1106
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,700
Otherwise, I'll be worried.

1107
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:21,620
Okay.

1108
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:21,630


1109
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,100
I'll return your car to your company tomorrow.

1110
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,310


1111
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,580
Yuxuan,

1112
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,830


1113
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,600
I know you see me as your friend.

1114
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,790


1115
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,790
But I don't.

1116
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,990


1117
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,300
This hairpin is not expensive.

1118
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,590


1119
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,300
It only represents my heart.

1120
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,390


1121
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,590


1122
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,490
Because from the moment I bought it,

1123
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,380
I just want to give it to you.

1124
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,550


1125
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:07,900
Yuxuan,

1126
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,270


1127
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,650
don't reject me so quickly.

1128
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,790


1129
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,020
I've been waiting for a long time

1130
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,150


1131
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:16,840
to tell you this.

1132
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,150


1133
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,110
You don't have to reply to me right away.

1134
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,270


1135
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:21,940
I hope

1136
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,180


1137
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,480
you can take your time to think about it.

1138
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,820


1139
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,390
Okay?

1140
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,790


1141
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,470
I can wait.

1142
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,590


1143
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,790


1144
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,720
Bai Bin, are you free tomorrow?

1145
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,040
Let's meet somewhere.

1146
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,230


1147
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:20,610
Mr. Gu.

1148
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:20,870


1149
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,040
Miss Xun gave this to me

1150
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,150


1151
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,030
and asked me to give it to you.

1152
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,270


1153
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,820
She said she already parked the car in the garage.

1154
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,910


1155
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:25,870


1156
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:25,890
Where is she?

1157
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:26,830
She just left.

1158
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:26,910


1159
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,460
You haven't signed it yet.

1160
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,790


1161
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:49,630
Bai Bin,

1162
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,870


1163
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,350


1164
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,260
since I met you,

1165
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:53,810
I think

1166
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:53,830


1167
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,630


1168
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,400
you are a very kind person.

1169
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,290
We don't know each other,

1170
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,470


1171
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,320
but you still helped

1172
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,390


1173
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,440
me and Huixin's flower shop.

1174
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,670


1175
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,900
Later,

1176
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,910


1177
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,030
I went to work at the Gu Group.

1178
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,270


1179
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,200
You kept helping me.

1180
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,670


1181
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,780
I'm really grateful

1182
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,790


1183
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,520
for having a friend like you.

1184
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,750


1185
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,760
But in the future,

1186
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,900


1187
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,540
we can only be friends.

1188
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,870


1189
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,960
I hope you understand.

1190
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,270


1191
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,030


1192
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:28,840
Yuxuan,

1193
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,630


1194
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,290
is this your answer after your consideration?

1195
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,190


1196
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,070
Since you've made up your mind,

1197
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,440
I respect your choice.

1198
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,750


1199
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,060


1200
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,050
Then,

1201
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,320
we are still friends,

1202
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,580


1203
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,630


1204
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,240
right?

1205
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,240
Friends forever.

1206
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,350


1207
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,670


1208
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,600
Friends forever.

1209
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,070


1210
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,110
Why are you here?

1211
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,160
I need to talk to you. Come with me.

1212
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,350


1213
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,400
Sir,

1214
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,510


1215
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,500
there is a custom in my hometown.

1216
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,590


1217
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,960
A man must put a hairpin

1218
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,060


1219
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,040
on the girl he loves.

1220
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,230


1221
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,910


1222
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,740
This means the man

1223
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,690
thinks this woman is the love of his life.

1224
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,750


1225
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,170
Then they can grow old together

1226
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,310


1227
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,130
and never be apart.

1228
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,390


1229
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,180
Sir, are you willing to put this hairpin on me?

1230
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,550


1231
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,120
Yes, I do.

1232
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,470


1233
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,860
Then with what joy we shall renew our life, when I return safely from the dreadful strife.

1234
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,110


1235
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,820
But, if the Fates should decree death, my spirit will forever live with thee.

1236
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,060


1237
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,400
Ruoxi,

1238
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,750


1239
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,450
wait for me here. I'll be back soon.

1240
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,670


1241
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:12,870


1242
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:12,719
Ruoxi.

1243
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,980
Then with what joy we shall renew our life, when I return safely from the dreadful strife.

1244
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,989


1245
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,810
But, if the Fates should decree death, my spirit will forever live with thee.

1246
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,060


1247
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,540
Ruoxi.

1248
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:29,590


1249
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,870
Then with what joy we shall renew our life, when I return safe from the dreadful strife.

1250
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,110


1251
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,790


1252
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,530
But, if the Fates should decree death, my spirit will forever live with thee.

1253
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,460
Since this is your choice,

1254
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,710


1255
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,810
I'll stand aside and just watch you be happy.

1256
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,110


1257
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,840
Many people know that

1258
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:18,910


1259
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,590


1260
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,390
the ancestor of my family got the painting of the Flying Fairy

1261
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,830


1262
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,690
and finally became a sculpting master.

1263
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,440
But no one knew

1264
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,630


1265
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,600
my ancestor, Gu Xu, left a will before he died.

1266
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,790


1267
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,870
His will was written in the family motto.

1268
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,150


1269
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,270


1270
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,190
The descendants of the Gu family

1271
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,180


1272
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,960
should find the woman in the painting

1273
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,750


1274
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,540
and protect her.

1275
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,230


1276
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,090
But I never truly believed

1277
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,060
the story of the woman in the painting.

1278
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,310


1279
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,470
I thought it was a fantasy.

1280
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,540


1281
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,550


1282
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,290
But later,

1283
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,390


1284
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,350
I got into a car accident.

1285
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,210
And my hands got injured.

1286
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,310


1287
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,870


1288
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,740
Since then,

1289
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,030


1290
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,890
I dreamed every day.

1291
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,380
I dreamed about a woman

1292
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,390


1293
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,660
who looked exactly like the woman in the painting.

1294
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,790


1295
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,080
All my dreams felt so real

1296
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,310


1297
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,830


1298
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,650
as if I experienced them myself.

1299
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:05,850
Later,

1300
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,070


1301
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,430


1302
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,250
my hands recovered.

1303
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,050
But

1304
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,230


1305
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,070


1306
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,860
I couldn't pick up the graver anymore.

1307
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,630
So I went for psychotherapy.

1308
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,790


1309
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,310
I want to know

1310
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,510


1311
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,560
what those dreams mean.

1312
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,830


1313
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,930
What does that have to do

1314
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,110


1315
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,910


1316
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,740
with me unable to carve?

1317
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,250
And then?

1318
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,510


1319
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,710
Dr. Lin and I tried many treatments,

1320
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,820


1321
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,490
but they failed.

1322
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,710


1323
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,750
So I had dreams for five years.

1324
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,950


1325
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,990
And I couldn't carve for five years.

1326
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,300


1327
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,220
I've been trying to figure out

1328
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,390


1329
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,830
what the relationship is between them.

1330
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,900


1331
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,080
Until

1332
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,430


1333
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,550
I met you.

1334
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,580


1335
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,430


1336
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,390
Me?

1337
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,700
Is it because I look like her?

1338
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,750


1339
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,280
Not exactly.

1340
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,870


1341
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,250
♫Finally♫

1342
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,060
Do you still remember the time when we met?

1343
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,350


1344
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,070
♫Lost over the centuries♫

1347
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,540
I could feel it.

1348
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,750


1349
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,080
♫For you I do♫

1350
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,410

00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,550


1352
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,790
But after you went to the sculpture museum with me,

1353
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,030


1354

1357
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,150
I could pick up the graver again.
