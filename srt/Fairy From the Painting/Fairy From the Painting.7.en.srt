too much work.

200
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,290
I fell asleep while working.

201
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,510


202
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,110
I was so mad.

I haven't thanked you properly.

231

How can I ask you for help again?

233

Friends help each other.

240
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,940
It's because I'm taking you as my friend

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,070


242
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,290
that I'm speaking so frankly.

By the way,

did you resign

253

254
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,020
because you met difficulties at work?

255
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,070


256
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,470
Yeah. Something has been bothering me.

Aren't you here for a date?

265

266
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:26,920
That's what you have for dinner?

267
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,140


268
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,710


269
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,730
They don't look appetizing.

270
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,290
Mr. Gu,

271

274
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,100
I'm not here for a free meal.

275
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,150


276
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,420
I'm here to remind someone

290
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,150
Let's enjoy the food.

men should be macho,

298
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,300
should eat like a horse and drink like a fish.

299
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,350


300
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,080
Bai Bin is very macho.

302
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,580
But you...

303
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,750


304
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,840
You're a bit girlish.

306
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,070
Why are you so serious?

307
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,190


308
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,880
No hard feelings.

309
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,990


310
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,240
We won't tell anyone.

311
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,390


312
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:26,810
Right?

313
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:26,980


314
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:27,670
You...

provoke him in front of other men.

336
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,410
If he reacts competitively,

413
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,420
you'll have three obvious symptoms.

415
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,740
First, your heart will beat very fast.

416
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,790


417
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,650

419
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,320
once he gets too close to you,

420
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,430


421
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,470
your heartbeat may go up to 180.

423
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,620
Second, you'll miss him like crazy.

427
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,170
especially when you need him.

429
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,270
Third, this one can give you a hard time.

430
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,550


431
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,900
You hurt as if someone stabbed you in the heart.

432
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,190


433
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,020
When you feel heartbroken for someone,

435
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,040
unfortunately,

437
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,170
it means you love him to distraction.

444
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,620
it seems that I don't like him.

445
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,380
After all, my heart only beat very fast

446
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,470


447
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,920
when he kissed me the other day.

448
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,990


449
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,090

452
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,050
that was because I was so angry.

453
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,400
It doesn't count, right?

454
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,500


455
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,140
It doesn't count. It doesn't count.

457
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,030


458
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:35,950
It's okay.

Relax.

460

461
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,450
I heard that the Yiyu Garden Project has gotten into a dilemma.

463

The board members are fretting over it.

464

465
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,380
Aren't you bothered?

466
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,430


467
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,700
It's none of your business.

468

469
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,730
You're no longer an employee of the Gu Group.

470
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,950


471
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,180
You helped me a lot.

472
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,260


473

No matter what, I do care about you.

After all,

I know what's been holding you back.

478

479
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,460
It must be tiring for you to keep it

480

481
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,940
from the board and shareholders.

483
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,720
How did you know?

484
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,990


485

I've been your assistant for five years.

487
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,480
If I hadn't even noticed that,

488

489
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,980
I wouldn't have been worth my salt.

490
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,070


491
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:17,860
Mr. Gu,

495
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,020
you could get the Yiyu Garden Project.

496
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,190


497
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,820
Where is Gu Yancheng?

498

499
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,080
He needed to deal with something about work and left.

500
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,340


501
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,190
What on earth does Gu Yancheng want?

He comes and goes as he pleases.

Have I got him wrong?

506

Let's eat.

513
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,920
The food won't taste so good when it gets cold.

514
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,140


515
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,890
Yes, eating is more important.

516

520
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,680
Weird. Where is he?

521
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,840
Hello?

522
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:41,900

Hello, Fairy.

524

525
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,940
Is Gu Yancheng with you?

No.

529
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,380


530
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,320
You sure?

531
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,670


532
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,520
He postponed the meeting with an important client for you today.

533
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,660
I now need his opinion

534
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,670


535
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,830
on an important file.

536
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,990


537
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,450
I can't find him or get through to him on the phone.

538
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,670


539
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,590


540
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,550
I'm at the end of my rope.

541
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,190


542
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,010
For me?

543
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,350


544
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,190
He was with me today,

545
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,180
but he left without saying goodbye.

546
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,340


547
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,150
Do you know where he is now?

548
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,310


549
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,940
If he's disappeared without even telling you,

550
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,030


551
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,660
he must have gone to that place.

552
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,910


553
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:30,490
Mr. Gu.

554
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,590


555
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:34,890
Boss?

556
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,030


557
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,070
You can't drink,

558
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,190


559
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,490
but here you are, drinking all alone in the dark.

560
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,670


561
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,910


562
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,700
Gu Yancheng.

563
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,540
Are you okay?

564
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,860


565
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,569
My goodness.

566
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,670


567
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,369
My heart is beating so fast.

568
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,589


569
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,950
Do I really like Gu Yancheng?

570
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,190


571
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,300
No way.

572
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,390


573
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,220
Xun Yuxuan, you're here.

574
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,230


575
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,390


576
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,390
Why are you leaving?

577
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,930
Are you okay?

578
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,230


579
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,910


580
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,780
I...

581
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,330
I'm fine.

582
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,630


583
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,670
I'm perfectly fine.

584
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,830


585
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:00,990
Stop drinking.

586
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,150


587
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,320
You can't hold your liquor.

588
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,510


589
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,940
Drinking like this can do damage to your body.

590
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,070


591
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,200
Damage?

592
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,550


593
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,690
I don't care.

594
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,750


595
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,430


596
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,410
I'm a loser anyway.

597
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,440
Things can't be worse.

598
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,470


599
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,050
How can you call yourself a loser?

600
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,110


601
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,190
What would that make ordinary people like me?

602
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,310


603
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,870
You're the CEO of the Gu Group,

604
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,950


605
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,500
a sculptural genius.

606
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,550


607
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,530
Your works are priceless.

608
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,750


609
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,550
How on earth are you a loser?

610
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,700


611
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,590


612
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,610
Look.

613
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,190


614
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,160
My hands.

615
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,740
I know.

616
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,870


617
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,460
These are the hands

618
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,470


619
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,290
you insured for a whopping amount of money.

620
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,390


621
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,630


622
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,520
You're wrong.

623
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,790
What you're looking at

624
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,510
are hands that can never sculpt again.

625
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,710


626
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,190
Useless hands that must not be seen by anyone.

627
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,260


628
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,340
Because of these hands,

629
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,630


630
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,850
I can't get the Yiyu Garden Project.

631
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,990


632
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,830
They are useless hands.

633
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,030


634
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,150


635
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,980
Useless...

636
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,230
Useless...

637
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,270


638
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,920
Boss,

639
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,110


640
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,080
don't torture yourself like this again.

641
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,270


642
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,750
Everything will be fine.

643
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,870


644
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,320
Boss.

645
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,590


646
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,020
Gu Yancheng?

647
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,190


648
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,320
Wake up. We need to go home.

649
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,590


650
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,390


651
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,120

686
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,420
this peach grapefruit tea just came out recently.

687

688
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,720
Try it.

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,670
Thank you, Grandpa.

Grandpa,

693
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,460
I came here out of the blue

695
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,980
to ask you something.

696

697
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,580
Go ahead.

701
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,050
Mr. Gu's hands...

702
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,310


703
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,780
Why can't he sculpt again?

704
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,020


705
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,390
You've known this matter?

706
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,590


707
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,030
He told you about it?

708
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,230


709
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,030
Mr. Gu drowned his sorrows last night.

710
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,350


711
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:15,960
He got drunk

712
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,270


713
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,890
and confided in me.

714
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,950


715
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,120
But he didn't tell me the reason.

716
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,350


717
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,000
Then you have to ask him.

718
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,190


719
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,690
I can see that it's a great blow

720
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,830


721
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,200
for Mr. Gu that he can't sculpt.

722
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,430


723
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,360
I don't want to see him so sad.

724
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,740


725
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,210
I also asked Mr. Shao about it,

726
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,310


727
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,840
but he said

728
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,910


729
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,200
it's not his story to tell.

730
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,390


731
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,480
So after thinking about it,

732
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,630


733
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,600
I came to you for the answer.

734
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,670


735
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,110


736
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,000
Yuxuan,

737
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,850
I have a question.

738
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,020


739
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,740
Why do you want to know?

740
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,990


741
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,950
I want to help him.

742
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,110


743
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:58,680
Good.

744
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:58,820


745
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,460
It happened

746
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,590


747
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,870
five years ago.

748
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,270


749
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,490
Next,

750
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,550


751
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,430
we'll announce the winner of the seventh Golden Sculpture Award.

752
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,550


753
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,620
[The 7th Golden Sculpture Award Ceremony]

754
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,070
The award goes to the sculptor of Elegant Gathering,

755
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,190


756
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:35,930
Gu Yancheng.

757
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,030


758
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,580
That accident had a great impact on the company.

759
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,820


760
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,170
So the Gu Group

761
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,390


762
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,520
kept it a secret.

763
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,780


764
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,380
The public only know that Yancheng was sick.

765
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,590


766
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,140
After that,

767
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,310


768
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,560
he can't sculpt anymore.

769
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,830


770
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,100
But Mr. Gu doesn't seem

771
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,150


772
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,260
to have any trouble using his hands in daily life.

773
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,270


774
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,560
His hands recovered well.

775
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,790


776
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,850
All kinds of functions are great.

777
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,230


778
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,090
But for some reason,

779
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,100


780
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,150


781
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,940
he can't use a sculpting knife.

782
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,870


783
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,790
So the doctor suspected

784
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,740
that it was a psychological problem.

785
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,910


786
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,310


787
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,140
However,

788
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,570
he received therapy

789
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,860


790
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,290
but it didn't work either.

791
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,500


792
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
What you're looking at

793
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,510


794
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,200
are hands that can't sculpt anymore.

795
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,550


796
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,600
It turns out

797
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,750


798
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,750
someone as exalted as you,

799
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,950


800
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,240
can also be in such pain.

801
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,500


802
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,790
[Gu Group]

803
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,170
Mr. Wang sent someone to follow up

804
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,220


805
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,410
on the Yiyu Garden Project today.

806
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,430


807
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,490
He told me about the Wei family's new conditions.

808
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,790


809
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,790
Also,

this Friday afternoon,

812

813
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,080
they will decide on the winning bidder in the board meeting.

814
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,390


815
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,030
If we want this project,

816
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,220


817
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,620
we must reply to them

818
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,990


819

Otherwise,

823
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,470
they'll have to weed out the Gu Group.

824
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,710


825
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,000
What's your plan?

826
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,150


827
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,360
I quit.

828
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,670


829
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,490
Why don't you give it a second thought?

830
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,630


831
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,480
I remember you said

you've recovered a little, right?

834
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,830


835
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,160
I tried again.

00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,310


837
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,950
It's still too difficult for me.

838
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,070


839
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,010
Okay.

I'll call Mr. Wang myself.

I'll buy you lunch. Do you have time?

857
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,120
Something must have happened.

859
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,680
Or you wouldn't have smiled so eerily.

860

861
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,490
Tell me.

863
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,180
What is it?

864
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,270


865
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,540
A date.

866
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,870


867
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,330
A date?

868
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,430


869
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,650
Who's the girl?

871

We've known each other for so long,

872

873
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,220
but it's the first time

874
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,230


875
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,330
that I've heard the word date from your lips.

876
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,550


877
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,100
It's Fairy, right?

878
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,270


879
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,800
I knew it.

880
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,870


881
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,220
When did you two

882
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,230


883
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,510
start seeing each other?

884
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,670


885
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,540
Good for you, Gu Yancheng.

886

887
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,250
You kept it quiet but you did it quick.

888
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,270


889
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,660
When did you make it clear to her?

890
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,820


891
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,130
Make what clear?

892
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,190


893
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,390
That you like her.

895
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,100


896
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:49,840
I didn't.

897

898
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:51,570
She asked me

899

if I liked her.

900
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,310


901
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,120
What did you say?

902
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,380


903
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,210
I didn't answer.

904

905
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,310
You're so straight-laced.

906

907
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,620
If I were her,

908
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,630


909
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,920
I would be mad and not talk to you again.

910
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,150


911
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:03,770
She must have felt so embarrassed.

912
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,030


913
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,780
She was not angry.

914
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,030


915
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:08,870
She was not?

916
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,020


917
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,050
That's not a good sign.

918
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,350


919
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,580
If she wasn't angry,

920
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,630


921
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,170
it means she didn't take you seriously.

922
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,390


923
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,270


924
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,010
Really?

925
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,610
But she just asked me out for lunch.

926
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,750


927
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,610

931
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,410
is just a normal human social behavior.

932
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,710


933
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,350
When people want to talk about business, ask for help,

934
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,470


935
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,430
make apologies, and express gratitude,

939
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,950
And it's just lunch on a working day.

940
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,150


941
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,430
What are you fantasizing about?

942
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,630


943
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,250
So, it isn't a date?

944
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,470


945
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,420
Mr. Gu,

let me make one thing clear to you.

949
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,860
You have to become her boyfriend

951
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,410
before you call having meals with her dates.

952
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,630


953
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,950
You also have to make every date a special occasion.

954
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,190


955
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,090
You need to make preparations beforehand.

956
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,230


957
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,050
Find out what she likes

958
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,150


959
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,320
and make a perfect plan.

960
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,390


961
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,790
Surprises and gifts are a must.

962
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,990


963
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,780
Then you can call it a date.

964
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,990


965
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,760
Understand?

966
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,870


967
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,250
I need to think about it.

968
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,230


969
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,710
I'm leaving.

970
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,910


971
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,070


972
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,860
When are you coming back?

973
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,010
There are several decisions you need to make.

974
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,190


975
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,470


976
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,230
Now I understand that poem.

977
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,390


978
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,130
She slept till the sun rose high, for the blessed night was short.

979
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,890
From then on the monarch held no longer morning court.

980
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,150


981
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,100


982

are you okay?

Of course.

Good.

1100
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:44,660
why don't you eat the dishes?

1101
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,830


1102
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,030
I'm hungry. I just want rice.

1103
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,150


1104
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,260
Boss,

you really like to play tough.

1107
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,870


1108
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,870


1109
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,770
Waiter, we want more dishes.

1110
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,510


1111
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,200
Boss,

I'm considerate and have been doing my job well, right?

1115
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,500


1116
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,650
Yeah.

1117
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,070


1118
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,020
Well,

can I ask for

1121
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,550


1122
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,840
a small reward?

1123
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,990


1124
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,050
Sure.

1125
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,430


1126
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,960
My birthday is coming.

1127
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,190


1128
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,720
I want a small gift from you.

1129
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,870


1130
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,870


1131
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,690
Surprises and gifts are a must.

1132
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,430


1133
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:38,970
No problem.

1134
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,690
Can I ask for anything?

1135
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,870


1136
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,170
Of course.

1137
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,230


1138
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,700
Anything you want.

1139
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,950


1140
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,750
It's not easy to get this reward.

1141
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,940


1142
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,240
I need to think carefully about what I want.

1143
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,470


1144
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,430


1145
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,260
Think while you eat.

1146
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,990


1147
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:51,940
I'll take you to a place later.

1148
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,840
Okay. Thank you.

1149
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,030


1150
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,670
What are we doing here?

1151
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,820


1152
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,340
You said you want a gift,

1153
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,460


1154
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,469


1155
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,400
so I took you here.

1156
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,830


1157
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,620
Maybe you can find something you like here.

1158
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,110
You want to buy me a gift at the mall?

1159
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,469


1160
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,230


1161
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,870
You know anywhere else where we can buy gifts?

1162
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,239
Let's go.

1163
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,429


1164
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:22,889
Wait.

1165

1166
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,870
I've decided what I want.

1167
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,070


1168
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,350


1169
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,980
What's it?

1170
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,870


1171
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,780
We need to go to one place

1172
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,130
to get it.

1173
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,310


1174
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,020
Boss, here we are.

1175
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,030


1176
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,600
The gift you want is here.

1178
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,250
The collections in the sculpture museum

1179
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,469


1180
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,290
are not for sale.

1181
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,510


1182
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,250
If you want something in it,

1183
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,470


1184
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,100


1185
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,860
I have to talk to Grandpa first.

1186
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,180
Don't worry.

1187
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,310


1188
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,810
I've told Grandpa Gu about it.

1189
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,870


1190
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,790


1191
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,690
He's agreed.

1192
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,850
Let's go.

1193
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,790


1194
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,790
Come on.

1195
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,070


1196
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,930
This is what I want.

1197
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,270


1198
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,620


1199
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,400
You want my work?

1200
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,620
Yeah.

1201
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,670


1202
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,330
Everyone wants to have the work by the sculptural genius.

1203
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,510


1204
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,500
Besides,

1205
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,510


1206
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,220
products at the mall all have price tags.

1207
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,350


1208
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,630


1209
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,320
Boss,

1210
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,690
what you carved

1211
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,670


1212
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,580
are priceless, right?

1213
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,830


1214
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,170
Of course.

1215
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,310


1216
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,070


1217
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:50,870
These are satisfying works

1218
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,920
I carved in the past.

1219
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,100


1220
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,190
Which one do you like? You can take it.

1221
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,310


1222
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,040
I don't want any one of them.

1223
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,310


1224
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,450
But these are all I have now.

1225
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,700


1226
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,840
Boss,

1227
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,070


1228
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,590
could you sculpt something

1229
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,670


1230
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,750
for me?

1231
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,830


1232
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,890
Anything is fine.

1233
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,830


1234
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,710


1235
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:08,670
I'm not picky.

1236
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:16,790
Boss,

1237
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,070


1238
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,710


1239
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,540
I know

1240
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,650
your hands can't sculpt now.

1241
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,940


1242
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,790
I'm not asking you

1243
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,950


1244
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:23,820
to give me the gift immediately.

1245
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,110


1246
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,260
Just take your time.

1247
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,510


1248
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,820
How did you find that out?

1249
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,100


1250
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,510
You told me yesterday.

1251
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,860


1252
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,570
Remember?

1253
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,870


1254
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,470


1255
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,290
I told you everything.

1256
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,890
That's why

1257
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,020


1258
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,230
you gave up the Yiyu Garden Project,

1259
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,340


1260
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:47,820
right?

1261
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,070


1262
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,250
Could you

1263
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,510


1264
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,070
not give up so soon?

1265
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,350


1266
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,030
Your hands are fine.

1267
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,150


1268
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,360
You can overcome your mental problems.

1269
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,580


1270
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,390
How did you know about that?

1271
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,630


1272
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,580
I didn't dare to ask you.

1273
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,790


1274
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,690
So I asked Grandpa.

1275
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,990


1276
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,260
He told me about it.

1277
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,630


1278
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,620
Even if you're my personal assistant,

1279
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,870


1280
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,420


1281
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,130
you've crossed a line here.

1282
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,270
This is my privacy.

1283
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,430


1284
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,590
You don't have to be so caring.

1285
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,830


1286
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,090
I just...

1287
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,230


1288
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:18,870
Leave.

1289
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,070


1290
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,030


1291
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,750
I want to be alone for a moment.

1292
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,480
Gu Yancheng,

1293
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,790


1294
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,940
I remember

1295
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,110


1296
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,840
how you showed up by my side so many times

1297
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,820


1298
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,350


1299
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,060
like a hero.

1300
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,790
I thought

1301
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,030


1302
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,720
you just liked to play the hero.

1303
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,950


1304
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,780
But later I read one sentence from a book.

1305
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,060


1306
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,790
It says, there is only one heroism in the world:

1307
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:51,020


1308
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,950
to see the world as it is

1309
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,150


1310
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,630


1311
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,370
and to love it.

1312
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,400
This is life.

1313
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,710


1314
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,070


1315
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,720
Cruel things happen to you.

1316
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,470
Some people lose their confidence

1317
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,830


1318
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,980
and never get back up.

1319
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,270


1320
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,120
But in my eyes,

1321
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,350


1322
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,240
you are a true hero.

1323
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,550


1324
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,850
Because you've never given up on sculpting,

1325
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,910


1326
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,780
have you?

1327
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,030


1328
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,640
You've been holding on all this time,

1329
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,910


1330
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,900
so please,

1331
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,030


1332
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,730
please keep holding on.

1333
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,020


1334
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,480
That's what I think

1335
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,790


1336
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,550
a hero should do.

1337
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,830


1338
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,040
♫Finally♫

1339
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,870
♫Lost over the centuries♫

1340
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,940

♫Because of you♫

1346
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,760
♫Everything suddenly made sense♫

1347
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,450
♫Four seasons and day and night♫

00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,610
♫Through the barren river♫
