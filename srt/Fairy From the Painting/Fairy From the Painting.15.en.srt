4
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,870
Good morning.

5
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,770
Hello, Mrs. Lin.

6
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,290
Mrs. Lin.

7
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,350
Don't scroll your phone when you walk.

8
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,050
It's dangerous.

9
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,180
I'm fine.

10
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,480
I mean the it's dangerous for the phone.

11
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,460
Washing up in the company

12
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,740
saves money for your family, huh?

13
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,130
Of course not.

14
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,150
I stayed in the company last night.

15
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,420
Working overtime?

16
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,350
I don't think I arranged any task for you.

17
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,520
I live in the company because I have nowhere to go.

18
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,690
Why?

19
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,579
My landlord suddenly canceled the contract.

20
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,390
I haven't found a suitable place yet.

21
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,370
Mrs. Lin,

22
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,760
will you kick me out?

23
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,860
Live as you want.

24
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,150
Just remember to wake up earlier.

25
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,250
And

26
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,829
put on your clothes.

27
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,100
Don't let others see you like this.

28
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,530
Thank you,

29
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,380
my CEO.

30
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,070
Yao Yuan.

31
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,840
What's going on between you and Mrs. Lin?

32
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,970
Are you two dating?

33
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,490
You come to the company for work,

34
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,870
not for gossiping.

35
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,940
It's reported that you've been hiding the fact

36
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,580
that you couldn't sculpt

37
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,950
for the five past years.

38
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,330
Would you like to

39
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,350
respond to it?

40
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,430
There's an old Chinese saying,

41
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,930
"Seeing is believing".

42
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,120
Whether it is a rumor or not,

43
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,640
I think the truth will be revealed

44
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,730
in three months at the Golden Sculpture Award.

45
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,900
I didn't expect you to care so much about my brother.

46
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,490
You're wasting your time again.

47
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,130
My time can be wasted

48
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,880
as I wish.

49
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,040
No need to worry about me.

50
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,560
I'm here

51
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,440
to deliver something.

52
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,520
On my birthday this year,

53
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,750
I'm going to hold a party.

54
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,260
I'll invite many friends.

55
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,550
I hope you can come too.

56
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,340
Come if you have time.

57
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,760
I won't force you to come.

58
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:13,900
By the way,

59
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,820
you will attend the Golden Sculpture Award

60
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,130
this year, right?

61
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,810
Should I wish you success in advance?

62
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,690
Don’t worry.

63
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,330
I won't lose to Gu Yancheng this time.

64
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,310
You can leave now.

65
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,550
Why are you rushing me to leave?

66
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,140
I rarely come here.

67
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,230
This is not how you treat a guest.

68
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,380
Shouldn't you treat me to tea?

69
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:54,880
Please.

70
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,680
You're so obedient.

71
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,030
You may have a cup of tea

72
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,510
if you want.

73
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,610
I have something else to do.

74
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,510
I have to go.

75
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,290
Are you avoiding me again?

76
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,460
No way.

77
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,860
Let's see where you're going.

78
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,240
There's an old Chinese saying,

79
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,780
"Seeing

80
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:17,670
is believing".

81
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,790
Whether it is a rumor or not,

82
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,380
I think the truth will be revealed

83
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,440
in three months at the Golden Sculpture Award.

84
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,600
So you've planned this long ago.

85
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,350
You made me worried.

86
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,840
I like to see you worry about me.

87
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,440
That's easy for you to say.

88
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,590
I'm really worried.

89
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,510
How do you feel now?

90
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,860
Not bad.

91
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,240
But it's not the best yet.

92
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,650
Then how will you

93
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,470
recover to the best state?

94
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,600
How about

95
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,330
seclusion?

96
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,000
Or go somewhere to find inspiration?

97
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,350
Just stay by my side.

98
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,320
Then, I can have endless power.

99
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,450
If you're afraid of being seen,

100
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,450
why did you follow me?

101
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,950
This place doesn't suit you.

102
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:40,770
Go back.

103
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,250
Why doesn't this place suit me?

104
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,940
I'm an actor.

105
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,570
I'm here

106
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,159
to appreciate art.

107
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,770
But you...

108
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,990
I came to see you.

109
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,280
No other purposes.

110
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,400
I just want to be friends with you.

111
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,640
Fair and square.

112
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,909
But you're avoiding me.

113
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,530
You're not a gentleman.

114
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,650
I've never been a gentleman.

115
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,460
Then I'm not a gentlewomen either.

116
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,550
What's the saying again?

117
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,840
"People of the same ilk like each other".

118
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,470
Can't you just say we're in sync?

119
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,150
You're an actor after all.

120
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,510
It's not good to use idioms casually.

121
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,150
Do you think I'm uneducated?

122
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:29,890
Why are you here?

123
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,610
For the art exhibition.

124
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,419
Don't you need to prepare

125
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,169
for the Golden Sculpture Award?

126
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,610
Even Mr. Wei doesn't need it,

127
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,020
I don't need it either.

128
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,450
Let's appreciate the painting.

129
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,810
Yes.

130
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:49,770
Appreciate the painting.

131
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,450
Its title is "Murder".

132
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,680
Who can tell

133
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,340
how the "murder" is shown?

134
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,090
This painting uses black lines as the background.

135
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,050
The red lines represent the track of the murderer.

136
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,580
And the white line

137
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,220
expands from the central red.

138
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,790
It should represent the disappearing soul.

139
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,140
Mr. Gu,

140
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,960
what do you think of this painting?

141
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,460
Not bad.

142
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,400
The lines are wild.

143
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,610
It's a style of abstract expressionism,

144
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,070
but it has a delicate structure.

145
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,310
Sister-in-law,

146
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,810
can you tell?

147
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,740
Yes.

148
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,790
Tell me.

149
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,030
There are 1,000 Hamlets in 1,000 readers' eyes.

150
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,800
-You know me well. -That's it.

151
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,870
I can't be an artist

152
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,860
in my life.

153
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,110
You don't need to be an artist.

154
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,030
You can be the wife of an artist.

155
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,080
Am I right, Brother?

156
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,900
Mr. Gu is really in love now.

157
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,290
But don't just focus on dating

158
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,560
and forget the important thing.

159
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,860
I come prepared

160
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,370
to the Golden Sculpture Award.

161
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
If you go on like this,

162
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,690
you'll lose badly.

163
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,570
Mr. Wei, you think too much.

164
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,100
Since young,

165
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,420
you've never defeated me.

166
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:42,890
Ah.

167
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,100
Even in terms of dating,

168
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,240
you are my defeated opponent.

169
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,510
Gu Yancheng.

170
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,510
Don’t be too proud.

171
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,900
Do you dare to compete with me today?

172
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,700
I'm all in.

173
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,560
That's all for today.

174
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,670
We should go back for dinner.

175
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,030
Sister.

176
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,010
Are you going back with us?

177
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,620
No.

178
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:01,730
Continue.

179
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:02,960
Mr. Wei.

180
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,660
You're addicted to games.

181
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,960
Let's get down to business.

182
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,640
You can date.

183
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,450
Sir.

184
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,980
Your frown is so wrinkly that you can kill a mosquito.

185
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,720
Smile.

186
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,500
It's just a game.

187
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,930
It's no big deal.

188
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:30,830
Muyu,

189
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,740
does your brother often come here?

190
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,540
Why can't I beat him in anything?

191
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,960
Haodong.

192
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,680
You and my brother

193
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,610
are not the same type.

194
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,510
You are different people.

195
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,690
In my heart,

196
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,040
you're better than my brother in many aspects.

197
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,570
Why do you always want to live like him?

198
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,000
We

199
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,030
are different people.

200
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,850
You must be the daughter of the Gu family.

201
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,380
You must have a lot of pocket money.

202
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,040
Give it to me.

203
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,390
I don't have money.

204
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,880
Don't listen to her nonsense.

205
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,770
Just search her.

206
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,160
Stop!

207
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,420
Leave here now.

208
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,000
Do you want me to tell the dean?

209
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,550
This seems to be the little devil in junior high.

210
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,170
Who?

211
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,470
The young master of the Wei family.

212
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,700
I heard that he has a bad temper.

213
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,800
Leave now.

214
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,900
If I find you bullying her again,

215
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,220
I'll beat you up.

216
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,590
Are you okay?

217
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,150
I'm fine.

218
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:33,990
Thank you.

219
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,470
If anyone bullies you again,

220
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,560
just say my name.

221
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,890
What's your name?

222
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,940
Wei Haodong.

223
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,350
Wei Haodong.

224
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,670
Haodong.

225
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,620
When will you turn back

226
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,740
to that gentle person in adolescence?

227
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,070
But it's okay.

228
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,190
I will always be with you

229
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,020
until you figure it out.

230
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,120
Where is he?

231
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,630
Mrs. Lin.

232
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,610
Are you looking for me?

233
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,850
Do you have any work to assign to me?

234
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:20,740
No.

235
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,610
Then you are...

236
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,520
Pack up and come with me.

237
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:28,870
Where are we going?

238
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,460
You'll know when we get there.

239
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,530
This is the apartment you are renting to me?

240
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,550
Yes.

241
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,740
The rental must be expensive.

242
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,870
This is my one of my apartments, a small one.

243
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,430
You can stay here for the time being.

244
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,320
But

245
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,230
I may not have enough money for the rental.

246
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:05,890
It's free.

247
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,040
Do you mean you want to hide me in this love nest?

248
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,920
You may get a bad reputation if you live in the company.

249
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,710
People may gossip.

250
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,120
You're right.

251
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,330
But

252
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,300
remember to keep tidy here.

253
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,140
Mrs. Lin,

254
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,850
your hair is messy.

255
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,480
How dare you touch the CEO's head?

256
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,720
It's getting late. I gotta go.

257
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,430
Keep tidy.

258
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,560
Okay, my CEO.

259
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:08,690
No.

260
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,910
It should be my dear landlord.

261
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,850
Are you looking for me?

262
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,270
Where have you been?

263
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,490
The Golden Sculpture Award is coming.

264
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,010
I went to an art exhibition

265
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,770
for inspiration.

266
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,830
Inspiration?

267
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,070
You actually went with the Gu family.

268
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,160
It seemed that you got along so well

269
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,270
that I thought you were a family.

270
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,250
You sent someone to follow me.

271
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,430
So sad.

272
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,050
I'm your mother.

273
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:16,990
But you

274
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,579
don't want to talk to me.

275
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,829
I want to know your whereabouts too.

276
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,240
I have no choice.

277
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,830
Stop controlling me.

278
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,820
Haodong.

279
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,470
No matter how old you are, you are still my son.

280
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,120
Am I right?

281
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,870
I came here today to tell you

282
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,950
that you must win over Gu Yancheng.

283
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,960
You must win the Golden Sculpture Award.

284
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,660
You can't fail.

285
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,410
Haodong.

286
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,780
Why do you always compare yourself to my brother?

287
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,300
You are not the same type.

288
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,290
You are different people.

289
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,600
In my heart,

290
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,120
you're better than my brother in many aspects.

291
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,110
But why do you always try to live like him?

292
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,960
Why must I defeat Gu Yancheng?

293
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,020
We are different people.

294
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,670
We can live in different ways.

295
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,370
Stop being childish.

296
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,440
Remember firmly your identity.

297
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,860
You are the heir of the Wei family.

298
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,950
You bear the honor of the Wei family.

299
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,050
It's fine if you want to be a coward,

300
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,100
but you can't embarrass the Wei family.

301
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,950
Do you understand?

302
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,170
Okay.

303
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:49,750
Search someone for me.

304
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,780
Got it.

305
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,590
Let her in.

306
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,990
A visitor. Who is it?

307
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,830
You also know her.

308
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,220
I know her?

309
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,420
Come in.

310
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,240
Why are you here?

311
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,110
Why, Shao Jie?

312
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,820
Judging from your tone,

313
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,090
you don't seem to welcome me.

314
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,960
How is that possible?

315
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,750
How can I not welcome you, our little Yina?

316
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,130
Here.

317
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,160
Yina.

318
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,010
You've become more elegant

319
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,360
after you went abroad.

320
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,740
Your sweet words

321
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,000
haven't changed at all.

322
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,260
Yancheng hasn't changed either.

323
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,230
You're still so excellent.

324
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,800
Did you meet Muyu?

325
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,600
Of course.

326
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,140
She was the first person I went to see when I came back.

327
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,850
Why are you here today?

328
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,160
Are you here to see us?

329
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,440
I'm here to see Yancheng.

330
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,010
I have something great to tell him.

331
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,210
Yina.

332
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,930
You can't treat me differently.

333
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,780
You don't need my help now.

334
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,530
I just came back and heard

335
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,690
those reports.

336
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,520
I also heard that Yancheng would participate

337
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,680
in the Golden Sculpture Award.

338
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,000
So I came here quickly.

339
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,420
Well,

340
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,900
how are you going to help?

341
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,250
Yancheng,

342
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,070
you should know who Leng Quan is.

343
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,110
Leng Quan?

344
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,680
That rare-stone collector?

345
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:30,760
Yes.

346
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,580
When I studied oil painting abroad,

347
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,800
I was his daughter's best friend.

348
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,090
So

349
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,320
I want to introduce you to him.

350
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,200
He appreciates talented young people.

351
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,860
He collects many rare stones,

352
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,260
which may be used in the competition.

353
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,510
What do you think?

354
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,090
Okay, let's make an appointment

355
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,890
with him.

356
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,640
Okay.

357
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,660
Wait for my message.

358
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,430
Come and help me.

359
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,830
My left hand does not work well.

360
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,140
You are indeed a craftsman.

361
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,150
Steady and accurate.

362
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,120
I'll leave the glorious task of

363
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,910
applying nail polish to you.

364
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,000
Sure.

365
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,010
But I want the reward.

366
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,930
So stingy.

367
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,040
I mean this.

368
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,280
Let me make it clear that this is advance payment.

369
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,250
Pay for tomorrow.

370
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,480
Then come with me tomorrow.

371
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,010
Where?

372
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,750
For fun?

373
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,110
I'm going to pick out some nice dresses.

374
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,770
I must look good tomorrow.

375
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,640
You look good in anything.

376
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,490
My nail polish hasn't dried yet.

377
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,200
Seeing from my social status,

378
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,730
your pay is not enough.

379
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,080
I need to

380
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,850
ask for the final payment now.

381
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,010
Yancheng!

382
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:41,950
Yina!

383
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,550
Yancheng, who is this?

384
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,950
This is Muyu's best friend.

385
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,730
She's the one who introduced me to Mr. Leng Quan.

386
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,760
Yancheng, who is this?

387
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,820
She is Yuxuan.

388
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,780
She's my girlfriend.

389
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,840
Hello, my name is Du Yina.

390
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,920
I'm an artist.

391
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,250
I just came back from abroad.

392
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,820
Hello, I'm Xun Yuxuan.

393
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,330
I'm a freelancer.

394
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,320
Self-employed?

395
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,470
You are also an artist?

396
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,620
It has nothing to do with art.

397
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,390
It's mainly about lifestyle.

398
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,690
What exactly do you do?

399
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,890
Now that you mention it, I'm more curious.

400
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,460
Let's go inside.

401
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,150
Don't keep Mr. Leng Quan waiting for too long.

402
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,470
It's all my fault.

403
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,850
I'm so happy to see you.

404
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,940
Yancheng, let's go in.

405
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,300
Let's go.

406
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,930
Yancheng?

407
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,300
Calling him so intimately?

408
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,520
What's wrong?

409
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,380
Nothing.

410
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,230
Let's go.

411
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,440
They're all top-class rare stones to me.

412
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,710
They've costed me a lot of effort

413
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,360
to collect.

414
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,630
Normally,

415
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,870
I won't show them to others.

416
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,980
But you two have a good relationship with my daughter.

417
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,070
Plus, I admire Mr. Gu's work.

418
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,140
Today,

419
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
I'll make an exception.

420
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,850
Mr. Gu, you may have a look as you wish.

421
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,450
Thank you, Mr. Leng.

422
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,030
Thank you, Uncle Leng.

423
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,230
No wonder Lan always praises you.

424
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,380
I only have two treasures in my life.

425
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,800
One is my daughter and the other is rare stones.

426
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,710
Mr. Gu, please.

427
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,600
This Barlin stone is good.

428
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,640
I don't know about the texture,

429
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,020
but it is shaped like a human.

430
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,430
That's right.

431
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,790
It really suits...

432
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,650
You mean the Flying Fairy?

433
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,310
However,

434
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,090
it's more like what you are in my heart.

435
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,530
Do you learn it from Shao Jie? You are so sweet.

436
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,270
Only you know whether it's sweet or not.

437
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,430
Yancheng.

438
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,220
Which one do you like to use

439
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,790
for sculpting?

440
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,140
It's a secret for now.

441
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:33,510
Mr. Leng,

442
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,260
would you sell this Barlin stone to me?

443
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,430
Mr. Gu, you have sharp eyes.

444
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,420
You picked the most valuable

445
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,430
among these stones.

446
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,300
Your place is full of top quality stones.

447
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,980
But this stone

448
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,890
is perfect for what I want to sculpt.

449
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:50,880
Mr. Gu,

450
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,070
I never sell stones here.

451
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,660
It's only for myself.

452
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,130
Mr. Leng.

453
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,080
There are always exceptions.

454
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,060
I know these stones are alive

455
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,020
in your eyes.

456
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,300
But for sculptures,

457
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,350
these stones have souls.

458
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:07,960
The meaning of the sculpture

459
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,880
is to show these interesting souls

460
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,760
to more people

461
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,920
and let more people benefit from these souls.

462
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,350
It is lucky for these stones

463
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,340
to be appreciated by you.

464
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,540
But

465
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,900
it's indeed lonely for them to stay in this courtyard

466
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,570
for the rest of their life.

467
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,890
Mr. Gu,

468
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,670
you are intelligent and benevolent.

469
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,830
I can give you this stone.

470
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,290
But

471
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,040
I have a request.

472
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:37,900
Go ahead.

473
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,620
I've been planning to redo the view in the garden.

474
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,360
Since you love stones so much,

475
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,580
can you help me display these stones again?

476
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,340
But

477
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,530
you have to rely on yourself.

478
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,020
There are so many stones.

479
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,740
How can he do it alone?

480
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,030
Let's help.

481
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,590
That's life.

482
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,370
If you want something,

483
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,890
you have to pay the price.

484
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,930
Mr. Gu, what do you think?

485
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,580
No problem.

486
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,540
That's good.

487
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,020
I'll get back to work.

488
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,980
I'll check it out when you're done.

489
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,930
Yancheng.

490
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,340
Can you do it alone with so many stones?

491
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,280
Trust me.

492
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,100
Yancheng.

493
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,060
You must be tired.

494
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,530
Have some water and take a rest.

495
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,470
Thank you.

496
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,480
You're welcome.

497
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,490
Yancheng.

498
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,940
You're sweating.

499
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,430
It's a hard job.

500
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,320
No worries.

501
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,790
Come on.

502
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,540
Yuxuan.

503
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,170
How did you meet Yancheng?

504
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,440
I worked with him for a while

505
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,740
as his assistant.

506
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,570
You must be excellent.

507
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,780
I know Yancheng is very strict with his work.

508
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,150
Not really.

509
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,050
He's not that strict

510
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,720
at work.

511
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,970
In which country did you study?

512
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,680
I never studied abroad.

513
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,150
Then you must have graduated from

514
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,580
one of the top universities in China.

515
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,880
No, it isn't.

516
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,690
It's very ordinary.

517
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,930
I hear that Gu Group has always been

518
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,830
strict with recruiting.

519
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,760
Are you the daughter of any group?

520
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,730
No.

521
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,060
It seems that Yancheng's preference

522
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,120
has changed a lot during these years when I studied abroad.

523
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,100
It looks like

524
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,570
you know Yancheng well.

525
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:54,740
Yes.

526
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,360
Muyu and I were classmates in junior high.

527
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,790
So I always went to his house.

528
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,810
Plus, my family specializes in exhibition.

529
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,700
So we two families

530
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,690
are business partners.

531
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,750
Yancheng has always been nice to me.

532
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:14,770
Yuxuan.

533
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,660
I don't mean anything else.

534
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:17,680
Don't think too much.

535
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,750
Of course not.

536
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,710
Yancheng has always been nice to his sister.

537
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,600
It's reasonable that he likes you.

538
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,430
Take a seat, Yuxuan.

539
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,300
I'll ask Uncle Leng for mercy.

540
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,820
Thank you.

541
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,680
"Yancheng".

542
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,140
"Yancheng".

543
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,520
It is tiring. Have some water.

544
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,340
Thank you.

545
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,700
Mr. Gu.

546
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,620
I underestimated you.

547
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:08,490
I didn't expect

548
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,030
you could do this.

549
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,280
I admire your character and perseverance.

550
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,510
I'm sure

551
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,070
you are my bosom friend.

552
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,550
Take the Barlin stone with you.

553
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,220
Thank you, Mr. Leng.

554
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,640
I'll assign the accountant

555
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,690
to go through the payment process with you.

556
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,400
No need.

557
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,520
These precious stones

558
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,680
are priceless.

559
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,750
You also said

560
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,880
they all have souls.

561
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,280
So

562
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,680
let's not talk about business.

563
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,130
I'll give it to you, my bosom friend.

564
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,470
Thank you.

565
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,510
You're welcome.

566
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,260
I just hope you can interpret

567
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,100
its soul

568
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,300
and make it an unparalleled piece.

569
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,350
Congratulations, Yancheng.

570
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,030
Let's find a place

571
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,160
to celebrate.

572
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,860
I'm a little tired today.

573
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,090
Maybe another day.

574
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,670
Let's go home.

575
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,040
Okay.

576
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:03,970
Let's go home.

577
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,920
I'll go get our belongings.

578
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,930
I'll ask you out next time.

579
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,750
Mr. Leng,

580
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,630
goodbye.

581
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,590
Please.

582
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,860
I'll take a shower first.

583
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,800
Then let's have dinner together.

584
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,770
You can take a shower if you want.

585
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,890
No need to inform me.

586
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,200
Are you angry?

587
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,520
You promised to take me out,

588
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,000
but you introduced to me a beauty who studied abroad.

589
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,190
You should have told me in advance.

590
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,610
I was so unprepared.

591
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,980
What did you want to prepare for?

592
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,070
My experience is not as rich as others.

593
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,960
At least I can dress up nicely.

594
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,270
Besides,

595
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,220
you carried so many stones alone today.

596
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,570
I feel sorry for you too.

597
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,430
Also,

598
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,620
"Congratulations, Yancheng".

599
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:12,650
"Let's find a place to celebrate".

600
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,530
Are you jealous?

601
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:20,790
I'm not jealous.

602
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,270
Why should I be jealous?

603
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,830
So you're not worried at all?

604
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,880
Of course I'm not.

605
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,210
Don't forget

606
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,660
I learned Taekwondo.

607
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,430
If you dare to cheat on me,

608
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,780
I would...

609
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,070
I'm so scared

610
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,330
to see you act like this.

611
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,360
Take your dirty hands away.

612
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,010
You're so dirty today.

613
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,000
You're covered with mud.

614
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,060
It's already so dirty.

615
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,810
Let's wash together.

616
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,700
Let go of me!

617
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:53,900
Let go of me!

618
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,560
Hello, boss.

619
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,330
So this girl

620
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,580
is Gu Yancheng's girlfriend?

621
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,570
It seems that Gu Yancheng cares about her very much.

622
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,280
Gu Group

623
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,920
has also acknowledged the identity of her as Gu Yancheng's fiancee.

624
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,900
An ordinary girl?

625
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,310
Interesting.

626
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,170
What should I do next?

627
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,440
There's no rush.

628
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,210
Let me think about it.

629
00:34:59,560 --> 00:34:59,940
Yina.

630
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,070
Have a seat.

631
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,100
Yancheng.

632
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,300
I'm sorry to ask you out on a short notice.

633
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,520
I happened to pass by your company today,

634
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,090
so I wanted to have a meal with you.

635
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,850
Yuxuan is also here.

636
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:16,930
That's great.

637
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:18,700
Not at all.

638
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,680
Today,

639
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,520
he asked me to make sculpture with him.

640
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,580
I'm really sorry.

641
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,460
Do you

642
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,290
think I'm disturbing?

643
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,030
Of course not.

644
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,270
I also hoped you would come.

645
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,660
I just ordered

646
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,940
Yancheng's favorite dishes.

647
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,470
Yuxuan, what else do you want?

648
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,120
Take a look.

649
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,330
I think

650
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,340
although it's Yina who asked you out today,

651
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,290
we should thank her.

652
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,490
Why don't we

653
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,350
pay for this meal?

654
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,480
What do you think, Yancheng?

655
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,510
Yes.

656
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,990
You're so considerate.

657
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,630
Do you hear that, Yina?

658
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,750
Don't rush to pay today.

659
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:08,970
Yancheng.

660
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,040
You went to the art exhibition too?

661
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,020
Let me guess

662
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,820
which artists you like the most.

663
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,570
Aren't they Mr. Chunshan, an impressionist,

664
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,460
and Mr. Wen Qingtan, a minimalist?

665
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:22,650
Yes.

666
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,740
I like their works.

667
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,430
Although the style is simple,

668
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,530
but it's very meaningful.

669
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,400
Just eat.

670
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,730
Why are you talking about something hard to understand?

671
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,850
To show off your knowledge?

672
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:40,980
Sure enough.

673
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,300
Yancheng,

674
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,870
your taste hasn't changed.

675
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,130
I was worried I was wrong.

676
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,860
I guess I still know you well.

677
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,930
You're acting like this in front of someone else's girlfriend?

678
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,530
I don't know art,

679
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,000
but I know him better than you do.

680
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,180
Here, Yancheng.

681
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,200
Have this one.

682
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,330
Do you like it?

683
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,210
You want to defeat me with a piece of heart-shaped steak?

684
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,390
Yuxuan,

685
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,310
didn't you go to the art exhibition too?

686
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,510
Which artist do you like the most?

687
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,290
I don't like

688
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,630
anyone in particular.

689
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,390
I'm going to the restroom.

690
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,110
Yancheng, you guys chat.

691
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:47,690
Xun Yuxuan.

692
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,430
I've asked around.

693
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,220
You were just Yancheng's driver.

694
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,130
Yes.

695
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,120
But

696
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,020
isn't it too much for Miss Yina

697
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,280
to know about me?

698
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,390
I don't care about you.

699
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,000
I care that you are Yancheng's girlfriend.

700
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,010
I didn't expect that.

701
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,770
I didn't expect Yancheng changed a lot

702
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,230
because of you.

703
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,060
That's right.

704
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,660
People always change.

705
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:20,980
But I still believe

706
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,130
that a leopard cannot change its spots.

707
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,180
After all,

708
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,140
Yancheng has always liked

709
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,620
paintings of impressionism

710
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,180
and minimalism.

711
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,700
So it's hard to guarantee

712
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,640
his interest in someone as ordinary as you

713
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,070
is not just on the spur of the moment.
