00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,030
Gu Yancheng.

3
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,310
Are you possessed?

4
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,509
You pervert!

5
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,150
This is my first kiss.

6
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,710
You...

7
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,910
Thank you for marrying me.

8
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,910
You caught a cold?

9
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:37,910
Last night,

10
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,350
It's all because of you.

11
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,950
What did I do?

12
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,860
You don't remember anything?

13
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,550
I...

14
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,590
Miss.

15
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,630
I made ginger soup for you.

16
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,150
It's just a minor cold.

17
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,470
After drinking this,

18
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:56,630
you will feel better.

19
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,910
Thank you, Granny.

20
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,230
Thank you so much.

21
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,910
Take a sip to give her a demonstrate.

22
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,110
Why did she need demonstrate?

23
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,150
If you go on like this,

24
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,110
you won't find a wife.

25
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,590
Is there anything to do with drinking soup and getting married?

26
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,310
This is your first girlfriend, right?

27
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,590
Drink slowly.

28
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,950
Don't burn yourself.

29
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,180
Last night.

30
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,579
The workers were working on it.

31
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,670
Here, take a look.

32
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,990
The workers are making bricks.

33
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,149
This is brick.

34
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:16,550
Yes.

35
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,790
This way, please.

36
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,180
This is a brick.

37
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,710
There are already have patterns.

38
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,340
Sir, what is that?

39
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,980
This is a gold brick.

40
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,830
Golden brick?

41
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,670
We called it gold bricks

42
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,070
is because the bricks are hard.

43
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,670
When knocking,

44
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,790
there was a metal texture.

45
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,670
So it's called gold bricks.

46
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,430
But there's another way of saying it.

47
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,670
Because its production is very complicated.

48
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,670
There are more than 30 procedures.

49
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,590
It takes about two years

50
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,590
from production to completion

51
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,550
The brick was knocked witch sounds

52
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,310
and cut without holes.

53
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,060
So it looks very precious.

54
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,910
According to your description.

55
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,070
It's as good as gold.

56
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,310
It's also very precious.

57
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,190
So,

58
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,630
this gold brick used to be directly for the capital.

59
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,740
It was specially used

60
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,030
like the Imperial Palace, the Summer Palace.

61
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,510
I see.

62
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,510
The brick is good.

63
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,830
The molds used for bricks are also so beautiful.

64
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,670
Nowadays, workers are so creative.

65
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,870
Inherited traditional culture.

66
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,670
We didn't do enough.

67
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,110
Gu's sculpture

68
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,630
is our model.

69
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,790
They expand the sculpture culture.

70
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,150
What we did

71
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,790
are a long way off.

72
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,390
It's good for

73
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,750
a small factory like ours

74
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,420
can survive.

75
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,230
I'm really afraid

76
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,830
I can't hold on

77
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,510
and cut off this skill.

78
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,830
So now,

79
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,390
we can only make bricks

80
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,710
and make a living.

81
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,590
You're the one who deserves respect.

82
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,910
If we have project

83
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,190
can use this gold brick.

84
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,710
That's really good.

85
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,510
Would you like to cooperate with us?

86
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,670
That's great.

87
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,740
Here, Mr. Gu.

88
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:14,990
This way, please.

89
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,660
It seems

90
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,790
he's not just an evil capitalist.

91
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,590
He has a conscience.

92
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,110
Mr. Gu,

93
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,630
The workers are stepping on mud.

94
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,830
Sir, what is this?

95
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,030
This is where you step on mud before make bricks.

96
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,710
With feet?

97
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,710
Don’t you have machines?

98
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,390
You don’t know.

99
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,510
The bricks

100
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,990
made of machine

101
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,070
will have cracks.

102
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,390
Usually,

103
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,380
we need five hours barefoot work

104
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,310
can finished it.

105
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,310
Five hours.

106
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,430
If Mr. Gu and Miss Xun want to try,

107
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,870
you can go up and experience it.

108
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,830
Mr. Gu,

109
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,750
As the CEO of Gu Group,

110
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,990
shouldn't you check

111
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,110
the sculpture materials?

112
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:27,710
Sure.

113
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,030
Aren't you going to try?

114
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,390
Fine.

115
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,070
You...

116
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,550
Well...

117
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,030
Mr. Gu,

118
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,910
How is your memory?

119
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,110
I can recite modern Chinese dictionary at three.

120
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,750
I could recite stone sculpture art at five.

121
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,660
And I can explain high-class math at seven.

122
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,670
Do you still remember

123
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,740
what happened last night?

124
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,990
What?

125
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,670
Let's talk calmly

126
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,030
when you remember.

127
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,550
It's getting late.

128
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,150
Do you want to come in for dinner?

129
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,470
No, I'll see you tomorrow.

130
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:51,630
Yancheng.

131
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,550
What's wrong?

132
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,230
What happened

133
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,670
Last night?

134
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,870
last night.

135
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,990
Great!

136
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,430
Chairman,

137
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,860
your great grandson is on his way.

138
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:16,790
Okay.

139
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,670
You pervert.

140
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,470
This is my first kiss.

141
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:40,950
Mr. Gu,

142
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,830
how is your memory?

143
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,300
No way.

144
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,350
Good morning, Mr. Gu.

145
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,540
Did you not sleep well last night?

146
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,350
Mr. Gu.

147
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:03,990
Mr. Gu.

148
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,590
What?

149
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,310
What?

150
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,670
I should be asking you that.

151
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,510
You didn't sleep well? Did you have a nightmare?

152
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,710
Yes.

153
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,750
This is karma.

154
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,310
I wish you have nightmares every day.

155
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,430
Is this Gu's sculpture hall?

156
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,830
This is too big.

157
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,630
Go in.

158
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,710
These are just ordinary collection

159
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,390
of the Gu family.

160
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,670
The real treasures are in the Collection Pavilion.

161
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,590
Collection Pavilion?

162
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,060
Can I take a look?

163
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,030
No.

164
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:13,820
Why?

165
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,270
Only the Gu family

166
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,270
can enter the Collection Pavilion.

167
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,620
Boss,

168
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,870
you carved here?

169
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,110
Yes.

170
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,750
How does an artist like you

171
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,470
do your usually work?

172
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,470
Can you show me

173
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,790
Let me look up to you.

174
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,470
What's wrong?

175
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,470
Do you want to try?

176
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,590
I...

177
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:14,630
Sit down.

178
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,710
Take this.

179
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,990
Like a pen.

180
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,150
Huh?

181
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,430
My hands aren't trembling anymore.

182
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,990
Boss,

183
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,470
I suddenly remembered

184
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,030
Huixin asked me to go to the flower shop.

185
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,670
I'll pick you up later.

186
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,350
You mean your hand seems to be getting better

187
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,150
because of fairy.

188
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,350
How did she do that?

189
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,460
Nothing special.

190
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,950
I just let her try.

191
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,550
I didn't ask you here to tell you a story.

192
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,030
But to find a way.

193
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,070
Since Xun Yuxuan

194
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,460
is helpful to my recovery.

195
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,430
What should I do

196
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,750
to recover faster?

197
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,630
I have a bold idea.

198
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:13,830
Go ahead.

199
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,990
Take Xun Yuxuan with you all the time.

200
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,550
All the time.

201
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,350
It's like that now.

202
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,830
No, no, no.

203
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,310
Do you know portable battery?

204
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,430
You are this.

205
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,990
A phone that can run out of power at any time.

206
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,270
And Xun Yuxuan is like a portable battery.

207
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,620
Do you know

208
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,150
how to sue portable battery?

209
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,590
It's to keep it with you all the time

210
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,070
and keep it up day and night.

211
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,550
What did you mean?

212
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,110
You need to be together day and night.

213
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,660
Day and night?

214
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,270
Yes, day and night.

215
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,620
Don't be apart for a moment.

216
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,270
Sorry, let me try again.

217
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,109
Come in.

218
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,190
Mr. Gu,

219
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,900
I want to take a day off tomorrow.

220
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,590
Why?

221
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,110
It's personal.

222
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,230
I don't have to report everything.

223
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,940
Okay.

224
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,700
Thank you, boss.

225
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,430
But

226
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,390
according to the company rules,

227
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,860
you have to send me an email to apply for it.

228
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,180
Okay, I'll send it to you tonight.

229
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,070
Big companies have so many rules.

230
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,830
It's so troublesome to ask for leave.

231
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:12,780
Yuxuan,

232
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,790
I heard you're taking leave tomorrow.

233
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,710
What are you going to do?

234
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,950
To deliver flowers at Hongda Mall.

235
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,230
Can we have dinner

236
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,510
after work tomorrow?

237
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,830
Sure.

238
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,350
Huixin will come with me tomorrow. Let's go together.

239
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,550
Okay.

240
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,990
See you.

241
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,790
When will you send me the application?

242
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,380
Okay.

243
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,830
Let's have dinner after work.

244
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,990
Make an appointment for dinner?

245
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,710
Okay, Mr. Gu.

246
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,900
I'll send it to you right away.

247
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,710
Hello, Shao Jie.

248
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,150
I want all the schedule information of Xun Yuxuan tomorrow.

249
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,470
You're so nice today.

250
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,870
You know I haven't had breakfast?

251
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:11,910
Bai Bin.

252
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,470
Why are you here?

253
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,510
I'm done my work.

254
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,750
I'm here to wait for you for dinner.

255
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,430
Are we having breakfast, lunch

256
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,230
or dinner?

257
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,310
Decide by you.

258
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,510
Okay, wait for me.

259
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,590
I'll finish the basket first.

260
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,030
Have breakfast first.

261
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,470
Report!

262
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,340
There's a special situation.

263
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,660
How can you work without breakfast?

264
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,390
I'll carry it.

265
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,550
Forget it.

266
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,310
It's embarrassing.

267
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,150
We're colleagues.

268
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,470
It's okay.

269
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,950
Okay.

270
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,420
Help me first.

271
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,950
I'll finish it quickly and come over to help you.

272
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:04,990
Thank you.

273
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,910
Hey,

274
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,580
what's wrong with your free labor?

275
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,510
Free labor?

276
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,790
Mr. Bai happened to be here for business.

277
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,110
and asked us to have lunch together.

278
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,750
His business it so early.

279
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,110
It's just as you believe it.

280
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,030
What do you mean?

281
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,110
Silly.

282
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,950
Of course he like you.

283
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,500
What are you talking about?

284
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,110
It'll be awkward if he hears you.

285
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,510
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

286
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,270
Never mind

287
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,230
OK.

288
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,310
Let's not talk about this.

289
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,950
What's going on?

290
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,030
What?

291
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,100
Don't play dumb.

292
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,150
I heard that

293
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,230
you looked for the stones with Gu Yancheng

294
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,940
and you live together.

295
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,870
Nonsense.

296
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,310
Who told you that?

297
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,630
The assistant of Gu Yancheng.

298
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,270
Shao Jie.

299
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,590
Him?

300
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,260
He's a famous playboy in Gu's Group.

301
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,510
All he thinks all about these things

302
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,870
in his mind.

303
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,830
Don't believe him.

304
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,910
That's good.

305
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,670
I didn't dare to ask these days.

306
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,630
I was so worried.

307
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,430
Worried about what?

308
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,390
I think although

309
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,990
Gu Yancheng is rich and handsome.

310
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,870
He’s totally different

311
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,110
from us.

312
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,550
In dramas,

313
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,390
they fight among themsleves in the rich families

314
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,230
for property.

315
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,070
That's ridiculous.

316
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,100
Am I right?

317
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,670
I think you should watch less dramas.

318
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,060
Besides,

319
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,030
how could I fall in love with that narcissist?

320
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,790
But

321
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:52,060
I still think Mr. Bai is nice.

322
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,310
He's gentle and considerate.

323
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,550
He's the perfect boyfriend.

324
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,670
If I were you,

325
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,230
I would choose him as my boyfriend.

326
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:01,990
Huixin,

327
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,310
when can you

328
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,020
stop being so anthomaniac?

329
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,470
You don't understand.

330
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,300
Love needs to be kept fresh all the time.

331
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,750
You've been single all your life.

332
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,310
You should solve your problem first.

333
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,230
You can't keep your first kiss

334
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,470
when you are 26 years old, right?

335
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,500
Why can't anyone else kiss me?

336
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,150
Why was he?

337
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:49,910
It's Bai Bin.

338
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,110
Boss. Did you see that?

339
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,150
Work harder.

340
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,030
Otherwise, your power bank

341
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,110
will belong to someone else.

342
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,830
Boss,

343
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,150
I can see your jealousy across the screen.

344
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,270
Forget it.

345
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,230
Maybe I should leave.

346
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,550
My whole body is aching.

347
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,670
I'm so angry.

348
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,750
Eat more.

349
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,990
Bai Bin,

350
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,830
How long have you been in Gu Group?

351
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,070
For almost five years.

352
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,590
Five years?

353
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,470
You are so tolerant.

354
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,990
If he didn't give us a lot of money,

355
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,230
then I could have paid for the flower shop.

356
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,830
I couldn't even stay for five days.

357
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,830
It's not that hard actually.

358
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,860
That's because you're all-rounded,

359
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,180
so you think it's not difficult.

360
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,870
You need to teach me more in the future.

361
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,350
Okay?

362
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,110
Okay.

363
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,430
Cheers!

364
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,270
Thank you, master.

365
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,990
Oh my god.

366
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,750
What's going on? What's going on?

367
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,580
What's wrong?

368
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:08,900
Look.

369
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,390
Gu Muyu, the superstar,

370
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,870
is in love.

371
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,500
Gu Muyu?

372
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,700
Gu Yancheng's sister?

373
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:18,550
Yes.

374
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,580
My lady,

375
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,030
how can you laugh?

376
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,710
Do you think I'm done living?

377
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,060
You told me you went to a party with your friends.

378
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,750
Now?

379
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,550
You just made a headline for me.

380
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,430
I just want the truth now.

381
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,470
Are you in a relationship

382
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,740
with this man?

383
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,350
No.

384
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,990
That's good.

385
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,110
I'll arrange the company to issue a statement

386
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,950
to clarify it.

387
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,430
Amy,

388
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,990
I mean, not yet.

389
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,150
For now, I like him unilaterally.

390
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,670
He hasn't accepted me yet.

391
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,510
What is this?

392
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,780
Do you still know who you are?

393
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,110
As the president of Wei family,

394
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,710
you can't make any mistakes in your life.

395
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,190
Although Gu Muyu is the daughter of the Gu family,

396
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,900
we will never accept

397
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,510
that kind of identity.

398
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,910
Don't make a fuss.

399
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,710
It was just a coincidence.

400
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,910
By chance?

401
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,630
Then how would such news come out?

402
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,710
Don't worry.

403
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,350
I hate Gu Yancheng the most.

404
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,150
I can't have anything to do with his sister.

405
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,470
That's the best.

406
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,590
Remember your identity.

407
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,510
Where are you going?

408
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,030
You're awake.

409
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,150
This is the proposal and tender

410
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,550
for Yiyu Garden.

411
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,430
Take a look tomorrow.

412
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,350
Let's discuss it in a meeting.

413
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,110
It's getting late.

414
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,390
I have an appointment. I have to go.

415
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,710
Today's work isn't over yet.

416
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,710
What job?

417
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,350
I've done all my work today.

418
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,740
Xun Yuxuan.

419
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,150
Charger?

420
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,990
No, fairy.

421
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,900
Have you figured out how to spend time with her?

422
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,790
I want her to move to my flat.

423
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,470
Isn't it inappropriate?

424
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,350
You are both single.

425
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,750
How can she agree?

426
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,510
That's why I asked you to stay and think with me.

427
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,660
Boss.

428
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:17,630
I...

429
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,150
Can you let me go today?

430
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,270
They are all waiting for me.

431
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,470
You can choose to date now.

432
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,870
But all the bonuses for this month

433
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,270
will be cancelled.

434
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,550
Gu Yancheng,

435
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,060
If you keep doing this,

436
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,260
when can I have a girlfriend?

437
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,710
If they know about your love history,

438
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,030
they will leave sooner.

439
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,190
Fine.

440
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,710
I'm afraid of you.

441
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,190
Shouldn't he be sleeping

442
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,150
at this time?

443
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,070
Hello, Mr. Gu.

444
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,590
What can I do for you?

445
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,470
Hello, Mr. Gu.

446
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,470
What's wrong?

447
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,750
I'm not feeling well.

448
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,070
Come to my house.

449
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,150
Where is Uncle Du?

450
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,230
Ask Uncle Du to take you to the hospital.

451
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,550
He's not here.

452
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,230
I...

453
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,470
I...

454
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:30,790
Hello.

455
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,780
Hello, Mr. Gu.

456
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,830
Hello?

457
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,110
Mr. Gu.

458
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:42,780
Mr. Gu.

459
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,270
It's hot.

460
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,590
Gu Yancheng!

461
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,740
Gu Yancheng, don’t sleep.

462
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,390
Wake up.

463
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,910
Why is there no one at home?

464
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,750
You have a fever.

465
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,630
Can you walk now?

466
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,550
I'll take you to the hospital.

467
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,510
Gu Yancheng.

468
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:17,590
Gu Yancheng!

469
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,430
I'm not going.

470
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,590
I'm not going to the hospital.

471
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,630
Are you out of your mind?

472
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,510
You are so sick.

473
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,550
How can you not go to the hospital?

474
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,390
I have a medical kit at home.

475
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:31,350
No.

476
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,940
You have to go to the hospital now.

477
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,230
Let's go.

478
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,830
No.

479
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,830
Forget it. Where is your medicine box?

480
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,870
It's...

481
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,110
It's...

482
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,070
What did you say?

483
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,270
Forget it. I'll find it myself.

484
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,310
It's cold.

485
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,110
Cold.

486
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,550
So cold.

487
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,310
You're awake.

488
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,030
Feeling better?

489
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,420
What do you want?

490
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:20,949
What can I do?

491
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,469
I'm fine.

492
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,989
The fever has gone down.

493
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,030
Otherwise, I'll drag you to the hospital.

494
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,070
Thank you.

495
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,750
You called me so late last night.

496
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,710
You scared me.

497
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:38,989
By the way,

498
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:40,389
why are you alone in your family?

499
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,420
Where is Uncle Du?

500
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,550
Where is your personal doctor?

501
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,949
Do you know that a fever can kill people?

502
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,870
Even if you can't burn to death, you'll be a fool.

503
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,030
Stop laughing.

504
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,060
If it weren't for me, you would have died.

505
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,909
I stayed up all night to take care of you.

506
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:57,910
You have to give me a raise.

507
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,270
No problem.

508
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,550
But

509
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,830
I have a new task for you.

510
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,870
It sounds bad.

511
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,020
Go ahead.

512
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,830
Uncle Du went home to visit his family.

513
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,350
and will be away for a month.

514
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,550
Now I'm sick.

515
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,500
I may need you

516
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,990
to take care of me

517
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,990
as a life assistant,

518
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,630
And you need to take on some of the duties of him.

519
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,510
A life assistant?

520
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,550
But I seem to be just your driver.

521
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,350
But I told everyone that you were my assistant.

522
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,750
That's true.

523
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,150
But I'm a girl.

524
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,470
It's inconvenient.

525
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,030
Why don't you ask Bai Bin for help?

526
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,590
Do you think

527
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,260
you can handle the company

528
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,910
better than Bai Bin?

529
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,990
Well...

530
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:01,990
Of course.

531
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,510
I'm not forcing you.

532
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,830
It's a request.

533
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,510
Because I'm used to using people I trust.

534
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,470
You trust me?

535
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,580
You're from Gu Group.

536
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,630
Of course I trust you.

537
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,150
But

538
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,430
if you don't want to do it,

539
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,620
then forget it.

540
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,150
I'll be able to find someone else with three times the salary.

541
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,420
It's okay. You can go first.

542
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,470
I can do it myself. Don't worry about me.

543
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,700
I'll help you to the end.

544
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,190
Besides, it's only a month.

545
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,110
It's not that long.

546
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,660
Boss,

547
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,990
is the triple pay you just mentioned

548
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,470
still valid?

549
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,270
Of course.

550
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,270
Have a good rest first.

551
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,990
I'll get you something to eat.

552
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,590
The battered-body trick of the Thirty-Six Strategies.

553
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,350
For success,

554
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,790
a proper sacrifice is also necessary.

555
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,020
As the saying goes,

556
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,830
danger can never be overcome without taking risks.

557
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,710
Now you just need to catch a cold

558
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,190
you can take the chance to soften the kind fairy.

559
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,030
In this way,

560
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,070
The success rate of her agreeing to move in is very high.

561
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,070
No.

562
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,060
The battered-body trick needs to be real.

563
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,700
Fairy is not stupid.

564
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,430
If you just lie to her,

565
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,460
she'll know it right away.

566
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:45,830
How is it?

567
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,750
Are you going to

568
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,150
do the Yiyu Garden project or not?

569
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,350
I want to discuss it with Mr. Gu.

570
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,500
How about 8 p.m.?

571
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,100
No problem.

572
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,710
Nice.

573
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,870
What are you doing?

574
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,750
You scared me.

575
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,150
Why is there no sound when you walk?

576
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,270
Didn't I ask you

577
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,300
to have a rest up there?

578
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,430
Why did you come down?

579
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,550
I have work to do tonight.

580
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,430
I need to go out.

581
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,110
Boss, you're still working so hard.

582
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,750
People like us

583
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,070
will feel awkard.

584
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:16,620
Here.

585
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,620
Have a seat.

586
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,030
Here, boss.

587
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,910
Try our unique cooking.

588
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,470
It's good for your stomach.

589
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,190
It's specially designed

590
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,820
for the sick

591
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,990
and drunk intestines.

592
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,390
Try it.

593
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,310
Have a taste.

594
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,710
How is it? Is it good?

595
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:09,980
Not bad.

596
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,060
What do you mean?

597
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,350
That's quite good.

598
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,470
Let me tell you.

599
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,470
I only made this porridge for Old Xun,

600
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,470
but not for others.

601
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,270
You are the first one.

602
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,190
Go back and pack your things

603
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,590
and move to my house.

604
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:41,990
Okay.

605
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,110
You don't have to pick me up.

606
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,870
When I'm done,

607
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,030
I will ask Bai Bin to send me back.

608
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:46,910
Okay.

609
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:50,790
Boss,

610
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,550
I forgot to ask you.

611
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,750
which room

612
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,750
should I live in?

613
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,950
You...

614
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,470
can live in the guest room opposite mine.

615
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,470
The sunshine in that room is better.

616
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,030
It’ll be more comfortable.

617
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,070
Mr. Gu, please wait a moment.

618
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,540
Mr. Gu, sorry to keep you waiting.

619
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,110
Miss Hu is here too.

620
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,590
Mr. Wang has something to do. Sorry for the delay.

621
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,070
He asked me to chat with you first.
