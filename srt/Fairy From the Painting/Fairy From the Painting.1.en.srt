Could you excuse us?

171
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:43,990
Excuse me.

172
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,390
Thank you, Miss. Lin.

173
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,300
I'm here to ask...

174
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,840
Miss. Lin.

175
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,450
your magazine is running very well.

176
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,780
In less than a year,

177
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,680
you have interviewed almost all the business elites.

178
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,680
That's true.

179
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,250
So today I would like to ask

180
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,240
Mr. Gu to accept our interview in person.

181
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,280
I wonder whether Mr. Gu will give me this opportunity.

182
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,350
Thank you for your appreciation.

183
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,450
But you know,

184
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,980
I never do interviews.

185
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:26,880
Excuse me.

186
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,530
Miss. Lin.

187
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,390
Sorry. Sorry.

188
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
I'll talk to him.

189
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,530
Buck load of money in the account!

190
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,150
Today

191
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,390
except a little twists and turns,

192
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,440
everything else went well.

193
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,940
If this time a young man comes along,

194
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,380
we can have a romantic encounter.

195
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,940
Then I wouldn't want anything more.

196
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,560
-It's you! -It's you!

197
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,100
Yuxuan!

198
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,080
I'm fine.

199
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,320
Get up. Up!

200
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,850
Are you a bulldozer?

201
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,940
Are you taking revenge on me

202
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,810
for what I did to you on the road?

203
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,280
What happened?

204
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,650
He is that man!

205
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,900
Him!

206
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,030
Baibin, to the hospital.

207
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:26,660
Yes!

208
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,030
Mr. Gu, are you alright?

209
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:30,840
I'm fine.

210
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,660
The bacteria in his wound

211
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,580
will split at 20 times per second.

212
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,630
It's been over a minute.

213
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,640
Get someone here to bandage him.

214
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,440
Right away.

215
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,910
Is it necessary?

216
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,360
-A storm in a teacup. -Does it hurt?

217
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,620
It's the 21st century.

218
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,290
Is there still a living princess who can't stand a pea?

219
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,650
I'll pay some of your medical fees.

220
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,320
Yeah!

221
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,140
Pay?

222
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,680
Do you know how much you have to pay for this hand

223
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,010
if he wants to pursue it?

224
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,770
How much?

225
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,250
Hey, it's not a big deal.

226
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,350
Your knees give up now?

227
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,360
Based on my current salary,

228
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,990
I have to work from the Warring States period

229
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,810
to pay him back.

230
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,440
Where is my money and where is my romantic encounter?

231
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,360
-Things shouldn't go like this, right? -Let's go.

232
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,000
That, that much.

233
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,020
Do we have to sell our flower shop?

234
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,150
What?

235
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,820
This romantic encounter failed again?

236
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:28,830
What?

237
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,460
They said it's too easy, right?

238
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,980
Then you tell them

239
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,610
I will pay them whether they succeed or not,

240
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,030
and double.

241
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,850
What should I do?

242
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,090
When can I have a great-grandson?

243
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,260
Don't tell me...

244
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,240
They have to

245
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,130
look like the fairy in the painting of the Flying Fairy.

246
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,560
I don't want your compensation.

247
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,120
But here's my advice.

248
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,290
It's not easy to make money.

249
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,460
And it's even harder to play tricks.

250
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:15,590
Also,

251
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,300
get your original face back.

252
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,700
Boss, no. She, she is not.

253
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,280
What?

254
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,370
Your original face.

255
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,290
Original face?

256
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,460
Is he trying to

257
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,410
praise me in a not-obvious way?

258
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,970
What an educated man.

259
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,190
Right?

260
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,210
He didn’t ask you to pay his medical bills.

261
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,910
Nor did he send you back to the Warring States Period to work.

262
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,380
So hurt.

263
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,170
Let me blow on it.

264
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,440
Blow it.

265
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,480
Mr. Gu.

266
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,510
Go to the sculpture room.

267
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,650
[the Flying Fairy]

268
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,960
My name is Bai Ruoxi.

269
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,690
♫Finally♫

270
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,330
♫Lost over the centuries♫

271
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,190
Check this woman.

272
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,500
♫For you I do♫

273
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,340
Yes.

274
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,660
♫Seasons changed♫

275
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,140
♫Thoughts turned into roses♫

276
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,700
♫Over the island of time♫

277
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,500
♫To surround you♫

278
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,060
♫Because of you♫

279
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,180
♫Everything suddenly made sense♫

280
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,760
♫Four seasons and day and night♫

281
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,470
To Dr. Lin.

282
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,040
♫Through the barren river♫

283
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,790
♫You and I are fated♫

284
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,750
You mean

285
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,240
you saw

286
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,740
the girl who is in your dream

287
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,230
and looks like your family's ancestral statue.

288
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,950
Yes, and it's strange.

289
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,860
Whenever I see her in danger,

290
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,600
my body feels out of control.

291
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
When I came to my senses,

292
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,380
I was already in front of her.

293
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,330
And it seems that as soon as I meet her

294
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,270
there is a different feeling in my heart.

295
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,120
You mean

296
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,550
a sense of destiny that is not under your control?

297
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,870
It can't be destiny.

298
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,010
Why not?

299
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,180
Because

300
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,560
she must have been someone arranged by my grandpa.

301
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,050
Old Master.

302
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,780
The girl you sent didn't work.

303
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:51,890
What?

304
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,160
Didn't work?

305
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,560
Old Master, don't worry.

306
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,590
It's not a bad thing.

307
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,780
It was a girl who got the jump on the girl you sent

308
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,820
before she could come to him.

309
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,400
A girl?

310
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,650
Come.

311
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:04,830
Sit down.

312
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,830
Tell me everything.

313
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,830
Tell me in detail.

314
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,580
Let me tell you.

315
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,090
Yancheng is busy today.

316
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:13,970
Very busy.

317
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,650
It's all because of a girl.

318
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,400
A girl?

319
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,060
Witch girl?

320
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,840
Let me see.

321
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,360
Fairy.

322
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,420
Highly rated.

323
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,180
I've already named

324
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,990
my great-grandson.

325
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,560
I want to create a chance for my great-grandson

326
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,200
to come to this world.

327
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,390
Shao Jie

328
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,020
What's her job?

329
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,329
She seems to be a designated driver.

330
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,730
A...

331
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,300
Driver?

332
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,060
How about this?

333
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,270
Go get Bai Bin back from Yancheng.

334
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,339
Yes.

335
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:31,940
Fairy.

336
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,300
Driver?

337
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,470
Our florist is going to go bankrupt.

338
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,230
It's about to go out of business.

339

witch has great achievements.

510
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,550
Let's get to know each other again.

511
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,930
My name is Xun Yuxuan.

512
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,590
I've been hired by Mr. Gu Yaohua.

513
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,110
I have become your professional driver.

This statue is the Flying Fairy.

516
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,650
I won't bother you.

517
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,130
OK.

518
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,520
Grandpa Gu said

519
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,790
he'll pay me even if I don't drive.

520
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,140
Bye, Mr. Gu.

521
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,020
Why is she still so happy

522
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,420
even without coming near me?

523
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,170
Strange.

524
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,680
[The Flying Fairy]

525
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,610
I finally found you.
