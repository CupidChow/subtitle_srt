Yuxuan, you're here.

6
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,710
You changed your suit jacket?

00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,750
I just lent it to someone.

11
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,890
But your jacket is here.

21
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,530

27
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,620

31
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,290
It's not what you think.

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:21,840
Liar!

39
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,350
I'll stay away from other women.

40

41
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,980
You sound like I'm forcing you.

42

I'm willing to do that.

Go away!

61
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,130
Silly girl, you misunderstood me.

62
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,370
I didn't.

63
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,430


64
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:19,950

Let's go upstairs and have a drink.

76
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,650
No, my girlfriend is waiting for me.

77
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,390


78
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,260
Your jacket...

79

Keep it.

80

Why are you here?

85
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,320
I came to return your jacket.

86
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,390


87
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,450
I see.

88
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,750


89
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,740
You can leave now.

I have something to tell you.

Go ahead.

97
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,940
You want me to say it here?

98
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,230


99

105
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,810
to show you

108
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,800
that I'm no longer the little girl I used to be.

109
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,030
I want to tell you,

110
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,230


111
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,200
I like you.

112

113
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,680
I believed

114
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,870


115
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,820
you thought no one would be good enough for you.

116
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,070


117
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,280
But I didn't expect...

118
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,430


119
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,610
I didn't expect to come back

120
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,620


121
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,060


122
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,790
and hear that you've got a girlfriend.

123
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:18,830
Don't cross the line.

124
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,070


125
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,610
I already have a girlfriend.

126
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,710


127
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,670


128
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,420
I hope you understand.

129
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,910


130
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,730
Please leave now.

131

132
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,530
If my girlfriend misunderstands,

133
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,580
it'll take me a long time to explain things to her.

134
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,630


135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,720
Yancheng,

136
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,990


137
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,940
tell me what she has that I don't.

138
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,150


139
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,970
Why can't you give me

140
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,980


141
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,880
one last chance?

142
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,070


143
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,659
You never stood a chance,

144
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,870


145
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,150


146
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,100
so there's no such thing as one last chance.

147
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,260
Yancheng,

148
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,270


149
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,270


150
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,020
please leave.

151
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,280
Xun Yuxuan is the only woman I love.

152
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,430


153
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,830


154
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,460
That's it.

155
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,700
Are you telling me the truth?

156
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,870


157
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,240
What else do you want to hear?

158
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,670


159
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,200
Anyone would misunderstand.

160
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,310


161
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,470
It was late and the two of you

162
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,670


163
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,290
were in the same room.

164
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,470


165
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,710


166
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,580
You even changed your clothes.

167
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,790


168
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,560
Of course I'd get the wrong idea.

169
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,620
I swear,

170
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:25,830


171
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,230


172
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,100
it won't happen again.

173
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,070


174
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,770
Miss Xun, are you here for Mr. Gu?

175
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,270


176
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,210
Is he in the sculpture room?

177
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,310


178
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,260
He should be in the collection room now.

179
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,430


180
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,240
I'll take you there.

181
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,790
No need.

182
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,950


183
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,460
I know where it is. Go back to work.

184
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,470


185
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,010
Thank you.

187
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,790
It reminds you of why you started sculpting?

188
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,950


189
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,300
When did you come?

190
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,630


191
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,070


192
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,870
I just arrived.

193
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,790


194
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,540
Are you here for inspiration?

195
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:24,850
Yes.

196
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,310


197
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,440

200
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,110
it was because of this sculpture

201
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,450
that I became interested in sculpting.

202
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,670


203
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,710


204
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,710

206
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,100

207
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,590


208
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,370
how my ancestor made it so vivid.

209
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,710


210
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:43,690

212
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,400
he got the inspiration

213
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,370
after seeing a real fairy dance.

214
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,660


215
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,660
That person who gave your family

216
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,670


217
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,180
the painting of the Flying Fairy

218
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,430


219
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,460
must have seen

220
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,670


221
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,830


222
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,590
a real fairy too.

223
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,170
He could only draw so beautiful a fairy

224
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,390


225
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,750
after seeing one with his own eyes.

227
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,860


228
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,660
Although the portrait is exactly like the sculpture,

229
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,910


230
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,910
it's obvious

231
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,870


232
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,580
that the creators had totally different feelings for the fairy.

233
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,870


234
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,740
We don't know

235
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,310


236
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:10,990
how she felt about them thousands of years ago.

237

238
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,510
But,

239

240
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,090
thank God

241
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,390
for letting me meet my fairy.

as a reward.

You scared me.

Why didn't you tell me you were coming back?

256

257
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,990
Dad, where are the videos Mom left?

258

259

266
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,750
You got into the hospital because of dancing.

267

268
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,230
Why do you want to dance again?

Dad, I'm fine now.

you still can't dance.

Won't you stay for dinner?

370
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,350


371
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,060
Gu Yancheng's competition is approaching.

372
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,310


373
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,030
Time is running out.

374
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,230


375
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,250
I'll call you

376
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,260


377
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:02,930
before I come back next time.

378
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,950


379
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:03,350
Bye.

380
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,670


381
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,860
Now I know

382
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,310


383
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,480
why they say the father is the daughter's lover.

384
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,670


385
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,680
She dumped me after she got a boyfriend.

386
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,990


387
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,100


388
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,980
Honey,

389
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,390


390
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,010
I feel heartbroken.

391
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,020
That's right.

392
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,310


393
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,350


394
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,250
This is the theater where Mom used to dance.

395
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,310


396
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,110
Hello.

397
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,190
Hello?

398
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,390


399
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,460
How can I help you?

400
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,470


401
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,340
Are there any seats left for that performance?

402
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,550


403
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,150


404
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,020
Yeah. Which seating section would you like?

405
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,700
Any section that's left.

406
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,950


407
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,760
There are seats left in all sections.

408
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,830


409
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,190


410
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,080
Then I want a seat in the best section.

411
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,610
480 yuan.

412
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,750


413
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,070


414
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:28,790
It's done.

415
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:34,630
Thank you.

416
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,910


417
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,910
Someone actually paid to watch that dance drama.

418
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,030


419
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,900
It's so similar.

420
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,150


421
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:21,530
Great!

422
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,550


423
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,210
Great!

424
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,470

Great!

426
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,270


427
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,180
Thank you.

428
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,230


429
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,150


430
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,010
Audience can't enter the backstage.

431
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,010
I'm looking for someone.

432
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,070


433
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,390


434
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,330
Can you help me send a word in?

435
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,190


436
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,060
Who are you looking for?

437
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,150


438
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,800
The girl who danced on the stage.

439
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,270


440
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,190
You mean the dancer is a girl?

441
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,910


442
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,710
Isn't she?

443
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,070


444
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,890
You don't even know the gender.

445
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,350


446
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,100
I'll say it again.

447
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,530
Only staff can enter the backstage.

448
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,630


449
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,740
Please send a word for me.

450
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,750


451
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,599
I need to talk with him. It's urgent.

452
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,710


453
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,349


454
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,180
Sorry. Please leave.

455
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,390


456
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,270
Xun Yuxuan?

457
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,630


458
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,460
I know her. Let her in.

459
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,510


460
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,250
Okay.

461
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,920
How can a boy be so pretty?

462
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,230


463
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,470


464
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,250
And he knows me.

465
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,060


466
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,869
Xun Yuxuan,

467
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:20,990
what are you doing here?

468
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,230


469
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,180
You know me?

470
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,270


471
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,950


472
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,720
Don't you recognize me?

473
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,599
It's me, Gao Jiaqian.

474
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,750


475
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,990


476
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,840
Gao Jiaqian?

477
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,100
When you were young,

478
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,110


479
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,190
you came to this theater with your mother.

480
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,350


481
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,150


482
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:36,840
You forgot it all?

483
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,610
Hey.

484
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,670


485
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,230


486
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,070
Who are you?

487
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,230


488
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,080
She's rehearsing.

489
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,150


490
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,930
You can't be here.

491
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,470
Don't get me wrong.

492
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,630


493
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,940


494
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,720
My dad works in the theater.

495
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,790


496
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,590
Then what are you doing here?

497
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,190


498
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,130
I'm here to watch Ms. Fairy dance.

499
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,370
Ms. Fairy?

500
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,430


501
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,030


502
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,700
Are you talking about her?

503
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,870


504
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,850
You like dancing?

505
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,680
Yes, very much.

506
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,830


507
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,470


508
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,370
I can teach you. I know how to dance.

509
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,440
But Dad said

510
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,380


511
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,310


512
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,240
boys shouldn't learn to dance.

513
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,110


514
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,140
Your dad is wrong.

515
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,660


516
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,520
You can learn

517
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,460
whatever you like.

518
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,590


519
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,500


520
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,490
I want to dance on the stage

521
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,010
like Ms. Fairy.

522
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,230


523
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,190


524
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,080
No problem.

525
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,030


526
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,020
I'll ask my mom

527
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,230


528
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,010
to teach you.

529
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,870


530
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,750
She's your mother?

531
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,300
Yes.

532
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,550


533
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,940


534
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,870
After the accident,

535
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,470


536
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,250
I never met you again.

537
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,000
Do you dance now?

538
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,310


539
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,150


540
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,170
I stopped dancing

541
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,870


542
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,680
after the accident.

543
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,090
By the way,

544
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,190


545
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,470
the dance you just performed

546
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,550


547
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,140
was the one my mom danced back then?

548
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,190


549
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:31,920
Yes.

550
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,150


551
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,860


552
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,740
I couldn't forget

553
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,240
your mother's dance.

554
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,350


555
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,150


556
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,890
I didn't give up dancing after I grew up.

557
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,030


558
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,990
A few years ago, I found the choreographer of that dance

559
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,220


560
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:41,990
and had it redesigned.

561
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,470


562
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,270
I wanted to bring the dance of the fairy

563
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,910


564
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,690
back on stage.

565
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:47,770
But...

566
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:47,990


567
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:48,990


568
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:48,790
What's wrong?

569
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,350


570
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,110
Nothing.

571
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,780


572
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,850
Yuxuan, what brought you here?

573
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,790


574
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,610
You wanna talk with me?

575
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,750


576
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,490
I came to try my luck,

577
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,870


578
00:19:59,090 --> 00:19:59,740
but now,

579
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,460


580
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,160
I want you to teach me to dance.

581
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,070


582
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,870
But I need to do performances.

583
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,300


584
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:07,990
Forget it.

585
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,870


586
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,840
Anyway,

587
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,790


588
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,520
I don't know when I'll be on stage the next time.

589
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,990


590
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:12,790
I can teach you.

591
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,910


592
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:13,900
Besides,

593
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,470


594
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,260
I have plenty of time.

595
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,350


596
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,090
You can practice in our rehearsal room.

597
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,830


598
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,610
When do you want to start?

599
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,550


600
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,290
I want to start as soon as possible.

601
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,270


602
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,090
Are you sure?

603
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,550


604
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,300
You haven't danced for almost 20 years, right?

605
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,540


606
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,440
I'm sure.

607
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,630


608
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,620
What's more,

609
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,790


610
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,630
I hope I can learn it in half a month.

611
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,110


612
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,940
Half a month?

613
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,430


614
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,420
I know

615
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,430


616
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,220
it may be very difficult.

617
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,110


618
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,940
But when you danced just now,

619
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,310


620
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,070
you looked just like my mom.

621
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,060
You were very beautiful.

622
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,350


623
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,230
I'm very confident with you as my teacher.

624
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,580


625
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,310


626
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,160
You have that much faith in me?

627
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,830
Fine.

628
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:50,870


629
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,950


630
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,700
I'll make a plan for you.

631
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,060


632
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,840
The training

633
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,150


634
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,860
will start tomorrow.

635
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,430
OK.

636
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,590


637
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,350


638
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,190
I'll do my best.

639
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,550


640
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,560
Why are you still up?

641
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,010
Why did you come back so late?

642
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,070


643
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,500
Did something happen?

644
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,590


645
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,560
I went to see my dad.

646
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,590


647
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,420
How about

648
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,430


649
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,990


650
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,970
I bring him here tomorrow?

651
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,350


652
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,430
It's okay.

653
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,450
From what I know about him,

654
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,470


655
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,940
he wouldn't want to come.

656
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,950


657
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,970
Have you had dinner?

658
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,150


659
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,500
Yes.

660
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,790


661
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,820
It's a four-hour drive

662
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,980


663
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,390


664
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,120
from here to your dad's place.

665
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,620
I'll go with you next time.

666
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,990


667
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,510


668
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Okay.

669
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,250
You really dote on me.

670
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,230


671
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,580
What's wrong?

672
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,590


673
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,150
It hurts.

674
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,260


675
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,710


676
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,710
What's wrong? Are you okay?

677
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,860
Well...

678
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,990


679
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,990


680
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,020
It hurts to know you've just realized that.

681
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,070


682
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,000
You learned this sweet trick

683
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,670


684
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,530
from Shao Jie, right?

685
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:17,780
No.

686
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,110


687
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,330
Loving you taught me that.

688
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,590


689
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,190


690
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,200
Go to the sculpture museum with me tomorrow.

691
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:25,690
Sorry.

692
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:25,820


693
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,430
If you don't go,

694
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,510


695
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,390
I won't feel motivated.

696
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,470


697
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,510


698
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,230
I'll have no energy to carve.

699
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,240
This is the compensation.

700
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,550


701
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:40,870
Are you motivated now?

702
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,230


703
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,530
Close.

704
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,790


705
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,160
What about now?

706
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,340


707
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,270


708
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,160
That's more like it.

709
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,430


710
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,350
You have to know

711
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,940


712
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,850
this kiss is for the day after tomorrow.

713
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,870


714
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,260
I'm going to take a shower.

715
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,100


716
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,830
Gao Jiaqian.

717
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,830


718
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,710
Yuxuan.

719
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,490
What? You don't recognize me again?

720
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,710


721
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,100
You were a beautiful lady yesterday.

722
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,190


723
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,170
It's a handsome guy standing before me.

724
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,230


725
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,470
How can I recognize you?

726
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,750


727
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,120
As a professional dancer,

728
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,350


729
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,200
yesterday,

730
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,390


731
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,390
I was just a character.

732
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,590


733
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,870
Today

734
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:49,950


735
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,480
I am myself.

736
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,870


737
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,830
So professional.

738
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,830


739
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,130
The drawing you sent me. Come over.

740
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,260


741
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,760
I've seen the drawing you sent me.

742
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,060


743
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,370
So you want

744
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,430


745
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,120
to include the move of the fairy in the painting

746
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,270


747
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,820
in the dance.

748
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,190


749
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:12,730
Yes.

750
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:12,990


751
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,180
It also has to be a Dunhuang dance.

752
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,470


753
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,870
Is it hard?

754
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,070


755
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,690
Your mother

756
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,710


757
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,920
was good at Dunhuang dance.

758
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,270


759
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,360
Dunhuang dance is not difficult.

760
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,630


761
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,430


762
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,570
But

763
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,380
your ill painting skill

764
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,940


765
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,270
makes it challenging for me to imagine that move.

766
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,630


767
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,460
It's kind of impressionist.

768
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,540


769
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,870


770
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,700
Forget the details. The impression is the most important.

771
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,920
Although I'm not a good painter,

772
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,070


773
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,400
this move is actually very beautiful.

774
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,670


775
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,060
Just make do with it.

776
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,270


777
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:47,540
Well...

778
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:47,870


779
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,140
I can pay you more.

780
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,350


781
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,800
Not necessary.

782
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,070


783
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,950
You've paid me enough to teach you.

784
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,230


785
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,950
Then can I finish learning in half a month?

786
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,030


787
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,390


788
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,230
According to your requirements,

789
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,100
I designed a plan.

790
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,350


791
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,650
Half a month

792
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,790


793
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,630
probably will be enough.

794
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,750


795
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,360
But you have to train

796
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,430


797
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,250
for ten hours every day.

798
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,390


799
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,550


800
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,330
Can you do it?

801
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:20,380
No problem.

802
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,660


803
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,770
Okay, let's start now.

804
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,030


805
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,380
Okay.

806
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,620


807
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,290
Come.

808
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,550


809
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,180
Follow my rhythm

810
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,110


811
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,190


812
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,130
and do some moves.

813
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,000
Like this.

814
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,190


815
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,500
Follow my rhythm.

816
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,630


817
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,310
Five, six, seven, go.

818
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,350


819
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,550


820
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,310
One, two, three, four.

821
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,110


822
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,940
Five, six, seven, eight.

823
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,290
Raise your leg slowly. Hands go over.

824
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,550


825
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,790


826
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:58,710
One, two, three, four.

827
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,010
Stay there.

828
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,310


829
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,970
Stand still.

830
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,190


831
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,990


832
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,920
Keep your legs straight.

833
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,070


834
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,010
Straighten your knees.

835
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,620
Next move.

836
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,630


837
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,860
Five, six, seven, eight.

838
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,870


839
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:14,990
Yuxuan.

840
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,110


841
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,100
Hold your fingers this way.

842
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,110


843
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,910


844
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,750
Move in a circle.

845
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,150


846
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,820
Yes, look at your hands. Up.

847
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,460
Put your right hand before the chest. Pull it down.

848
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,750


849
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,740


850
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,560
Move your left hand a little higher.

851
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,470


852
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,460
Yes. Look that way.

853
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,670


854
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,760
Good. Look out.

855
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,750


856
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,810
Push your hips out as your eyes move.

857
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,830


858
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,930
The right hip. Push it out. Yes.

859
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,270


860
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,320
Next, raise your leg.

861
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,430


862
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,210
Raise your leg slowly. Hands over there.

863
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,780


864
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,740
Don't wobble.

865
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,710


866
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,690
Keep your legs straight.

867
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,920
Mom, I'm so tired.

868
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,990


869
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,650
I don't want to dance this anymore.

870
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,750


871
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,270


872
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,180
What do you want to learn?

873
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,620
I want to learn the dance you've been practicing.

874
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,750


875
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,290
You're too young.

876
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,300


877
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,420
You haven't even learned the basics.

878
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,620


879
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,460
After you grow up and master the basics,

880
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,470


881
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,470


882
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,350
you can learn it.

883
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,400
I want to watch you dance.

884
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,510


885
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:12,950


886
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,850
Mom,

887
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,740


888
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,560
can you perform the whole dance for me?

889
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,820
Sure.

890
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,030


891
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,700
A few days later,

892
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,710


893
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,980
I'll put on a nice dress

894
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,070


895
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:19,730
and dance for you, OK?

896
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,030


897
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,460
OK.

898
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,470


899
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,810
Let's go on practicing.

900
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,900


901
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,290
Remember how the hands move?

902
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,510


903
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,060


904
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:27,790
Draw a circle.

905
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,570
Put your right hand down.

906
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,630


907
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,670


908
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,800
Your wrist.

909
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,750


910
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,660
Yes, then...

911
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,210
Then, push your hips out.

912
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,070


913
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,210
Move your hips out.

914
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,310


915
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,570
Look to the right.

916
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,860


917
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,380
Yuxuan, are you okay?

918
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,550


919
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,330
I'm fine.

920
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,550


921
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,620
I just feel a little dizzy.

922
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,870


923
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,500
I think it's because you haven't danced in a long time.

924
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,740


925
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,840
Your body can't take

926
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,750


927
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,070


928
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,050
such tense training.

929
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,640
Looks like we have to change your training plan.

930
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,750


931
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,010
No.

932
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,270


933
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,540


934
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,500
I didn't fall because of that.

935
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:00,850
Then why did you fall?

936
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,910


937
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,990
Let's continue.

938
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,230


939
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,510


940
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,290
Come.

941
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,250
Yuxuan,

942
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,350


943
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,120
why don't we take a break?

944
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,270


945
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,340
It's okay. Time is ticking.

946
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,390


947
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,010
Okay.

948
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,380


949
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,350


950
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,210
Follow me.

951
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,310


952
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,130
Let's take it slow.

953
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,910


954
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,520
Let's start from where we stopped.

955
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,260


956
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,040
One, two, three, four.

957
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:33,310


958
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,300
Five, six, seven, eight.

959
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,490
One, two, three, four.

960
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,670


961
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,320
Hold still.

962
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,510


963
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:46,110


964
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:46,070
Five, six, seven, eight.

965
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:51,340
Here.

966
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,430


967
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,070


968
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,950
Put your hand here.

969
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,670


970
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,500
Okay.

971
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,310


972
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,130
Yes.

973
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:55,650
Stand still.

974
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:55,790


975
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,230
Turn your knees outwards.

976
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,270


977
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,520
Yes.

978
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,790


979
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,860
Every time you do this move,

980
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,870


981
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,930
you have to hold very still.

982
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,270


983
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,030


984
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,840
You need to build muscle memory.

985
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
Next.

986
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,350


987
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,830


988
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,660
Five, six, seven, go.

989
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,940
Squat.

990
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,870


991
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,350


992
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,090
Turn around.

993
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,740


994
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,570
The hand goes up.

995
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,760
The flower shop has been busy these days?

996
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,030


997
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,260
Why are you so tired?

998
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,310


999
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,540
Don't worry.

1000
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,550


1001
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,690
I'll take it as a workout.

1002
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,870


1003
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:57,910
Don't forget

1004
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,950


1005
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,540
I used to practice taekwondo.

1006
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,550


1007
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,410
But you can't exhaust yourself every day.

1008
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,510


1009
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,950
If you're short-handed,

1010
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,990


1011
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,350
hire someone new.

1012
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,550


1013
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,610
Don't worry.

1014
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,620


1015
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,420
I know what I'm doing.

1016
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,470


1017
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,560
I'll take a hot bath first.

1018
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,750


1019
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,150
Six, seven, eight.

1020
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,340


1021
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,340
One, two, three, four.

1022
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,590


1023
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,460
Five, six, seven, eight.

1024
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,710


1025
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,690
One, two, three, four.

1026
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,020


1027
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,070
Five, six, seven, eight.

1028
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,190


1029
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,230
One, two, three, four.

1030
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,470


1031
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,590


1032
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,560
Five, six, seven, eight.

1033
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,250
One, two, three, four.

1034
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,550


1035
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:04,360
Five, six, seven, eight.

1036
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,670


1037
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:09,310


1038
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,170
One, two, three, four.

1039
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:15,980
Good.

1040
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,260


1041
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,320
Stand straight.

1042
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,550


1043
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,220
Go.

1044
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,580


1045
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,220
One, two, three, four.

1046
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,430


1047
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,000
Five, six, seven, eight.

1048
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,300


1049
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,940
Raise your hands.

1050
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,270


1051
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,340
Keep it straight.

1052
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,550


1053
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,190
Okay.

1054
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:28,470


1055
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:29,820
A bit higher.

1056
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,910


1057
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,610
And your feet.

1058
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:31,750


1059
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,260
Five, six, seven, eight.

1061
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:37,560
Good.

1062
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:37,870


1063
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:40,630
Wait.

1064
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:40,790


1065
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,420
Move your hands like this.

1066
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,510


1067
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,390
Up.

1068
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,540


1069
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,690
Then down.

1070
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,950


1071
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:51,700
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1072
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:52,020


1073
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,820
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1074
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:57,030


1075
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,270


1076
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,890
Turn around.

1077
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,670
Keep your eyes on the front.

1078
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,030


1079
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,320
Again.

1080
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,430


1081
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,270
Like this.

1082
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,390


1083
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,660
Higher.

1084
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,150


1085
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,760
Lower your body.

1086
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,030


1087
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:17,990
Like this?

1088
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,270


1089
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:18,900
OK.

1090
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:18,980


1091
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:19,780
Five, six, seven.

1092
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,990


1093
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,650
Higher hands.

1094
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,870


1095
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,030
Yes.

00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,470


1097
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,130
Keep your body low.

1098
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,350


1099
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,750
OK.

1100
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,140


1101
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,910
-Do I do it right?
-Yeah.

1102
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:25,990


1103
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,970
Yuxuan, take a rest.

1104
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,190


1105
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,840
I need to answer the call.

1106
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,070


1107
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,590
Okay.

1108
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:31,990


1109
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,720
Something happened in the dance troupe?

1110
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,990


1111
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,440
What?

1112
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,670


1113
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,070


1114
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:50,690
I see.

1115
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,230
I'll be right there.

1116
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,540


1117
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,560
Jiaqian,

1118
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,870


1119
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,950
what happened?

1120
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,230


1121
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,300
Yuxuan, I have to go out for a while.

1122
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,670


1123
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,440
Practice by yourself.

1124
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,750


1125
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,470
I'll come back tonight

1126
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,540


1127
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,370
and make up the time for you, okay?

1128
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,790


1129
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,070
No problem. Go.

1130
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,390


1131
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:05,910
Okay.

1132
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,060


1133
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,220
Alright, Yuxuan.

1134
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,390


1135
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,410
That's all for today.

1136
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,510


1137
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,060
Okay, thank you.

1138
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,150


1139
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,150
Jiaqian, I gotta go.

1140
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,390


1141
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,490
Yuxuan.

1142
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,830


1143
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,270
You could have finished today's training earlier

1144
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,350


1145
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,290
if I hadn't left suddenly.

1146
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,550


1147
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,360
It's too late. Let me send you home.

1148
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,580


1149
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,230
Okay, let's go.

1150
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,470


1151
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,180
Okay.

1152
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,230


1153
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:03,660
Let's go.

1154
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,990


1155
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,600
Who is that man?

1156
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,790


1157
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:31,000
[Dear Mr. Gu]

1158
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:39,440
Yuxuan, your house is so luxurious.

1159
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:39,790


1160
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,620
Thank you

1161
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,750


1162
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,780
for sending me home at this hour.

1163
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,030


1164
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,469
It's okay.

1165
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,540


1166
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,260
Sorry for keeping you late.

1167
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,590


1168
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,230
I'll leave. See you tomorrow.

1169
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,590


1170
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,250
See you tomorrow.

1171
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:49,500


1172
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,389
See you tomorrow?

1173
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,580


1174
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,560
See you tomorrow.

1175
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,750


1176
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,300
Sorry.

1177
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,670


1178
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,590
I came back late and made you worry.

1179
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,830


1180
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,020
I didn't expect

1181
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,030


1182
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,290
you to call me so many times.

1183
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,470


1184
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,420
I said I'd go pick you up.

1185
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,470


1186
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,280
Why didn't you call me?

1187
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,350


1188
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,500
I'm not a kid.

1189
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,550


1190
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,970
You don't have to pick me up every day.

1191
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,150


1192
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,020
Who is the man sending you back?

1193
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,270


1194
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,530
He

1195
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,750


1196
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,220
is a friend of mine.

1197
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,270


1198
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,280
We knew each other since childhood.

1199
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,510


1200
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,880
Why did he send you back?

1201
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,190


1202
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,730
He asked me for help.

1203
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,950


1204
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,980
It was too late, so he sent me home.

1205
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,310


1206
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,000
Why? Are you jealous?

1207
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,270


1208
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,180
Jealous? How is that possible?

1209
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,430


1210
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,950
I'm better than him

1211
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,110


1212
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,260
in terms of appearance, body shape, and career.

1213
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,550


1214
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,210
Jealous? Impossible.

1215
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,350


1216
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,300
No one is comparable to you

1217
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,340


1218
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,970
in terms of being bossy and narcissistic.

1219
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,270


1220
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,010
But I like these traits of you.

1221
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180


1222
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,050
Am I being narcissistic?

1223
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,310


1224
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,080
I'm just telling the truth.

1225
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,190


1226
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,590
Yeah, you're telling the truth.

1227
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,710


1228
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,240
I'll go to work.

1229
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,510


1230
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:12,730
Kiss me.

1231
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,030


1232
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,300
I'm leaving.

1233
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,390


1234
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,360
Bye.

1235
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,660


1236
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,240
Bye.

1237
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,310


1238
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:25,500
Bye.

1239
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,590


1240
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,150
Morning, Ms. Lin.

1241
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,580


1242
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:40,950
Morning.

1243
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,310


1244
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,170
Work hard, everyone.

1245
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,340


1246
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,270
Ms. Lin smiled just now.

1247
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,630


1248
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,180
Looks like she's in a good mood today.

1249
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,430


1250
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,880
All right. Get back to work.

1251
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,190


1252
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,300
What do you want for lunch?

1253
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,350


1254
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,860
Japanese food.

1255
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,070


1256
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,950
Do I sound too cold?

1257
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,350


1258
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,430


1259
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,150
I wanna have Japanese food.

1260
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,190
No.

1261
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,510


1262
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,830


1263
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,490
Could you take me to have Japanese food, darling?

1264
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,810
No. It's disgusting.

1265
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,390


1266
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,200
Japanese food.

1267
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,830


1268
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,340
No problem.

1269
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:26,470


1270
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,310
That Japanese restaurant is a bit far from here.

1271
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,670


1272
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,270


1273
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,070
It'll take us too much time to get there.

1274
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,270
I have work on hand.

1275
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,510


1276
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,700
How about I order takeout in advance

1277
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,790


1278
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,040
and come to your office for lunch?

1279
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,300


1280
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,600
Just say that you need to have a word with me.

1281
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,150


1282
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:44,980
Okay.

1283
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,390


1284
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,090
It's the working hour.

1285
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,150


1286
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,240
You should not be texting.

1287
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,350


1288
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,810
Finish editing the photos for Blooming

1289
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,860


1290
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,790
before noon.

1291
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,870


1292
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,930
Ms. Lin is waiting.

1293
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,150


1294
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,380
I remember sending the edited photos to you yesterday,

1295
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,790


1296
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,550
but you haven't replied yet.

1297
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,910


1298
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,740
So it's my problem?

1299
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,790


1300
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,470
You should've reminded me

1301
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,550


1302
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,930
when I didn't reply to you.

1303
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,990


1304
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,460
You're a newbie.

1305
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,470


1306
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,770
How can you slack off

1307
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,830


1308
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,300
like this?

1309
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,630


1310
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,190
Show me the photos now.

1311
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,390


1312
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,730
What's wrong with the tone?

1313
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,780


1314
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,200
It's horrible.

1315
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,310


1316
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,810
It doesn't have the vibes of youth.

1317
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,830


1318
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,270
What's your advice?

1319
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,430


1320
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,720
Fine.

1321
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:52,950


1322
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,970
Prepare different versions of them.

1323
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,950


1324
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:55,930
We'll make a choice later.

1325
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,100


1326
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,130
OK.

1327
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:57,430


1328
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,580
Yao Yuan,

1329
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,590


1330
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,400
don't think you can claw your way up the corporate ladder

1331
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,470


1332
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,880
through a handsome face.

1333
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,110


1334
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:06,840
Understand?

1335
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:06,870


1336
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,030
What do you mean?

1337
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,150


1338
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,760
I mean what I said.

1339
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,910


1340
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,960
Focus on your work.

1341
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,110


1342
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,390
Don't be a gigolo who only knows sucking up to women.

1343
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,580


1344
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,290
Are you talking about me?

1345
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,390


1346
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,500
Ms. Lin.

1347
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:19,630


1348
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,020
Ms. Lin.

1349
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,310
