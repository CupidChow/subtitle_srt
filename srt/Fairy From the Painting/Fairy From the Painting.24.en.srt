is a very familiar sculptor to us.

Bye.

173
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,750
What's wrong?

174
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:09,920
I miss you.

175
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,330
It's only been an afternoon

176
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,380
and you miss me so much.

177
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,360
I miss you every minute and every moment

178
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,420
that I can't see you.

179
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:18,850
Me too.

180
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,250
I made some new dishes. Come and Try it.

181
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,710
I want to go to the company with you.

182
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,900
I have something to deal with in the company.

183
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,080
I can't accompany you.

184
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,610
You don't have to.

185
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,040
Don't forget that I'm your personal assistant.

186
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,290
It's a matter of course for me to follow you around.

187
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,280
But I can't focus on work

188
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,310
when you are around me.

189
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:01,980
Fine.

190
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,710
If you keep hugging me,

191
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,480
I'll be late.

192
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,890
You are the boss.

193
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:10,960
Who could accuse you of being late?

194
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,620
A boss should set an example.

195
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,860
Fine, you go.

196
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:20,920
Bye.

197
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,840
No way. I have to follow him.

198
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,490
Hello?

199
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:49,860
Okay.

200
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,870
Boss, Mr. Gu is here.

201
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,650
Don't let anyone disturb us.

202
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,560
Yes.

203
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,430
I'm honored

204
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,290
that you can take time out of your busy schedule to come here.

205
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,120
Mr. Bai, you can just say it.

206
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,350
Why waste time?

207
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,200
Are you still investigating

208
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,460
the Golden Sculpture Award and Henggu Water City?

209
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,830
So what if I a, or what if I'm not?

210
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,260
I just want to warn you

211
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,120
to stop wasting your energy.

212
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,610
Actually, there is a simpler solution.

213
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,710
I'm all ears.

214
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,570
The birthmark on your chest disappeared.

215
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,780
And after the disappearance,

216
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
your sense of danger to Yuxuan

217
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,420
was also gone.

218
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,290
Right?

219
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:09,490
Yes.

220
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,640
About you

221
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,830
and your ancestors

222
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,660
as well as the painting "Flying Fairy,"

223
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,370
Yu Xuan already told me.

224
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,380
I'm not sure.

225
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,970
if all these have anything to do with the disappearance of my birthmark.

226
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,700
But it doesn't affect me.

227
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,700
But that painting

228
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:24,560
is mine,

229
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,320
not yours.

230
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,280
This painting

231
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,710
is called the Flying Fairy.

232
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,600
You must find the girl in the painting

233
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,990
and protect her.

234
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,080
[The Flying Fairy]

235
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,680
Fairy?

236
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,650
You mean

237
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,710
you want me to return the painting to you?

238
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:19,950
Yes.

239
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,170
I'm afraid Mr. Bai's request

240
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,880
is more than that.

241
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,610
I also want Yuxuan.

242
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,740
Impossible.

243
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,850
The painting and Xun Yuxuan

244
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,750
were originally mine.

245
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,580
I just want what's mine back.

246
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,660
Xun Yuxuan doesn't belong to anyone.

247
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,290
She only belongs to me.

248
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,000
As long as you agree to these two requests,

249
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
you will be the winner of every gold award

250
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:51,860
of the Golden Sculpture Award in the future.

251
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,550
All our projects

252
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,710
can also work with you.

253
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,340
From the fifth time,

254
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,700
I'm the winner of every gold award.

255
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,150
In the name of Gu's sculpture,

256
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,180
there will be many companies

257
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,000
to ask for cooperation.

258
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,870
I have always had

259
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,550
all that you said.

260
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,420
Things are different now.

261
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,620
Now you have me.

262
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,290
You don't have to be so struggling.

263
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,970
You fall in love with her only because of this contract.

264
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,420
Falling in love with her is the consciousness of the contract

265
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,640
instead of your own.

266
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,220
Now you've lost your memory

267
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,400
and have forgotten her.

268
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:35,950
So,

269
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,800
you don't have to protect her anymore.

270
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,300
Gu Yancheng’s memory is back.

271
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:43,550
Boss,

272
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:44,880
I'm sorry.

273
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,390
Miss Xun insisted on coming in.

274
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,330
I couldn’t stop her.

275
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:51,590
You may leave.

276
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:52,640
Yes.

277
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,620
Although his birthmark has disappeared,

278
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,410
I can feel that

279
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,490
his love for me is real.

280
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,020
It's not at all what you said.

281
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,770
He remembered?

282
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:10,650
Yuxuan.

283
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,470
Don't be fooled by him.

284
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,760
Bai Bin,

285
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,660
do you believe

286
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,950
I can sense when she's in danger

287
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,480
because she is the girl in the painting?

288
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,720
Yes.

289
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,860
Although Xun Yuxuan looks like the girl in the painting,

290
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,710
a thousand years have passed.

291
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,630
Human lives are limited.

292
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,820
How could the woman in this painting and Xun Yuxuan

293
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,120
be the same person.

294
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,390
She is!

295
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,250
That girl...

296
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,480
should be Bai Ruoxi, right?

297
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,360
How do you know her name?

298
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,380
Because when I had the birthmark,

299
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,150
I often dreamed of her.

300
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,440
What else did you dream about?

301
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,700
But after I lost my memory,

302
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,920
I stopped dreaming of her.

303
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,220
Until recently,

304
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,150
I dreamed of her again.

305
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:01,840
She told me

306
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,570
she's not Xun Yuxuan.

307
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,380
So I'm more determined.

308
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,510
Bai Ruoxi

309
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,460
is not Xun Yuxuan.

310
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,730
She told me something when she left.

311
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,450
What?

312
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,270
Time is limited.

313
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,640
Why not cherish the one in front of you?

314
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,569
The woman in that painting

315
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,510
is Bai Ruoxi.

316
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,710
But Bai Ruoxi

317
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,140
is indeed not Xun Yuxuan.

318
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,400
I only love Xun Yuxuan.

319
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,060
She is not anyone's replacement.

320
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:44,780
But you,

321
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,910
you regard Xun Yuxuan as Bai Ruoxi's substitute.

322
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:48,990
Substitute?

323
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,180
Impossible.

324
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,090
That's impossible.

325
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,720
Xun Yuxuan is Bai Ruoxi.

326
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,400
I can't be wrong.

327
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,210
-Xun Yuxuan is Bai Ruoxi. -Leave him alone.

328
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,790
-Xun Yuxuan is Bai Ruoxi. -Let's go.

329
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,550
Xun Yuxuan is Bai Ruoxi.

330
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,910
Bai Ruoxi.

331
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,510
Am I really wrong?

332
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,820
Time is limited.

333
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,160
Why not cherish

334
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:50,870
the one in front of you?

335
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,890
Mr. Bai, please take a look.

336
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,780
This is a sculpture

337
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,710
we specially designed for Yiyu Garden.

338
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,000
It's also the promise Yancheng made to you.

339
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,860
Yancheng asked me to tell you

340
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,610
thank you very much, Mr. Bai,

341
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,700
for giving the project,

342
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:24,850
the Yiyu Garden,

343
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,190
to the Gu Group.

344
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,760
Gu Yancheng is indeed a genius in the sculpture world.

345
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,210
Although there is no fancy technique on the sculpture,

346
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,510
it is indeed suitable

347
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,690
to place in the center of the Yiyu Garden.

348
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,230
They bring out

349
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:44,950
the best in each other.

350
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,360
As long as Mr. Bai is satisfied.

351
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,090
We have something

352
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,020
for you.

353
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,650
This...

354
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,470
for me?

355
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,470
Yes.

356
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,550
This statue

357
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,770
was carved by our ancestor, Gu Xu,

358
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,640
and the heirloom of our family.

359
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,970
So, I can't give it to you.

360
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,890
But Yancheng carved this

361
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,470
for you.

362
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,770
Also...

363
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,510
This painting

364
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,990
should be returned to its owner.

365
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,830
This painting.

366
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,900
In order to keep a promise,

367
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,930
our Gu family has been protecting this for a thousand years.

368
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,490
Today,

369
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,730
I return your fairy to you.

370
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,710
You can protect her yourself.

371
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,790
So,

372
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,390
it was just my obsession all along.

373
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,630
Maybe,

374
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,640
I should let it go.

375
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,940
I got my gold award back,

376
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,240
Shouldn't you prepare a gift for me?

377
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:26,890
Gift?

378
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,080
You didn't prepare one?

379
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,200
Shouldn't you have expected me

380
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,970
to win the gold award this time?

381
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,630
Indeed not.

382
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,220
But since you brought it up,

383
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,860
I'll think about it.

384
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,290
No need.

385
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,710
I've thought about something.

386
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,170
Boss.

387
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,550
What's the rush?

388
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,090
Didn't I ask you to help me find Huixin

389
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,680
to get Yuxuan's finger size?

390
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,350
Your proposal

391
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,620
made us busy around.

392
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,570
You should give us

393
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,450
two big red packets.

394
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:06,710
Sure!

395
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,080
Honey.

396
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,110
Did you get it?

397
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,630
Don't rush me.

398
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,840
You're asking for a lot.

399
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,350
And can't let her sense something.

400
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,180
Yuxuan, as the saying goes,

401
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,790
"Big hands can grab more money, make more money, and keep more money."

402
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,450
How about we measure

403
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,860
our finger size?

404
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,080
Is that a thing?

405
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,520
Of course.

406
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,620
Even the slightest can make a big difference.

407
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,890
Really?

408
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,520
Wait here.

409
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,610
Give me your hand.

410
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,520
That one.

411
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:56,980
Open it.

412
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,190
Let's start with this one.

413
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:02,760
Okay.

414
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:11,980
Let's go.

415
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,140
Hello, ladies.

416
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,580
Please follow me to pick out the dresses.

417
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,610
What are we going to do?

418
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,570
Why do we have to change?

419
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,950
You'll know when you get there.

420
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,050
We have to take photos later.

421
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,380
Of course we have to dress beautifully.

422
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,400
Take photos?

423
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,390
Ladies, please come in.

424
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:29,410
OK.

425
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,240
Let's go. I'll take you there.

426
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,390
Huixin,

427
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,380
didn't you say you'd take me to take photos?

428
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,090
Why are we here?

429
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,660
What's the rush?

430
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,570
We'll start shooting soon.

431
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,090
I...

432
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,790
-What are you doing? -I think...

433
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,660
My stomach is funny.

434
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,890
Yuxuan, I need to go to the bathroom.

435
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,600
You go up first. Don't wait for me.

436
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,580
I need to the bathroom first.

437
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,880
What is she doing?

438
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,740
[Love]

439
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,360
[I didn't know you would come to me this day]

440
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,940
[My feelings for you are getting stronger]

441
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,940
[I know we're meant to be]

442
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,970
[Do you remember that you owe me a wish?]

443
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,990
[Today, I want to fulfill this wish]

444
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,960
[Gu Yancheng’s woman]

445
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,960
[Are you ready?]

446
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,760
Xun Yuxuan.

447
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:54,550
Xun Yuxuan.

448
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,180
It's an honor

449
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,100
to meet you,

450
00:28:58,910 --> 00:28:59,450
to know you,

451
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,130
and to fall in love with you.

452
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,900
For a long time,

453
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:05,830
my world

454
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,620
is nothing but endless loneliness.

455
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,410
Until I met you.

456
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,360
You've brought me so many unexpected colors in my life.

457
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,180
Our stories

458
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,520
are like the shining stars

459
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:20,840
that illuminated my night.

460
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,280
Do you remember what I told you?

461
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,360
You are my destiny.

462
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,950
My ideal in the mortal world.

463
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:31,960
Now,

464
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,350
I hope

465
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,390
this idea can become a reality.

466
00:29:59,250 --> 00:29:59,880
Marry me.

467
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,190
Honey.

468
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,560
Our daughter is getting married.

469
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,070
Did you see that?

470
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:22,970
You must be happy too.

471
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,950
Gu Yancheng.

472
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,980
Yuxuan will be all yours to protect.

473
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:45,930
Mr,

474
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,910
the flower...

475
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:47,930
Yes.

476
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,930
Move it to the left.

477
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,200
The one in your hand.

478
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,240
Yes.

479
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,120
A little to the left.

480
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,650
-Okay. -You must be thirsty.

481
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,120
Take a break if you're tired.

482
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,100
No.

483
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,880
My best friend is getting married.

484
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,180
I can't be more excited!

485
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,450
Not only that,

486
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,240
I'm going to make this wedding the most beautiful one.

487
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,100
So, I can take this opportunity to advertise our shop.

488
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,740
When people see that

489
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,590
our shop created such a beautiful setting for the Gu Group,

490
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,700
I'm sure we'll have lots of orders in the future.

491
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,690
My girlfriend is so good at business.

492
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,940
Looks like I don't have to work anymore.

493
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,820
No way.

494
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,180
I won't have an idle man in my house.

495
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,280
You better go back to work at the Gu Group.

496
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,190
Well.

497
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,920
How come you still have time to talk back to me?

498
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,030
What about the food and the wedding process?

499
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,790
Are they all set?

500
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,670
Hurry, check them again.

501
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,960
Yes, sir.

502
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,370
Little fairy?

503
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,570
Is she here already?

504
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,340
Like a kid.

505
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,390
Why don't you kiss me again on the right?

506
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,020
That flower.

507
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,740
Yes, a little to the left.

508
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,310
Yes.

509
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,970
My brother is getting married today.

510
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,950
Don't pull a long face.

511
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,820
Keep smiling, okay?

512
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,750
My gold award.

513
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,980
I believe

514
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,770
you can surpass my brother next time.

515
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,390
But today is his wedding day.

516
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,010
Mr. Wei, please.

517
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,250
Boss, are you really leaving?

518
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:48,820
I've made up my mind.

519
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,160
From now on,

520
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,390
the company is in your hands.

521
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,140
[Invitation]

522
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,239
I hope you can come

523
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,340
to our wedding.

524
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,630
No matter what happened before,

525
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,150
you'll always be our most valued friend.

526
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,930
Yuxuan's father.

527
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,960
From now on,

528
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,330
we are a family.

529
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,370
I'm old.

530
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:05,970
I often stay at home alone.

531
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,170
The biggest problem for a old man

532
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,480
is loneliness.

533
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,290
I really hope

534
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,190
they can give me a great grandchild as soon as possible.

535
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,360
How great

536
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,900
if we can take our great-grandchildren to play with us!

537
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,100
I'm not in a hurry for that.

538
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,640
They are just married.

539
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,340
They will need more time to be with each other.

540
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,010
Let nature take its course.

541
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,350
-Yeah. Let nature take its course. -Let nature take its course.

542
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,230
Please be quiet.

543
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,910
The wedding is about to begin.

544
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,890
Please take your seats.

545
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:34,990
I should go.

546
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,170
You sit.

547
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,020
Go.

548
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,710
Let's welcome the bride.

549
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,880
Our guests, please be seated.

550
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:48,890
Mr. Gu Yancheng,

551
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,210
are you willing to

552
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,420
marry Miss Xun Yuxuan?

553
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:56,980
I do.

554
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,980
Miss Xun Yuxuan,

555
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,460
are you willing to

556
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,710
marry Mr Gu Yancheng?

557
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,870
I do.

558
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,810
Since both of you are willing,

559
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,470
how about

560
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:16,760
you kissing her?

561
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,270
Kiss!

562
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,260
Kiss!

563
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,250
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

564
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,450
Kiss! Kiss!

565
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,800
Seeing them,

566
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,980
I'm already looking forward to our wedding.

567
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:49,670
Whose wedding?

568
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,420
Our wedding, of course.

569
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,510
You want to propose to me?

570
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,330
Let me tell you.

571
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,540
My requirements are high.

572
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,560
Okay.

573
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,730
I'll keep working hard.

574
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,410
Then do your best.

575
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,100
This is going to be a long probation period.

576
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,980
[Having searched for her hundreds and thousands of times in the crowd.]

577
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,980
[Suddenly look back,]

578
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,980
[and she is there in the dim light.]

579
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,470
So you're that photographer, Shadow  Magician.

580
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,680
Did I take a step closer

581
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,860
to your request?

582
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,240
Yes. A big step.

583
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:41,650
Let's go.

584
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,630
How I envy you.

585
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,230
Gu Yancheng.

586
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,240
You got her.

587
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,970
Time is limited.

588
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,880
Why not cherish the one in front of you.
