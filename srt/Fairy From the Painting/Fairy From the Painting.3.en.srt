1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:52,350
I don't dance.

3
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,310
You don't know how?

4
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,150
I'll teach you.

5
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,590
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

6
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,750
I'm not feeling well. I have to leave.

7
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,590
Mr. Gu, long time no see.

8
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,829
If it's convenient,

9
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,190
let's find a place to talk.

10
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,190
I really want to know

11
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,900
how much Mr. Gu

12
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,070
values our Yiyu Garden Project?

13
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,670
Go check on her.

14
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,350
Yes.

15
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,150
Here.

16
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,910
Yuxuan.

17
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,230
Bai Bin.

18
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,870
Why did you follow me?

19
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,310
You don't look well.

20
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,750
I'm a little worried.

21
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,110
How are you? Are you feeling better?

22
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,510
I just came out for some fresh air.

23
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,990
I'm much better.

24
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,910
If Gu Yancheng

25
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,230
is half as good as Bai Bin...

26
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,870
Forget it. Why am I thinking about him?

27
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,100
I suppose you're hungry?

28
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,710
Let's go eat.

29
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,310
I have been hearing nothing but praise about Mr. Gu from Mr. Wang.

30
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,990
Meeting you now, you do have an extraordinary aura indeed.

31
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,190
A toast to Mr. Gu.

32
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,630
Let's just get straight down to business.

33
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,829
I'm in a hurry.

34
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,190
About the Yiyu Garden Project,

35
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,260
Wei Group has contacted me.

36
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:59,579
They are very eager to collaborate.

37
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,830
I'm aware.

38
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,030
But I'm not worried.

39
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,710
Because Mr. Wang should be aware

40
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,870
that the status of Gu Group's sculpturing

41
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,510
is way beyond that of Wei Group's.

42
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,150
That's true.

43
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,270
Mr. Wei gave me

44
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,149
a hand-carved Eternal Harmonious Union sculpture.

45
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,430
But no matter how I looked at it,

46
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,550
the blade technique reminded me of Mr. Gu's past work.

47
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,550
From an artistic point of view,

48
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,110
I like Mr. Gu more,

49
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,830
especially your works.

50
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,390
But?

51
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,460
Mr. Gu is indeed smart.

52
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,310
But the base bid

53
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,420
is also an important factor for consideration.

54
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,620
Wei Group is ready to pay however much it takes

55
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,630
to win this project.

56
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,390
Naturally, I hope Mr. Gu

57
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,580
will also go all out.

58
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,230
Of course.

59
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,190
But Mr. Wang must also be a smart man.

60
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,590
Mr. Wang should understand

61
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,430
the additional value that the Gu brings

62
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,350
is far greater than Wei's.

63
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,190
Yes.

64
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,110
If Yiyu Garden

65
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,870
can be like Ancient City of Panlong,

66
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,190
in possession of Mr. Gu's sculptures,

67
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,910
the garden's value will definitely increase.

68
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,110
After all, the value of Mr. Gu's works will also increase if it's at a good location.

69
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,830
What do you think, Mr. Gu?

70
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,790
If you agree with Gu Group's terms,

71
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,950
why not?

72
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,180
What do you think, Mr. Wang?

73
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,230
Li.

74
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:48,909
Xuan.

75
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,870
You look different today.

76
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,590
Give me two bowls of clam rice noodles and ten grilled scallops.

77
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,430
Okay. Please have a seat.

78
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:55,990
Okay.

79
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,620
Have a seat.

80
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,030
Here, put this on.

81
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,910
If you get a cold, you'll have to apply for leave and have your pay deducted.

82
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,150
Thank you.

83
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,070
What if you catch a cold?

84
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,390
That will be quite nice.

85
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,950
It will be like a vacation.

86
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,510
Even you want a vacation?

87
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,110
It shows what a tyrant

88
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,710
Gu Yancheng usually is.

89
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,510
If Mr. Gu is a tyrant,

90
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,790
then what am I?

91
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,670
You are the Samaritan of our colleague circle,

92
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,350
always providing timely help.

93
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,510
You don't like Mr. Gu?

94
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,830
It's not a matter of like.

95
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,150
I work for him and he pays me.

96
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,870
It's just a transactional relationship.

97
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,630
Then, is there anything you want

98
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,710
or like?

99
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,940
I want to be like my dad.

100
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,510
A monthly salary of 200,000 yuan.

101
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,630
Your father is so capable.

102
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,030
My dad also wants a monthly salary of 200,000 yuan.

103
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,470
No harm in wishing.

104
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,500
Here comes the clam rice noodles.

105
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,910
Thank you, Li.

106
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,550
Eat it while it's hot.

107
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,150
Okay.

108
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,830
Okay, thank you.

109
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,190
Their clam rice noodles are extremely delicious.

110
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,430
Delicious, right?

111
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,590
By the way, Bai Bin,

112
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,870
where do you live?

113
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,630
My house may be a little far from yours.

114
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,790
Eat slowly.

115
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,380
Be careful, it's hot.

116
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,350
When we're done,

117
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,190
I'll take you home.

118
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,430
Bai Bin,

119
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,670
with your looks and personality,

120
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,710
in ancient times

121
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,140
we can at least exchange for 500 years of peace at the borders.

122
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,030
Thank you for your coat.

123
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,710
You must not catch a cold.

124
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,350
Okay.

125
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,470
See you tomorrow then. Bye.

126
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:40,990
Bye.

127
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,910
Who's that?

128
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,390
Me.

129
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,670
Mr. Gu?

130
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,660
Are you okay?

131
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,070
I'm fine.

132
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,230
You don't look well.

133
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,710
Don't tilt your head back.

134
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,790
It'll block your windpipe.

135
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,230
Just look straight ahead.

136
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,350
You sure know a lot.

137
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,750
Mr. Gu, what are you doing?

138
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,550
Are you trying to silence me?

139
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,830
Pardon me.

140
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:55,830
Mr. Gu,

141
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,180
please don't tell me you came all the way here in the middle of the night

142
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,910
just to take revenge on me?

143
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,750
You are really...

144
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,190
Who can it be at this hour?

145
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,060
Is this Xun Yuxuan's house?

146
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,020
Yes.

147
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,780
And you are?

148
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,070
Sorry, we're late.

149
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,030
Who told you to come?

150
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,150
Me.

151
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,750
Come in.

152
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,740
Enjoy.

153
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,830
I know you haven't had dinner.

154
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,430
I prepared it specially for you.

155
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,310
Oh my.

156
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,980
But I just had two bowls of wonton dumplings,

157
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,470
ten raw oysters,

158
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,110
a bowl of clam rice noodles and five grilled scallops.

159
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,860
Aren't you touched?

160
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,230
I can't touch the food.

161
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,550
Indeed, I can't touch the food.

162
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,590
I'm touched.

163
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,710
Very touched.

164
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,710
Then hurry and enjoy your meal.

165
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,110
You don't have to be polite.

166
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,110
Are you full?

167
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,060
Boss,

168
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,580
I'm really full.

169
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,070
That's good.

170
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,030
Boss,

171
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,710
do you need me to drive you home?

172
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,310
No.

173
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,670
You've had a long day.

174
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,750
I can go back by myself.

175
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,670
Thank you for your understanding.

176
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,470
Grandpa, what is this?

177
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,150
This is the Flying Fairy statue.

178
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,470
It was carved by our ancestors.

179
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,180
It's also the most precious treasure of our Gu family.

180
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,430
Can you carve this?

181
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,260
Me?

182
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,110
This statue

183
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,630
can't be carved

184
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,070
by just anyone.

185
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,910
I want to learn sculpturing too.

186
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,310
I can definitely carve such a fairy.

187
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,790
Can I still do it?

188
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,540
Yancheng.

189
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,230
What happened next

190
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,110
with the lady who resembled the one in your dreams?

191
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,630
Unconsciously,

192
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,390
I saved her several times, again.

193
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,190
Now, due to some reasons,

194
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,540
she became my employee.

195
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,830
Every time you saved her,

196
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,500
was it always involuntarily?

197
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,230
Doctor Lin,

198
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,030
I think you're right.

199
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,030
Maybe she is the one who is fated with me.

200
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,230
Maybe she is the one

201
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,110
our family has been looking for.

202
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,660
Maybe

203
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,510
she can make me...

204
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,150
Make you what?

205
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,470
I'm thinking.

206
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:04,790
Maybe

207
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,230
she is the one who can help me recover.

208
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,470
Yancheng.

209
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,020
A person who doesn't try to give himself a chance

210
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,310
will never have a chance.

211
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,750
I think

212
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,230
you can try to spend more time with her.

213
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,790
Maybe then you can overcome the obstacles in your heart.

214
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,110
Boss.

215
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,580
Why are you here?

216
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,550
And why didn't you let me follow you?

217
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,100
My employees to be able to ask less and do more.

218
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,350
Do you like hiking?

219
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,590
It's not bad.

220
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,070
Do you tire easily?

221
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,670
What's so tiring about hiking?

222
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,070
Then come pick me up at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

223
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,150
5 a.m.? So early?

224
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,270
What's wrong?

225
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,430
It's over 60 kilometers by car.

226
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,670
It still doesn't have to be so early.

227
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,660
When you become my boss,

228
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,470
you can do as you please.

229
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,470
Let's go.

230
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,590
Yes, boss.

231
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,870
What kind of attitude is that?

232
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,550
I'm simply in awe and delight

233
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,110
of how full of vigor

234
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,510
and energy

235
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,510
my boss is.

236
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,150
That's more like it.

237
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,750
Strange.

238
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,430
Why does he seem

239
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,150
somewhat attractive to me today?

240
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,230
Boss, here we are.

241
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,310
Get off.

242
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,870
What's wrong, boss?

243
00:17:59,310 --> 00:17:59,670
Let's go.

244
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,030
Where are we going?

245
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,070
Up the mountain.

246
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,710
Up the mountain?

247
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,510
Right now?

248
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,230
I haven't had breakfast.

249
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,590
Boss,

250
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,390
I've actually thought about it all night.

251
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,190
As your driver,

252
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,030
I don't think I need to go hiking with you.

253
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,590
How about I clean your car here?

254
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,110
You won't come along?

255
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,340
Do I have a choice?

256
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,590
If you don't come along, your pay will be deducted.

257
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,670
If you come along, you'll get a bonus.

258
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,190
How much?

259
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,670
A deduction of 500 yuan or a bonus three times your salary.

260
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,950
Okay. I'll go.

261
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,150
Let's hike.

262
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,670
Boss, wait for me.

263
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,270
Wait for me.

264
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,230
What on earth is in his bag?

265
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,590
Why is it so heavy?

266
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,270
Give me the water.

267
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,310
No wonder it's so heavy.

268
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,350
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

269
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,990
No.

270
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,030
It looks like

271
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,830
hiking with me

272
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,150
brings her great joy.

273
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:45,710
Let's go.

274
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,390
Wait for me.

275
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,630
Mr. Gu.

276
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,790
Have you finally found your conscience?

277
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,390
You promised to pay me three times my salary.

278
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,870
Not a penny less.

279
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,990
After all, you chose to take your bag from me.

280
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,430
Mr. Gu, slow down.

281
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,390
Wait for me.

282
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,430
I'm not going to pay you for carrying my bag.

283
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,350
Boss,

284
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,750
do you have any water left?

285
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,510
Yes.

286
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,710
I've finished my water.

287
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,070
Can you give me a bottle of yours?

288
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,540
No.

289
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:09,990
Why?

290
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,070
You're so petty.

291
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,350
I didn't plan to

292
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,550
hike with you today.

293
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,780
If I had known I was going to hike with you,

294
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,070
I would have brought more water myself.

295
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,270
But I can sell it to you.

296
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,950
Sell?

297
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,070
I carried the water on my back up here.

298
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,820
And you want me to buy it?

299
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,870
You don't have to.

300
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,230
Fine, I'll buy it.

301
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,350
How much?

302
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:35,310
50 yuan.

303
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,510
50 yuan?

304
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,710
Why don't you just rob me?

305
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,630
Don't you know the food sold on mountains

306
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,910
are much more expensive than usual?

307
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,310
Did I come here to play today?

308
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,750
I'm here to work with you.

309
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:51,750
Besides,

310
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,550
I carried the water for the first half of the way up here.

311
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,070
The water on the mountain is expensive

312
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,950
because of its transportation cost

313
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,270
and labor cost.

314
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,150
I brought the water.

315
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,270
Although the cost of one bottle of water is not high,

316
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,510
the transportation fee

317
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,140
and the service fee for you

318
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,230
are all paid by me.

319
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,590
In that case,

320
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,270
50 yuan a bottle is a good bargain.

321
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,180
You!

322
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,190
I'll buy one bottle!

323
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,150
You can deduct it from my salary!

324
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,710
I can't drink too fast.

325
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,710
This bottle of water is too expensive.

326
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,870
Mr. Gu,

327
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,150
what kind of stone

328
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,740
are you looking for today?

329
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,230
Do you have to come and find it yourself?

330
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,910
We've been busy all day.

331
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,110
But we've found nothing.

332
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,470
I heard that this mountain is a good place for a graveyard, according to geomancy.

333
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,830
Hikers can see the fen fire.

334
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,350
The fire that floats around the skeletons.

335
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,590
Wait.

336
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,510
Wait for me.

337
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,190
It's late. We should go back.

338
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,950
Finally, we can go home!

339
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,510
Boss,

340
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,550
did you hear some strange sounds?

341
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,830
What sounds?

342
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,110
The sounds made by the skeleton?

343
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,550
You are tough.

344
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,630
And you are afraid of those things?

345
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,990
I'm just kidding.

346
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,830
How could I be afraid of those things?

347
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,790
Hello?

348
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,190
Okay.

349
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:56,990
Okay.

350
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,550
Keep in touch.

351
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:00,870
Okay.

352
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,270
Boss! Boss!

353
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,350
Thank goodness.

354
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,470
No broken bones.

355
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,630
You should thank me.

356
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,110
You sent me here?

357
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,550
Thank you.

358
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,390
Wait.

359
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,070
I think I recall

360
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,710
it was you who dragged me down the mountain?

361
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,430
Wasn't that because of

362
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,750
you and that bug?

363
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,390
Who would have thought that the prominent Mr. Gu

364
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,270
is afraid of bugs?

365
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,270
I'm not afraid of insects.

366
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,350
It's because

367
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,710
they contain a lot of bacteria and dust.

368
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,630
I find them unhygienic.

369
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,460
Whatever. You always have your reasons anyway.

370
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,430
What a weirdo.

371
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,900
Who put the medicine on me?

372
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,830
Did you...

373
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,430
I...

374
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,310
Miss!

375
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:13,750
Miss!

376
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,830
Are you feeling better?

377
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,950
I dropped by to see you.

378
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,110
I'm much better. Thank you, Granny.

379
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:20,630
You're welcome.

380
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,230
We're having a barbecue outside.

381
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,190
You couple should join us and have fun.

382
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,870
Granny, you misunderstood.

383
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,190
We're not a couple.

384
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,300
I know.

385
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,380
You are in a relationship.

386
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,020
But you're not married yet.

387
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,590
Don't worry.

388
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,390
I may be old,

389
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,790
but I'm very open-minded.

390
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,350
Granny, we really are not together.

391
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,780
Young man,

392
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,030
a man should take the initiative.

393
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,430
Alright, I will leave you two alone.

394
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,510
I will wait for you outside.

395
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,670
Take good care of her.

396
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,990
It's deep in the night.

397
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,590
And we're two single people

398
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,150
in the middle of nowhere.

399
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,270
It's hard to avoid misunderstanding.

400
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,390
Why didn't you ask Granny to apply the medicine on me?

401
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,710
Mrs. Zhang said she has astigmatism and is shortsighted.

402
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,550
She was afraid she would make things worse.

403
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,230
So I...

404
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,630
Hurry up.

405
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,500
I will go out first.

406
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,550
Mr. Shao,

407
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,470
can you hurry up?

408
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,870
You're even weaker than Yuxuan.

409
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,070
I have been selling flowers for you for a whole day

410
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,980
with my pretty face.

411
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,390
I'm exhausted now.

412
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:24,820
You're slacking!

413
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,470
Whose number is this?

414
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,510
What's going on?

415
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,780
Hello, who is it?

416
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,630
It's me.

417
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,350
Gu Yancheng.

418
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,030
How dare you call me?

419
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,430
What important matter?

420
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,070
Do you know what I've been through today?

421
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,270
I sold my face and became a flower girl.

422
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,910
Is it because you have your fairy now

423
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,470
so you don't need your bro?

424
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,590
Alright. Fine, I owe you this one.

425
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,190
That's more like it.

426
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,870
Why is your phone number...

427
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,670
Something came up.

428
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,710
I can't go back today.

429
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,510
I'm staying here.

430
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,190
I called to tell you that

431
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,750
if anything happens in the company,

432
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,230
you can deal with it with Bai Bin first.

433
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,310
Got it.

434
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,830
Let me ask you something.

435
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:24,989
What?

436
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,830
Are you staying in the same room with your fairy?

437
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,030
Hello?

438
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,230
Hello?

439
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:33,790
Hello?

440
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,150
You don’t have to hang up if you don’t want to tell me.

441
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,150
Who did you say Gu Yancheng stays with?

442
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:40,949
Guess.

443
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,670
Could it be Yuxuan?

444
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,550
Hello, Old Master.

445
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,870
Yancheng went to Xiangshi with his fairy today

446
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,710
and stayed at Longyi Villa.

447
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:07,630
Really?

448
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,180
My grandson is so efficient.

449
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:19,910
Whose phone is this?

450
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,630
It's Mrs. Zhang's.

451
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,870
Where's your phone?

452
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,150
We should be glad we are fine.

453
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,230
Don't care too much about the phone.

454
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,310
I remembered.

455
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,630
Mr. Gu is afraid of bugs.

456
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,030
Back then,

457
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,590
you were really weak and helpless.

458
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,700
What? What weak?

459
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,150
Relax.

460
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,870
I won't tell a soul.

461
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,100
But on one condition.

462
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,060
Confidentiality fee.

463
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,990
It's fine if you don't want to pay me.

464
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,910
Then I have to borrow your phone.

465
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,670
I need to call my family.

466
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,230
The phone belongs to Mrs. Zhang.

467
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,550
If you want to use it,

468
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,910
ask her.

469
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,390
Petty. Miser!

470
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,110
Honey.

471
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,630
Cheers.

472
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,590
Cheers.

473
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,230
Come, have a seat.

474
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,390
Try our wild barbecue.

475
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,910
And the fruit wine.

476
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,500
It was brewed by my husband and me.

477
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,950
Thank you, Grandpa and Granny.

478
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,150
Granny, thank you for your phone.

479
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,340
By the way,

480
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,100
how did you fall from the mountain?

481
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,150
Did you encounter a serious accident?

482
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,150
Yes.

483
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,990
We encountered a very serious accident!

484
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,460
A very big bug!

485
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,030
Isn't it serious?

486
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,070
Well,

487
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,750
why are you couple here?

488
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,350
We're not a couple.

489
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,470
He is my boss.

490
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,500
A genius sculptor.

491
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,470
Me?

492
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,030
A worker he paid for.

493
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,670
Sculpturing?

494
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,870
It reminds me that

495
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,670
there is a carving shop

496
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,790
in Longyi Villa.

497
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,350
It's an ancestral craft.

498
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,270
They have ancestral craftsmanship too?

499
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,620
They often go up the mountain.

500
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,270
They seem to be doing that

501
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,830
brick sculpture.

502
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,100
Other than that,

503
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,750
I don't know.

504
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,830
What is brick sculpture?

505
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,910
Brick sculpture

506
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:42,070
is an important decoration in Chinese ancient buildings.

507
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,950
It takes effort not only to carve,

508
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,350
but also in the selection and baking of the bricks.

509
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,630
It seems that sculpture is not only a physical work,

510
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,270
but also a delicate work.

511
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,270
So taxing.

512
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,990
By the way, Granny,

513
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,750
can I borrow your phone?

514
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,510
My phone is broken too.

515
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,340
Of course.

516
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,980
Although,

517
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:07,790
well,

518
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,470
you have to drink with us.

519
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,190
No problem.

520
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:13,950
Come on.

521
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,470
Come. Let's eat.

522
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:19,910
Make yourself at home.

523
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,910
Don't just sit there.

524
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,710
We are in the mountain.

525
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,150
Miss,

526
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,830
you're very forthright.

527
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,230
Have another cup.

528
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,230
Thank you.

529
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,670
Why don't you drink?

530
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,700
Don't just drink.

531
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,580
Eat some.

532
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,990
You can't just have one drink.

533
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,270
Men shouldn't do this.

534
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:51,830
One more, one more.

535
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,150
Thank you, Grandpa.

536
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:58,710
Well,

537
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,470
take your time.

538
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,390
Have some more.

539
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,670
I'll bring you more dishes.

540
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,300
Come on, cheers.

541
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,670
Okay.

542
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,350
Cheers.

543
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:06,830
Cheers.

544
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:07,550
Cheers.

545
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,750
Drink.

546
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,070
Here, Mr. Gu.

547
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:19,990
Cheers.

548
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,350
Yes, cheers.

549
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,030
Come on, Grandpa.

550
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:22,590
Cheers.

551
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,910
OK, girl.

552
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:50,940
Gu Yancheng.

553
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,230
Gu Yancheng.

554
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,590
You can sleep here!

555
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,070
Will he catch a cold if he sleeps here?

556
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,390
You saved me after all.

557
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,710
Let me get you a blanket.

558
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:42,950
Mr.

559
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,070
Ruoxi,

560
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,910
there is a custom in my hometown.

561
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,100
A man should put a hairpin

562
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,830
on the woman he loves

563
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,950
and believe that she is the love of his life.

564
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,380
So then they can grow old together

565
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,700
and never be apart.

566
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,230
Would you like to wear this hairpin?

567
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:38,790
Ruoxi.

568
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,580
Then with what joy we shall renew our life, when I return safe from the dreadful strife.

569
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,870
But, if the Fates should decree death, my spirit will forever live with thee.

570
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,310
Gu Yancheng, what are you doing?

571
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,430
Not saying anything in the middle of the night,

572
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,540
who are you trying to scare?

573
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:17,750
What are you doing?

574
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,870
I didn't just leave you to sleep there.

575
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:19,910
Look.

576
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,270
I was bringing you a blanket.

577
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,270
Then with what joy we shall renew our life, when I return safe from the dreadful strife.

578
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:47,470
But, if the Fates should decree death, my spirit will forever live with thee.

579
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,110
Gu Yancheng,

580
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,350
are you possessed?
