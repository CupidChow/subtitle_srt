[Episode 22]

4
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,140
From now on,

5
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,810
I'm not only your driver,

6
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,280
but also your personal assistant.

7
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,690
Why do I not know about this?

8
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,620
Chairman Gu just decided that today.

9
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,690
He thinks Uncle Du

10
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,150
has too much work to do.

11
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,729
So he asked me to help him.

12
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:58,130
I don't need a personal assistant.

13
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:58,690
You can go.

14
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,220
Why?

15
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,940
It's not a comfortable job

16
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,710
for a woman.

17
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
I don't feel uncomfortable.

18
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,690
You're a man, what's there to be afraid of?

19
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,570
Are you afraid

20
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,870
that you can't bear the reality if I reject you?

21
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,780
All right, I'm going to cook.

22
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,300
Is there really no more response?

23
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,330
What's wrong?

24
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,720
I cut my hand.

25
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,180
I cut my hand.

26
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:40,930
Hand.

27
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't move.

28
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,980
Boss, I'm sorry.

29
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,010
I didn't mean to get hurt.

30
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,940
You're not suitable to be an assistant.

31
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:32,960
It's better not to do it.

32
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,030
Who said that?

33
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,850
Don't look down on me.

34
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,810
Listen.

35
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,350
This happened by accident.

36
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,960
Once you've tried my cooking,

37
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,310
you'll know how good I am.

38
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,810
Wait.

39
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,880
Let me cut the vegetables.

40
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:14,780
Here, boss.

41
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,530
Try it.

42
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,140
See if this assistant is qualified.

43
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,210
What do you think?

44
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,040
Not bad.

45
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,250
That's it?

46
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,510
Is it that hard to praise me?

47
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,010
What's in the pot?

48
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,580
This one?

49
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,320
This

50
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,630
is Xun family's very own stomach-nourishing porridge.

51
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,650
Let me get you a bowl.

52
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:52,900
I promise

53
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,590
this will shock your taste buds.

54
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,220
Try it.

55
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,070
It smells good.

56
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,980
It's especially good for hangovers

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,380
and people who just recovered

58
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,700
from serious illnesses.

59
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:23,970
Try it.

60
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,210
Isn't it good?

61
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,830
What's wrong?

62
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,150
Is it not good?

63
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,050
No.

64
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,159
It's not bad.

65
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,860
I thought something went wrong.

66
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,350
Boss,

67
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,250
do you think this porridge

68
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,670
tastes familiar?

69
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,560
It seems

70
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,240
a little familiar.

71
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,740
Really?

72
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:53,659
But

73
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,650
all porridge taste quite similar.

74
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,900
Besides,

75
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,460
I don't really like porridge.

76
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,370
I guess I read too much into it again.

77
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,860
I take back what I said.

78
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,930
Which part?

79
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,190
That you're not suitable to be an assistant.

80
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,020
Really?

81
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,020
Your cooking is qualified.

82
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,280
Is the wound too small

83
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,350
for him to sense my danger?

84
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,520
Should I try something more exaggerated?

85
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,370
But it's too dangerous

86
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,950
to get smashed by lights or hit by cars.

87
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,240
And he might still not recall anything while I'd be dead.

88
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,990
Then he will be so sad.

89
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,730
What should I do?

90
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,690
Right.

91
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,220
Why didn't I think of that?

92
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,150
Let's try again.

93
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,810
Why is this woman so careless?

94
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,010
Gu Yancheng.

95
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,170
Gu Yancheng, can you feel it?

96
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,550
Come here.

97
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:28,920
I knew it.

98
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,720
It still doesn't work.

99
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,130
He really doesn't feel me now.

100
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,360
The connection between us has really disappeared.

101
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,590
I'm really disheartened now.

102
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,280
I'm afraid he won't recall who I am anymore.

103
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,060
This situation

104
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,310
is a bit tough.

105
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,750
But there's still a way.

106
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,090
Tell us quickly.

107
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,280
Why are you being suspenseful? It's infuriating.

108
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:30,610
Yuxuan,

109
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,450
do you remember the time at the hotel

110
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,560
when you were the heroine that saved the man in distress?

111
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,190
Yes.

112
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,100
But

113
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,330
we can't lie to him again.

114
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,030
Of course not.

115
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,010
I remember.

116
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,570
Don't think too much.

117
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,090
Tell us quickly.

118
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,940
I'm creating suspense.

119
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,730
I think

120
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,520
you might as well be more forward

121
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,700
and kiss him.

122
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,890
Maybe under such strong stimulation,

123
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,150
he might recall everything.

124
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,460
Will it work?

125
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,370
You will also need me to help set things up.

126
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,930
We are at our wits' ends anyway.

127
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,290
We need to go hard or go home.

128
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,450
Don't worry. I'll arrange everything.

129
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,180
Shao Jie.

130
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,350
What is he up to?

131
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,140
Why are you here?

132
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,480
Where is Shao Jie?

133
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,690
Xun Yuxuan.

134
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:38,850
What are you doing?

135
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,140
Don't go.

136
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,520
Why are you doing this?

137
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,620
Because I want you to recall who I am sooner.

138
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,490
You know what?

139
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,290
Every time I see the distant look in your eyes,

140
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,860
I feel like my heart is suffocating.

141
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,210
Although I tell you

142
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,180
I'm not in a hurry,

143
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,150
to take your time,

144
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,590
that you'll eventually remember me.

145
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,380
But deep down, I really hope

146
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,770
you can remember me soon,

147
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,400
and hug me

148
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,480
and love me.

149
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,650
Gu Yancheng,

150
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,130
please.

151
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,900
Can you remember me?

152
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,710
I'm sorry.

153
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,940
Even if

154
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,420
there was something between us,

155
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,300
but right now

156
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,350
you're like a stranger to me.

157
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:02,780
I can't do it.

158
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
I won't let you go.

159
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,500
Did you

160
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,450
remember something?

161
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,380
Are you testing my determination?

162
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,330
You really

163
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,840
don't remember anything?

164
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,580
No.

165
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:34,840
Mr. Gu.

166
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,370
Why are you here?

167
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,080
We were so scared when we watched the news about you.

168
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,530
The Gu Group said you were recuperating

169
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,520
and not seeing anyone.

170
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,010
I didn't expect to see you here.

171
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,290
You are...

172
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,260
Mr. Gu,

173
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,090
we handed the Yiyu Garden Project

174
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,140
to Gu Group.

175
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,010
Now you're turning your back on us?

176
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,530
Besides,

177
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,260
you still owe our chairman

178
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,250
a sculpture.

179
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,830
And Mr. Bai will be here soon.

180
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,190
Why don't we have a meal together?

181
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,250
Yiyu Garden again?

182
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:06,770
I'm sorry.

183
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,910
The car headlights were too bright just now.

184
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:09,750
I couldn't see clearly.

185
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,440
How about this?

186
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,050
I have something to do today.

187
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,220
I'll visit you another day.

188
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,210
Okay.

189
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,720
What's wrong with Mr. Gu?

190
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,550
Strange.

191
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,630
Let's get down to business.

192
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,330
Let's go.

193
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,330
Yes, boss.

194
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,260
Yuxuan.

195
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,460
Bai Bin.

196
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,490
Why are you here?

197
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,920
I wanted to ask you

198
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,730
what happened.

199
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,300
Gu Yancheng.

200
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,170
He really forgot me.

201
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,990
He forgot everything about us.

202
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,120
Why would I have feelings for her?

203
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,610
Do these memories really belong to us?

204
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,370
No.

205
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,850
Remain logical.

206
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,050
Before any confirmation,

207
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,640
I must not become softhearted.

208
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,350
Postpone tonight's schedule.

209
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,280
I'll bear the consequences.

210
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,010
Okay, I'll go and make arrangements.

211
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,340
What happened

212
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
between you and Gu Yancheng?

213
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,920
His birthmark really disappeared.

214
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,260
Yuxuan,

215
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,340
I know this situation is very strange.

216
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,700
But you have to trust me.

217
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,730
I joined the Gu Group

218
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,950
to confirm this.

219
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:57,940
And I...

220
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,430
my ancestor

221
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,730
loved the person in the painting.

222
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,510
But for some reasons,

223
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,730
he couldn't protect her.

224
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,980
That's why he made such a decision.

225
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:16,650
Bai Bin.

226
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,330
I want to be alone for a while.

227
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,200
Yuxuan.

228
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,140
Please remember,

229
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,700
no matter when,

230
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,960
I'll always be behind you.

231
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,290
Xun Yuxuan.

232
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,030
Why are you still here?

233
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,650
Don't you want to go back?

234
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,800
Mr. Gu, do you remember me?

235
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,260
Mr. Bai,

236
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,710
I may have forgotten many things in the past,

237
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,830
but I still remember

238
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,570
things from half a month ago.

239
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,010
Then do you still remember

240
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,880
I've been your assistant for the past five years?

241
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,100
Assistant?

242
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,350
What's your purpose

243
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,050
in being my assistant?

244
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
My purpose is simple.

245
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,640
Because of Yuxuan.

246
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,390
Because of her?

247
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,740
You joined Gu Group as an assistant

248
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,240
to look for her?

249
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:17,530
Yes.

250
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,260
I don't care what your purpose is.

251
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,750
She's my assistant now.

252
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,020
She must come with me.

253
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,130
Mr. Gu.

254
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,630
Since you don't remember me,

255
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,630
I don't have to go back with you.

256
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,400
I became your assistant

257
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,170
to jog your memory.

258
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,340
From now on,

259
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,100
I won't bother you anymore.

260
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,880
Come back with me.

261
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,260
No.

262
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:56,530
Gu Yancheng.

263
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,790
I told you before that I like Xun Yuxuan.

264
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,070
I didn't fight with you

265
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,070
because she loves you.

266
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,980
Now that you've hurt her so bad,

267
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,920
I won't back down.

268
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,290
Since you've forgotten everything,

269
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,530
please leave for good.

270
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,360
From now on,

271
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,920
I will be by her side.

272
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,930
Why?

273
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,480
Why am I so unhappy?

274
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,150
Bai Bin,

275
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,940
be honest with me.

276
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,100
What you told me

277
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,490
about the Flying Fairy,

278
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,370
is it true?

279
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,010
Absolutely.

280
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,430
It's completely true.

281
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,380
Before,

282
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,180
I never believed it.

283
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,340
But now,

284
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,970
the truth is right in front of me.

285
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,880
So all this time,

286
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,780
it was unrequited love from my end.

287
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,600
Yuxuan,

288
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,770
what I said just now...

289
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,460
I know you were trying to get me out of a bind.

290
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,890
No.

291
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,190
I really meant what I said.

292
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,910
Truthfully.

293
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,920
I want to take care of you

294
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,380
and protect you.

295
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,280
Bai Bin, I'm tired.

296
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,900
I want to go back first.

297
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,410
Let me give you a ride.

298
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,100
No need.

299
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,290
I want to be alone.

300
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,570
Thank you.

301
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,300
It's been a thousand years.

302
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,630
I won't miss my chance again.

303
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
What's wrong with you?

304
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,710
You and Fairy...

305
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,000
Yuxuan.

306
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,310
Did you succeed?

307
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,920
I don't even remember her.

308
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,840
You're lying to yourself.

309
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,880
You can't carve now

310
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,240
because you still have muscle memory.

311
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,030
Don't you have

312
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,710
dopamine memory from your love with Yuxuan?

313
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,310
Gu Yancheng.

314
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,630
I told you before that I like Xun Yuxuan.

315
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,910
I didn't fight with you

316
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,840
because she loves you.

317
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,640
Now that you've hurt her so bad,

318
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,480
I won't back down.

319
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,080
Since you've forgotten everything,

320
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,120
please leave for good.

321
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:20,900
By the way,

322
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,310
how is the Yiyu Garden Project?

323
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,550
It's still ongoing.

324
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,030
But we signed the contract with them

325
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,010
on one condition.

326
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,990
You have to create a sculpture

327
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,130
dedicated solely to them.

328
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,950
Is this hard?

329
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:42,920
Five years ago,

330
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,700
you had a car accident.

331
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,980
You couldn't sculpt after the accident.

332
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,870
He probably knew this weakness

333
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,830
and is deliberately giving you a hard time.

334
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,700
But he didn't expect that you had Yuxuan.

335
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,090
With Yuxuan's help,

336
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,340
you could sculpt again.

337
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,690
You mean

338
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,250
Xun Yuxuan was the reason I could sculpt again?

339
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,460
After Yuxuan appeared,

340
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,510
your hand got better.

341
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,580
With her encouragement, you recovered quickly.

342
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:15,490
Hello?

343
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,370
Okay.

344
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,610

351
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,650
take a closer look.

352
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,940
Do I look the same as

353
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,310
the fairy you're sculpting?

I was your model here.

Is she

357
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,330
really related to the Flying Fairy?

358

I've figured it out.

before,

after you helped me regain my ability to sculpt.

461
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,900
And last week, I was able to sculpt

462
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,710
only because you were with me.

463
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:36,239
The fact is

464
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,630
you are the reason I can sculpt again.

465
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,230
And then?

466
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,510
I wanted to confirm

467
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,310
if the reason we were together

468
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,780
was because of love

469
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,659
or because of sculpting.

470
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:52,739
So,

471
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,409

So...

480
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,710
So your answer is to be with me

481
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,650
so you can sculpt?

482
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,690

Today, I'll tell you

488
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,680
a story about a fairy.

489
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,300
A thousand years ago,

490
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,380
this fairy

491
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,570
was the daughter of a general.

492
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:00,890
She has been good at dancing since she was young.

493
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,010
The Flying Fairy Dance she did when she was 16

494
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,270
became widely famous.

495
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,070
Is this about

496
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,420
the Flying Fairy?

497
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,210
That painting

498
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,230
was done by a man who admired her.

499
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,670
Did they get together?

500
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,080
For peace between the two countries,

501
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:25,740
she was conferred as a princess

502
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,590
for marriage with a foreigner

503
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,600
at the faraway country.

504
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,770
She must have been very sad.

505
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:34,760
No.

506
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,260
She's different from other women.

507
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:37,420
She volunteered.

508
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,230
She said

509
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,200
if her sacrifice

510
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,080
brought peace between the two countries,

511
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:46,900
then she had no resentment

512
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:48,840
and no regrets.

513
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,070
What about the man?

514
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,540
The man

515
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,620
has been looking for her,

516
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,070
hoping to protect her.

517
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,570
Did he find her?

518
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,290
No.

519
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,770
This man was seriously ill

520
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,660
and was dying.

521
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,450
So he painted her

522
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,010
and gave it to others,

523
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,790
hoping that someone else would find her

524
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:15,650
and protect her.

525
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,220
What a touching love story.

526
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,950
Two people who loved each other

527
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,430
were blatantly split apart.

528
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,580
Actually, this woman

529
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,490
has always treated him as a friend.

530
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,300
If the woman doesn't like him,

531
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,450
then why is this man still so hopelessly in love with her?

532
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,220
Falling in love with her

533
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,300
was just his own business.

534
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,480
It was also his own chaos.

535
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,490
He didn't need her response.

536
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,220
As long as she is happy,

537
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,580
he is content

538
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,660
with protecting and accompanying her from afar.

539
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,060
I like Gu Yancheng.

540
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,450
Why should I care

541
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,120
if he really likes me?

542
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,920
As long as he's doing well,

543
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,240
I'm happy.

544
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,470
What's wrong?

545
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,570
Bai Bin.

546
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,170
Thank you for your story.

547
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:25,970
This man

548
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,390
is not an ordinary man.

549
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,090
A thousand years ago, he fell into a deep sleep.

550
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,980
Once he woke up, the first thing on his mind

551
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,430
was to look for her.

552
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,080
It's been a thousand years.

553
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,140
I've finally found you,

554
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:50,760
Ruoxi.
