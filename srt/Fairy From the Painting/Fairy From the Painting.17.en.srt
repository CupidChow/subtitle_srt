00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,930
Thank you for the meal today, Mr. Gu.

6
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,550


7
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,430
You're welcome.

8
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,979
You are Yuxuan's friend.

9
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,110


10
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,860
That's what I should do.

11
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,190


12
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,270


13
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,100
By the way,

14
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,220


15
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,000
It'll be Muyu's birthday in a few days.

16
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,100


17
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,880
I want to invite you to play together.

18
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,070


19
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:04,840
Also,

20
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,870


21
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,680
Muyu specifically told me

22
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,660
to bring you along.

23
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,990


24
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,330
I never thought

25
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,340


26
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,260
I could become friends with a celebrity

27
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,420


28
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,510


29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,360
and attend her birthday party.

30
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,790


31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,560
That's the peak of my life.

32
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,340


33
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,500
I also heard that

34
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,780
there would be a beautiful painter who returned from overseas.

35
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,790


36
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,440
Yes.

37
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,710


38
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,950
Muyu invited many of her friends.

39
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,190


40
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,030


41
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,160
Waiter, a cup of green tea.

42
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,070


43
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,070
What are you doing?

44
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,590
To enlighten him.

45
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,670


46
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,380


47
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,300
This is the Longjing tea picked before Grain Rain. Please enjoy.

48
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,070


49
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:05,910
Thank you.

50
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,350


51
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,140
Mr. Gu.

52
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,180


53
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,030
Try this tea. Is it authentic?

54
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,070


55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,850
The buds are longer than the leaves

56
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,829


57
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,650
and are dark green.

58
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,230


59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,200
The soup is too dark.

60
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,390
It tastes a little bitter.

61
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,740


62
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,950


63
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,860
This is not good tea.

64
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,700
I didn't expect you

65
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,550


66
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,470


67
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,350
to know green tea so well.

68
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,670


69
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,579
But even the best green tea

70
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,900
is cool-natured.

71
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,710


72
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,540
It's not suitable for you, Mr. Gu.

73
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,350


74
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,370
You shouldn't drink too much.

75
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,750


76
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,550
Thank you for reminding me.

77
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,870


78
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,700
But

79
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,010
I prefer this intoxicating wine.

80
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,070


81
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,870


82
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,760
I never drink tea.

83
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,310


84
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,110
Have some more.

85
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,630


86
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,400
Huixin.

87
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,590


88
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,470
You're a master.

89
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,279
Men need to be reminded, you know.

90
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,990


91
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,630


92
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,480
Yuxuan.

93
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,830


94
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,580
Have some more.

95
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,630


96
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,530
Yuxuan, you've lost weight recently.

97
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,070


98
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,400
-Have some more. -So do you.

99
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,470


100
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,540


101
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,360
Cheers.

102
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,740


103
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,350
Cheers.

104
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,110


105
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,450
Cheers.

106
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,670


107
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,040
Cheers.

108
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,270


109
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,630


110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,480
Yao Yuan, what are you looking at?

111
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,360
Nothing.

112
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,510


113
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,640
Although you did save the day for the magazine last time,

114
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,710


115
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,990


116
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,900
you can't be absent-minded in the morning.

117
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,980
Be careful that Ms. Lin

118
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,990


119
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,030
asks you to pack up and leave.

120
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,150


121
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,830


122
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,450
I'll be fired

123
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,010
before packing up.

124
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,270


125
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,790


126
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,380
Good morning, Ms. Lin.

127
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,250
Ms. Lin, I have something to tell you.

128
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,310


129
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,070


130
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,850
Sister, let me help you. It's hot.

131
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,850
No need.

132
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,990


133
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,300


134
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,030
And don't call me that again.

135
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,540
Listen to me. Last Saturday...

136
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,500


137
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,820


138
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,690
I'm not interested

139
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,700
in anything other than work.

140
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,950


141
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,030
Ms. Lin.

142
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,270


143
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,470


144
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,510
I'll ask you to confirm

145
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,190


146
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,040
some articles in the next magazine.

147
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,580
They broke up so quickly?

148
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,710


149
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,390


150
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,220
Ms. Lin, I have work to report to you.

151
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,850
Yao Yuan, what are you doing here?

152
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,950


153
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:10,980
Man.

154
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,150


155
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,410
Are all our interns so idle?

156
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,590


157
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,510


158
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,360
Ms. Lin.

159
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,260
I'll arrange work for him later.

160
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,430


161
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,830


162
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,730
Yao Yuan,

163
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,190


164
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,070
Didn't you hear Ms. Lin say you were too idle?

165
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,670


166
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,680
Leave now.

167
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,230


168
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,130
Hurry up.

169
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,580
Ask Mr. Wu to send you

170
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,590


171
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,580
all the new photos.

172
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,630


173
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,550


174
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,320
Hurry up, go and edit them.

175
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,030


176
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,830
Yao Yuan, have you finished editing the photos?

177
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,420


178
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,050
Almost done.

179
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,990


180
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,880
Hurry up.

181
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,350


182
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,240
You have to go to the studio later.

183
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,780
There are two models filming there.

184
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,790


185
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,860
We're understaffed.

186

Okay.

00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,830


199
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,430

202
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,240
Let's Change the poses.

Lower.

204
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,430

206
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,100
This is good.

207
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,030


208

Hello.

213

214
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,200
Is there anything I can do for you?

215
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,429
What can you do?

216
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,740


217
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,330
Anything about photography.

00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,630


219
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,100
Take the broom and wait there.

220
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,430


221
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,900
After the shooting,

222
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,030


223
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,220

226
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,860
the place.

227
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,670


228
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,420
Cleaning?

229
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,060


230
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,830
What's the matter? Don't you want to do that?

231
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,510


232
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,380
Or what do you want to do?

233
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,510


234
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,310
You want to take photos?

237
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,960
I started from cleaning.

238
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,270


239
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,590


240
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,300
It's your chance.

241
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,910


242
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,690

Now, close-up shot.

250
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,070


251
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,830


252
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,600
Let's sprinkle petals.

253
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,410
Ready.

254
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,470


255
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,140
One, two, three.

256
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,150


257
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,010
One more.

258
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,060


259
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,220

261
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:28,960
One more.

262
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,110


263
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,900


264
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,750
Okay.

265
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,660
Okay.

266
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,110


267
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,460
Okay, take a rest.

268
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,670


269
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,150


270
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,110
Next one, get ready.

271
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,430


272
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,340
We still need the petals.

273
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,190


274
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,910
Your planner said

275
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,870


276
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,710
we needed to save props.

277
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,850
Pick them up with your hands.

278
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,030


279
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,650
What?

280
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,020


281
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,710


282
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,840
I said pick them up with your hands.

283
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,380
If you have any questions,

284
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,310


285
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,670


286
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,590
you can ask your planner.

287
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,360
Okay.

288
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,470


289
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,350
Hurry up.

290
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,270


291
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:00,880
Okay.

292
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:00,950


293
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,590


294
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,480
Hurry up.

295
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,670


296
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,560
Next group of models.

297
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,680
Hurry up.

298
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,830


299
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,710


300
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,620
OK. Stand still.

301
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,630


302
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,390
Give me a very good pose.

303
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,510


304
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,300
You.

305
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,910


306
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:20,680
Sprinkle the petals.

307
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,590


308
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,610
Me?

309
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,870


310
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,780
Yes. You.

311
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,250
When I say three,

312
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,430


313
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,430


314
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,260
sprinkle the petals.

315
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,910


316
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:30,660
Get ready.

317
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,080
Well.

318
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,420


319
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,710


320
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,540
How do I sprinkle these?

321
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,060


322
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,700
After all, I didn't sprinkle it just now.

323
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,230
I'm asking you to do it now.

324
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,430


325
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,940
The requirement is

326
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,020


327
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,990
to make it look beautiful.

328
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,190


329
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,830
Understand?

330
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,070


331
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,260
Okay.

332
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,350


333
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:42,910
Hurry up.

334
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,070


335
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,590
Okay, ready. Come on.

336
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,670


337
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,350


338
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,310
One, two, three.

339
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,510


340
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,400
What are you doing?

341
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,050
It's not beautiful at all.

342
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,190


343
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,990
Can you do your job well?

344
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,030


345
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,110


346
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,790
But...

347
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,030


348
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,670
Kevin.

349
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,020


350
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,980
The model hasn't arrived yet.

351
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,060
No one can find him.

352
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,340


353
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,910


354
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,650
Besides, we might not be able to shoot today.

355
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:06,670
What?

356
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:06,830


357
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,530
You want me to take photos of men and women tomorrow?

358
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,750


359
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,710


360
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,640
That's impossible.

361
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,390


362
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,270
I have other plans tomorrow.

363
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,350


364
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,210
What to do now?

365
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,280
The model you hired stood me up.

366
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,390


367
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,630


368
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,410
Why do you ask me what to do now?

369
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,970
It's me who hired the model,

370
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,990


371
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,230
but I've introduced him to you.

372
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,350


373
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,700
You have to be responsible for this.

374
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,830


375
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,830


376
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,770
You can't blame it on me, can you?

377
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,870


378
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,650
Why?

379
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,850
If that's the case,

380
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,030


381
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,180
let's stop filming today.

382
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,350


383
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,660
Fine.

384
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,710


385
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,760
Let's see who will lose more.

386
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,870


387
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,080
Let me tell you.

388
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,260


389
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,160
I'm an independent photographer,

390
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,270


391
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,050
not an employee of TB.

392
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,430


393
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,580
Ms. Lin can't blame me anyway.

394
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,670


395
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,060
Who do you think you are?

396
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,150


397
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:40,330
You...

398
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,950


399
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,950


400
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:57,780
Well...

401
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,710
Can I?

402
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,990


403
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,310


404
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,330
Are you the new

405
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,440
intern photographer?

406
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,630


407
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,000
Yes.

408
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,070


409
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,470


410
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,200
I'm the one who asked Gu Yancheng to save the day.

411
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,700


412
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,470
Hello, I'm Yao Yuan.

413
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,400
It's no bother.

414
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,670


415
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,140
No. I think your image

416
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,150


417
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,770
is not inferior to Gu Yancheng's.

418
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,910


419
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,140
You can be a male model.

420
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,150


421
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,780
If you're willing to help,

422
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,790


423
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,400
that's great.

424
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,550


425
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,450
Let me tell you.

426
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,550


427
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,820
if the shooting

428
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,750


429
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,150


430
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,240
can't go smoothly today,

431
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,280
the progress will be delayed.

432
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,550


433
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,590
And look!

434
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,910


435
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,230
The day is going to be wasted.

436
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,310


437
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,870


438
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,600
I guess Ms. Lin

439
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,550


440
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,100
will give me a lecture.

441
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,710


442
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,490
It's okay.

443
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,990


444
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,650
I'm just afraid that my colleagues will be scolded for nothing.

445
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,910


446
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,700
I do this for Ms. Lin

447
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,700


448
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,470
and the company.

449
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,630


450
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,470
This is what I should do.

451
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,350
You're right.

452
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,430


453
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,900
Kevin, come here.

454
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,910


455
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,470


456
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,240
Listen.

457
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,590


458
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,520
I've found the male model.

459
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,360
He?

460
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,590


461
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,870
Yes.

462
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,990


463
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,110


464
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,920
The theme of our magazine is Blooming.

465
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,870


466
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,800
His image and temperament

467
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,550


468
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,320
perfectly match.

469
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,470
I only shoot professional models.

470
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,710


471
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,060
So you mean

472
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,070


473
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,340
we can't do the job today?

474
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,500


475
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,830


476
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,780
Or I need to invite you tomorrow

477
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,230


478
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,010
when the model arrives.

479
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:29,650
It's inappropriate.

480
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:29,870


481
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,510
How about this?

482
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,710


483
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,540
I'll call Ms. Lin

484
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,670


485
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,960
and ask her to come to the scene and guide in person.

486
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,190


487
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,460


488
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,260
I guess if she comes,

489
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,750


490
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,610
our magazine will not

491
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,950


492
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,840
work with you anymore.

493
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,700
I can shoot.

494
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,710


495
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,610
But I have one condition.

496
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,670


497
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,420
Go ahead.

498
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,550


499
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,690
Let him try on the clothes first.

500
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,910


501
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,420
And then see

502
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,430


503
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,870
how well he fits in with our female models.

504
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,110


505
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,050
If it doesn't work,

506
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,220


507
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:05,960
I won't do it either.

510
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,660
I have good taste.

511
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,790


512
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,530
As long as you don't make trouble.

513
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,560
Let's get changed.

514
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,830


515
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,130
Okay.

516

522
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,930
this is the new copy of the magazine.

523
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,290
We've read it.

524

525
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,870

527
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:24,980
You can take a look.

If there are no other problems,

531

we'll print it.

552
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,300

00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,160
Okay.

556
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,500


557
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,190


558
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,120
Good.

559
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,270


560
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,160
Let me see.

561
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,590
Nice!

562
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,860


563
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,270


564
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,070
You're really handsome.

565
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,650
Right.

566
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,710


567
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,510


568
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,320
Kevin, the male model is here.

569
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,250
Okay.

570
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,510


571
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,920
Try the light first.

572
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,110


573
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,480
Go.

574
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,870


575
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,690
Sir, how can I...

576
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,700


577
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,980
Stand still. I'll try the light.

578
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,270


579
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:32,790
Okay.

580
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:32,830


581
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,150
The female model, come here.

582
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,260


583
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,310
Hurry up.

584
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,430


585
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,350


586
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,110
Hello.

587
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:48,700
Hello.

588
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,710


589
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,100
OK. Stand still.

590
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,270


591
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,310
Boy.

592
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,390


593
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,820
Don't be so stiff.

594
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,710


595
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:55,870


596
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:55,770
Here.

597
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,050
Hold the girl's waist with your right hand.

598
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,190


599
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,490
Okay.

600
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,750


601
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,210
Put it on. Put it on.

602
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,270


603
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,070


604
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,850
Okay, be natural.

605
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,350


606
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,970
Keep your heads closer.

607
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,350
OK. OK. Smile.

608
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,630


609
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,550
Three, two, one.

610
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,750


611
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,590
Ms. Lin, you're here.

612
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,350


613
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,330
You want to be a model

614
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,030


615
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,880
instead of a photographer now, right?

616
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,310


617
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,380
No, I don't like being a model. I'm here...

618
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,070


619
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,010
Well...

620
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,310


621
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,000
Ms. Lin,

622
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,530
please don't be angry.

623
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,710


624
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,470


625
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,280
Yao Yuan just wanted to help me.

626
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,340
Because our original male model

627
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,350


628
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,270
stood us up.

629
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,470


630
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,540
And Mr. Kevin

631
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,550


632
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,550
can't come tomorrow.

633
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,670


634
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,200
If Yao Yuan hadn't come,

635
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,470


636
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,840
our magazine would have suffered a huge loss.

637
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,150


638
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,470


639
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,320
But if you don't like it,

640
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,450
you can scold me.

641
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,630


642
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,690
Ms. Lin, it's true.

643
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,020


644
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,420
Although Yao Yuan

645
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,430


646
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,850
is not a professional model,

647
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,070


648
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,720
he has a great temperament.

649
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,910


650
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,870


651
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,690
And the photos are great.

652
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,710


653
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,540
You can take a look.

654
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,400
Our theme this time is Blooming.

655
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,460


656
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,960
It shows pure love,

657
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,910


658
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,300


659
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,140
not strong desires.

660
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,490
They don't have to get so close.

661
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,710


662
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,550
The sense of distance

663
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,670


664
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,089
is in line with our theme.

665
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,270


666
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:16,829
You're right.

667
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,950


668
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,420
Ms. Lin.

669
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,510


670
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,950


671
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,720
Alright, let's continue.

672
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,560
Keep working.

673
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,790


674
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,319
I'll take a look here.

675
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,589


676
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,510


677
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,410
Okay, let's continue.

678
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,150


679
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,090
Okay, let's start.

680
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,190


681
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,180
Girl, get closer.

682
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,190


683
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,150
Okay, make a natural expression.

684
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,940
Three, two, one.

685
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,950


686
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,320
Stop.

687
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,630


688
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,960
Distance.

689
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,110


690
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,590


691
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,370
Understand?

692
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,630


693
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,340
Got it.

694
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,540
Okay, ready.

695
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,590


696
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,470


697
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,510
Keep a distance.

698
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,070


699
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,150
Let's take another one.

700
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,470


701
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,550
Look at me. Make a natural expression.

702
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,710


703
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,730
Three, two, one.

704
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,770
OK. One more.

705
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,870


706
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,000
Girl, make a hand heart.

707
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,110


708
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,660


709
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,710
All right. Boy. Make a hand heart as well.

710
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,350


711
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,430
Okay. Very good.

712
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,470


713
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,410
Okay. Three, two, one.

714
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,510


715
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,190
Stop.

716
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,430


717
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,200
I want a pure feeling.

718
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,590


719
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,610
You two are so close.

720
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,910


721
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,690
Is it pure?

722
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,260
OK. Again. Be pure.

723
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,350


724
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,440
Girl, look at the boy.

725
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,550


726
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,900
Make eye contact.

727
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,950


728
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,160
OK. Three, two, one.

729
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,270


730
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,170
Stop.

731
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,350


732
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,670


733
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,680
The female model.

734
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,590


735
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,420
Why are you staring at him in that way?

736
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,430


737
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,190
Don't look at him.

738
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,950


739
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:30,680
Go on.

740
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,300
Okay, one more.

741
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,470


742
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,270
Girl, get close.

743
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,390


744
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,340
Okay.

745
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,070


746
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,180
Three, two...

747
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,190


748
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,870


749
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:38,770
Stop.

750
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,440
I have talked about the distance.

751
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,790


752
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,690
A little further apart.

753
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,830


754
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,310
Okay. A little further apart. Let's do it again.

755
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,470


756
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,230


757
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,050
One more.

758
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,750


759
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,840
Smile naturally.

760
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,350


761
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,220
OK. One more.

762
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,830


763
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,790
Three, two, one.

764
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,270


765
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,100
Good. Very good.

766
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,590


767
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,410
One more.

768
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,040
Stretch a little.

769
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,030


770
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,910


771
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,790
OK. Three, two, one.

772
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,720
It's done. Planner.

773
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,030


774
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,690
Ms. Lin, can we call it a day?

775
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,990


776

OK. Everyone.

777
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,550


778
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,990


779
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,850
Thank you for your hard work. Let's call it a day.

780
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,390
Come with me.

781
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,670


782
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,580
Got it.

783
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,910


784
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,670


785
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,470
Explain it.

786
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,390


787
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,120
I'll give you a chance.

788
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,500
Well,

789
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,660


790
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,370
Xun Yuxuan is my sister.

791
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,510


792
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,420
Sister.

793
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,590


794
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,910


795
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,750
You know a lot of sisters.

796
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,240
No.

797
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,510


798
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,280
I only have one sister.

799
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,430


800
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,200
I know that you and she have a misunderstanding

801
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,150


802
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,230


803
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,950
because of my brother-in-law,

804
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,280
so I didn't tell you.

805
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,710


806
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,530
Your elder sister?

807
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,670


808
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,650
Yes. Really.

809
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,870


810
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,270
She's my sister of the same father and mother.

811
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,540


812
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,960
The same father and mother?

813
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,070


814
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,260


815
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,140
But you have different last names.

816
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,710
I have my mother's last name.

817
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,950


818
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,040
Xun Yuxuan has my father's surname.

819
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,390


820
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,700
Really?

821
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,710


822
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,740


823
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,540
Do you believe me now?

824
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,150


825
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,790
I hope you'll be in my household register.

826
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,410
You suddenly changed the password and blocked me.

827
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,630


828
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,750
Aren't you worried that I have nowhere to live?

829
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,900


830
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,380
Of course.

831
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,660


832
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,790
I knew it.

833
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,150


834
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,190


835
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,080
The lock is open.

836
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,070


837
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:22,950
It's my birthday.

838
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,630


839
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:36,300
Wanning.

840
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,110


841
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,950
I made you angry these days.

842
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,310


843
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,050
I'll cook something to reward you.

844
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,340
He's gone?

845
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,350


846
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,320
He's gone?

847
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,710


848
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:55,810
You're awake.

849
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,030


850
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,430


851
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,400
Next,

852
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,170
please enjoy a hearty breakfast.

853
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,390


854
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,550


855
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,180
Honey, you worked hard last night.

856
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,110
Eat up.

857
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,300


858
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,060


859
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,770
Or you'll be late for work.

860
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,690
Can we make it public?

861
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,710


862
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,080
No.

863
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,390


864
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,540
Work and private life should be separate.

865
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,870


866
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,020
Eat up.

867
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,150


868
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:46,770
Okay.

869
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:46,830


870
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,710


871
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,480
Yuxuan.

872
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:27,950
Haven't you finished yet?

873
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,180


874
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,530
Wait a little longer.

875
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,750


876
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,110


877
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,020
You said that two hours ago.

878
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,630


879
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,490
Is everything okay?

880
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,470
Just wait a little longer.

881
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,710


882
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:36,940
Okay.

883
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:36,950


884
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,710
Coming.

885
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:42,870


886
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,800
You look so beautiful today.

887
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,070


888
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,770
But you getting all dressed up like this

889
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,870


890
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,740
makes me confused.

891
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,670


892
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,890
Of course I have my purpose for dressing like this.

893
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,950


894
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,970
You're too early.

895
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,150


896
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,400
The guests are not here yet.

897
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,710


898
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,580
Muyu, happy birthday.

899
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,790


900
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,220
Happy birthday.

901
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,420


902
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,520
I've put the gift at home.

903
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,740


904
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,770
I was worried you wouldn't be able to come.

905
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,190


906
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,710
I'm so happy now.

907
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,950


908
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,840
Sister-in-law.

909
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,870


910
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,220
You look so beautiful.

911
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,390


912
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,870


913
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,550
You are trying to compare me with you!

914
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,900
Of course not.

915
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,910


916
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,600
You're definitely the shiniest.

917
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,710


918
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,900
And I dress like this

919
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,950


920
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,470


921
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,460
to match

922
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,170
your perfect brother.

923

924
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,000
Stop showing affection in public

925
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,180


926
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,640
I need to eat cake later.

927
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,910


928
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,230


929
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:50,990
Muyu.

930
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:52,560
Huixin.

931
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,830


932
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,890
What are you talking about?

933
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:53,910


934
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,030
I'm single.

935
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,110


936
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,220
What can I talk to them about?

937
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,510


938
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,100
To witness their public display of affection, of course.

939
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,310


940
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,100
Wait for me.

941
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,390


942
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,680
You're finally here.

943
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,910


944
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Please be quiet.

945
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,030


946
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,540
Let me introduce.

947
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,630


948
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,530
This is Du Yina.

949
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,790


950
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,360
My best friend since childhood.

951
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,550


952
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,990
She's having a tour exhibition across the country.

953
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,190


954
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,660
She's a beautiful artist.

955
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,670


956
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,120
You're dressed so beautifully too.

957
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,270


958
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,240
Even as a celebrity, I'm going to lose.

959
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,180


960
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,160
You still like to joke.

961
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,390


962
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,730
Happy birthday.

963
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,070


964
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,460
Thank you.

965
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,750


966
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,070
To express my gratitude,

967

968
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,460
I have a gift for you.

969
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,670


970
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,010
I have good news for you.

971
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,110


972
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,470


973
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,670
This beautiful painter is single.

974
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,900


975
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,970
You guys can pursue her.

976
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,940
Muyu.

977
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,230


978
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,770
You really like to make fun of me, right?

979
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,790


980
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,040
Alright, let me introduce my sister-in-law to you.

981
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,190


982
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,080
Brother Yancheng. Yuxuan.

983
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,230


984
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,080
We meet again.

985
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,390


986
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,240
You know Yuxuan?

987
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,510


988
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,390


989
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:17,110
Of course.

990
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,270
We met several times

991
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,350


992
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,560
because of Yancheng.

993
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,910


994
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,990
Is this the angelic bitch you mentioned?

995
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,070


996
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,050
I have something to do.

997
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,310


998
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,040
Take your time.

999
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,350


1000
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,100


1001
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,950
Mr. Gu.

1002
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:48,960
Long time no see.

1003
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,190


1004
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,000
Wait for me.

1005
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,350


1006
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,340
Miss Du Yina.

1007
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,460


1008
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,490
You are so perfect,

1009
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,540


1010
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,340
why didn't you find a handsome boyfriend

1011
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,350


1012
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,470


1013
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,160
when you were abroad?

1014
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:02,750
I didn't

1015
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,870


1016
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,640
because I've had someone I like since I was a kid.

1017
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,910


1018
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,110


1019
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,760
What are you talking about?

1020
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,270
I know even if you don't tell me.

1021
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,470


1022
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,230
You must be talking about men, right?

1023
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,470


1024
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,650
Brother Shao Jie.

1025
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,870


1026
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,800
Your sixth sense of love hasn't changed.

1027
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,070


1028
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,600
Don't talk nonsense.

1029
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,870


1030
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,880
What else can you talk about

1031
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,950


1032
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,840
with a group of beautiful girls together?

1033
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,190


1034
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,660
I thought

1035
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,670


1036
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,760
you were just Brother Yancheng's good friend.

1037
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,870


1038
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,850
Who is more important, he or the girls?

1039
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,070


1040
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,690
Don't set me up.

1041
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,950


1042
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,760
You want me to offend someone?

1043
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,910


1044
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,280
This atmosphere makes me uncomfortable.

1045
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,670


1046
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,030
I'll go somewhere else.

1047
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,270


1048
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,620
I'll go with her.

1049
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,870


1050
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,260
Shao Jie.

1051
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,270


1052
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,750
Where is Yuxuan?

1053
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:56,950


1054
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,150
She said she went out with her friend for some fresh air.

1055
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,430


1056
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,980
Brother Yancheng.

1057
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,110


1058
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,300
How's the sculpture going?

1059
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,390


1060
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,350
Not bad.

1061
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,670


1062
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,070


1063
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,020
Yuxuan is wearing too little.

1064
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,270


1065
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,020
I have to find her.

1066
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,470


1067
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,220
What happened? Why are they all gone?

1068
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,140
Why were you staring at me?

1069
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,230


1070
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:16,990
What did I do wrong?

1071
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,190


1072
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,030
I'll ask her.

1073
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,270


1074
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,280
Yina.

1075
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,470


1076
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,110
I have something to do.

1077
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,180


1078
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,210
Enjoy yourself here.

1079
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,470


1080
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:23,980
You...

1081
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,150


1082
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,420
Miss Du, nice to meet you.

1083
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,660


1084
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,970
We are looking for the female leading role

1085
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,150


1086
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,050
for the next drama.

1087
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,190


1088
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,730
Are you interested?

1089
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:32,990


1090
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,640
Brother Haodong.

1091
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,870


1092
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,460
Wei Haodong.

1093
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,670


1094
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,310
Why are you avoiding me when you're here?

1095
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,500


1096
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,020
Do you know how high my heels are

1097
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,350


1098
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,630
and how tired I was from running?

1099
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,870


1100
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:51,960
I'm sorry.

1101
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,310


1102
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,880
A gift for me?

1103
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,060


1104
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,000
Happy birthday.

1105
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,340


1106
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,520
Since you gave me a gift,

1107
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,790


1108
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,900
I have a gift in return.

1109
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,910


1110
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,710
The gift is in the room.

1111
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,990


1112
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,780


1113
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,660
At ten o'clock.

1114
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:14,910
Go get it.

1115
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,270


1116
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,320
If you don't go,

1117
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,550


1118
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,110
you'll never see me again.

1119
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,540


1120
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,610
I'm so angry.

1121
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,950


1122
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,630
Why do I feel that you are even angrier

1123
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,670


1124
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,590
than me?

1125
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,910


1126
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
I get angry when I see that playboy.

1127
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,550


1128
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,830
Especially when he talks to that pretentious woman.

1129
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,030


1130
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,500
You must be hiding something from me.

1131
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,740


1132
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,910
Tell me now.

1133
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,150


1134
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,230


1135
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:53,900
Huixin.

1136
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:56,970
I have something to tell you.

1137
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,230


1138
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,440
I have nothing to tell you.

1139
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,710


1140
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,780
Don't hide from me.

1141
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,110


1142
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,190
Can we have a talk?

1143
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,470


1144
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,000
I have nothing to talk to you about.

1145
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,310


1146
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:07,800
No.

1147
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,150


1148
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,590
I have to make it clear today.

1149
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,870


1150
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,330
You guys talk first.

1151
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,510


1152
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,310


1153
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,060
Okay, go ahead.

1154
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:23,920
Come with me.

1155
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,350


1156
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,890
Let go of me!

1157
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,110


1158
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,830
What are you doing? Let go of me!

1159
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,910


1160
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,290
Are you leaving?

1161
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:29,550


1162
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,180
I'm sorry.

1163
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,190


1164
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,760
I don't plan to have a boyfriend now.

1165
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,950


1166
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,290
Let's be friends.

1167
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,550


1168
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,810
Yeah, we can add each other on WeChat.

1169
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,910


1170
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,550
We can go out

1171
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:37,670


1172
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,270
and play together.

1173
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,550


1174
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,490
Thank you for the invitation.

1175
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,750


1176
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,970
I have a tour exhibition recently.

1177
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,140


1178
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,400
I don't have time to play.

1179
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,550


1180
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,410
We can also be a member of a boost

1181
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,510


1182
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,650
in your exhibition.

1183
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,030


1184
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,150
Only those who know painting can visit my exhibition.

1185
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,390


1186
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,090
What?

1187
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,190


1188
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,020
You dress like this tonight

1189
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,150


1190
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,980
to attract the second-generation rich

1191
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,020


1192
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,320
like us, don't you?

1193
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,430


1194
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,370
Don't pretend to be aloof.

1195
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,750


1196
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,860
Let's go upstairs. It's cold here.

1197
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,910


1198
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,820
Let's go.

1199
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,830


1200
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,460
Let's go.

1201
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,470


1202
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,250
What are you doing?

1203
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,350


1204
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,410
Apologize!

1205
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,550


1206
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,640
Do you know who I am?

1207
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,710


1208
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,250
How dare you hit me and threaten me?

1209
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,550


1210
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,460
Let me tell you.

1211
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,710


1212
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,490
I invested in Gu Muyu's next film.

1213
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,750


1214
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,640
Really?

1215
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:12,940


1216
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,550


1217
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,510
Then I announce on behalf of Gu Muyu,

1218
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,510
she resigns.

1219
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,750


1220
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,990
Resignation?

1221
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,150


1222
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,940
Who do you think you are?

1223
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,350


1224
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,810
He is Gu Yancheng,

1225
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,910


1226
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:21,960
Gu Muyu's brother.

1227
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,180


1228
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,300
You are Gu Yancheng, CEO of Gu Group.

1229
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,580


1230
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,790


1231
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,600
I'll pay the penalty.

1232
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,180
But I won't let go of

1233
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,340


1234
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,830


1235
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,650
what happened today.

1236
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,120
Let's go. Don't make it a big deal.

1237
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,390


1238
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,020


1239
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,800
Are you okay?

1240
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,210
Luckily, you came in time.

1241
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,350


1242
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,410
Go back to your room and rest.

1243
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,590


1244
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,930
I think I'm a little scared.

1245
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,190


1246
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,150
Brother Yancheng, can you give me a hand?

1247
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,540


1248
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,320
Let go of me!

1249
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,590


1250
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,670
Let's talk here.

1251
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,750


1252
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,980
Huixin, I want to be with you.

1253
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,270


1254
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,090
What did you say?

1255
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,260


1256
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,390
I said I wanted to be with you.

1257
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,830


1258
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,400
You...

1259
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,740


1260
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,430
What did you say? I didn't hear you.

1261
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,790


1262
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,550


1263
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:45,200
Huixin.

1264
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,220
I've made up my mind.

1265
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,470


1266
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,440
I really want to be with you.

1267
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,590


1268
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,190
Think about it.

1269
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,550


1270
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:55,800
I'll wait for your reply.

1271
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:55,830


1272
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,920
I was kissed just like that?

1273
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,909


1274
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,409
Yan...

1275
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,590


1276
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,420
Muyu, why are you here?

1277
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,550


1278
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:44,170
Are you disappointed to see me?

1279
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,429


1280
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,050
Why are you here alone?

1281
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,150


1282
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,690
Where is my brother?

1283
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,989


1284
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,270
I went out for something.

1285
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,469


1286
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,060
And I haven't seen him since I came back.

1287
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,389


1288
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,650
I see.

1289
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,949


1290
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,489
He must be waiting for you in the hotel room.

1291
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,790


1292
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,180
Hotel room?

1293
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,470


1294
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,880
Didn't my brother tell you?

1295
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,150


1296
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,230
I gave him a room card, 921.

1297
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,430


1298
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,300
Vista Suite.

1299
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,430


1300
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,020


1301
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,670
It is my gift for you.

1302
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,640
I feel embarrassed.

1303
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,790


1304
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,890
Stop it. Just go.

1305
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,110


1306
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,900
It's getting late.

1307
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,110


1308
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,430


1309
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,160
I have something important to do.

1310
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,950
I'll leave you alone. Bye.

1311
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,310


1312
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,880
[Please take this bunch of flowers and walk forward in the direction indicated by the arrow]

1313
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,990


1314
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,720
What took you so long?

1315
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,600
Where is your brother?

1316
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,830


1317
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,620
Didn't you say your brother wanted to discuss sculpture with me?

1318
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,030


1319
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,900
Why did he ask me to come here?

1320
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,270


1321
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,900
My brother is in the studio.

1322
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,950


1323
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,630
Can you change your excuse next time?

1324
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,910


1325
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:55,970
I'll get going.

1326
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,270


1327
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,020
I can make it every time I use this excuse.

1328
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,270


1329
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,430
Think of it as spending time with me today.

1330
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,710


1331
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,870


1332
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,650
No.

1333
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,790
My mom has to check my work today.

1334
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,030


1335
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,000
I don't have time for you.

1336
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,390


1337
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,670
Have you forgotten?

1338
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,950


1339
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,820
Today is my 18th birthday.

1340
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,030


1341
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,140
I'm sorry. I...

1342
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,150


1343
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,570
You have to give me a gift anyway.

1344
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,790


1345
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,010
And from now on, you have to prepare gifts for me

1346
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,070


1347
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,250
on my birthday every year.

1348
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,550


1349
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,710
What do you want?

1350
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,030


1351
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,820
Just come with me.

1352
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,180


1353
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,430


1354
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:42,420
Take photos with me.

1355
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,750


1356
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,510
It'll be a gift for me.

1357
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,200
I don't like taking photos.

1358
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,350


1359
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,420
I don't care.

1360
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,670


1361
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,880
Today is my birthday.

1362
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,180


1363
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,350


1364
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,870
You can't go against my wish.

1365
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,130
I just want this gift.

1366
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,580


1367
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,860
If you don't accompany me,

1368
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,190


1369
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,650
I'll go

1370
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,660


1371
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,460
wherever you go today.

1372
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,590


1373
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,110
Okay.

1374
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:00,180


1375
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,760
Cheer up.

1376
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,990


1377
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,730
Can you do it seriously?

1378
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,950


1379
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,070


1380
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,990
I'm doing it seriously.

1381
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:26,890
Cheer up.

1382
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,950


1383
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:27,470


1384
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,360
Okay.

1385
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,550
It's not that good.

1386
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,910


1387
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,080
Let's take another group.

1388
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,470


1389
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,540
No.

1390
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,630


1391
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,710
You're not satisfied with every photo.

1392
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,910


1393
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,790
When will you finish it?

1394
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,990


1395
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,270
It's the last time.

1396
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,670


1397
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,710
Even if you don't like it this time,

1398
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,950


1399
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,040
I won't do it, okay?

1400
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,310


1401
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,190
It's a deal.

1402
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,470


1403
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,280
This is the last time.

1404
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,510


1405
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,210
I'll start now.

1406
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,550


1407
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:20,900
Muyu.

1408
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,070


1409
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,370
This is...

1410
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,510


1411
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,120
It's a gift for you.

1412
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,390


1413
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,610
Muyu, I'm sorry.

1414
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,790


1415
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,680
I have something to do.

1416
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,030


1417
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:30,720
I have to go.

1418
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,870


1419
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:31,980
Stop!

1420
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,990


1421
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,650
When will you stop running away?

1422
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,790


1423
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:38,600
I think

1424
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,830


1425
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,010
this is not the right time

1426
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,180


1427
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,110
to talk about this now.

1428
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,500


1429
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,900
Then when do you think is the right time?

1430
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,070


1431
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,200
I've liked you since I was young.

1432
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,390


1433
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:48,770
I confessed to you for the first time

1434
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,870


1435
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:49,760
on my 18th birthday.

1436
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,990


1437
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,560
You left without saying anything.

1438
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,750


1439
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,940
Are you going to do this again today?

1440
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,230


1441
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:56,320
Yes.

1442
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,580


1443
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,930
No.

1444
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,270


1445
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,000
Brother Haodong.

1446
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,150


1447
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,020
I know you like me too.

1448
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,350


1449
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,540
Otherwise, how can I ask you out every time

1450
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,550


1451
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,450
with the same reason?

1452
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,630


1453
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,950
And you are willing to be cheated.

1454
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,190


1455
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,270
Muyu.

1456
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,590


1457
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,900
Let's calm down

1458
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,190


1459
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,110


1460
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:24,950
and talk.

1461
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,190
Muyu,

1462
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,470


1463
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,720
whether we like each other or not

1464
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,950


1465
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,400
doesn't matter anymore.

1466
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,710


1467
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,350
As long as the Gu and Wei families are still competitors,

1468
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,670


1469
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,870
we can't be together.

1470
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,110


1471
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,830
Then why did you come?

1472
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,110


1473
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,460
Why did you give me hope?

1474
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,740


1475
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:51,620
Yes.

1476
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:51,870


1477
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,400
I gave you hope.

1478
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,870


1479
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,310


1480
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:57,900
I want to see you.

1481
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,640
It's my fault.

1482
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:03,870


1483
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,190
I came here

1484
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,390


1485
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,740
because I'm afraid you'll do something stupid.

1486
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:10,030


1487
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,750
But now it seems

1488
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:12,990


1489
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,070
I'm oversensitive.

1490
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,430


1491
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,520
I'm sorry.

1492
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:18,870


1493
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,870
Wei Haodong,

1494
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,980


1495
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,900
Can you be brave?

1496
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,750


1497
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,360
What happened?
