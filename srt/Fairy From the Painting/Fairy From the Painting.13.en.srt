This is the first time you've kissed me.

6
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,490
You've taken advantage of me so many times.

Can't I do it once?

As many times as you like.

00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,170

14
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,410
fulfilling your first duty

20
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,870


21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,759
Drive me home.

22
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,060
I've been your driver for so long.

27
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,160
Perhaps,

28
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,430
you should move into my place.

29
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,790


30
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,510
No way.

32
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,470


33
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:39,160
We can't live together now.

34
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,890
Why not?

35
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,110

37
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,020
You lived with me before.

38
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,260
I was just your assistant at that time.

39
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,270


40
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,310


41
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,160
Even if you wanted to do something to me, you wouldn't dare.

42
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,510


43
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,470
If we live together now,

44
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,550


45
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,230
I'll be in the wolf's den.

46
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:52,990


47
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,900
So that's your concern.

48
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,190


49
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,970
Seems that you can't wait for it to happen.

50
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,650
That's nonsense.

51
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,030


52
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,030


53
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,860
I just want to be with you every day.

54
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,790
After all, you don't work in the Gu Group anymore.

55
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,030


56
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,630


57
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,620
We can barely make time

58
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,670


59
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,360
to see each other.

60
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,860


61
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,780
Then I'll go back to work for the Gu Group.

62
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,510


63
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,410
Not gonna happen.

64
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,950


65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,940
How can I let my girlfriend

66
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,790
be my driver?

67
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,030


68
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,370
Move into my place, will you?

69
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,350


70
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,250
Not now.

71
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,350


72
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,230


73
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,170
My dad is at my place.

74
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,570
Okay. I'll wait.

75
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,630


76
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,020
I'm leaving.

77
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,390


78
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,020
Wait.

79
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,270


80
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,030


81
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,930
What? When have you become so clingy?

82
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,720
Take advantage of me before you go.

83
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,790


84
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,470


85
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,340
Well...

86
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,750


87
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,660
What if the neighbors see us?

88
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,630
There's no one around us now. You'd better hurry up.

89
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,590


90
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,130
I'll count on you to find Yuxuan a boyfriend.

91
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,180


92
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,260
I've been fretting over it.

93
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,270


94
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,870
No problem.

95
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,030


96
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,520

Mr. Gu.

103

104
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,950
What are you doing?

105
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,230


106
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,940
There was a bug here. I patted it away for him.

108
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,140
Dad, Aunt Li.

109
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,390


110
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,970
Where are you going?

111
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,029


112
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,190
I'm taking your dad

113
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,310


114
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,690
to the community activity center.

115
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,910


116
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,080
Is this handsome guy

117
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,110


118
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,060

Hello, Aunt Li. I'm...

122

125
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,360
He ran into me and gave me a ride.

126
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,210
I'm relieved to hear that.

127
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,380


128
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,350
I'm thinking about

129

130
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,130
introducing my nephew to you.

131

132
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,870
My nephew is also very handsome.

133
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,990


134
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,400
He is?

135
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,630


136
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,950
He's now the financial director of his company.

137
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,030


138
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,240

I've seen that young man.

142
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,430
Very good-looking.

144
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,830
Show me his photo.

146
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,020
I'll show it to my daughter.

147
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,030


148
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:57,540
Dad, Aunt Li,

149

150
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,610
why don't you go somewhere else to exchange information?

151
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,750


152
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,550


153
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,510
I need to talk to my boss about work.

154
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,190


155
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,070
Go.

156
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,950
Talk about work.

157
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,190


158
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,090
Go.

159

This one, right?

163
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,670


164
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,400
-Yeah. -Let me take a look.

165
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,300


166
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,270


167
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,240
Xun Yuxuan.

168
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,380
Exchange information for a blind date, huh?

169
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,630


170
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,560
I just wanted to send them away.

171
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,710


172
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,160
I won't go meet that guy.

174
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,700
Why couldn't you just say

175

176
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,570
I'm your boyfriend?

178
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,720
We can't come clean so early.

179
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,030


180
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,570
It would be too much for my father.

181
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,790


182
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,850

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,670


186
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,360
usually end up being nipped in the bud.

187
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,500


188
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,840
And don't presume too much.

189
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,950


190
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,460
You're on probation.

191
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,470


192
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,900


193
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,659
I can refund you anytime.

194
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,680
A masterpiece like me

195
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,830


196
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,130
is not returnable.

197
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,270


198
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,700
A masterpiece? You mean a weirdo?

199
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,030


200
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,700
By the way, if I put this

201
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,750


202
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,170
on the Internet for sale

203
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,220


204
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,480
and say it's carved by Gu Yancheng,

205
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,590


206
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,990
I can get paid a large amount of money, right?

207
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,230


208
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,950


209
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:54,790
I dare you!

210
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,430


211
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,450
Why would I not dare?

212
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,540
You've only made it to carve it

213
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,550


214
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,620
with my generous help.

215
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,630


216
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,780
I deserve half the credit.

217
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,190


218
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,190


219
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,260
Go ahead and sell it.

220
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,030
I can carve another one.

221
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,180


222
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,730
Dummy, I can never bring myself to sell it.

223
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,990


224
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,550


225
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,250
I'll take extra care of it.

226
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,350


227
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,180
But I can't help but think

228
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,020
that if you carve something for me

229
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,030


230
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,220
on my every birthday,

231
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,230


232
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,390


233
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,330
I'll become super rich

234
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,750
within a few years, right?

235
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,870


236
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,850
Sounds very ambitious.

237
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,860


238
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,360
You bet.

239
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,430


240
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,520
I have a business mind.

241
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,830


242
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,990


243
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,850
Speaking of which,

244
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,070
it's your birthday this Saturday.

245
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,230


246
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,500
How did you know?

247
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,830


248
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,030


249
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,870
It doesn't matter.

250
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,230
What matters is that I truly care for you.

251
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,350


252
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,620
How about this?

253
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,670


254
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:48,030


255
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,770
Don't make any plans for Saturday.

256
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,350


257
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,150
Let's go on a date.

258
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,390


259
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,280
Okay.

260
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,270


261
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,000
Well,

262
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,540
find me a new driver.

263
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,870


264
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,960
A new driver?

265
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,190


266
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,590
You haven't made up with Fairy yet?

267
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,830


268
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:15,890
Yes.

269
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,030


270
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,870
Then just ask her to come back.

271
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,990


272
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,350
We don't want outsiders to work for us.

273
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,270


274
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,400
Making my girlfriend my driver

275
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,630


276
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,950


277
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,640
is not good for our relationship.

278
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,230


279
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,070
It's also not safe.

280
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,100
Wait.

281
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,110


282
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,500
You and Fairy are together now?

283
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,550


284
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,409
Good for you, Boss.

285
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,590


286
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,280
You finally made her your girl.

287
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,500


288
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,510
You should hold a celebratory party.

289
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,790


290
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:43,950
No problem.

291
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,270


292
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,680
But...

293
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:45,630


294
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,590


295
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,480
Wait. Nothing good follows behind but.

296
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,450
You have to do me another favor.

297
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,470


298
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,800
Let me make it clear first.

299
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,110


300
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,420
I can do you any favor,

301
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,670


302
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,700
as long as I don't pay out of pocket.

303
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,870


304
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,500


305
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,420
Didn't you say

306
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,870
every date should be a special occasion?

307
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,910


308
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,870
That I need to make preparations beforehand.

309
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,110


310
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,190


311
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,930
This Saturday is Yuxuan's birthday.

312
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,830


313
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,620
Make a schedule for me.

314
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,460
We'll have the whole day.

315
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,620


316
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,510
You're asking the right person for help.

317
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,790


318
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,120
No one knows better than me

319
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,190


320
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,590
about girls' fantasies about a perfect date.

321
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,630


322
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,430
A romantic date

323
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,630


324
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,790


325
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,600
requires only one thing.

326
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,000
Take it to the extreme.

327
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,190


328
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,230


329
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,100
Extreme?

330
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,440
Yes. Extreme.

331
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,710


332
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,520
Either you go up to the sky or go down to the sea.

333
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,750


334
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,780
Recall the past or look into the future.

335
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,070


336
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:36,929
Go up to the sky?

337
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,150


338
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,230


339
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:37,900
Yes!

340
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,360
A French revolving restaurant

341
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,630


342
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,070


343
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,790
can let you and Fairy

344
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,380
enjoy delicious food in the clouds.

345
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,630


346
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,070
What about going down to the sea?

347
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,310


348
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,410
See the fantastic sea world without diving in the ocean.

349
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,670


350
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,840
Play with dolphins

351
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,950


352
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,660
or penguins.

353
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,740


354
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,540
Believe me,

355
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,630


356
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,660
girls' hearts soften

357
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,710


358
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,610
when they see those cute animals.

359
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,750


360
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,740
By then, you and Fairy

361
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,750


362
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,500
can pledge your love to each other

363
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,710


364
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,420
and let the sea be your witness.

365
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,710


366
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,520
What is looking into the future?

367
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,670


368
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,570
Ferris wheel.

369
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,830


370
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,020
That's a little far-fetched.

371
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,110


372
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,920
Boss,

373
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,150


374
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,190


375
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,080
although you're a little bit

376
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,870


377
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,670
abler and smarter than me,

378
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,050
I've brought many more girls to the amusement park

379
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,190


380
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,200
than you have.

381
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,350


382
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,130
It's an amazing experience

383
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,190


384
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,830
when it gets dark and the whole park is suddenly lit up.

385
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,030


386
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,130
Dating with me

387
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,140


388
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,620
is such enjoyment.

389
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,870


390
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,390


391
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,310
Do your exes think so? I doubt it.

392
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,830


393
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,740
Shut up.

394
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,690
There was no bad blood between me and them.

395
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,790


396
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,390


397
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,310
You've never been there before,

398
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,210
so I'm sure you don't know about

399
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,270


400
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,100
the romantic story behind the Ferris wheel.

401
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,470


402
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,510


403
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,340
What story?

404
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,670


405
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,540
It is said that couples

406
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,110
riding the Ferris wheel together

407
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,190


408
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,160
will eventually break up.

409
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,430


410
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,060
But if they kiss

411
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,150


412
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,090
at the highest point,

413
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,270


414
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,260
they'll be together forever.

415
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,590


416
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,990


417
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,980
I bet you've kissed numerous times

418
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,440
at the highest point.

419
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,750


420
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,460
This story is not convincing.

421
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,670


422
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,620
It doesn't matter whether you're convinced or not.

423
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,950


424
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,850
The key is that girls believe it.

425
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,990


426
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,070
Just do it

427
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,150


428
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,850
to fulfill your girl's wish.

429
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,350


430
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,800
I won't ride the Ferris wheel.

431
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,190


432
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,760
Then...

433
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,830


434
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,800
You just take her

435
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,990


436
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,710


437
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,560
to the highest point of any amusement facility

438
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,450
and kiss her.

439
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,670


440
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,110
It may work as well.

441
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,390


442
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,350


443
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,330
Go on.

444
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,560
I know that.

445
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,790


446
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,880
You're going to talk about looking into the future next.

447
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,150


448
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,580
Bingo.

449
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,750


450
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,720
You and Fairy

451
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,870


452
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,640
can watch stars and the moon together,

453
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,860


454
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,340
and talk about poems and songs and the philosophy of life.

455
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,430


456
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,540
Then naturally the conversation will turn to the future.

457
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,830


458
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,880
Right?

459
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,110


460
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,450
One more thing.

461
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,750


462
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,800
You'll be grateful to me for telling you this.

463
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,030


464
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,130
What?

465
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,270


466
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,560
What is this?

467
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,780


468
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,900
Camp under the starry sky.

469
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,110


470
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,700
Nothing more romantic than that.

471
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,710


472
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,070


473
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:38,880
Most importantly,

474
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,490
you must bring only one tent.

475
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,950


476
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,540
You're so conniving.

477
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,950


478
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,910


479
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,850
Why did you bring me here?

480
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,440
It's Fairy's birthday.

481
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,510


482
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,670
You should give her a gift.

483
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,830


484
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,240
Although you've given her a hairpin,

485
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,310


486
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,630
she can't wear it every day.

487
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,670


488
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,890
After thinking about it,

489
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,070


490
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,780


491
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,720
I think this is the most suitable gift.

492
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,040
It's not too expensive,

493
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,350


494
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,740
so Fairy won't feel indebted.

495
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,070


496
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,530
Besides,

497
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,620


498
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,330
put on the lipstick of love

499
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,510


500
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,270


501
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,120
for her

502
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,300
and let her return it to you bit by bit later.

503
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,510


504
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,470


505
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,220
But Yuxuan doesn't seem to like these things.

506
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,630
You really don't understand women, do you?

507
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,870


508
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,270
Haven't you seen that movie?

509
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,510


510
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,410
Breakfast at Tiffany's starring Audrey Hepburn.

511
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,660


512
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,320
A girl can't read that sort of thing

513
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,630


514
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,580
without her lipstick.

515
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,830


516
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,940
So, every woman wants to be beautiful

517
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,070


518
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,630
and no woman

519
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,710


520
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,060
can resist the temptation of lipsticks.

521
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,230


522
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,230


523
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,190
Besides,

524
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,010
before you and Fairy

525
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,190


526
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,150
got together,

527
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,470


528
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,330
she must have felt it improper to let you spend money on her.

529
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,430


530
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,580
Thank you.

531
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,830


532
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,620
Boss, can't you pay for this one too?

533
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,870


534
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,440
Buy your woman gift with your own money.

535
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,870


536
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,480
Boss.

537
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,830


538
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,150
Huixin.

539
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,500


540
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,620
You scared the crap out of me.

541
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,870


542
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:25,880
What do you mean?

543
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,150


544
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,640
I'm here to apologize.

545
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,030


546
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,000
For what?

547
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,110


548
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,030
Well,

549
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,270


550
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,620
I lost control of myself that night.

551
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,900


552
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,850
I will be responsible for you.

553
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,950


554
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,830


555
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,820
Haven't we agreed

556
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,200
to forget about it?

557
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,310


558
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,560
And I really don't need you to take responsibility.

559
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,790


560
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,640
But...

561
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,870


562
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,110


563
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,950
we were both too eager that day

564
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,080
and forgot about birth control.

565
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,190


566
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,650
I mean,

567
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,910


568
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,350
if what I'm worried about happens,

569
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,670


570
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,120
I will be responsible for you.

571
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,430


572
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,010
You look like a playboy

573
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,270


574
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,830
but are actually quite reliable.

575
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,870


576
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,580
Don't worry.

577
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:07,870


578
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,330
I've taken care of it.

579
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,580


580
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,920
You have nothing to worry about.

581
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,070


582
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:16,920
What's wrong?

583
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,150


584
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,850
Are you upset because I'm too considerate?

585
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,910


586
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,170
No.

587
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,430


588
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm happy.

589
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,150


590
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,630
Alright. Now that you can rest assured,

591
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,740


592
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,440
you may leave.

593
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,740


594
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:27,910
Don't come here again.

595
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,190


596
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,260
We're done. Bye.

597
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,630


598
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,940
What else do you want?

599
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,190


600
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,660
It's a gift from my company. I have no use of it.

601
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,740


602
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,480
Take it.

603
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,670


604
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,440
Bye. Good night.

605
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,750


606
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,490
What's the matter with him?

607
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,790


608
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,960
Where are we going tomorrow?

609
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,190


610
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,870
It's a secret.

611
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,230


612
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,390
You'll know.

613
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,710


614
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,110
I'll pick you up at nine tomorrow morning.

615
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,470


616
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,720
Okay, I'll wait for you.

617
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,950


618
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:03,820
I'm going to bed.

619
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,150


620
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,260


621
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,070
So early?

622
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,990


623
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,800
Did you forget something?

624
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,020
Nothing that I can recall.

625
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,270


626
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,060


627
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,870
Are you sure?

628
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,200
I haven't taken advantage of you today. Happy now?

629
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,390


630
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,650
Boss,

631
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,830


632
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,350
you weren't like this before.

633
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,710


634
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,510
Can't you fill your mind

635
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,590


636
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,970
with something important instead?

637
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,230


638
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,470


639
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,440
For me,

640
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,050
nothing is more important than you.

641
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,350


642
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,710
Since I'm so important,

643
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,950


644
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,370
draw closer to the camera.

645
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,670


646
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,950


647
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,830
Yuxuan.

648
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,520
What happened?

649
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,630


650
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,020


651
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,090
I'm coming in.

652
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,130
What's wrong with your lips?

653
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,350


654
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,340
This is the trendy lip exercise.

655
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,390


656
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,470
They say it can make my lips sexy.

657
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,750


658
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,190
Sexy?

659
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,510


660
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,330
Why do you even want that?

661
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,620


662
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,260
Drink it.

663
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,620


664
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,770
Go to bed early.

665
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,990


666
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,070
Dad, you go to bed too.

667
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,420


668
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,510
I'm waiting to take the cup. Finish it.

669
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,870


670
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,870


671
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,550
Okay.

672
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:28,980
Good girl.

673
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,230


674
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,710


675
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,560
Sleep tight, Dad.

676
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,560
Using your phone again? It's bad for your eyes.

677
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,940


678
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,510
Don't stay up late.

679
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,830


680
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,320
Okay.

681
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,510


682
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,200
Good night. Have a good dream. Kiss kiss.

683
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,470


684
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,550
Good night. Kiss kiss.

685
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,870


686
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,260
What's going on?

687
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,470


688
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,950
I'm watching a romantic drama.

689
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,110


690
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,990
I know. Kiss kiss.

691
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,270


692
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,750


693
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,470
Good girl.

694
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,160
My girl has grown up.

695
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,550


696
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,260
I'm waiting for you downstairs.

697
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,349


698
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,490
Well, something unexpected happened.

699
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,870


700
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,150
Our plan may have to be canceled.

701
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,550


702
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,660
I'll call you later.

703
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,950


704
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,740
Why did you come up?

705
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,870


706
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:48,970
What happened?

707
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,190


708
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,200
Come in.

709
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,590


710
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,570
Who are you?

711
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,860


712
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:03,540
Who is he?

713
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,740


714
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,790


715
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,590
He...

716
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,480
My name is Doudou.

717
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,750


718
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,490
Nice to meet you.

719
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,750


720
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,470


721
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,260
Nice to meet you too.

722
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,380
He's Aunt Li's grandson.

723
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,590


724
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,800
Aunt Li went to travel with her friends.

725
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,950


726
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,920
She won't be back until tomorrow.

727
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,350


728
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,900
She asked me to take care of him.

729
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,070


730
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,190


731
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,950

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,460
Let's go eat.

917
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,540


918
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,120
Let me see... What's on the menu?

919
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,270


920
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:25,910
Hello, sir.

921
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,150


922
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,000
I suggest you

923
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,070


924
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,430
order the family combo.

925
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,630


926
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,290
It's very economical.

927
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,550


928
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,990
We're not family.

929
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,150


930
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,760
Good idea. We'll have that.

931
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,150


932
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,090
Doudou, order whatever you want.

933
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,590


934
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,810
Boy, you have a doting father.

935
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,070


936
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,490
Dad, I want

937
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,590


938
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,020
chicken drumstick, fried fries, and popcorn chicken.

939
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,310


940
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,780
No way.

941
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,990


942
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,600
Listen.

943
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,910


944
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,670
These are all fried food.

945
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,860


946
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,380
You can't eat too much of them. Do you hear me?

947
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,670


948
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,260
Mom, you're being so harsh today.

949
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,390


950
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,070
Can't you be more like Dad?

951
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,340


952
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,240
Madam, I want all the three things I ordered.

953
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,710


954
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,710
Please serve them immediately.

955
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,950


956
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,340
Okay.

957
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,430


958
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,670
Good for you two guys.

959
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,870


960
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,550
You've teamed up against me, right?

961
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,750


962
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,870
You don't give a fig about my opinion, do you?

963
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,070


964
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,920
Mom has the final say in the family.

965
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,270


966
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,870


967
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,750
Sorry,

968
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,810
forget about the three snacks the boy ordered just now.

969
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,230


970
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,060
Madam, your husband is so nice to you.

971
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,270


972
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,360
Your food will be served in a moment.

973
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,590


974
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,980
In fact, he's not my husband.

975
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,110


976
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,290
Are you two

977
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,390


978
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,040
drama queens today?

979
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,350


980
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,210
You both want to win the Academy Award for Best Actor?

981
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,430


982
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,580


983
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,470
-It's his fault. -It's his fault.

984
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:49,920
Sister,

985
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,270


986
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,600
let's ride the roller coaster

987
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,990


988
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,420
after eating.

989
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,790


990
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,940
Roller coaster?

991
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,990


992
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,050
Say no.

993
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,670


994
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,730
I thought someone was brave.

995
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,950


996
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,630


997
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,470
Beg me.

998
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,270
Doudou,

999
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,470


1000
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,740
if we ride the roller coaster

1001
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,910


1002
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,990
after eating,

1003
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,260


1004
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,790
I may feel nausea

1005
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,870


1006
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,230
and...

1007
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,150


1008
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,080
Do you understand?

1009
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,430


1010
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,790


1011
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,720
Fine. We can play something else.

1012
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,440
Good. We'll play something else.

1013
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,670


1014
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,820
Doudou,

1015
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,070


1016
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,210
is this what you meant by something else?

1017
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,270


1018
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:54,980
Yeah.

1019
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,350


1020
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,870
Pirate ship, my favorite.

1021
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,030


1022
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,470
Doudou, let's ride this next time.

1023
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,590


1024
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,090
OK?

1025
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,310


1026
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,690
Let's ride it together.

1027
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:13,910


1028
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:15,870
Let's go.

1029
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,270


1030
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,090
It is said

1031
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,270


1032
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,330
that couples

1033
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,430


1034
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,110
riding the Ferris wheel together

1035
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,190


1036
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,850
will eventually break up.

1037
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,060


1038
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,230
But if they kiss

1039
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,310


1040
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,620
at the highest point,

1041
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,790


1042
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,350
they'll be together forever.

1043
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,470


1044
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,850
Yuxuan.

1045
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:23,950


1046
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,140
Yeah?

1047
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,190


1048
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,980
Why am I the only one drinking?

1049
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,110


1050
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,330
Because I have to drive.

1051
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,390


1052
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,270
You can find a designated driver.

1053
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,630


1054
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,450
I'm afraid

1055
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,710


1056
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,650
the designated driver can't send us where we're going later.

1057
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,790


1058
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,480
So we have

1059
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,550


1060
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,560
other plans for tonight?

1061
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,870


1062
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:07,940
Of course.

1063
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,140


1064
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,190
Today is your birthday.

1065
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,390


1066
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,710
It won't end until midnight.

1067
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,950


1068
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,170
Doudou,

1069
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,390


1070
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,300
here, take mine.

1071
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,540


1072
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,350
Thank you, Brother Yancheng.

1073
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,670


1074
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,580
Seems that you'll be a good father.

1075
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,910


1076
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,230
That's for sure.

1077
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,550


1078
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,020
I'll be a good dad,

1079
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,380


1080
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,360
but you have to give me a kid first.

1081
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,710


1082
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,740
Knock it off.

1083
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,910


1084
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,940
Doudou is still here.

1085
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,190


1086
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,030
Eat your food.

1087
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,110


1088
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,250
It'll get cold soon.

1089
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,470


1090
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,470
Sister, I need to go to the bathroom.

1091
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,670


1092
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,560
Can you go alone?

1093
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,750


1094
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,790
Do you need me to go with you?

1095
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,900


1096
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,490
No. I'm a grown-up man.

1097
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,830


1098
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,700
Cheers.

1099
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,030


1100
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,660
Cheers.

1101
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,830


1102
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,310
Cheers.

1103
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,750


1104
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,670
What's happening?

1105
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,870


1106
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:25,350
♫Happy birthday to you♫

1107
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:26,030


1108
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,260
You kept completely in the dark.

1109
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,470


1110
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,540
Sister Yuxuan,

1111
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,750


1112
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,240
Brother Yancheng wants to give you a surprise.

1113
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,510


1114
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,370
Sister Yuxuan,

1115
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,510


1116
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,610
happy birthday. I wish you become prettier and prettier.

1117
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,870


1118
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,670


1119
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:08,480
Thank you.

1120
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,040
Yuxuan,

1121
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,430


1122
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,410
happy birthday.

1123
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,510


1124
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:15,590
Thank you.

1125
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:15,830


1126
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,000
Sister Yuxuan, make a wish.

1127
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,270


1128
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,250
Alright.

1129
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,470


1130
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,530
Sister Yuxuan,

1131
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,700


1132
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,210
what wish did you make?

1133
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,350


1134
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,990
I won't tell you.

1135
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,150


1136
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,520
If I tell you my wish, it won't come true.

1137
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,710


1138
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,100
You don't have to tell me.

1139
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,270


1140
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,400
It must be related to Brother Yancheng.

1141
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,630


1142
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,120
You know too much.

1143
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,390


1144
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,390
Come and blow out the candles with me.

1145
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,660


1146
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,450
One, two, three.

1147
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,620


1148
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,010
Happy birthday.

1149
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,020


1150
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,890
Happy birthday to you.

1151
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,070


1152
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,510
Thank you.

1153
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,830


1154
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,890
Brother,

1155
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,030


1156
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,590
let me take a look.

1157
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,590


1158
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,370
I can't see anything. Where are the stars?

1159
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,590


1160
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,430


1161
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,310
There are a lot of clouds tonight.

1162
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,340
We can't see anything.

1163
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,350


1164
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,120
It's okay. We can wait for the clouds to disperse.

1165
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,270


1166
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,130
Let's play cards

1167
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,190


1168
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:27,910
while waiting.

1169
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,030


1170
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,320
Good idea.

1171
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,670


1172
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,350
Take him to sleep.

1173
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,590


1174
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,190
Here.

1175
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,310


1176
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:25,920
Look.

1177
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,270


1178
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,850
Is that the Big Dipper?

1179
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,190


1180
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:53,710
Yes.

1181
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,230


1182
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:57,139
It's beautiful.

1183
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,550


1184
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,070
Why are you looking at me like that?

1185
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,190


1186
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,400
I suddenly remembered

1187
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,620


1188
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,670


1189
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,330
that I dreamed this once.

1190
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,870
We stood side by side

1191
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,990


1192
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,050
and watched the stars together.

1193
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,310


1194
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,230


1195
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:26,980
But in my dream,

1196
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,620


1197
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,340
you were wearing a red wedding dress.

1198
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,310


1199
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:30,970
You were very beautiful.

1200
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,850
That was just a dream. I never said I'll marry you.

1201
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,070


1202
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,830


1203
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,580
Admit it.

1204
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,410
You want to marry me.

1205
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,620


1206
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,060
We gotta go.

1207
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,390


1208
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:54,820
Wait.

1209
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,190


1210
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,750
I should have given you this

1211
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,870


1212
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,700
last night.

1213
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,790


1214
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,190
What is this?

1215
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,390


1216
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,310
A gift.

1217
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,590


1218
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,540
Don't open it.

1219
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,550


1220
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,310


1221
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,050
Remember to use it next time we meet.

1222
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,640
Why so mysterious?

1223
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,980


1224
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,030
We'll go back now.

1225
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,150


1226
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,000
Bye.

1227
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,190


1228
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:15,510
Bye.

1229
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:15,790


1230
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,740
Goodbye, Brother Yancheng.

1231
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,990


1232
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,640
Bye.

1233
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,790


1234
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:18,520
Bye.

1235
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,750


1236
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,380
[Gu Yancheng]

1237
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,860
You finally called me, Mr. Gu.

1238
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,100


1239
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,650
What are you going to do? Expose it?

1240
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,180


1241
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,300
I'm not that bad,

1242
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,390


1243
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,860
but I'm indeed after something.

1244
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,190


1245
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,450
Come pick me up at my workplace.

1246
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,750


1247
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,540
Let's go out to have a talk.

1248
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,790


1249
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,140
Why is she in such a hurry?

1250
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,510


1251
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,720
Where is she going?

1252
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,910


1253
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,330
Mr. Gu,

1254
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,420


1255
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,730
aren't you curious about

1256
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,870


1257
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,410
how I got your medical record?

1258
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,670


1259
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,670


1260
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,560
Now that you've had it,

1261
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,820
it's meaningless to ask that question.

1262
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,150


1263
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,460
I was surprised

1264
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,670


1265
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,210
that Mr. Gu, who has always been acclaimed as a sculptural genius,

1266
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,500


1267
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,580
actually can't carve.

1268
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,910


1269
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,020
If word gets out,

1270
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,150


1271
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,080
there'll be a big stir.

1272
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,390


1273
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,520
I've recovered.

1274
