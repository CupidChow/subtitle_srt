4
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,140
What do you mean?

5
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,120
Literal meaning.

6
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:44,420
Work hard.

7
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,890
Don't always think about how you look or taking advantage of women.

8
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,820
Are you talking about me?

9
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,500
-Ms. Lin. -Ms. Lin.

10
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,330
How are the photos for the feature, "Blooming"?

11
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,390
Haven't chosen yet.

12
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,630
But I'm already on it.

13
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,170
These?

14
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:03,940
Yes.

15
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,630
Ms. Lin. You see!

16
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,360
Only these photos.

17
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,150
And he hasn't retouched them yet.

18
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,980
I've asked him to refix it.

19
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,420
Besides,

20
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,880
His attitude toward work is beyond terrible.

21
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,430
He even dated his girlfriend

22
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,680
during his working hours.

23
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,920
These photos are well fixed.

24
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,630
They are passed.

25
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,720
What?

26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,640
Didn't I make myself clear?

27
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,220
No.

28
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,530
Yao Yuan,

29
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,820
I want to see you in my office.

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,880
Since you know you are at work,

31
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,340
don't discuss things that are irrelevant to it.

32
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,010
TB needs capable people,

33
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,760
not someone with a big mouth.

34
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,130
Understand?

35
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,610
Close the door.

36
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,440
Why didn't you tell me they bullied you?

37
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,510
It's nothing. I can handle it myself.

38
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,450
No.

39
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,090
Whoever bullies you must pay the price.

40
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,730
Alright.

41
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,040
I know you care about me.

42
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,210
Don't worry.

43
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,780
These trifles won't affect

44
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,770
my work and life.

45
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,760
But,

46
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,000
if your mood

47
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,860
and thus the company are affected

48
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,770
because of me,

49
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,810
then I will be really sad and blame myself.

50
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,130
Moreover,

51
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,740
I don't want my girlfriend

52
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,020
to be criticized because of this.

53
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,650
Alright, let's forget it this time, okay?

54
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,050
No.

55
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,350
We must not promote this unhealthy tendency.

56
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:58,950
Besides,

57
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,690
today I just happened to see it.

58
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,560
I don't know

59
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,730
how many newcomers are usually bullied.

60
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,500
If all our excellent talents quit

61
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,360
because they were bullied at work,

62
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,530
it would be the biggest loss

63
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,690
to our company.

64
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,260
I know you're right.

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,850
But...

66
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,580
Don't worry.

67
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,660
I know what to do.

68
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:18,890
Oh no.

69
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,540
I'm a little proud.

70
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,100
How can I have such an excellent boss

71
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,810
and girlfriend?

72
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,190
I'm glad you know.

73
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,170
By the way,

74
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,700
I found that your photographing style

75
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,770
is very similar to that of a popular photographer online.

76
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,860
And the set you took for Gu Yancheng

77
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,990
is also very similar to that photographer's style.

78
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,110
Really?

79
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,140
His name seems to be the Shadow Magician.

80
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,820
Do you know him?

81
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,659
No.

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,420
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

83
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,610
Fortunately, she didn't realize that I am the Shadow Magician.

84
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,020
Oh, right.

85
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,200
since I don't need to retouch the photos anymore,

86
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,000
let's go out for dinner.

87
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,100
Sure.

88
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,850
Since I helped you out just now, this dinner is on you.

89
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,540
Yes, sir.

90
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,050
I'll tell her

91
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,840
when I can match her.

92
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:09,720
Huixin.

93
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,940
Mr. Gu.

94
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,040
Why are you here?

95
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,170
I heard you've been busy lately.

96
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,120
So I came to check on you.

97
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,280
Where is Yuxuan?

98
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,800
She hasn't been here lately.

99
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,370
She said she went to learn from her master.

100
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,130
What? Mr. Gu, you don't know?

101
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,470
No. I got it wrong.

102
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,620
It's okay. Go ahead. I'm leaving.

103
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:32,880
Okay.

104
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,470
Take care, Mr. Gu.

105
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,690
Check someone for me.

106
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,070
Here, in your position.

107
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,260
Come on.

108
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,120
Five, six, seven, go.

109
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,840
One, two, three, four.

110
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,730
Five, six, seven, eight.

111
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:06,960
Two, two.

112
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,000
Stop.

113
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,490
Yuxuan,

114
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,820
with your current progress,

115
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,470
it's almost impossible for you

116
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,320
to learn this dance in half a month.

117
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,450
Did you hurt yourself before?

118
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,130
I know.

119
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,430
Because people who were badly hurt while dancing

120
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,150
will be afraid of falling after recovery.

121
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,240
No.

122
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,130
I'm sorry. Let's start it over again.

123
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,610
You have to overcome your fear.

124
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,710
Otherwise, it's hard for you to finish this dance.

125
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,280
I know. I can overcome it.

126
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,490
Can you tell me

127
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,050
what the reason is?

128
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,560
Maybe I can help you.

129
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,360
Nothing.

130
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,510
Maybe it's just that I haven't danced for a long time.

131
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:48,900
OK.

132
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,740
Since you don't want to tell me,

133
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,620
I won't force you.

134
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:52,790
How about this?

135
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,140
I'll hold your hand

136
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,159
behind you.

137
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,570
Follow my rhythm

138
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,440
and see if you can relax gradually.

139
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,450
Okay, let's do it again.

140
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,340
Come on.

141
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,820
From the previous position again.

142
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,690
Five, six, seven, go.

143
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,190
One, two, three, four.

144
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,570
Five, six, seven, eight.

145
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,100
Gao Jiaqian, male, 26 years old.

146
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,560
A professional dancer

147
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,770
and the current leader of a dance troupe.

148
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,840
He is handsome

149
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,090
and has great dancing talent.

150
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,430
Get to the point.

151
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,450
Gao Jiaqian is rehearsing

152
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,690
a dance drama called the Fairy

153
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,600
with Xun...

154
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,060
They should be in the rehearsal room now.

155
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,230
Where is the rehearsal room?

156
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,210
Yes.

157
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,800
Follow that feeling.

158
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,400
You are better than before.

159
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,280
Okay, wait.

160
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:43,740
Place it here. Remember this sign.

161
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,930
Their movements

162
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,130
are a bit awkward.

163
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,200
Not harmonious.

164
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:49,210
Next.

165
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,880
Come on. Go.

166
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,470
Then seven, down.

167
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,500
Two, three.

168
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:57,840
Go.

169
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,340
You are?

170
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,390
Don't you know she has a boyfriend?

171
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,180
Why are you here?

172
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,690
You don't want me here?

173
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,720
What are you talking about?

174
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,170
Don't you tell me that you are at the flower shop?

175
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,420
Why are you here?

176
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,330
This is a little...

177
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,770
awkward.

178
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,110
Let me introduce him to you.

179
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,380
He is Jiaqian.

180
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,050
He is my childhood friend.

181
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,039
Now he is an excellent dancer.

182
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,530
This is Gu Yancheng,

183
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,700
my boyfriend.

184
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,190
So you are Yuxuan's boyfriend.

185
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,340
Yes.

186
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,260
I am her boyfriend.

187
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:51,900
Yuxuan.

188
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,190
You guys talk.

189
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,570
We can continue training later.

190
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:55,880
OK.

191
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:07,920
Tell me.

192
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,500
What are you doing here?

193
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,660
Are you jealous again?

194
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,470
Be serious.

195
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,620
I just asked Jiaqian

196
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,180
to be my dance teacher.

197
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,950
Jiaqian, Jiaqian.

198
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,220
You called his name so intimately.

199
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,910
Do you two need to dance like this?

200
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,150
It's just a few dance moves.

201
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,580
Aren't you supposed to not dance?

202
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,250
Yet you're dancing now?

203
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,240
Because of that man?

204
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,720
Seems like he really is more important than me.

205
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,630
What a refreshing and tantalizing smell of lemon.

206
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,580
Alright, I'll tell you.

207
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,140
Actually,

208
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,410
I learned this dance for you.

209
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,710
For me?

210
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,730
You don't believe me?

211
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,410
Forget it.

212
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,500
I quit.

213
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,740
Are you really doing this for me?

214
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,910
I wanted it to be a surprise.

215
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:20,840
But now...

216
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,000
Forget it.

217
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,600
Actually...

218
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,770
I'm just worried about you.

219
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,160
And it's dancing.

220
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,230
Well,

221
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,880
what am I supposed to do

222
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,560
with this surprise for you?

223
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,380
What do I have to do for you to forgive me?

224
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,060
What do you think?

225
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,370
As your real boyfriend,

226
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,340
seeing you hugging another man

227
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,820
is enough for me to lose my mind, right?

228
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,850
How dare you find an excuse?

229
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,800
Alright.

230
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,480
I admit

231
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,850
it's my fault this time.

232
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,580
I promise it won't happen again.

233
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,670
You're smiling.

234
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,110
So you have forgiven me.

235
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,200
Sorry, we're not peeping.

236
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,780
R-Rright.

237
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,340
We didn't mean it.

238
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,380
I just want to learn some moves

239
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,410
from Mr. Gao.

240
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,520
You see. It's not easy to control your body.

241
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,680
You guys continue. We'll go practice outside.

242
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:30,430
Mr. Gao.

243
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:31,800
Wait.

244
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,890
What is it?

245
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,800
I was rude to you earlier.

246
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:36,920
I apologize.

247
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,200
It's okay.

248
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,440
It's good that the misunderstanding is resolved.

249
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,910
Yuxuan is my friend.

250
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,430
I also hope she can be happy.

251
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,580
By the way, Mr. Gao,

252
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,820
when I was watching you two practice,

253
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,420
was there something wrong?

254
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,630
I didn't expect you to notice that.

255
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,550
He is sensitive

256
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,480
as long as it's relevant to his fairy.

257
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,490
There are indeed some problems.

258
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,910
Yuxuan's dance moves are not smooth.

259
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,290
It feels like she's been fighting against herself.

260
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,750
But deep down,

261
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,740
I can also feel that she wants to dance.

262
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
But her body resists dancing instinctively.

263
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,740
That's why I held her.

264
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,700
I wanted her to follow my rhythm

265
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,800
and feel the rhythm of the dance.

266
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,650
I don't know anything about dancing,

267
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,540
but when I saw your moves,

268
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,670
I thought of the painting of the Flying Fairy.

269
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,090
So,

270
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,940
you want to dance the Flying Fairy Dance?

271
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,620
Alright.

272
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,950
Now the surprise is officially ruined.

273
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,780
Silly.

274
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,240
You know I'll be worried about you.

275
00:12:59,130 --> 00:12:59,960
I know

276
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,320
this competition is very important to you.

277
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,970
So I want to do something

278
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,560
that I can do.

279
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,260
You know it.

280
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,260
I want to try everything

281
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,410
that will be good for you.

282
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,180
Even if it's just a dance.

283
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,950
Thank you for all you've done.

284
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,710
But promise me,

285
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,880
don't force yourself.

286
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,420
Don't get hurt.

287
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,330
OK?

288
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,090
Don't worry.

289
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,500
I will do it

290
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,090
within my abilities.

291
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,280
Let's continue practicing.

292
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,130
OK.

293
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,820
Then you...

294
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,750
It's okay.

295
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,870
Go on.

296
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,800
I'll wait for you outside

297
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,690
so we can go home together.

298
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,510
Okay.

299
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,500
Go.

300
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,280
Yuxuan,

301
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:02,920
I need to ask you a favor.

302
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,190
What is it?

303
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,660
Please tell Huixin.

304
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,720
It's been so long since the birthday party.

305
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,150
If she doesn't give me an answer,

306
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,000
I will go ask her myself.

307
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,790
I don't seem to be

308
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,580
following you.

309
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,990
As long as she will understand.

310
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,890
Thanks.

311
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,190
Bye.

312
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,330
You chose a good boyfriend.

313
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,150
He is not bad.

314
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,810
Stop smiling. Go on.

315
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,360
Okay.

316
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,280
Come on. Follow me this time.

317
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,310
Stop looking!

318
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,990
Five, six, seven, go.

319
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,840
Yes, stretch out.

320
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,420
Your hip.

321
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:00,900
Where are you?

322
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,320
I'm stuck in traffic. I don't know when I'll arrive.

323
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,040
It's okay. I'll wait for you.

324
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,300
There should be something you like in this pile.

325
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,900
Please, you are?

326
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,630
The person who delivers your boyfriend to you.

327
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,500
I thought there was a traffic jam.

328
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,470
How do you come here so fast?

329
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,160
I wanted to give you a surprise.

330
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,470
And I couldn't wait to see you.

331
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,100
So I left early.

332
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,340
Your working attitude is problematic.

333
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,150
If others find out,

334
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,310
they will make a fuss about it.

335
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,460
It's okay.

336
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,220
I have someone to protect me anyway.

337
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,830
I'm very professional.

338
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,010
Don't worry.

339
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,700
I have finished my task completely.

340
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,500
I promise you'll be satisfied, boss.

341
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,350
Since you work so hard,

342
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,710
these are all rewards for you.

343
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:08,930
These?

344
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,030
You didn't go to the office all afternoon just to buy these?

345
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,490
I bought you these

346
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,450
to celebrate you becoming my boyfriend.

347
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,970
This feeling...

348
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,550
What?

349
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:21,950
You don't like them?

350
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,780
No.

351
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,280
It's just...

352
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,000
I feel like I am a toy boy.

353
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,680
I'm a little uncomfortable.

354
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,210
I used my own money

355
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,460
to buy gifts for my boyfriend.

356
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,350
Is there a problem?

357
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,070
No. No.

358
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,060
That's not what I meant.

359
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,470
I know.

360
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,390
But your gifts for me are too expensive.

361
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,020
It hurts

362
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,440
my pride.

363
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,470
Although I don't understand your feeling,

364
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,520
I believe

365
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,180
you will become a top photographer one day.

366
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,400
Then you can buy me

367
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,060
more expensive ones.

368
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,599
Let's make a deal.

369
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:06,880
Stamp it as evidence.

370
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,700
Today, let's change a way of practicing.

371
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,460
Stand here.

372
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,920
With lutes, small and large, let us give her a friendly welcome.

373
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,760
My lady came here.

374
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,260
I wonder if I may

375
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,740
invite you to dance.

376
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,420
Follow my lead.

377
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,010
Do you know where this is?

378
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,710
No.

379
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,600
This is the Yiyu Garden.

380
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,970
Yiyu Garden.

381
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,180
Yuxuan.

382
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,650
It is you who gave me the courage

383
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,330
to start carving again.

384
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:21,730
Now,

385
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,720
I want to help you overcome your mental barriers.

386
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,880
Not for the competition,

387
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,440
but for yourself.

388
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,130
If this dance

389
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,490
can help you reduce all your pain in the past,

390
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,860
I'm willing to be there for you.

391
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,490
You know all about it?

392
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,170
Gao Jiaqian told you everything?

393
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,830
Gao Jiaqian and I agreed to help you together.

394
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,010
Look.

395
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,250
You've been dancing since just now.

396
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,390
I believe you can do it.

397
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,370
Okay.

398
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,150
Mom!

399
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,760
Are you alright?

400
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,080
Yancheng!

401
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,690
I did it!

402
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,930
I can dance now!

403
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,870
I knew you could do it.

404
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,320
For him,

405
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,890
You can even go this far.

406
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,020
It seems that you really love him.

407
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,240
Ruoxi.

408
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,160
No.

409
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,470
Yuxuan.

410
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,900
What's wrong? You're absent-minded.

411
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,530
Nothing.

412
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,050
What answer did Shao Jie ask you to give him?

413
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,460
You wouldn't even tell me.

414
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,020
No.

415
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,710
Really?

416
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,050
Really.

417
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,150
There must be something.

418
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,560
Tell me the truth!

419
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,890
Fine, I'll tell you.

420
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,520
He confessed his feelings to me.

421
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,670
His feelings?

422
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,130
That fast?

423
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,340
Shao Jie has good taste.

424
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,670
What do you think?

425
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,660
Do you like him?

426
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,670
I don't know.

427
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,870
You don't know?

428
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,580
So you, the master of love,

429
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,840
is just a show-off!

430
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,450
All the wisdom you passed on to me

431
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,200
was all empty talk?

432
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,430
They can't be applied in real life?

433
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,980
The fact that

434
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,730
you are in a relationship with Gu Yancheng

435
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,120
verifies my theory.

436
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,440
I'd better go back and think about it.

437
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,700
My situation is more difficult than yours.

438
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,870
Because my relationship with him

439
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,570
is a little complicated.

440
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,800
From the beginning, we were not like the others.

441
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,080
With his flirty personality,

442
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,740
I don't know if he means it.

443
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,070
Alright, let's not talk about this.

444
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,740
Aren't you going to learn to dance from your master today?

445
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,090
Why didn't you go?

446
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,630
I'm off today.

447
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,660
Didn't you say time is limited?

448
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,800
Why do you still have time to rest?

449
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,470
Gao Jiaqian said he had something to do today.

450
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,840
However,

451
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,900
I think he's hiding something from me.

452
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,300
Is something wrong?

453
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:00,940
What?

454
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,990
I hope I'm overthinking it

455
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,670
Why are you here?

456
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,180
Didn't I already pay my rent?

457
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,540
Don't you have any idea

458
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,480
how much rent you pay me?

459
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,480
How long has your rent for this place

460
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,500
been due?

461
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,310
You kept delaying it.

462
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,010
And just gave me a little yesterday.

463
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,510
You still want to delay it?

464
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,340
Brother.

465
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,790
Don't hold on to the place anymore.

466
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,500
Let me tell you the truth.

467
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,100
There is another troupe

468
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,560
that wants to sign the lease with us.

469
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,990
They'll give full payment.

470
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,730
I can't rent it to you anymore.

471
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,210
What about my members?

472
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,690
It's none of my business.

473
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,330
That's your business.

474
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,950
It has nothing to do with me.

475
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:01,980
Jiaqian.

476
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:03,810
What's going on?

477
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,290
The dance troupe has been struggling to make ends meet for several months.

478
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,420
And they haven't been paid for a long time.

479
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,140
Everyone wants to disband.

480
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,890
Yesterday there were also several members who wanted to leave.

481
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,590
I wanted to use the tuition you gave me

482
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,690
to pay the rent.

483
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,670
But in a hurry,

484
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,960
I gave more than half of it to my actors.

485
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,020
It's all my fault.

486
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,730
I don't have the leadership.

487
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,150
But how did this happen?

488
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,990
Such a good dance drama.

489
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,500
Is it costing you money all the time?

490
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,700
Our dance troupe

491
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,870
is not that famous.

492
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,850
And our dance

493
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,620
is not mainstream now.

494
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,490
Our audiences are all drawn by leaflets

495
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,930
or friends' recommendations.

496
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,190
So I can't pay them.

497
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,250
But now,

498
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,500
I feel sorry for everyone.

499
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,620
Don't say that.

500
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,550
You've done a good job.

501
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,150
I think

502
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,020
if our dance

503
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,360
can be seen by the public,

504
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,850
they will love it.

505
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,150
Don't worry.

506
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,300
Let's think of a way together.

507
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,050
Okay.

508
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:07,960
I have to take this call.

509
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,780
[My Mr. Gu]

510
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,050
I forgot he was coming to pick me up.

511

00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,570
has meetings during the day and works at night.

682
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,810
You don't have time for me at all.

683
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,470
Come on.

684
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,760
We see each other every day.

685
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,700
What's your true purpose?

686
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,540
Because you haven't had a good rest.

687
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,940
So for this hour,

688
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,000
we'll watch the sea here

689
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,940
and enjoy the sea breeze and think nothing.

690
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,620
Okay.

691
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,460
I'll listen to you.

692
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,460
Think nothing.

693
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,380
Let's make our relationship public.

694
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,220
Is it because of the rumors these days?

695
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,900
I'm sorry.

696
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,540
You get too much criticism

697
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,500
because you're with me.

698
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,460
No.

699
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,940
We're really together.

700
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,960
You don't mind others' opinions anymore?

701
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,590
We live

702
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,930
like fish in the sea.

703
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,420
Only the endless sea in our eyes.

704
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,360
We should be free in the vast sea.

705
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,740
We go wherever we want.

706
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,710
Do whatever we want.

707
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,400
We shouldn't worry about others' opinions about us.

708
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,100
Am I right?

709
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,650
The fact that I met you

710
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,480
is the luckiest thing that has ever happened

711
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,030
in my life.

712
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,260
Miss Gu,

713
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,440
I heard you've taken part in a big movie.

714
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,260
The heroine of the Light Chaser.

715
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,450
Can you tell us something?

716
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,040
I can tell you a little bit.

717
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,350
The female lead in the movie

718
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,460
is a very inspiring dance teacher,

719
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,230
a role I've never played before.

720
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,560
It's also a big challenge for me.

721
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,490
So, what did you do

722
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,520
for this role?

723
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,560
I studied dancing so hard.

724
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,480
And I watched a dance drama recently.

725
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,670
I was very touched.

726
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,250
The deep conversations with those dance teachers

727
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,530
gave me a lot of basis for a dance teacher's life.

728
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,090
It also made me more confident to interpret this character well.

729
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,480
May I ask

730
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,680
the name of that dance drama you watched?

731
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,960
Of course.

732
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,760
It's a dance drama called the Fairy.

733
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,510
I really want to recommend it to you.

734
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,060
You can take a look if you're interested.

735
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,440
It's worth watching.

736
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,460
Okay, thank you.

737
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,530
Are you ready?

738
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,210
Yes.

739
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,810
Mr. Gao, are you ready?

740
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,750
We're going to start the interview.

741
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,470
Ready.

742
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,220
Three, two, one, start.

743
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:20,800
Mr. Gao.

744
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,720
We know that you have been a dancer

745
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,280
for more than 10 years

746
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,580
since you started dancing.

747
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,580
May I ask

748
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,960
what was the opportunity for you

749
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,670
to create this dance drama, "the Fairy"?

750
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,900
Actually all of this

751
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,160
started from the fairy in my heart.

752
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:35,790
When I was young,

753
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,500
I was dancing in this theater.

754
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,640
At that time, I saw a sister dancing

755
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,380
like a fairy.

756
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,470
After that, I insisted on learning dancing.

757
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,900
Until now,

758
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,510
re-staging of this dance drama

759
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,900
is also to allow more people

760
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,050
to see it.

761
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,790
OK. Thank you, Mr. Gao.

762
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,580
That's all for today's interview.

763
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,030
Please get ready with other dancers

764
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,190
for styling.

765
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,690
We'll have a photographer here

766
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,680
to take some stage photos for you.

767
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,320
OK. It's me who should thank you.

768
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,150
It's an honor

769
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,080
to be in your magazine.

770
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,540
I'll get ready first.

771
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,020
Thank you.

772
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:20,750
Let's go.

773
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,380
Let's find a quiet place to eat.

774
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,650
Are they really together?

775
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,760
It's really hard to believe.

776
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,390
I misunderstood her before.

777
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,390
I rubbed her the wrong way.

778
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,390
Forget about them. Get to work.

779
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:47,920
Here. Take this.

780
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,250
Help me carry it. Hurry.

781
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,030
Slowly.

782
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,670
Why are you here now?

783
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,590
I told you to be here at 2 p.m.

784
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,340
You workaholic.

785
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,450
I'm afraid you won't eat well,

786
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,220
so I came to supervise you.

787
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,340
It feels so good to make our relationship public.

788
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,300
Everyone must be jealous now.

789
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,620
Eat more.

790
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,190
They smell so good.

791
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,890
They smell like our family's cooking.

792
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,160
Why are you here?

793
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,400
I should be asking you that.

794
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,870
We're here to work.

795
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,010
Work.

796
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,520
By the way, Ms. Lin,

797
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,590
my silly brother has been giving you a lot of trouble

798
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,840
at work, right?

799
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,590
Sister,

800
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,030
Stop teasing her.

801
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,670
I'm with your brother now.
