[Episode 21]

4
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,650
Justice has long arms.

5
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,460
Although the surveillance footage

6
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,710
was tampered with,

7
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,320
the person you sent

8
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,240
appeared somewhere else.

9
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,650
The police is on their way.

10
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,050
They'll catch him soon.

11
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,530
He'll confess

12
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,700
who is behind him.

13
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,610
If it were you,

14
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,329
I would ask you,

15
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,770
your son,

16
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,220
and the Wei family

17
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,200
to pay the price.

18
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,090
I did it.

19
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,380
It has nothing to do with Haodong.

20
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,450
He knew nothing.

21
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,410
Fine. I'll turn myself in

22
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,910
and take full responsibility.

23
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,490
Chairman Gu,

24
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,560
please give Wei family a way out

25
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,630
for the sake of the friendship of Gu and Wei families.

26
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,460
I beg you.

27
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:40,980
Friendship of Gu and Wei families?

28
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,960
Have you ever cared about it?

29
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,620
Fortunately, Yancheng is fine now.

30
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,040
And Muyu pleaded with me to let you go.

31
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,920
That's why I invited you here today.

32
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,460
Otherwise,

33
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,920
I'll make the Wei family lose its foothold.

34
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,200
It's all my fault.

35
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,150
It's all my fault.

36
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,210
I can take full responsibility.

37
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,490
I can.

38
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,540
Please don't

39
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,410
involve my son and the Wei family,

40
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,230
okay?

41
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,730
I promise you.

42
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,000
Turn yourself in now.

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,600
I'll keep my promise.

44
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,280
Okay.

45
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:37,940
Sorry.

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,040
Chairman Gu.

47
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,380
Because of this,

48
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,180
my son cut ties with me.

49
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,130
Because of me,

50
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,630
he and Muyu haven't been together.

51
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,430
But I know

52
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,720
he really likes Muyu.

53
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,430
So please,

54
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,510
let them be together.

55
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,720
Don't break them up because of me, okay?

56
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,010
Don't worry.

57
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,840
I don't want my granddaughter to be sad again.

58
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,050
Thank you.

59
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,020
Thank you.

60
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,520
It's hard for you, isn't it?

61
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,030
Fortunately, she stopped

62
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,170
and acted like a mother.

63
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,810
She made a mistake,

64
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,030
so she has to take responsibility.

65
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,970
Only in this way

66
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,200
can she and I truly be mother and son.

67
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,290
I apologize to you again

68
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:44,800
for what my mother did.

69
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,840
I'm leaving.

70
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,070
Mr. Liu,

71
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,300
you should be glad that you have a good son.

72
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,550
Who are you looking for?

73
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,350
Where is the patient in this ward?

74
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,540
He's awake.

75
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,190
He was discharged with his belongings yesterday morning.

76
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,410
Thank you.

77
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:45,620
Boss.

78
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,230
Why are you looking at me like that?

79
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,740
Is there a problem?

80
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,020
I checked it carefully when I went out today.

81
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,070
I won't disgrace the company.

82
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:53,690
No.

83
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,730
That's good.

84
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,710
Just tell me if there's any problem.

85
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,550
I will solve it.

86
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,880
Why do I feel he's a little different?

87
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,830
He's not as fierce as yesterday.

88
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:26,810
Boss,

89
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,460
anything I can help?

90
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,450
No.

91
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,690
You may just say it nicely.

92
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,950
Why are you yelling?

93
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,810
Tell me if you need anything.

94
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,909
I'm always here.

95
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,850
I am proud of myself.

96
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,510
That's 80% similar to the Flying Fairy.

[Shao Jie]

98
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,810
Hello, boss.

99
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:25,920
This is an emergency.

100
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,780
Come to the sculpture room now.

101
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,570
Something happened in the company?

102
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,810
No, it's me.

103
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,430
You?

104
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,810
What happened?

105
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,580
Tell me more.

106
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,730
My hands keep trembling

107
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,740
once I pick up the carving knife.

108
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,830
What happened?

109
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,790
What has happened these years?

110
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,300
Didn't you forget about the accident?

111
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,310
Do you have muscle memory?

112
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,250
What car accident?

113
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,610
Is your personal assistant

114
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,380
by your side right now?

115
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,380
She's outside.

116
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,820
Listen to me carefully.

117
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,170
Only she can solve this.

118
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,060
It's no use looking for me.

119
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,900
I have something to do.

120
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,650
Bye.

121
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,750
Your year-end bonus is gone.

122
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,500

Why are you here?

125
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,140
Gu Yancheng is sculpting inside.

126
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,050
Keep your voice down.

127
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,670
I have something to talk to you.

128
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:23,800
Are you free now?

129
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,610
It's working time.

130
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,600
I have to send Mr. Gu back later.

131
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,000
Well,

132
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,060
Gu Yancheng is awake.

133
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,430
I'll wait for him here with you.

134
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,370
I don't think it's a good idea.

135
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,240
I came to talk to you today.

136
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,570
I won't go back alone.

137
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,820
It must take some time for Gu Yancheng to come out.

138
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,370
Okay, let's talk outside.

139
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,640
Xun Yuxuan.

140
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,630
Boss, why are you out?

141
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,340
Who is this?

142
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,250
Don't you know Bai Bin?

143
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,290
Your friend?

144
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,770
Yes, this is my friend.

145
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,100
He wants to talk to me.

146
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,430
Remember,

147
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,070
don't bring anyone in next time.

148
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,400
Come in. I have something to ask you.

149
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,970
What do you mean, Mr. Gu?

150
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,020
Gu Yancheng is in a special situation.

151
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,580
I'll tell you the details later.

152
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,880
What are you waiting for?

153
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:23,680
Come in.

154
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,440
Keep in touch.

155
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,280
Bye.

156
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,000
He doesn't recognize me.

157
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,570
Mr. Gu, what can I do for you?

158
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,370
Please explain to me

159
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,180
what happened when I had a car accident?

160
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,830
You remember the accident?

161
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,340
Now, answer my questions only.

162
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:05,970
No questions.

163
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,540
It was five years ago

164
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,940
after the seventh Golden Sculpture Award.

165
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,700
It was an accident.

166
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,660
What does the accident have to do with my sculpting?

167
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,780
You hurt your hands in the accident,

168
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,940
and then you couldn't carry a carving knife.

169
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,820
Although your hands were cured later,

170
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,730
you couldn't finish the sculpture

171
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,740
because of psychological effects.

172
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,670
No wonder Shao Jie hid the accident from me.

173
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,410
Boss.

174
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,040
Is something wrong with the sculpture?

175
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,300
What problem can I have?

176
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,160
Maybe this is a good chance.

177
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,200
Boss,

178
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,580
take a closer look.

179
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,860
Do I look the same as

180
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,320
the fairy you're sculpting?

181
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,530
Because

182
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,930
I was your model here.

183
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,500
You?

184
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,940
My model?

185
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,240
If you don't believe me,

186
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,760
I'll stand here.

187
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,280
You can try.

188
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,940
The Golden Sculpture Award is about to begin.

189
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,710
I can't give up halfway because of a small problem.

190
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,790
From picking up the stone,

191
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,370
design, outlining, sculpting, retouching, glowing,

192
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,520
polishing to finally matching the pedestal,

193
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,150
it takes a lot of effort

194
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,240
to have an artwork with soul.

195
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,580
The artist

196
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,660
must be devoted to every step

197
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,530
passionately.

198
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,070
This process is just like life.

199
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,260
I'm also sculpting and practicing myself.

200
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,740
I feel like something is missing.

201
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,920
What are you doing?

202
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,000
I must be dreaming.

203
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,870
Of course not.

204
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,950
No.

205
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,580
Then why do you let me hug you?

206
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,460
It must be a dream.

207
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,550
Let go of me!

208
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,770
No.

209
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,080
You're so strong.

210
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,220
You shouldn't be an assistant.

211
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,140
You should be a bodyguard.

212
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,310
Just let me hug you a little longer.

213
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,220
Let go.

214
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,450
No.

215
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,970
How long are you going to hug me?

216
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,070
Just a moment.

217
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,380
I'll count to three.

218
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,070
If you don't let go,

219
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,930
you will pay the price.

220
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,320
Got it.

221
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,370
Count it.

222
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,720
One.

223
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:07,810
Two.

224
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,000
Three.

225
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,359
Boss.

226
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,560
Why do you look so pale?

227
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,890
Is making the sculpture too tiring?

228
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,410
What are you doing?

229
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,520
I can't feel my feet.

230
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,280
I won't be fooled by you again.

231
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,730
I really can't move.

232
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,600
Sit down.

233
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,670
Since you're my model,

234
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,030
take a break.

235
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,220
Thank you, boss.

236
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,270
You're so nice.

237
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,810
You just praised me and now you're turning your back on me?

238
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,330
Who is it?

239
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:55,690
Haodong.

240
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,200
Open the door.

241
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,150
I know everything.

242
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,240
Muyu,

243
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:11,890
you may leave.

244
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,320
I saw the news.

245
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,440
Aunt turned herself in.

246
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,550
Grandpa told me everything.

247
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,410
I know you must be sad.

248
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,490
Muyu,

249
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,650
stop being in love with me.

250
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Why?

251
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,670
Grandpa told me everything.

252
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,750
Your mother agreed to our relationship.

253
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,470
Grandpa has no objections.

254
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,260
The Gu and Wei families

255
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,930
are no longer our obstacles.

256
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,820
My mother taught me

257
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,590
to treat Gu Yancheng as my rival since I was young.

258
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,900
But I failed.

259
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,270
I'm not as good as him in everything.

260
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,730
My mom said I'm useless.

261
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,580
She said I was a piece of junk.

262
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,190
So I began to mimic

263
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,810
the way Gu Yancheng was like.

264
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,510
But I couldn't find myself,

265
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,050
neither in sculpting nor in other aspects.

266
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,210
But she never knew

267
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,780
I never wanted to compete with Gu Yancheng.

268
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,260
I never did.

269
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,710
She even didn't know

270
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,690
that I really liked sculpting.

271
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,040
But for her vanity,

272
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,520
I gave up on sculpting.

273
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,890
Unexpectedly,

274
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,010
in order to defeat Gu Group,

275
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,280
she did so many things to harm your family

276
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,350
in secret.

277
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,480
I am too shameful to see you.

278
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,430
Muyu.

279
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,560
Actually, I...

280
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:21,880
Thank you.

281
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,140
Just leave.

282
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,620
Leave.

283
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,520
Muyu.

284
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,430
Bai Bin.

285
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,420
Why are you still here?

286
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,970
I said I wanted to talk to you.

287
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,420
So I waited until you get off work.

288
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,070
This man has a bad face.

289
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,790
He's annoying.

290
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,950
May I know your name?

291
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,590
I can't explain what happened

292
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,180
to Gu Yancheng.

293
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,210
If he asks any strange questions,

294
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,590
don't be surprised.

295
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,570
Don't worry. I know what to do.

296
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,620
Hello, Mr. Gu.

297
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,340
My name is Bai Bin.

298
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,420
I'm an investor of Yiyu Garden.

299
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,720
Your company and I are in partnership.

300
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,320
You made all the sculpture design in the garden.

301
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,120
Yiyu Garden?

302
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,510
Shao Jie mentioned it to me.

303
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,600
Sorry, Mr. Bai.

304
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,910
I've been seriously ill recently.

305
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,460
I can't remember anything.

306
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,740
Please forgive me.

307
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,330
You're welcome, Mr. Gu.

308
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,740
When you were hospitalized,

309
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,610
I visited you.

310
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,530
I know you were discharged recently.

311
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,540
I came here today

312
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,790
to have dinner with you.

313
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,570
Wish you all the best, Mr. Gu.

314
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,410
Boss,

315
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,930
Bai Bin meant no harm.

316
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,660
When you were hospitalized,

317
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,380
Professor Shi was invited by Bai Bin.

318
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,840
I didn't expect Mr. Bai to be so considerate.

319
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,870
How can I ask Mr. Bai to treat me?

320
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,020
Mr. Bai saved my life.

321
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,970
Of course it's my treat.

322
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,460
Sure.

323
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,450
Mr. Gu, thank you for tonight.

324
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,890
Please.

325
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,170
Please.

326
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,530
My sixth sense tells me

327
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,780
this meal is more terrifying than the Hongmen Banquet.

328
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,570
This is the only decent restaurant nearby.

329
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,510
If you are not used to Sichuan cuisine,

330
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,170
we can go to another restaurant.

331
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,350
-It's fine. -It's fine.

332
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,700
I remember you can't eat spicy food.

333
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,550
Why not?

334
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,000
I can eat them now.

335
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,880
Amnesia will cause the change of taste?

336
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,550
Can you do it too?

337
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,690
Don't worry about me.

338
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:32,890
As long as you like it.

339
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,780
Who wants to order?

340
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,320
-You. -You.

341
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:46,690
Not bad.

342
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,880
It's not too spicy.

343
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,770
Yes, it's just right.

344
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,520
Boss.

345
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,360
You're not acting tough, are you?

346
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,350
If you can't stand it, don't eat it.

347
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:06,850
This is nothing.

348
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,430
By the way,

349
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,690
next time when I carve,

350
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,710
you also must be my side.

351
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,380
Okay.

352
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,210
Mr. Bai, you're here

353
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,020
not just for a welcome party, are you?

354
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,220
What do you want from my employee?

355
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,500
Are you trying to poach my employee?

356
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,050
You misunderstood.

357
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,130
Of course.

358
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,270
Yuxuan is a good employee.

359
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,450
I also hope she can come to my company

360
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,000
so that I can give her enough freedom.

361
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,840
And I won't interfere with her private life.

362
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:50,920
Thank you.

363
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,190
Actually,

364
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,780
Bai Bin came here

365
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,070
for nothing important.

366
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:03,660
It's just that

367
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,380
he happened to help me,

368
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,470
so I owe him a meal.

369
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:09,510
Really?

370
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,040
Yes.

371
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,210
Right?

372
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,590
You can only enjoy Sichuan cuisine when it is still hot.

373
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,830
It won't taste good when it's cold.

374
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:03,770
Bai Bin.

375
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,050
You're here.

376
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,340
Have a seat.

377
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,740
How is Gu Yancheng?

378
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,830
I've sent him back.

379
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,920
What can I do for you?

380
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,110
I wanted to talk to you.

381
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,630
But seeing what happened to Gu Yancheng,

382
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,610
I think I need to make it clear.

383
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,850
Do you know anything?

384
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,480
Does he not even remember you?

385
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,550
Yes.

386
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,610
He forgot me

387
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,310
and everything between us.

388
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:55,710
He lost his memory.

389
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,120
Do you still remember the Flying Fairy?

390
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,210
Yes.

391
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,070
It's the painting inherited by the Gu family.

392
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,430
Actually the painting originated from

393
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,450
my ancestor.

394
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,300
That painting belongs to your ancestors?

395
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:22,500
Yes.

396
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,850
My ancestors gave the painting to Gu family

397
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,420
and asked them to find and protect the lady in the painting.

398
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,750
But what does this have to do with Gu Yancheng?

399
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,790
In order to make Gu Group keep their promise,

400
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,070
my ancestors made a contract

401
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,700
in a way.

402
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,700
This contract was deeply buried

403
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,800
in Gu's recessive genes.

404
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,420
Someone from Gu Group will inherit it.

405
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,850
It shows as a birthmark.

406
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,250
The one who has this birthmark

407
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,930
will have a natural desire to protect the lady in the painting.

408
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,070
Maybe

409
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,980
he might think he likes her.

410
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,010
How is that possible?

411
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,950
This is ridiculous.

412
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,540
If it is like what you say,

413
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,730
Grandpa Gu and Gu Muyu are both members of the Gu family.

414
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,980
Why are they fine?

415
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,490
Genes are mysterious.

416
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,130
Not everyone

417
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,330
inherits the genes from their parents.

418
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,210
And some recessive genes

419
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,920
will be stimulated in special situations.

420
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,020
They will be turned from recessive to dominant.

421
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,470
It happens that Gu Yancheng

422
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,980
has inherited this gene after generations.

423
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,140
That's why he can sense it when you are in danger,

424
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,280
and misunderstand that as love for you.

425
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,280
He does feel my danger.

426
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,430
But I don't agree with everything you said.

427
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,310
I can feel his sincerity.

428
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,200
We can put it in this way.

429
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,690
This gene is like an AI chip.

430
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,310
When he met you,

431
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,180
this chip was inserted.

432
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,730
His interest in and love for you

433
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,080
are the consciousness of this chip,

434
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,080
instead of his own consciousness.

435
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,200
That's impossible.

436
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,180
This is ridiculous.

437
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,080
How do you prove what you said?

438
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:28,730
You can check

439
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,850
whether the birthmark on his chest is still there.

440
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,050
Could the birthmark

441
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,740
disappear?

442
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,860
[Amy]

443
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,180
Hello.

444
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,610
Where are you?

445
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,080
Didn't we agree to go back to the crew tonight?

446
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,820
You need to act tomorrow morning.

447
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,100
I'll be there soon.

448
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,060
From your description,

449
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,260
Mr. Gu lost his memory for the past five years.

450
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,570
That means

451
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,710
he only has his memory before the accident.

452
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,520
That's right, Dr. Lin.

453
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,270
Although he has lost his memories,

454
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,100
I think he's still the same person I know.

455
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,880
But sometimes he's a little different.

456
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,590
It feels familiar and strange.

457
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,460
The selective amnesia

458
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,060
should be analyzed specifically.

459
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,450
One is

460
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,700
caused by congestion

461
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,220
due to brain injury.

462
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,140
The other

463
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,920
is caused by psychological factors.

464
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,450
But the doctor said he recovered well.

465
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,200
There's no congestion in his brain.

466
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,390
Don't tell me

467
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,590
he really has no feelings for me?

468
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,150
Don't think like that.

469
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,390
Sometimes,

470
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,680
it's not because he doesn't have feelings,

471
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,960
but because you are too important for him.

472
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,820
There's another possibility, that is,

473
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,660
he wants to forget a period of memory

474
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,270
but it affects other memories.

475
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,890
Really?

476
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,800
From what I know about him,

477
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,170
we can't force him to do what he doesn't want.

478
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:47,950
Besides,

479
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,250
you said his attitude towards you improved recently.

480
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,800
That means he cares about you

481
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,790
in his subconscious.

482
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,530
It's just that he hasn't realised it yet.

483
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,340
What should I do

484
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,720
to regain his memory?

485
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,180
I remember Yancheng mentioned

486
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,880
that as long as you're in danger,

487
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,780
his body

488
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,620
can't help protecting you.

489
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,909
Maybe you can have a try.

490
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,449
I've tried.

491
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,920
Step by step.

492
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,230
Don't rush it.

493
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,449
But you need to make sure you are safe

494
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,139
when you try this method.

495
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,250
Don't put yourself in real danger.

496
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,080
I need to believe in science.

497
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:38,650
[Chairman's Office]

498
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,420
Are you ready?

499
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:41,730
Have you memorized the lines?

500
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:42,739
Do your best.

501
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,260
Will this really work?

502
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,530
Of course. Why not?

503
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,690
Shao Jie says

504
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,520
Gu Yancheng is going to attend an event.

505
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,820
He's changing his clothes inside.

506
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,360
Don't worry.

507
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,580
We're ready to perform for you.

508
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,230
You also said

509
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,740
this is the first time for you two to see each other in this way.

510
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,380
Surely it is.

511
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,250
But if we act like this,

512
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,970
will he be angry?

513
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,490
No, don't worry.

514
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,160
Go.

515
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,330
Good luck.

516
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,140
Bye.

517
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,800
You...

518
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,860
Why didn't you knock?

519
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,050
The lines.

520
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,280
What are the lines?

521
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,450
Right.

522
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,230
Don't shout.

523
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,540
Don't shout.

524
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,510
I can let go,

525
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,200
but don't shout.

526
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,350
What are you doing?

527
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:56,570
Let go!

528
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,980
What are you doing?

529
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,060
Where is your birthmark?

530
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,990
Why did your birthmark disappear?

531
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,070
Let go!

532
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:03,780
How did you know?

533
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,540
Of course I know.

534
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,440
Because your birthmark...

535
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,790
You're already dressed?

536
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,390
Go on. Don't stop.

537
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,070
Stop!

538
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,890
When did your birthmark disappear?

539
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,240
I don't know.

540
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,910
It's gone after I woke up.

541
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,660
This isn't in the script.

542
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,170
You told me before

543
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,080
that every time I was in danger,

544
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,960
your birthmark would hurt a little.

545
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,200
That's why you could always come to protect me.

546
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:42,850
No wonder.

547
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,740
No wonder you can't sense me now.

548
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,840
It's because of the fact that the birthmark disappeared.

549
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,040
Sensory?

550
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,070
Protect you?

551
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,200
Boss.

552
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,150
Sorry to bother you.

553
00:36:59,300 --> 00:36:59,680
I...

554
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,470
I'm just here to deliver flowers.

555
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,150
What happened?

556
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,510
Can't it work?

557
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,650
Do you have to go further?

558
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:26,980
Huixin,

559
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,870
I found out something worse.

560
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,820
There's something worse than this?

561
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,010
Boss.

562
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,160
Anything else?

563
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,550
Did you collude with her?

564
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,610
No.

565
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,960
Why would I do something wrong to you?

566
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,480
I'm a loyal friend.

567
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,210
You look happy.

568
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,770
The heaven and earth can prove my loyalty to you.

569
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,430
The sun and the moon are my witnesses.

570
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,810
Even if we colluded,

571
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,550
it's for your own good.

572
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,250
Well,

573
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,380
she just talked about the birthmark on my chest.

574
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:05,850
Is that true?

575
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,020
You did tell me

576
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,990
that you would want to protect her.

577
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,820
But I don't know

578
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,260
what it has to do with your birthmark.

579
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,500
You must have told her in private.

580
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,240
After all,

581
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,850
your relationship

582
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,400
were much closer than you think.

583
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,540
I'll wait for you outside.

584
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,760
What are you doing?

585
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:47,930
Let go!

586
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,390
What are you doing?

587
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,410
Where is your birthmark?

588
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,410
Why did your birthmark disappear?

589
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,460
Let go!

590
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,120
How did you know?

591
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:58,820
Of course I know.

592
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,810
What on earth did I forget?

593
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,920
How is that possible?

594
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,370
I know it's hard to believe,

595
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,310
but this is the truth.

596
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,810
What would you do next?

597
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:18,770
Huixin,

598
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,550
I want to try again.

599
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,550
But I need Shao Jie's help.

600
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:23,580
No problem.

601
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,210
What's your plan?

602
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,060
I'll ask him to make arrangements.

603
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:32,870
Okay.

604
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,020
Alright. I will pull over here.

605
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,640
Why didn't my driver come to send me home?

606
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,170
You've been staring at me all the way,

607
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,850
but you didn't say anything.

608
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,680
It's because you miss Xun Yuxuan.

609
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:56,960
No.

610
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,160
As a employee of Gu Group, she is absent without asking for leave.

611
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,510
Ask the personnel department

612
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,500
to train her.

613
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:13,470
You're so stubborn.

614
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,870
Welcome home, Mr. Gu.

615
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,220
As my driver, why didn't you pick me up?

616
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,490
What are you doing at my house?

617
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,980
I'm working part-time.

618
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:26,980
Part-time job?

619
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,360
From now on,

620
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,020
I'm not only your driver,

621
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,510
but also your personal assistant.
