00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,490
Breakfast is ready.

5
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,770
Miss Yuxuan.

6
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,780
Why are you here?

7
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,980
Didn't you say

8
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,020
you couldn't carve

9
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,340
without me?

10
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,860
Besides,

11
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,829
the Golden Sculpture Award is about to begin.

12
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,300
I want you to carve with me.

13
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,840
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

14
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,350
My feeling for you is not love.

15
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,690
You still want to stay by my side?

16
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,670
Yes.

17
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,560
Thank you.

18
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,300
I just want to be with you.

19
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,060
As long as you're happy,

20
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,610
I'm happy.

21
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,770
Then do you have any requirements

22
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,810
for carving with me?

23
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,200
No.

24
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,520
Since you helped me so much,

25
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,990
I don't want to owe you anything.

26
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,940
If you have any wishes

27
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:34,960
or you want anything else,

28
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,100
you can tell me.

29
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,790
I have only one wish,

30
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,230
and you can't make it come true.

31
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,110
I heard it.

32
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,070
Tell me.

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,250
Forget it.

34
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,340
I just hope

35
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,700
you can live happily in the future.

36
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,650
So,

37
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,320
you still want me to regain my memory.

38
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:06,800
How about this?

39
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,700
I'll spare time every day.

40
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,760
You can arrange my time at will,

41
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,010
and I'll try my best to cooperate.

42
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,660
Really?

43
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,430
Think about it yourself.

44
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,400
I'll eat first.

45
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,260
Does this place look familiar to you?

46
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,970
Especially this painting.

47
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,820
I remember

48
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,540
I used to see some exhibitions here.

49
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,240
But I don't remember

50
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,200
we met here.

51
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:58,909
Oh.

52
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,410
Just tell me.

53
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,150
What happened here.

54
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,230
At that time,

55
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,210
we were here.

56
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,720
At that time,

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,350
you thought I was sent by Grandpa

58
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,250
to get close to you.

59
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,590
And I thought you were a crazy narcissistic.

60
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,990
Anyway, the impression we left

61
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,890
to each other is not that good.

62
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,210
Really?

63
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,470
You believe what I say?

64
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,450
Don't you doubt it?

65
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,090
That's my personality.

66
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,780
Look here.

67
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,430
Do you remember?

68
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,880
This place

69
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,110
is where we first confessed our love.

70
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,190
You confessed to me?

71
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:08,650
Please.

72
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,650
Stop being narcissistic.

73
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,150
It's impossible

74
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,530
for me to confess to you.

75
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,750
Based on your current memory,

76
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,140
there have been many things between us

77
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,330
that you didn't expect.

78
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:21,980
And then?

79
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
We got together?

80
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,140
Of course not.

81
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,460
Because

82
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,470
I rejected you.

83
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,140
You rejected me?

84
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,590
Well.

85
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,450
You didn't expect it, did you?

86
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,320
The credibility of this statement is almost non-existent.

87
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,250
No woman would refuse me.

88
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,750
Are you making up stories

89
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:45,490
while I lost my memory?

90
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,420
How about this?

91
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,610
Let's make a bet.

92
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,220
If one day you remember all the things

93
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,780
and find out what I said is true,

94
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,060
you owe me one.

95
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,590
No matter what wish I have,

96
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,530
you have to promise me at that time.

97
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,550
Okay.

98
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,500
I don't believe I would do such a thing.

99
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,360
Then you can wait to be proved wrong.

100
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,320
Boss.

101
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,210
You want to go in?

102
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,460
Yes.

103
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,840
Only Gu's people...

104
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,280
Only Gu's people can enter.

105
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,429
I know.

106
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,789
How do you know?

107
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,169
Because...

108
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,400
Because you agreed to let me in.

109
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,090
You didn't expect it, did you?

110
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,470
How could I do such an irrational thing?

111
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,080
Maybe this is because

112
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,740
you were in love.

113
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,170
You said...

114
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,040
Yuxuan.

115
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,000
I didn't realize it until later.

116
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,930
I want to see you

117
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,050
because I like you.

118
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,730
That's why I want you to stay with me.

119
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,060
It's not because of sculpture,

120
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,540
or the ancestral motto.

121
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,520
You did so much for me

122
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,820
to keep me from giving up carving.

123
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,400
Thank you so much.

124
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,460
I want you to stay with me

125
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,570
because I like you.

126
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,110
I want to protect you.

127
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,890
It's not because of sculpture

128
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,920
or the ancestral motto.

129
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,110
I finally understand those dreams.

130
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,380
They are telling me

131
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,050
that you, Xun Yuxuan

132
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,810
are my destined one

133
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,140
and my dream in the mortal world.

134
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,220
I carved this?

135
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,660
How could I carve such a rough thing?

136
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,690
Is it because of that car accident?

137
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,090
Do you remember now?

138
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,350
No.

139
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,080
Then,

140
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,770
can you do me a favor?

141
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:14,820
Sure.

142
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,530
Can I dance with you?

143
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,760
I don't think I have any other choice.

144
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,910
Boss, what's wrong?

145
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,320
Are you okay?

146
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:12,540
I'm fine.

147
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,320
Maybe I've been too tired recently.

148
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,960
Let's go back.

149
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:19,740
Let's go.

150
00:15:59,380 --> 00:15:59,620
Here.

151
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,250
Have some milk.

152
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,190
Put it on the table.

153
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,880
I'll drink it later.

154
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,170
I just heated it.

155
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:07,950
It'll get cold later.

156
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,480
Well.

157
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,630
Your boyfriend is smart, right?

158
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,590
It's because I trained you well.

159
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:34,780
By the way,

160
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,810
I have to go to school tomorrow.

161
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:37,580
Okay.

162
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,940
Tomorrow is the weekend.

163
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,640
Right.

164
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,220
Our weekly date task

165
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,020
is not completed yet.

166
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,690
But I don't seem to have time this week.

167
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,490
Let's do it ext time.

168
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,170
What a pity!

169
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,630
What a pity!

170
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,480
What?

171
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,380
Tomorrow

172
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,290
is our graduation ceremony.

173
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,060
and we'll take graduation photos.

174
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,010
I wanted you to go with me.

175
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,730
Since you don't have time,

176
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,730
then forget it.

177
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,810
I'll go to karaoke with my classmates

178
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,560
and have dinner.

179
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,190
If we drink at the party,

180
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,400
we'll stay in a hotel.

181
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,829
You don't have to wait for me.

182
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,710
A party?

183
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,320
A boy-girl party?

184
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,230
Yes.

185
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm free tomorrow.

186
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,310
I can go.

187
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,340
To be honest,

188
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,300
I want to experience

189
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,540
the feeling of being a student again.

190
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,620
It's decided then.

191
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:49,740
By the way,

192
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,620
I have to prepare a graduation gift for you.

193
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,350
What do you want?

194
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,000
A gift.

195
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,090
I can have a gift?

196
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,260
Of course.

197
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,320
Graduation is a big deal.

198
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,070
Of course I need to buy you a gift to commemorate it.

199
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,160
I don't want anything.

200
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,570
Just stay with me.

201
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,380
Good boy.

202
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,720
Don't pat me like I'm a child.

203
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,580
Okay.

204
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,290
Why are you so cute?

205
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:16,870
It hurts.

206
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,220
Here.

207
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,750
Thank you.

208
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,990
Why didn't you accompany Gu Yancheng today?

209
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,410
Gu Yancheng said he’s off today.

210
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,930
He also gave me a day off.

211
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:46,810
To be honest,

212
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,480
Gu Yancheng is a good boss.

213
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,760
He also pays during holidays.

214
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,330
You didn't go there these days,

215
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,470
but he didn't deduct your salary.

216
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,010
But as a boyfriend,

217
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,530
I dare not compliment him.

218
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,840
You know what?

219
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,770
These days

220
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,330
I took him to many places

221
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,920
where we had memories.

222
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,380
But he...

223
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,540
Huixin.

224
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,610
I really have no confidence in myself.

225
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,610
Yuxuan,

226
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,910
your new boyfriend is here.

227
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,960
Looks like Bai Bin still has feelings for you.

228
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,220
Don't talk nonsense.

229
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,100
Bai Bin, why are you here?

230
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,210
I heard

231
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,470
there was a movie called Flower Flying Fire.

232
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,180
It's quite popular.

233
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,850
To thank you

234
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,620
for telling me a story so patiently last time.

235
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,600
Movie on me.

236
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,000
Huixin.

237
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,020
Let's watch it together.

238
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,800
This kind of commercial movie is meaningless.

239
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,790
Gu Yancheng.

240
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,050
Didn't you say you're off today?

241
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:49,910
Why are you here?

242
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,090
I said I wanted to rest, but I didn't say I would rest at home.

243
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,890
Gu Yancheng,

244
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,620
I won't allow you to hurt Xun Yuxuan again.

245
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,070
I hurt her?

246
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,600
She has done enough for you.

247
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:00,930
I told you

248
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,210
I would be by her side from now on.

249
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,110
Who are you to her?

250
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,500
Why should she listen to you?

251
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,660
Who are you to her?

252
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,470
Who are you to control her?

253
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,660
I'm her boss.

254
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,540
Bai Bin.

255
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,630
I have something for you.

256
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:26,920
Bai Bin.

257
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,900
Here's your handkerchief.

258
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,820
I only see the newcomer laughing,

259
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,620
who can notice the crying old lover?

260
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,570
You misunderstood.

261
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,040
Gu Yancheng and I have made up.

262
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,610
You have made up?

263
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,930
Does he remember you?

264
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:58,950
No.

265
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,060
Since he didn't,

266
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,450
he has no right to meddle in your business.

267
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,800
That's none of your business.

268
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,780
Xun Yuxuan is helping me regain my memory.

269
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,660
Do you think it will work?

270
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,180
Have you ever remembered her?

271
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,860
-I'll be there in a few days. -I need to answer the phone.

272
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,300
Hello?

273
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,240
Hello?

274
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,710
I'm here.

275
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:35,890
Where are you?

276
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,530
I'll go find you.

277
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,920
Okay, wait for me there.

278
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,460
I'll pick you up.

279
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:38,940
Okay.

280
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,020
I'm leaving.

281
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,560
-My girlfriend is here. -Okay.

282
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,150
Bye.

283
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:50,710
Wanning.

284
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,430
Why are you looking at me like that?

285
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,670
Don't I look good in this?

286
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,640
You look good.

287
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,500
It's just that this is the first time I've seen you in a bachelor's uniform,

288
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,910
it suddenly occurrs to me that you are still a student.

289
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,140
I'm a little envious.

290
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,990
I shouldn't have dressed like this today.

291
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,960
I look old.

292
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,030
You're not old.

293
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,700
You are the most beautiful in my eyes.

294
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,990
To praise your dating with me

295
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,150
during your busy schedule,

296
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,130
I prepared a surprise for you.

297
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,350
What is this?

298
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,150
Come on, just follow me.

299
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,800
Why do you want me to dress like this?

300
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,710
I want to experience the sweet love on campus

301
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,600
with you.

302
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,870
Why are you so cute?

303
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,010
I can't stand it.

304
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,130
I need to record this moment.

305
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:49,770
No hurry.

306
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:51,700
Miss,

307
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,770
as your boyfriend and tour guide,

308
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,850
let me show you around

309
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,180
and experience the sweet love on campus.

310
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,790
It seems

311
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,800
You often take girls on bike rides.

312
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,860
No.

313
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,230
Just once, okay?

314
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,770
Who?

315
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,540
Who else?

316
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,640
My sister, of course.

317
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,360
Xun Yuxuan.

318
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,540
That's more like it.

319
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,100
But I really

320
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,510
didn't experience this

321
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,670
when I was in college.

322
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,060
Come on.

323
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,720
Come up.

324
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,170
From now on,

325
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,740
this position only belongs to my girlfriend.

326
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,340
Sit tight.

327
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:36,470
Let's go.

328
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,460
Guys,

329
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,000
this is our school's mecca for photography.

330
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,090
Do you need to take a photo?

331
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,570
Why is this a mecca for photography?

332
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,770
Because...

333
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,930
Please have a look.

334
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,130
You look nice.

335
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,150
I can do it this time.

336
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,670
Why are you here?

337
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:38,850
Where is Xun Yuxuan?

338
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,690
She asked me to pick you up.

339
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,460
Boss,

340
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,090
Are you really ready?

341
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,280
Let's go.

342
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,380
Shao Jie.

343
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,080
What are you doing here?

344
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,800
Are we going to watch a play?

345
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,110
What happened that day?

346
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,050
Anyway...

347
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,360
Boss.

348
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,330
Sit down and watch.

349
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,180
Go away.

350
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,030
You're a pervert.

351
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,810
This is my first kiss.

352
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,000
This is my privacy.

353
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,230
Why should I tell you?

354
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,630
Do you know

355
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,340
that taking photos without permission

356
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,930
is a serious violation of privacy.

357
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,090
I asked for leave.

358
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,700
Boss, what took you so long?

359
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,670
You're up.

360
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,380
Are you feeling better?

361
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,110
Please hang in there.

362
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,830
That's the hero

363
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,860
I want to see.

364
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,200
What are you waiting for? Put it on me.

365
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,540
Ruoxi.

366
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,250
Then with what joy we shall renew our life, when I return safe from the dreadful strife.

367
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,510
But, if the Fates should decree death, my spirit will forever live with thee.

368
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,760
Yuxuan.

369
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,210
I...

370
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,660
Yuxuan.

371
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,090
I finally found you.

372
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,880
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

373
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,500
Impossible.

374
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,720
If you're not Yuxuan,

375
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,030
then you are...

376
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,970
My name is Bai Ruoxi.

377
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,370
Bai Ruoxi?

378
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:05,570
Could it be

379
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,980
that you're the one in the Flying Fairy?

380
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,780
Why do you have my portrait?

381
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,350
That painting

382
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,230
was passed down from the Gu family.

383
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,830
I don't know where that painting came from,

384
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,290
But my ancestors

385
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,320
asked us to protect the person in the painting.

386
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,360
Are you the one we need to protect?

387
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:30,130
Then why do you want to protect me?

388
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,540
A thousand years have passed.

389
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,300
There's no way to know.

390
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,360
You just called me Yuxuan.

391
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,420
It sounds like a girl's name.

392
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:42,790
Yes.

393
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,070
You look exactly like her.

394
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,460
Is she the one you love?

395
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,030
I love her very much.

396
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,200
Gu Yancheng.

397
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:53,910
Gu Yancheng.

398
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,260
I finally found you.

399
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,130
Let's go home.

400
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:57,780
Okay.

401
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,620
All along, life has a limited period.

402
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,030
Why not cherish the ones in front of you?

403
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,390
You're awake.

404
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,720
I'll call the doctor.

405
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,330
Wait...

406
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,160
Wait a minute.

407
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,880
I'm thirsty.

408
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,360
Thirsty?

409
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,370
Are you thirsty?

410
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,700
Let me get you some water.

411
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,620
Gu Yancheng.

412
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,370
Do you recall anything?

413
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:43,870
What?

414
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:44,970
Let me ask you.

415
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,350
Do you recall anything?

416
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,100
Bai Bin.

417
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,620
Stop asking.

418
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,310
Gu Yancheng just woke up.

419
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,470
Let him rest for a while.

420
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,370
Here.

421
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,560
Have some water.

422
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,540
Feed me.

423
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,140
Feed you?

424
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:06,300
Okay.

425
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:09,670
Come on.

426
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:11,350
Slow down.

427
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:14,650
Be careful.

428
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,820
Drink slowly.

429
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,740
It's getting late.

430
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,480
I won't bother you.

431
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,710
Mr. Bai, why don't you go back and rest early?

432
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,830
Yuxuan can stay here and take care of me.

433
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:43,830
Bai Bin.

434
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,490
Go back first.

435
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,840
You've worked hard today.

436
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,090
I can stay and take care of him alone.

437
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,190
Let me see you off.

438
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,540
Do you want some water?

439
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,580
Help me lie down.

440
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,530
Take a rest.

441
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,140
I'm sorry.

442
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,870
Why are you sorry?

443
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,160
I was too anxious this time.

444
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,210
I always wanted you to remember me.

445
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,940
I didn't care about your feelings.

446
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,180
Don't worry.

447
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,720
I won't force you anymore.

448
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,470
And I won't bother you anymore.

449
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:09,900
Silly girl.

450
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,790
She hasn't realized I've regained my memory.

451
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,260
Let me tease her.

452
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,950
Then how will you compensate me

453
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,260
since you made me faint this time?

454
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:20,960
Compensation?

455
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,550
Okay.

456
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,920
What do you want?

457
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,900
Stay by my side

458
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,000
and be my personal assistant.

459
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,200
Do whatever I tell you to do.

460
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,720
If I don't let you go,

461
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,540
you're not allowed to leave.

462
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:39,320
Okay.

463
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,940
Take me to the sculpture room now.

464
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,260
Now?

465
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,740
You just woke up.

466
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,180
You need more rest.

467
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,540
What did you promise me just now?

468
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,020
I'll listen to you.

469
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,750
You can go wherever you want.

470
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,460
I'll get ready.

471
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,510
Why don't you go with me?

472
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:36,500
I can't help much,

473
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,540
so I won't go in.

474
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,100
I'm right here.

475
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,699
Call me if you need anything.

476
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:42,840
From now on,

477
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,420
you have to be with me all the time.

478
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,040
I...

479
00:34:59,170 --> 00:34:59,970
Just stay here with me

480
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:00,920
as usual.

481
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,350
Boss,

482
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,120
your fairy

483
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,960
is very different from the one in the collection room.

484
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,910
Although I don't know a lot,

485
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,750
I think this fairy has surpassed that one.

486
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,420
The real game will begin next week.

487
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,430
I'll finish up as soon as possible.

488
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,050
As for you,

489
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,150
you must stay here with me every day.

490
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,690
No outsiders are allowed to come in,

491
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,240
especially Bai Bin.

492
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,280
Got it.

493
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:45,400
Mr. Gu.

494
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,740
When do you want to go to the sculpture museum tomorrow?

495
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,620
I'll pick you up.

496
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,850
You can stay here today.

497
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,350
This...

498
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,660
I said

499
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,800
to be with me every hour and moment

500
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,650
every day.

501
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,000
What's wrong?

502
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,300
Did you burn yourself?

503
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,170
Maybe I've been sculpting for too long.

504
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,820
My hands are numb.

505
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,770
Your hands are numb?

506
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,120
Do you need to go to the hospital?

507
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,020
No.

508
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,250
I guess

509
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,670
it will hurt more tomorrow morning.

510
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,590
I don't know if I can be carve tomorrow.

511
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:36,750
Well,

512
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,020
let me give you a massage.

513
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,580
You...

514
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,300
Don't worry.

515
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,940
I've been massaging my dad since I was a kid.

516
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,410
He's a taxi driver.

517
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,070
He takes a long ride every day.

518
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,160
His back hurts a lot.

519
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,670
Fine.

520
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,100
Then

521
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,220
give me your arm.

522
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:25,490
What's wrong?

523
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,120
Are you okay?

524
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,600
My shoulder hurts too.

525
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,970
Your shoulder hurts too?

526
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,860
Let me massage your shoulder too.

527
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,760
My waist is not feeling well lately.

528
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,760
Why don't you lie down and let me give you a massage?

529
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,680
Okay.

530
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,060
Put a pillow on it.

531
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:34,510
Boss.

532
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,570
Is the strength okay?

533
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:37,980
Yes.

534
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:38,920
Harder.

535
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,800
What about now?

536
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,710
I still don't feel right.

537
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,680
Not here either.

538
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,860
That's not right.

539
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,620
Why is he insatiable?

540
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,450
Boss.

541
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,620
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

542
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,140
Can you show me?

543
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,990
Right here.

544
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,130
This place?

545
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,660
This is an acupoint.

546
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,190
It needs a lot of strength to work.

547
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,370
It hurts a little.

548
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,240
Hang in there.

549
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,620
Stop. Stop.

550
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:31,920
What are you doing?

551
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,940
You have to endure it.

552
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,170
This acupoint needs a lot of strength to press.

553
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,100
Stop.
