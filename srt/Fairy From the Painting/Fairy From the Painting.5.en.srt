1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,270
You lost.

3
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,789
I'm unlucky today. I'll drink.

4
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,190
What's wrong?

5
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,590
Let's play another day.

6
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,910
What?

7
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,510
Little fairy.

8
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,910
Where did you send Yancheng to?

9
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,110
Something must have happened to Yancheng.

10
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,310
Hotel Hill?

11
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,190
What's going on?

12
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,070
It's hard to explain.

13
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,110
I'm on my way there. Go there quickly.

14
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,310
Okay, I'll be right there.

15
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,870
Hurry up.

16
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,420
Hurry up!

17
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,110
What happened?

18
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,270
What happened to my boss?

19
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,910
As serious as losing his virginity.

20
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,750
Lose virginity?

21
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,240
He hasn't lost his virginity yet?

22
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,550
This lady has such a good figure.

23
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,710
I'm not asking you to look at this.

24
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,310
Think about it.

25
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,070
If this is a trap set by competitors,

26
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,310
they would use it as a menace.

27
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,910
Be it a threat or defamation,

28
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,590
in any case,

29
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,110
it would cause unexpected consequences

30
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,510
to Yancheng and Gu Group.

31
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,430
You mean

32
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,750
Gu Group may lose

33
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,110
the second two billion.

34
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,310
But I'm not sad.

35
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,990
After all, it has nothing to do with me.

36
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,670
This is not the most important thing.

37
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,240
The point is,

38
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,710
aren't you angry at all?

39
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,300
Why should I be angry?

40
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,990
How do you know the boss doesn't like it?

41
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,910
In the middle of the night, beauty is in his arms.

42
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,270
Gu Yancheng.

43
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,870
You are a failure as a man.

44
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:48,870
What did you say?

45
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,310
Think again.

46
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,870
What if the competitors

47
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,390
make use of it and kick us when we're down,

48
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,070
and ruin Gu Group?

49
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,950
Then the Group will go bankrupt.

50
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,750
And you won't get a penny.

51
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,350
All your efforts will be in vain.

52
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,470
No. Absolutely no.

53
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,110
Let's go.

54
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,190
What?

55
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,470
I'll stay here.

56
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,670
You go in first.

57
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,990
Go.

58
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,550
OK.

59
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,190
Gu Yancheng!

60
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,830
Gu Yancheng, wake up!

61
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,870
Gu Yancheng!

62
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,310
You are here.

63
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,150
Wait for me.

64
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:33,870
Here.

65
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,150
Slowly.

66
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,550
Have some water.

67
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,070
Boss, are you okay?

68
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,240
Oh no.

69
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,190
Look, it's really a trap.

70
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,390
Mr. Wang has brought people here.

71
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,950
What should we do?

72
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,600
Hide her.

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,590
Little fairy.

74
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,910
Put on her clothes.

75
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,550
I'll find a way to hide her.

76
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,030
Hurry.

77
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,390
I...

78
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,160
My figure is not bad.

79
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,230
Play it by ear.

80
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,430
I'll hide for a while.

81
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,750
This...

82
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,950
Why do I feel like hiding a corpse?

83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,680
What are you doing?

84
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,910
Calm down.

85
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,550
Did you take any other medicine?

86
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,110
Hu Meng.

87
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,350
How dare you betray me!

88
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,710
Come out!

89
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,470
Mr. Wang.

90
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,990
What are you doing?

91
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,150
Who let you in?

92
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,150
Gu Yancheng.

93
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,630
I trusted you so much.

94
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,350
How could you do that?

95
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,070
What do you mean?

96
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,300
See by yourself.

97
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,750
You mean this?

98
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,590
I received a message from Mr. Wang

99
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,150
to talk about the Yiyu Garden Project.

100
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,670
But Miss Hu came alone.

101
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,990
She said you would be late

102
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,950
and left.

103
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,270
How is that possible?

104
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,390
Mr. Wei asked me out today.

105
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,870
You say Hu Meng left.

106
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,910
Then who is she?

107
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,470
This...

108
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,430
What?

109
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:33,990
What do you think?

110
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,590
Not only was I stood up by Mr. Wang today,

111
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,270
but also disturbed like this.

112
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,909
I'm really...

113
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,110
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

114
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,990
I was too impulsive today

115
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,150
and disturbed you.

116
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,390
I'll go to Gu's Group tomorrow,

117
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,070
to discuss with you

118
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,190
the Yiyu Garden Project.

119
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,390
Sure, you're always welcome.

120
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,470
Thank Wei's gift for me.

121
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,390
Looking forward to our cooperation.

122
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,260
Wei Haodong,

123
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,030
this is not what you want to see, right?

124
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,870
What do you mean?

125
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,990
Please.

126
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,590
You scared my baby.

127
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,670
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

128
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,510
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,630
Who's your baby?

130
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,740
Boss.

131
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:30,910
Are you...

132
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,510
Are you okay?

133
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,190
What do you think?

134
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,670
Boss,

135
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,270
I'll go back

136
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:58,910
after I park the car.

137
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,350
Take my car back.

138
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,230
Thank you, boss.

139
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,150
By the way, when are you moving in?

140
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:16,910
Boss,

141
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,750
I haven't packed my things.

142
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,550
I'll move in tomorrow.

143
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,710
By the way, boss,

144
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,990
when you, a virgin, are outside alone,

145
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,710
take care of yourself.

146
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,310
Don't eat food given by strangers.

147
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,990
And don't drink the water given by strangers.

148
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,310
Bye.

149
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,470
Looks like this trick is really useful.

150
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,830
The fairy agreed to move in.

151
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,950
Tell me, how are you going to thank me?

152
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,550
I'm the one who's suffering. Why should I thank you?

153
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,660
A virgin...

154
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,270
How does she know

155
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,670
that you are still a virgin?

156
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,030
Boss, you should praise me for helping you.

157
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,020
Boss.

158
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,660
You're home?

159
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,830
I'm always here.

160
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,470
Always?

161
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,190
Why didn't I see you?

162
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,750
What happened to your foot?

163
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,030
You...

164
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,790
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

165
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,270
I have something important to tell you.

166
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,790
Look at the terms.

167
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,110
Although

168
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,670
I promised to be your life assistant

169
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,590
for a month,

170
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,550
I think

171
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,790
we still need to make an agreement.

172
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,030
For example, you can't eat my food.

173
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,230
And

174
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,030
knock on the door before you enter my room

175
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,320
to avoid unnecessary trouble.

176
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,230
You?

177
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,260
What unnecessary trouble would there be?

178
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,470
I'm worried

179
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,670
that I would cause troubles to your eyes

180
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,430
which can only identify beauty

181
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,030
to the extent that it may cause damage

182
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,070
to your mental health.

183
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,240
That makes sense.

184
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,790
Go on.

185
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,670
And then, separate personal affairs and job.

186
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,510
After all, I'm both a driver

187
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,030
and a life assistant.

188
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,710
I have a lot of work to do.

189
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,990
So you can't take up my private time.

190
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,630
Because I have to help Huixin at the flower shop.

191
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,110
I can't waste my private time

192
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,470
just because I live here.

193
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,950
OK.

194
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,710
And then, human rights equality.

195
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,190
During work time, I am your employee.

196
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,670
But after I get off duty, I only belong to myself.

197
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,070
You can't meddle in

198
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,670
my personal life

199
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,870
as the boss.

200
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,350
We don't interfere in each other's private life.

201
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,590
OK.

202
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,950
And then,

203
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,270
you promised to pay me

204
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,550
three times the salary.

205
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,830
You can't go back on your word.

206
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,710
Otherwise, you would cheat the labor class.

207
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,430
No problem. Anything else?

208
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,110
I don't think so.

209
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,150
But I have the right to add the terms.

210
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,710
Anything is fine.

211
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,710
Boss, I've recorded it.

212
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,070
This is the evidence.

213
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,430
Don't go back on your word.

214
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,470
All right, I'm going to have my meal.

215
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,790
Wait.

216
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,510
I have my rules too.

217
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,790
Go ahead.

218
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,230
In my house,

219
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,020
don't touch my stuff.

220
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,550
Put the public belongings back to their original places,

221
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,790
with the same angles.

222
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,670
Angles?

223
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,390
You have your private time.

224
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,020
But when I need help,

225
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,270
you have to come to me.

226
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,750
You will get overtime pay for that.

227
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,950
Okay.

228
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,070
Also,

229
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,260
don't eat such unpleasant food

230
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,630
in my house.

231
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,590
Unpleasant?

232
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,190
This is snails rice noodle!

233
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,070
Muyu.

234
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,750
Brother.

235
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,300
You're finally back.

236
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,869
You should come back more often.

237
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,069
Don't let grandpa nag about you.

238
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,829
Grandpa would be bothered enough by you alone.

239
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,510
I won't add to his burden.

240
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,880
Why are you laughing?

241
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,550
You're not good enough as my friend.

242
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,710
Brother,

243
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,550
you have no conscience to say this.

244
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,829
When you moved out,

245
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,910
you begged me to stay here with grandpa.

246
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,910
I did not beg you, but asked you to do so.

247
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,110
You're just bullying me because you're older than me.

248
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,950
I dare not resist.

249
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,230
Glad you know.

250
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,110
Grandpa is calling me.

251
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,310
I'm leaving.

252
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,710
Grandpa.

253
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,820
Have a seat.

254
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,590
Jie told me

255
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,590
someone set a trap for you, right?

256
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:58,910
Yes.

257
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,470
Luckily Shao Jie and Yuxuan arrived in time.

258
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,630
Who did it?

259
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,790
Do you have any idea?

260
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,550
I heard that lady

261
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,950
tell the waiter who drugged me

262
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,670
to thank Wei's gift for her.

263
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,310
Then Wei Haodong and Mr. Wang arrived.

264
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,870
So I suspect

265
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,350
it was Wei who did it.

266
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,710
I didn't expect

267
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,710
Wei Haodong dared to do such a thing.

268
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,070
It can't be him.

269
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,500
How can you be sure?

270
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,820
Muyu,

271
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,870
the Gu and Wei families have different standpoints.

272
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,510
There are no friends in business.

273
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,680
Besides,

274
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,300
Haodong has always been upset with your brother.

275
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,750
It can't be Wei Haodong anyway.

276
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,390
I'll confirm it now.

277
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,910
Old Du told me

278
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,590
you gave him a month off

279
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,350
and asked him to travel with his wife.

280
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,350
Why?

281
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,430
Old Master,

282
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,870
he lives with the fairy now.

283
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,590
Really?

284
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,030
You live together?

285
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,310
Grandpa.

286
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,510
We're not living together.

287
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,470
It's just for work.

288
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,230
Don't explain.

289
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,920
Yuxuan

290
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,870
is the fairy in the painting that the Gu family is looking for.

291
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,750
As long as you like her,

292
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,390
I'm happy too.

293
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,150
I understand.

294
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,870
It is typical for

295
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,230
men to act like this.

296
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,470
The Gu family

297
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,150
will be responsible for her.

298
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,070
Grandpa.

299
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,950
Please stop your fantasy.

300
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,870
If there's nothing else,

301
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,950
I'm leaving.

302
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,630
You...

303
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,390
Goodbye, grandpa.

304
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,470
You...

305
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,000
Goodbye, grandpa.

306
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,390
Just an unsophisticated kid.

307
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,350
He's shy

308
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,710
with such a trivial matter?

309
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,230
Wei Haodong.

310
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,310
I've been waiting for you for so long.

311
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,430
I knew you would be in the company.

312
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,030
But you asked your assistant to lie to me.

313
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,070
What happened?

314
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,640
Is it not enough?

315
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,750
You didn't set a trap

316
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,310
for my brother, did you?

317
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,830
What's the difference

318
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,190
if it was me or not?

319
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,590
I don't believe you did it.

320
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,190
You're not that kind of person.

321
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,430
What if I say it was me?

322
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,910
I don't believe it.

323
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,830
Gu Muyu.

324
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,950
I think you've always misjudged me.

325
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,390
Please don't come to me again.

326
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,390
This is not suitable for your identity,

327
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,750
nor for mine.

328
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,990
No matter what you say,

329
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,110
I won't believe it.

330
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,630
Gu Muyu, don't bother anymore.

331
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,000
I won't fall in love with you.

332
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,270
Wei Haodong,

333
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,310
don't try to get rid of me.

334
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,470
I've finished. I'll go wash the dishes.

335
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,310
Okay.

336
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,190
Xun Yuxuan!

337
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,750
Sorry, boss.

338
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,470
Sorry.

339
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,100
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it.

340
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,670
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,510
I'll button it up for you.

342
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,830
Sorry.

343
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,430
I'm so, so sorry.

344
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,430
Forget it.

345
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,070
We can't carry on like this.

346
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,110
I need to do something.

347
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,070
Gu Yancheng.

348
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,750
You're so annoying.

349
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,790
I'll wrap you around my little finger one day.

350
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,270
I swear.

351
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,230
It's been a long time since the last time I visited you.

352
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,190
Don't worry.

353
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,390
I'll take good care of her.

354
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,070
Humph, you won't be able to threaten me anymore.

355
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,470
You...

356
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,310
What are you doing?

357
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,110
Boss, I'm doing morning exercise.

358
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,230
I was sleeping.

359
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,790
But it's my daily routine.

360
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,870
Then change your routine.

361
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,070
Boss,

362
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,630
have you forgotten your promise?

363
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,910
This is my private time.

364
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,300
What did I promise you?

365
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,390
I knew this would happen.

366
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,710
Listen to this.

367
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,990
You did it?

368
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,270
Why would I do such a thing?

369
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,270
You have no evidence.

370
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,070
Besides, we have equal human rights.

371
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,550
I'm your employee only during working hours.

372
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,020
In private time, I belong to myself.

373
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,430
Personal affairs in private time…

374
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,950
Fortunately, I knew something like this would happen

375
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,670
so I uploaded the recording

376
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,630
to my mailbox and cloud storage.

377
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,550
Sure enough,

378
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,510
one can't be too careful.

379
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,830
You're…

380
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,030
Incredibly smart, right?

381
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,910
I know.

382
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,110
I don't need your compliment.

383
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,590
Give me your phone.

384
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,630
Give it to me.

385
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,350
Give it to me.

386
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,110
Listen,

387
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,630
since you don't like me living here,

388
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,000
I'll move out.

389
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,070
I'm leaving in a moment.

390
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,740
No.

391
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,590
I never go back on my words.

392
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,510
But I regret it now.

393
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,150
Also, keep this in mind.

394
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,780
I'm in a bad mood today.

395
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,270
I've changed shifts with Bai Bin.

396
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,880
He'll pick you up today.

397
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,470
Move!

398
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,870
My parents didn't raise me to be a soft touch.

399
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,110
I won't give in so easily.

400
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,470
Now you know I'm not to be messed with.

401
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,990
What?

402
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,070
You've moved into Gu Yancheng's house?

403
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,200
Keep your voice down.

404
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,150
Do you want the whole world to know?

405
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,470
I don't think you're afraid of that.

406
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,480
Xun Yuxuan,

407
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,950
you are so bold.

408
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,790
You didn't tell me before you moved in.

409
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,390
Do you have to be in such a hurry?

410
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,270
What are you thinking?

411
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,870
Don't you know why I did that?

412
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,510
I did it for our flower shop.

413
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,790
The salary he pays me is three times higher.

414
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,230
Three times?

415
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,960
But

416
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,310
when Uncle Du comes back,

417
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,070
I'll resign.

418
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,150
Anyway, I'm just going to

419
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,950
be his personal assistant for one month.

420
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,510
Three times. Really?

421
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,030
So nothing happened between you two

422
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,950
last night?

423
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,870
Huixin,

424
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,720
I think

425
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,790
it's time for me

426
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,430
to erase those obscene thoughts from your head.

427
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,550
I apologize.

428
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,150
It's too late.

429
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,070
Xun Yuxuan.

430
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,550
I apologize.

431
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:00,790
Yaoyuan.

432
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,150
Alright.

433
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,750
Why are you back?

434
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,190
Because I miss you.

435
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,390
Bai Bin.

436
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,430
Never mind.

437
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,350
Bai Bin,

438
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,470
just now,

439
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,270
when Xun Yuxuan asked you to pick me up,

440
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,680
did she say anything else?

441
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,000
Like…

442
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,390
Where is she going later?

443
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,960
She just said she was going to help in the flower shop.

444
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,310
Nothing else.

445
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,480
Did she mention anything about me?

446
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:46,830
No.

447
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,100
Was she angry?

448
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,390
No.

449
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,670
Women are really hard to understand.

450
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,350
If a man

451
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,910
tries to understand a woman,

452
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,710
he must like her a lot.

453
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,870
Like her?

454
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,310
Impossible.

455
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,910
I'm sorry.

456
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,110
I just need her

457
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,150
by my side.

458
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,430
Hello.

459
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,310
Mr. Gu,

460
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,790
our president made a request

461
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,270
about the Yiyu Garden Project.

462
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,830
He said if you agree to it,

463
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,110
we can seal the deal.

464
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,270
What is it?

465
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,590
He hopes you can design

466
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,590
and carve a work yourself

467
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,630
centered around the theme of Yiyu Garden.

468
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,310
Okay, I'll think about it.

469
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,510
Help!

470
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,230
Help!

471
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,909
Help me!

472
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,310
Let us out!

473
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,949
Help!

474
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,310
Help! Help me!

475
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,870
Let us out!

476
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,030
Sorry,

477
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,550
the subscriber you dialed cannot be connected at the moment.

478
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,030
Tell me

479
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,700
why you came back this time?

480
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,590
I don't believe crap like you missed me.

481
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,000
I did come back for a reason,

482
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,830
but it's true that I missed you.

483
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,230
Be honest.

484
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,110
Alright.

485
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,270
A magazine company I like

486
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:40,910
is recruiting.

487
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,030
I want to apply for a job there.

488
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,630
If I'm accepted,

489
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,630
that'll be great.

490
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,390
Haven't you achieved some success

491
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,870
in photography?

492
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,990
You have millions of fans on social media

493
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,190
and own a studio.

494
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,510
Why do you want to work for a company?

495
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,550
It's different.

496
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,440
People there are all very talented.

497
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,550
I can learn a lot from them in many aspects.

498
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,790
Where are you going to live?

499
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,550
Our parents' house?

500
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,030
No.

501
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,710
I'll rent a place after it's all settled.

502
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,190
Where are you going to stay these days?

503
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,470
I'll stay in a youth hostel

504
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,470
for the time being.

505
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,030
Youth hostel?

506
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,150
You can live in Yuxuan's place.

507
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,870
She doesn't live there this month anyway.

508
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,630
Why?

509
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,550
She lives with her boss recently.

510
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,750
What's wrong?

511
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,390
Nothing.

512
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,150
You can live at my place.

513
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,030
Recently,

514
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,950
I've been working overtime a lot at my boss's place,

515
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,270
so I live somewhere close to him.

516
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,190
You quit being a designated driver? You got a job?

517
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,870
Actually,

518
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,910
I still work as a driver.

519
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,660
But sometimes,

520
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,310
I also work as a personal assistant.

521
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,320
However,

522
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,190
the salary is very high.

523
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,590
Since that's the case,

524
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,100
could you rent me a place?

525
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,470
No way!

526
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,950
You know why I take this job?

527
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:57,190
Because someone said she's on the uppers

528
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,800
and that the flower shop is on the edge of going under.

529
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,510
Life has never been easy for me.

530
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,070
But I suddenly have an idea.

531
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,510
If it comes true,

532
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,270
we can end this miserable situation soon.

533
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,510
What is it?

534
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,310
Let's make him

535
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,670
our brand ambassador,

536
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,630
the face of our flower shop.

537
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,550
Me?

538
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,710
Great.

539
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,030
Do I have to dress up like a bouquet?

540
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,190
Not a bouquet.

541
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,750
You are as handsome as Apollo.

542
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:49,390
Don't you think it's dreamy and pretty?

543
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,550
No girl can resist you.

544
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,590
If we make a cardboard cut-out of you

545
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,270
and put it outside the shop,

546
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,320
it will attract many girls to buy flowers.

547
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,950
A cut-out?

548
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,110
No.

549
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,390
What are you doing?

550
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,920
Put your hands down.

551
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,110
Listen.

552
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,630
If you want to live in my house,

553
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,310
you must help us.

554
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,630
Fine.

555
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,150
You've been giving me orders since I was a kid.

556
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,270
I never had a say.

557
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,110
Come here. Let me do your hair.

558
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,550
Lower.

559
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,510
Lower!

560
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,670
Okay.

561
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:35,990
Not bad.

562
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,150
He's quite good-looking, isn't he?

563
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,350
Pretty good.

564
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,580
Get up.

565
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,030
Come with me.

566
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,990
Not bad.

567
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,270
He's quite good-looking, isn't he?

568
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,470
Boss, anything I can do for you?

569
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,190
Send someone to follow Xun Yuxuan secretly.

570
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,750
Keep me abreast of what she's doing.
