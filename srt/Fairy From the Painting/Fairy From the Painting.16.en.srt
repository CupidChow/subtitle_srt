00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,690
if you have any questions,

186
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,780


187
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,060
you can come to me directly.

188
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,230


189
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,010
Although I'm living in seclusion in the mountains,

190
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,180


191
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,159
my door

192
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,350


193
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,150


194
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,820
is always open for you.

195
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,500
Our two uncles really adore

196
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,510


197
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,430


198
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,290
the rising star of the sculpting world.

199
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,360
Please don't forget about me.

200
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,430


201
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,210
I'm a new artist.

202
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,270


203
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,580
I really need you seniors

204
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,830


205
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,490
and this sculpting genius to guide me along.

206
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,550


207
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,830
My man is undoubtedly excellent,

208
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,070


209
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,760
but I'm not bad either.

210
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,070


211
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,840
You little girl.

212
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,990


213
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,250
Didn't Uncle Leng Quan and I come here today

214
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,470


215
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,850
for your event?

216
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,060


217
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,840
Yes.

218
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,230


219
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,240
We want to see if you've improved

220
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,470


221
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,990
and whether you've been neglecting your craft abroad.

222
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,190


223
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,540
I would never.

224
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,670


225
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,210
I've been following the orders you gave me before

226
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,270


227
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,410
and constantly worked to perfect my craft.

228
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,670


229
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,350


230
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,270
However,

231
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,810
I really need some feedback

232
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,910


233
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,700
for my exhibition's finale today.

234
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,750


235
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,980
Don't worry.

236
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,230


237
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,050
We won't play favorites.

238
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,270


239
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,740
-Yes. -This way please, then.

240
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,790


241
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,710


242
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:36,450
Okay.

243
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,150
I guess it's too late

244
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,230


245
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,150
to leave now.

246
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,430


247
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:44,940
Yuxuan.

248
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,310


249
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,540
I really was

250
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,550


251
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,270
all suited up for battle.

252
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,550


253
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,280
I didn't expect to be critically hit.

254
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,540


255
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,610
This lady is a two-faced fox.

256
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,950


257
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,200
She appears to be respectful to you and Gu Yancheng

258
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,390


259
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,310
and offers help,

260
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,540


261
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,000
but she's really just trying to win Gu Yancheng’s favor.

262
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,150


263
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,630
She's trying to make you feel inferior

264
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,670


265
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,810
and kill your confidence.

266
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,820


267
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,790


268
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,570
Don't fall for her tricks.

269
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,290
Of course I won't.

270
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,510


271
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:19,860
But...

272
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,150


273
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,380
But that's also the truth.

274
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,620


275
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,590
Be it a rare stone collector

276
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,710


277
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,100
or a sculpting master,

278
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,310


279
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,350
she has so many connections.

280
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,590


281
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,980
Don’t forget

282
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,110


283
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,210
that Gu Yancheng could start sculpting again

284
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,270


285
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,640
only because of you.

286
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,860


287
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,260
It's all thanks to you.

288
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,430


289
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,610
Without you,

290
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,030


291
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,310
it would be pointless

292
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,350


293
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,130
even if she could invite all of the masters in the world.

294
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,470


295
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,930
You must pull yourself together.

296
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,070


297
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,890
Don't worry.

298
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,030


299
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,900
You have me, the professional fox slayer, behind you.

300
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,909


301
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,940
We must fight back.

302
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,909


303
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,190
What should we do now?

304
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,350


305
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,150


306
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,030
Before heading into battle, we have to eat well.

307
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:00,970
Let's go.

308
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,030


309
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,280
Let's eat something good first.

310
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,470


311
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,340
Let's go.

312
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,460


313
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,510
Cheers!

314
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,750


315
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,500
Huixin, you know what?

316
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,550


317
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,630
That Yina was hugging him.

318
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,830


319
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,980
Granted, she studied abroad,

320
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,030


321
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,490
but she didn't have to adhere to foreign etiquette here too.

322
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,669


323
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,710
I'm so mad.

324
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,950


325
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,320
Let me tell you.

326
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,549


327
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,150
All men are the same.

328
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,230


329
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,419
That playboy

330
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,590


331
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,169
gave me a gift for no reason.

332
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,990


333
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,350
But it's been a long time

334
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,429


335
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,690
since I've heard from him again.

336
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,950


337
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,520
These men...

338
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,790


339
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,760
Hello?

340
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:55,990


341
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,030


342
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:56,830
Hello?

343
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,050
The owner of this phone suddenly fainted.

344
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,470


345
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,670


346
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,590
You must be her daughter.

347
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,440
She has been sent to the hospital.

348
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,430


349
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,540
Please come.

350
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,630


351
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,480
Okay.

352
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,590


353
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,720
I'll be right there.

354
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,790


355
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,950


356
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:08,790
Yuxuan,

357
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,760
I have to go attend to something urgent.

358
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,950


359
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,500
What's wrong?

360
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,750


361
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,740
With Yuxuan's current situation,

362
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,910


363
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,760
I should not tell her about my mom.

364
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,060


365
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,920
Well, it's something urgent.

366

369
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,310
Can you walk on your own like this?

370
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,390


371
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,500

382

383
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,260
She drank too much.

384
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,310


385
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,450
I'm worried about leaving her alone.

386
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,590


387
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,910
I'll get someone to pick her up later.

389

Yes, my dear boss.

What do you want?

405

406
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,560
My dear landlord,

414
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,750
How about this?

415

418
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,130
Go to bed first.

432
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,080

449
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,400
I feel inferior to her in every aspect.

450

451
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,140
You have no self-awareness.

453
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,230
Can't you tell that she likes you?

454
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,770
[My Mr. Gu]

Why are you calling me?

I don't want to talk to you right now.

469

470
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,240
Strange.

471
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,600
What's going on?

472
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,980


473
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,300
Stop drinking.

474
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,670


475

You'll send me home?

478
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,790


479
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,660
Where?

480

To Gu Yancheng's house?

483
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,230


484
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,270

485
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,910


486
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,970
I want to go back to my apartment.

487

My apartment is more comfortable than his house.

488

489
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,910

Comfortable.

Comfortable.

492
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,590


493
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:52,980
So,

494
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,230


495
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,630
the two of you are already...

496
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,750


497
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,140


498
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:03,990
Yao Yuan?

499
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,150
Yao Yuan?

500
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,310


501
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,330
I'm here.

502
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,630


503
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,670


504
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,510
Where are you?

505
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,570
In the bathroom.

506
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,710


507
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,270
Stay still.

508
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,510


509
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,790


510
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,640
Yao Yuan?

511
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,750


512
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,490
Yao Yuan?

513
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,700
Be careful.

514
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,950


515
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,170
There's body wash down here.

516
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,190


517
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,410
It's not safe for you with your high heels.

518
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,590


519
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,650
Then let's go out.

520
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,910


521
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,430
Do you have your phone?

522
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,790


523
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,470
Yes.

524
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,790


525
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,150
Then why didn't you turn on the flashlight

526
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,310


527
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,170
when you came in?

528
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,380


529
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,000
Right.

530
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,260


531
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,550
I forgot.

532
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,710


533
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,040
Let's go.

534
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,270


535
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,090
Be careful.

536
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,100


537
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,600
Watch your step.

538
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,670


539
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,140
Be careful, my dear landlord.

540
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,270


541
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,860
The water outage should be because of a faulty valve.

542
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,190


543
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,850
It's fixed.

544
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,190


545
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,280
Thank you.

546
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,590


547
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,250
Thank you.

548
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,300


549
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,950
You always cause me trouble.

550
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,350


551
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,590


552
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,450
Well...

553
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,580
I don't think this is my fault?

554
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,870


555
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:38,870
Mrs. Lin,

556
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,310


557
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,700
be careful.

558
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,030


559
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,300
Mrs. Lin, actually I...

560
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,590


561
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,510
What are you doing?

562
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,700


563
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:58,580
Don't move.

564
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:58,900


565
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,440
How did this happen?

566
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,790


567
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,180
Maybe I bumped into something

568
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,190


569
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,120
when I came in.

570
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,420


571
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,230
It's nothing.

572
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,470


573
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,730
Why were you in such a hurry?

574
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,110


575
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,550
You didn't even change your shoes,

576
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,670


577
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,890
and you came in without a flashlight.

578
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,110


579
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,470
I'm not worried about you.

580
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,710


581
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,200
Then you must have been nervous.

582
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,380


583
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,120
You...

584
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,310


585
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,150
I just don't want my place to become a murder house.

586
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,390


587
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,070
Alright.

588
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,230


589
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,800
I'm leaving.

590
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,110


591
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,360
Mrs. Lin.

592
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,670


593
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,270
Well, have a seat.

594
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,470


595
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,190
Well,

596
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,430


597
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,150
I'm hungry.

598
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,390


599
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,880
You haven't had dinner

600
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,950


601
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,780
until now.

602
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,030


603
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,260
Do you want to...

604
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,350


605
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,220
I'm not hungry.

606
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,430


607
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,430


608
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,070
Mrs. Lin,

609
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,000
give me an hour.

610
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,230


611
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,430
I didn't know you can cook.

612
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,750


613
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,349
There are many things I can do.

614
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,630


615
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,750
Let's slowly get to know each other more.

616
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,910


617
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,369
Who said I want to get to know you?

618
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,710


619
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,690
Don't flatter yourself.

620
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,950


621
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,130
Hello?

622
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,350


623
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,230


624
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,040
Come down and get her.

625
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,150
Why are you the one sending her back?

626
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,390


627
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,750
Wasn't she having dinner with Huixin?

628
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,910


629
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,750
You don't need to know.

630
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,990


631
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,180
Besides,

632
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,350


633
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,360
I don't know what happened between you two,

634
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,430


635
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,090
but I hope you can treat her well.

636
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,270


637
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,390
If something like this happens again,

638
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,670


639
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,460
I will fight to get Yuxuan back.

640
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,670


641
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:04,950
Are you okay?

642
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,110


643
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,500
Why are you here?

644
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,790


645
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,450
You said you never get drunk.

646
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,750


647
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:14,860
What happened?

648
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,150


649
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,270
Of course.

650
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,550


651
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,390


652
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,210
No amount of alcohol can get me drunk.

653
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,730
Who can bully me?

654
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,950


655
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,430
Who dares to bully me?

656
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,580


657
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,630


658
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,340
Let's go.

659
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,370
Let's go home.

660
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,750


661
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,100
Wait.

662
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,260


663
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,170
I don't think this is my house.

664
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,470


665
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,470


666
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,130
I want to go home.

667
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,870


668
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,610
This is your home.

669
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,910


670
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,380
No.

671
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,640
My house is not this big.

672
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,780


673
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,390


674
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,160
But this place

675
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,310


676
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,100
looks familiar.

677
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,410
Let's go quickly.

678
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,750


679
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,670


680
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,640
It looks familiar.

681
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,910


682
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,770
It looks familiar.

683
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,190


684
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,000
Have some water.

685
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,010
How am I sobered up already?

686
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,270


687
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,490
I wish I could stay drunk a little longer.

688
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,870


689
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,230


690
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,930
Why did you drink so much?

691
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,590


692
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,370
What happened?

693
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,600
Did someone bully you?

694
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,990


695
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,850
You know him.

696
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,150


697
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,950
I know him?

698
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,270


699
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,530
Who?

700
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,910


701
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,300
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

702
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,550


703
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:16,700
Okay.

704
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,030


705
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,990
You have to beat him up for me.

706
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,100


707
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,140
No problem.

708
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,190


709
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,850
Beat yourself up then.

710
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,110


711
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,200
Me?

712
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,470


713
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,460
What did I do wrong?

714
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,670


715
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,550
You still don't know what you did wrong?

716
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,900


717
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,890
Is it because I've been spending too much time

718
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,950


719
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,250
consulting Mr. Wu Wei

720
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,510


721
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,280
that I'm always not around?

722
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,630


723
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,780
No.

724
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,070


725
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,680
Then,

726
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:53,870


727
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,780
did I forget an important anniversary?

728
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,790


729
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,550
Reflect on yourself.

730
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,830


731
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,350


732
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,180
Okay.

733
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,670


734
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,480
I'll reflect on myself.

735
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,470
But you drank so much today.

736
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,670


737
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,870


738
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,530
And you didn't answer my calls this late.

739
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,950


740
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,630
You even let a certain someone send you home.

741
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,030


742
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:13,900
I...

743
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,310
You're talking about me?

744
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,310


745
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,070


746
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,100
What about you and Yina?

747
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,830


748
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,690
You use the excuse of discussing art

749
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,670
to flirt with each other.

750
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,990


751
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,410
So that's why you're angry.

752
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,430


753
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,280
You are indeed jealous.

754
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,540


755
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,750
Yes.

756
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:28,910


757
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,380
What's wrong? I'm jealous.

758
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,500


759
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,060
Can't I be?

760
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,150


761
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,110


762
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:31,970
Sure.

763
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,830
I'm jealous too.

764
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,020


765
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,950


766
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,750
You secretly went to dinner with Bai Bin,

767
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,390


768
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,070
and let him take you home.

769
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,470
I'm upset too.

770
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,830


771
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,840
Why are you jealous?

772
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,790


773
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,070


774
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,110
You're the one who's at fault.

775
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,270


776
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,040
Yina was even hugging you.

777
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,070
How can you laugh?

778
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,190


779
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,150
Laugh all you want.

780
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,430


781
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,250
I'll go home by myself.

782
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,470


783
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,670
Where are you going at this hour?

784
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,950


785
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,550
Leave me alone. I'm leaving.

786
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,630


787
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,630
Alright.

788
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,870


789
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,110


790
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,010
I've realized my mistake.

791
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,420
Don't be angry.

792
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,750


793
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,480
What did you do wrong?

794
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,670


795
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,470
I'll be more careful from now on

796
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,630


797
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,550


798
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,300
and stay away from other ladies.

799
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,940
You make it sound like I forced you.

800
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,150


801
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,520
I'm choosing to do it.

802
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,790


803
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,170
Silly.

804
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,540


805
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,190
You're the only one

806
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,670


807
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,000
in my eyes and in my heart.

808
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,310


809
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,850
What's going on?

810
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,230


811
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,300
Mrs. Lin.

812
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,590


813
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,030
Please.

814
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,270


815
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,900
I usually only have steak, goose liver,

816
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,070


817
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,710
and coffee.

818
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,030


819
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Even if it's Chinese food,

820
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,470


821
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,680
I'll only have it at full banquet restaurants.

822
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,950


823
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,190
I'll just have to force myself

824
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,510


825
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,920
to stomach these dishes.

826
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,260


827
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,110
Forget it.

828
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,390


829
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,700
I'll give you face.

830
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,750


831
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:37,840
What do you think, Mrs. Lin?

832
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,150


833
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,750
Doesn't Chinese stewed beef

834
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,950


835
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,320
taste better than steak?

836
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,590


837
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,830
Not bad.

838
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,110


839
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,000
Eat more.

840
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,310


841
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,800
You girls

842
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,950


843
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,230
prioritize work,

844
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,580


845
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,230
but health is more important.

846
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,470


847
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,700
Girls.

848
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,910


849
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,540
To think you would call me a girl.

850
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,710


851
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,500
If you're not a girl,

852
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,270


853
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,870
why do you like snacks?

854
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,760
Who says I like these?

855
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,950


856
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,640
I just work late often

857
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,750


858
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,650
so I eat them to relieve my hunger.

859
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,830


860
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,770
I watch my figure.

861
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,950


862
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,720
I don't eat those.

863
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,950


864
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,900
If you don't want them, throw them away.

865
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,110


866
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:36,800
My dear landlord,

867
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,990


868
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,400
if you don't want them,

869
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,550


870
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,830
I'll have them.

871
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,910


872
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:40,930
I can eat them.

873
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,030


874
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,120
Stop calling me that.

875
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,310


876
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,670
You might accidentally call me that at the office

877
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,790


878
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,690
and arouse suspicion.

879
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,990


880
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,790


881
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,720
But

882
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,080
if I still call you Mrs. Lin in private,

883
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,350


884
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,370
it would feel like my work hasn't ended yet.

885
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,550


886
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,810
It's stressful.

887
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,150


888
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,100
What do you want?

889
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,380


890
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,410
I need to think about it.

891
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,670


892
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,710
Take your time.

893
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,060


894
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,300
Is it good?

895
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,710


896
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,520
Yes.

897
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:16,910


898
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,340
Eat more.

899
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,790


900
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,450
Have another piece of beef.

901
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,870


902
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,830
I knew I should have hidden the snacks well.

903
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,910


904
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,900
What did you want to hide?

905
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,190


906
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:39,720
Nothing.

907
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,870


908
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,770
Are you a hamster?

909
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,020


910
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,730
You even have a habit of hiding things.

911
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,990


912
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,420
What did I hide?

913
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,670


914
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,350
Don't you want to hide me?

915
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,710


916
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,420
I don't know what you like,

917
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,710


918
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,510
so I bought everything.

919
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,670


920
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,480
Let me know what you like and I'll buy them for you.

921
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,740


922
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,980
You don't have to cater to my taste.

923
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,350


924
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,580
Just buy whatever you want.

925
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,790


926
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:07,850
It's getting late.

927
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,230


928
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,040
I'll get going.

929
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,190


930
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,240
It hurts.

931
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,470


932
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,780
What's wrong?

933
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,070


934
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:17,870
I don't know.

935
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,110


936
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,510
Maybe I fell down before.

937
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,830


938
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,130
No external bruising.

939
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,350


940
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,710
Why don't you go to the hospital?

941
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:29,990


942
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,540
No need.

943
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,950


944
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,840
It's too late now.

945
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,950


946
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,690
How about tomorrow?

947
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,910


948
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,980
Why don't you apply some ointment for me?

949
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,230


950
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,350
I can't reach it.

951
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,580


952
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,710
I don't know how to.

953
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,070


954
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,250
Just like how I applied medicine for you.

955
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,540


956
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,070
Do it like I did.

957
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,510


958
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,020


959
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,680
It hurts.

960
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,360
I'll try.

961
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,390


962
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:10,770
Does it hurt?

963
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,110


964
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,540
Much better.

965
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,750


966
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,750
Kid,

967
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,030


968
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,370
you're good at acting cute.

969
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,540


970
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,820
Kid?

971
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,950


972
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:20,900
Why?

973
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,180


974
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,050
I saw your resume.

975
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,350


976
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,630
You're six years younger than me.

977
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,870


978
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,270
If you're not a kid, then what are you?

979
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,750


980
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,140
I know what I can call you in private.

981
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,510


982
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:29,870
What?

983
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,230


984
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,740
I'll call you...

985
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,030


986
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,870
Sister!

987
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,060


988
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,190


989
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,080
Sister.

990
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,030
Sister.

991
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,190


992
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:45,640
I'm leaving.

993
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,940


994
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,170
Sister,

995
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,470


996
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,170
take care.

997
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,350


998
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,270
Remember to send me a WeChat message when you get home.

999
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,470


1000
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,470
No, this is not like me.

1001
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,710


1002
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,620
Why would I fall for a kid?

1003
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,860


1004
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,270
I've seen this scene before.

1005
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,630


1006
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,790
He should be the one to get shy.

1007
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,110


1008
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,670
I'll call you...

1009
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,110


1010
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:13,840
Sister!

1011
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,150


1012
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:14,830
Sister.

1013
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,150


1014
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,390
Sister.

1015
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,630


1016
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,630
I've been in all kinds of big situations,

1017
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,830


1018
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,470
talking about acquisition, equity and projects.

1019
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,910


1020
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,080
Such a trivial event.

1021
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,420


1022
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:28,670
I'll be fine after a night's sleep.

1023
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,870


1024
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:29,920
Yes.

1025
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,230


1026
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,300
Go home and have a good sleep.

1027
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,550


1028
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:39,710
Come in.

1029
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,950


1030
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,360
Mrs. Lin,

1031
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,700


1032
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,520
here's the coffee you asked for.

1033
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,750


1034
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,390
I'll get back to work.

1035
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,710


1036
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,480
Did I ask him to buy coffee?

1037
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,820


1038
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,440
How did he know I like Americano?

1039
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,620


1040
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,680
Your mom was hospitalized yesterday.

1041
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,790


1042
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,750


1043
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,670
Why didn't you tell me?

1044
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,890
It's nothing.

1045
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,950


1046
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,980


1047
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,740
You were in a bad mood yesterday.

1048
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,540
I didn't want to worry you.

1049
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,910


1050
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,520
Well,

1051
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,870


1052
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,340
let's visit her

1053
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,470


1054
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,470
after we close the shop today.

1055
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,830


1056
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,200
It's okay.

1057
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,310


1058
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,330
My mom is fine.

1059
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,660


1060
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,790
It's just a chronic ailment.

1061
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,150


1062
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,170
She had an IV yesterday.

1063
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,300


1064
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,890
I sent her home today.

1065
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,270


1066
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,340
You

1067
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,590


1068
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,320
don't have to worry about my family.

1069
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,470


1070
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,060
You should worry about our flower shop instead.

1071
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,310


1072
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,420
What's wrong with our flower shop?

1073
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,710


1074
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,210
Have you resolved your conflict with Mr. Gu?

1075
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,380


1076
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,070
Since our flower shop started working with Gu Group,

1077
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,270


1078
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,810
our business has indeed improved a lot.

1079
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,190


1080
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,610
But we're still barely making ends meet.

1081
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,910


1082
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,330
How about

1083
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,510


1084
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,410
we get Mr. Gu

1085
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,700


1086
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,260
to introduce more clients?

1087
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,310


1088
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,150
Well...

1089
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,430


1090
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,230
I don't think it's a good time.

1091
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,470


1092
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:23,470
Do you know?

1093
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,670


1094
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,310
He’s been preparing for the competition recently.

1095
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,670


1096
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,270
He works day and night.

1097
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,670


1098
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,620
Huixin.

1099
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,900


1100
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,410
At this time,

1101
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,630


1102
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,740
I really don't want him

1103
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,830


1104
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,220
to be distracted by other things.

1105
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,510


1106
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,410
You're not even married yet,

1107
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,510


1108
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,970
and you're already worrying about your husband.

1109
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,190


1110
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,070
I'm so jealous.

1111
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,310


1112
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,120
Alright then.

1113
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,310


1114
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,010
We have to think about

1115
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,070


1116
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,730
other ways

1117
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,950


1118
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,830
to make our flower shop more competitive?

1119
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,070


1120
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,040
-Yao Yuan! -Yao Yuan!

1121
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,270


1122
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,290
It's been a long time since he worked here.

1123
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,430


1124
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,500
Our handsome man

1125
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,700


1126
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,500
will attract many customers.

1127
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,780


1128
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,090
Yes.

1129
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,430


1130
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,060
And then,

1131
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,100


1132
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,700
we'll also ask him to take photos of our shop

1133
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,710


1134
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,600
and post it online

1135
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,710


1136
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,540
as promotion.

1137
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,790


1138
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,890
You're indeed my woman.

1139
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,990


1140
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,290
That's exactly what I thought.

1141
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,470


1142
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,410
I'm counting on you.

1143
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,660


1144
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,700
Leave it to me.

1145
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,710


1146
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,030
[Yao Yuan]

Are you free this weekend?

1154
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,230


1155
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,230
I want to treat you to dinner.

1156

1157
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,570
Xun Yuxuan,

1159
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,920
you don't have to trick me.

1160
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,270


1161
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,120
You're my flesh and blood.

1162
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,230


1163
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,260
I know what you're thinking.

Tell me. What is it?

1167
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,770
It's nothing serious.

1168
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,020


1169
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,580
It's just our flower shop.

1170
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,870


1171
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,150
No.

1173
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,770
I don't want to be a flower child.

1174
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,070


1175
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,440
What flower child?

1181
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,510
When the flower shop prospers,

You don't agree?

1189
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,950

Where do you live?

Fine.

1202

1203
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,670
For the sake of our kinship,

Don't worry.

1211
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,340
I'll pay you well.

1212

1213
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,900
I'm hanging up.

1454
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,350


1455
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,820
I should be rewarded for my hard work.

1456
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,070


1457
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:35,900
I don't even get to drink water.

1458
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,110


1459
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,470
What kind of person is that?

1460
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:36,910


1461
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,290
Is she my enemy?

1462
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,710


1463
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,020
Why is she vying for

1464
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,150


1465
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:42,720
all the men I'm interested in?

1466
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,940


1467
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,840
No.

1468
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,030


1469
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,480
What does he have to do with me?

1470
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,710


1471
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,390


1472
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,250
What right do I have to question her?

1473
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,990


1474
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:11,740
Lin Wanning.

1475
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,140
Why are you here?

1476
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,390


1477
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,120
Watch your girlfriend.

1478
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,430


1479
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:33,840
From now on,

1480
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:33,990


1481
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,390
I won't use my looks for profit anymore.

1482
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,630


1483
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,870
It's all dirty money.

1484
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,270


1485
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,660
What do you know?

1486
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:37,950


1487
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,740
We are prioritizing

1488
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,750


1489
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,950
our customers' needs.

1490
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,110


1491
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:42,780
You're right.

1492
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:42,990


1493
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,480
To thank you for your hard work,

1494
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,540


1495
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,690
I'll give you a handsome reward.

1496
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,910


1497
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,080
There's a reward?

1498
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,390


1499
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:52,890
Done.

1500
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,020


1501
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,300
Such a large sum?

1502
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,590


1503
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,490
Thank you, Huixin.

1504
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,830


1505
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,790
You are more like a sister to me than my actual sister.

1506
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,270


1507
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,820
What are you talking about?

1508
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,190


1509
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,520
Then send me a reward too.

1510
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,870


1511
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,070


1512
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,770
Someone more charming than you two has arrived.

1513
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,370
Brother-in-law!

1514
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:08,790


1515
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,300
Why are you here?

1516
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,470


1517
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,210
You're early today.

1518
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,430


1519
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:11,910
Did it go well?

1520
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,230


1521
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,820
No.

1522
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,110


1523
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,360
I missed you the entire day

1524
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,630


1525
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,330
so I couldn't focus.

1526
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,750


1527
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,100
I couldn't wait to see you,

1528
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,310


1529
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,340
so I rushed here as soon as I could.

1530
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,470


1531
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,770
Mr. Gu, your sweet words are making me jealous.

1532
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,030


1533
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,580


1534
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,370
I haven't eaten yet,

1535
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,510
but I'm already full from all that honey.

1536
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,830


1537
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,650
Was today's event successful?

1538
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,710


1539
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,410
Of course.

1540
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,510


1541
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,650
How could it not go well with me?

1542
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,590


1543
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,710
Look at them.

1544
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:34,790


1545
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,880
So obsessed with money.

1546
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,030


1547
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,500
I have to work at my day job

1548
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,580


1549
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,110


1550
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,940
and I have to work for them on weekends.

1551
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,080
I'm exhausted.

1552
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,270


1553
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,410
Such is the life of a wage earner.

1554
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,670


1555
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:43,840
By the way,

1556
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,270


1557
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,950
I saw your boss outside.

1558
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,230


1559
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,360
She seemed unhappy.

1560
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,590


1561
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,520
My boss?

1562
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:49,790


1563
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,110
Where is she?

1564
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,460


1565
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:51,730
Outside.

1566
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,190


1567
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:58,710
She was here?

1568
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,070


1569
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,090
Sorry,

1570
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,340


1571
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,030
the subscriber you dialed cannot be connected at the moment.

1572
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:06,310


1573
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,630
Where are you going?

1574
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:11,830


1575
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,450
We still need to eat.

1576
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,670


1577
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,540
Why are you in such a hurry?

1578
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,870


1579
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,770
This kid...

1580
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:17,910


1581
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,310


1582
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,950
He is going to do what a man should do.

1583
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,930
Mrs. Lin, are you there?

1584
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,020


1585
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,450
Mrs. Lin?

1586
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,710


1587
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,490
Did she go home?

1588
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,670


1589
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,980
Invalid password.

1590
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,350


1591
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:52,190
This should be right?

1592
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,620


1593
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,290
Invalid password.

1594
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,510


1595
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,720
Oh no.

1596
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,270


1597
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,750
Sister, where are you?

1598
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,910


1599
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:29,810
Call me back when you see this.

1600
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,070


1601
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:30,760
I'm worried about you.

1602
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,070


1603
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,390
Sister,

1604
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,670


1605
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,370
don't ignore me.

1606
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:34,630


1607
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,140
I was just helping out today.

1608
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,470


1609
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,470
Tell me where you are.

1610
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:37,830


1611
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,700
Let me explain in person, okay?

1612
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,110


1613
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,060
Men are full of lies.

1614
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,430


1615
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,150
But

1616
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,470


1617
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,020
did I go too far?

1618
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,510


1619
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,380
Where is he going to stay tonight?

1620
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:54,950


1621
00:43:59,090 --> 00:43:59,860
He's a grown man.

1622
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,270


1623
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,060
He doesn't need me to worry about him.

1624
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,470


1625
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:02,720
Let's go home.

1626
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,110
