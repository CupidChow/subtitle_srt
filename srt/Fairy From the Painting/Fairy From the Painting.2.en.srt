00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,210
Are you okay?

33
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,370
Thank you.

34
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,820
Thank you for saving me again.

35
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,090
You think too much.

36
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,720
I made a mistake because of my injured hand.

37
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,140
Though it wasn't for me,

38
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,130
you saved me by accident.

39
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,660
So I have to thank you.

40
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,329
You're welcome.

41
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,960
I didn't mean it.

42
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,090
Okay.

43
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,470
Bye.

44
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,260
Hello?

45
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:47,630
I'll be right there.

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,440
Do you know how to drive?

47
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,730
How did you drive the car?

48
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,610
I'm asking you!

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,370
I'm sorry, bro.

50
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll handle it later.

51
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,430
Hurry up.

52
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,530
Boss.

53
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,670
I heard you hit a car for the fairy.

54
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,250
Big news!

55
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,860
You're now the iron tree in blossom,

56
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,760
which is seldom seen in a thousand years.

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,160
Where is the fairy?

58
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,440
Little fairy.

59
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,790
Xun Yuxuan.

60
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,060
How do you know her name?

61
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,610
By throwing a tortoise shell.

62
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,810
She is the full-time driver Grandpa found for you.

63
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,980
Everyone in the company

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,880
knows who she is.

65
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,560
Stop interrupting me.

66
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,780
Where is she?

67
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,650
She left.

68
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,040
She left?

69
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,880
How could she leave?

70
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,470
Listen, she is your full-time driver.

71
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
No matter where you go,

72
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,340
she has to follow you.

73
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:34,950
You know?

74
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,930
She's the full-time killer to kill me, right?

75
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,630
Deal with it.

76
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,060
Boss, please.

77
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,060
I've got a party to go.

78
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,930
I sneaked out.

79
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,850
I have to go back later.

80
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,820
Don't think I don't know

81
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,010
what you did for grandpa.

82
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,380
Atone for your sins.

83
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,580
Hello, are you Miss Xun Yuxuan?

84
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,560
Yes.

85
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,890
Hello, I'm the administrative director of Gu Group.

86
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,710
Hello. Hello.

87
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,820
I received a notice from CEO Office.

88
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,620
Your florist

89
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,850
will be the supplier of our group

90
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,240
from today.

91
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,740
Could you please

92
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,890
change the flowers and plants this morning?

93
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,290
Okay, no problem.

94
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,980
I’ll be there soon.

95
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,370
Hello, are you Miss Xun?

96
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,100
Yes, I am.

97
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:39,980
Hello.

98
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,170
You need to measure the distance between the flowerpots with a ruler.

99
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,590
Make sure the gap is accurate. Each two of them are opposite each other.

100
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,770
After changing the flowers in the lobby and the corridor,

101
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,500
change the flowers in each office.

102
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,700
I've informed all departments.

103
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,250
But before you go in,

104
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,110
knock the door first.

105
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,700
Okay.

106
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,350
Okay.

107
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:56,720
Thank you.

108
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,560
Thank you.

109
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,920
Oh my god.

110
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,020
OCD level 10.

111
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,100
How can an employee live with such a boss?

112
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,170
Fine.

113
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,360
I'll change the plants.

114
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,940
You go to the offices to change the flowers.

115
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:16,410
Okay.

116
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,280
Hello, change the plants.

117
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,200
Hello, change the plants.

118
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,470
This office is so neat.

119
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,140
This person must be a very strict person.

120
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,010
Why is another room here?

121
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,850
The director said we should put the flowers in every room.

122
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,320
Don't yell.

123
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,170
Do not yell.

124
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,130
Do you hear me?

125
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,930
What did grandpa promise you

126
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,490
to get close to me again and again?

127
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,540
Approach you again and again?

128
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,360
What do you mean?

129
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,840
A romantic encounter.

130
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,690
A designated driver.

131
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,800
A full-time driver.

132
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,000
And you even broke into my office today.

133
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,250
Why are you still faking?

134
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,270
Mr. Gu,

135
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,920
aren’t you too narcissistic?

136
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,930
I thought you were haunting me.

137
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,220
Why are you everywhere?

138
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,630
You...

139
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,250
What?

140
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,700
Let me tell you again.

141
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,860
I didn't approach you on purpose.

142
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,940
Going to the museum is my job.

143
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,880
Being a designated driver is my job.

144
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,380
Being a full-time driver is my job.

145
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,050
And I'm here to work today.

146
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,970
It has nothing to do with you.

147
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,890
Also, I admit

148
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,720
Grandpa Gu did give me a great treatment.

149
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,170
But I earned it

150
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,050
with my hard work.

151
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,860
You don't have the right to criticize me.

152
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,490
Goodbye, Mr. Gu.

153
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,159
By the way, Mr. Gu,

154
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,890
I have the spirit of contract.

155
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,700
If you need a car,

156
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,060
remember to call me.

157
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,160
Bye.

158
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,460
Miss Xun.

159
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,580
Mr. Bai.

160
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,179
You have finished?

161
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,740
Just call me Bai Bin.

162
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,580
After all, we are colleagues now.

163
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,789
You’re right.

164
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,179
Then don't call me Miss Xun anymore.

165
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,330
Call me Yuxuan.

166
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,500
Otherwise, it sounds weird.

167
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,270
Okay. Yuxuan,

168
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,080
are you going back?

169
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,290
Yes, Huixin is waiting for me downstairs.

170
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:56,900
Thank you.

171
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,230
Oh, right.

172
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,260
By the way,

173
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,720
I really should thank you.

174
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,970
If it weren't for your help,

175
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,220
we wouldn't have signed a long-term contract

176
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,420
with Gu Group,

177
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,900
and our florist would really go bankrupt.

178
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,660
Don't worry about it.

179
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,790
I didn't help much.

180
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,280
The company just needs it.

181
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,920
Thank you so much.

182
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,710
I'll treat you to a feast next time you come to our florist.

183
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,180
Okay.

184
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,130
I'm leaving.

185
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:21,850
Bye.

186
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,280
Bye.

187
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,270
Bye.

188
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,700
Mr. Gu.

189
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,170
What are you doing here?

190
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,300
Exercise my neck.

191
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,320
Go ahead if there's nothing else.

192
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,650
Take me to the sculpture hall.

193
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,590
Okay.

194
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:57,930
It seems

195
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,170
I will have a great-grandson soon.

196
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,850
Yancheng, do your best!

197
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,320
You have a good body and you're rich.

198
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,700
Yuxuan, we've been good friends for so many years,

199
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,950
don't forget me when you are rich.

200
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,140
No way.

201
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,550
That narcissist.

202
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,910
If he dares to mock me again,

203
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,030
I'll teach him a lesson.

204
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,000
That makes sense.

205
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,770
When did you arrive?

206
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:39,750
Not long.

207
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,820
When you were talking about the narcissist.

208
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:42,800
Who

209
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:43,870
made you so angry?

210
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,010
No, just a narcissist.

211
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,860
Mr. Bai, are you here to buy flowers

212
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,420
or look for someone?

213
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,560
I'm here for dinner.

214
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,330
I invited Bai Bin.

215
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,130
I think

216
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,180
he did us

217
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,430
such a good turn.

218
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,210
We should treat him to a big meal,

219
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,020
right?

220
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,570
What do you think?

221
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,760
No problem.

222
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:09,890
Arrange.

223
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,180
Yancheng.

224
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,250
Grandpa!

225
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,780
Yancheng,

226
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,940
I heard that your relationship with Yuxuan

227
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,630
was developing rapidly.

228
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:31,980
Grandpa.

229
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,940
Can you stop being so childish?

230
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,780
What?

231
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,390
I'm childish?

232
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,520
Yes.

233
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,120
As a representative of Gu Group,

234
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,030
you've been acting strange lately.

235
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,180
You can't indulge yourself anymore.

236
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,890
Why do you

237
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,500
change the subject?

238
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,980
I want to know about you and Yuxuan.

239
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,830
Do you still need to inquire?

240
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,790
Isn't she the person you arranged?

241
00:12:59,450 --> 00:12:59,940
Wrong.

242
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,550
I did

243
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,760
arrange

244
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,000
a romantic encounter for you.

245
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,340
But

246
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,200
you had gone to rescue her

247
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,250
before the lady I arranged arrived, right?

248
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,060
Yes.

249
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,230
Xun Yuxuan had nothing to do

250
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,380
with grandpa.

251
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,190
What?

252
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,080
Grandpa didn't arrange Xun Yuxuan.

253
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,380
This means

254
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,710
my arrangement doesn't count.

255
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,890
It only counts if it's arranged by God.

256
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:29,780
Right?

257
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,640
Grandpa didn't tell me. Why didn't you tell me earlier?

258
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,010
I...

259
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
It's not that I didn't tell you.

260
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,140
You didn't ask me to tell you.

261
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,690
You were there.

262
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,250
This...

263
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,360
A feast?

264
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,480
Isn't it a feast?

265
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,170
It seems to be a feast.

266
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,020
Right?

267
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,410
This isn't the feast I talked about.

268
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,560
But our budget is limited.

269
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,090
The flower shop has just started.

270
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,520
How can we waste money?

271
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,920
When I make big money,

272
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,060
I'll make it up to you.

273
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,240
Is that okay, Mr. GM Assistant?

274
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,630
This is enough.

275
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,280
I don't have high requirements for food.

276
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,550
Let's drink cola instead of wine

277
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,230
with pizza as a feast.

278
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,630
Thank you for your help.

279
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,190
We'll be good friends from now on.

280
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,610
If you have any difficulties,

281
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,880
you must tell Huixin and me.

282
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,000
We will do anything to help you.

283
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,130
Cheers.

284
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,840
Your assistant has a good taste

285
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,630
and he is more efficient than you.

286
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,820
Boss.

287
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:49,810
Look.

288
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,420
Let's go.

289
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,500
Okay. Got it.

290
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,240
Something urgent came up, so I have to go.

291
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,100
What's wrong?

292
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,280
There are some rumors about you and Mr. Gu online.

293
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,520
But don't worry.

294
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,500
The company can solve it.

295
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,420
What does he mean?

296
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,740
What rumor?

297
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,600
My goodness, Yuxuan, look.

298
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
The president of Gu Group is a playboy.

299
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,930
[The CEO of Gu Group is a prodigal?]  [Go back with a new lover late at night.]

300
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,930
[The CEO of Gu Group is a prodigal?]  [Go back with a new lover late at night.]

301
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,850
They hugged each other in the middle of the night.

302
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,690
[No more fairy tales.]

303
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,840
[The CEO of Gu Group has a new lover.]

304
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,070
Yuxuan.

305
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:47,790
Are you okay?

306
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,790
Let's ignore these rumors.

307
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,820
This photo makes me look too fat.

308
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,050
Am I fat?

309
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,060
No.

310
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,840
Hello.

311
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,210
I'm Gu Yancheng.

312
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,490
Let's talk.

313
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,800
Seriously? It's not true.

314
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,620
What does it have to do with that guy and me?

315
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,560
Ignore them.

316
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,710
You will come back to me.

317
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,580
Mrs. Gu.

318
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,060
We have airplanes, yachts and tanks.

319
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,270
Are you interested?

320
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,710
Yuxuan, you're rich now. Don't forget your friends.

321
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,580
We haven't been in touch for years.

322
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,440
I want to borrow some money from you.

323
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,330
You wretch, you interfered with other people's relationship.

324
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,060
You must die.

325
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,130
Hello?

326
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,010
Where are you?

327
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,440
Let's talk.

328
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,940
What took you so long?

329
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,570
Miss,

330
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,730
how did you think of meeting here?

331
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,620
The rumor about us has spread widely.

332
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,980
Everyone knows it.

333
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,810
It's the safest to meet here.

334
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,460
Because no one would have thought

335
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,430
the head of Gu Group

336
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,860
would come here to fool around.

337
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,000
You hung up my call so confidently.

338
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,710
Now you want to talk to me in secret.

339
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,320
That's because I didn't expect

340
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,490
the rumor would affect me so much.

341
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,580
Doesn't it affect you?

342
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,580
Affect?

343
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,070
Not at all.

344
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,890
That's good.

345
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,650
It's just that the stock price of Gu Group has limited down

346
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,360
with a loss of two billion.

347
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Two billion?

348
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,340
Two billion!

349
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,570
That means

350
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,760
you take half and I take half.

351
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,420
You're worth one billion and I'm worth one billion.

352
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,910
That means I'm worth one billion.

353
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,590
Don't go.

354
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,540
You have to solve

355
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,250
the rumor first.

356
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,690
Then Miss Xun Billion,

357
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,110
do you have any idea?

358
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,740
No.

359
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:51,900
Do you?

360
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,550
I do.

361
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,150
What is it?

362
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,820
Stay by my side.

363
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,290
What do you mean?

364
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,900
Don't get me wrong.

365
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,190
I just want you to stay by my side

366
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,270
and continue to be my driver.

367
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,560
In this way, the Group and I can tell the public

368
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,510
that you are my driver.

369
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,530
All the rumors

370
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,030
will disappear.

371
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,810
I think it'll work.

372
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,810
Let's go. Take me home.

373
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,570
Wait.

374
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,540
You have to apologize for the misunderstanding

375
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,570
and slander to me.

376
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,230
Apologize?

377
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:36,660
Yes.

378
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,110
I just found out today

379
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,580
the stock price of Gu Group

380
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,810
decreases by two billion in an hour.

381
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,100
In any case,

382
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,540
this rumor has a greater impact on you.

383
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,790
If I don't agree...

384
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,120
Are you threatening me?

385
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,830
You were the one who slandered me first.

386
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,690
Fine.

387
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,480
I misunderstood you.

388
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,130
Is that all?

389
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,590
You are underplaying the whole thing.

390
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,900
Dear employee,

391
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,830
what you've received

392
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,260
is the first sincere apology from me, your boss,

393
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,220
in a lifetime.

394
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,450
You should be grateful when everything is still fine.

395
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,800
Now, please follow the staff rules.

396
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,570
Take me home right now.

397
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,240
Let's go. Wait for me outside.

398
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,020
Yes, boss.

399
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,660
It is often said that the gale will stop at sunset,

400
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,940
and flies will flee when a swatter is risen up.

Gu Yancheng.

402
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,560

Hello, Mr. Gu.

Come back and take me away.

He’s out.

406
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,640
Mr. Gu.

407
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,770
What are you doing?

408
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,400
Stop filming!

409
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:51,780
Stop filming.

410
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,310
-Mr. Gu, tell us about it. -Stop filming.

Miss, can I interview you?

413
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,290
Can't you tell he's sick?

414
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,370
Let him go.

415
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,180
If you have nothing to do,

416
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,860
spend some time on interviewing scientists.

417
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,900
Why do you have to interview these profiteers?

418
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,970
-You and Mr. Gu... -Let’s go.

419

Mr. Gu, you are here in person today?

Okay.

No.

Why?

442

I'm a driver. Why should I wear a dress?

443
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,180
Don't you want to clarify

444

our relationship?

What does it have to do with my dress?

The heel is too high.

00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,130
It would be a pity if you become strangers.

509
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,990
Is this your driver?

510
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,270
No.

511
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,480
This is the new president assistant recruited by Gu Group.

512
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,100
She and Bai Bin

513
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,310
will be my right-hand men.

514
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,120
Gu Muyu.

515
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,750
So beautiful.

516
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,970
Excuse me, Uncle Lin.

517
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,620
Miss Gu.

518
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,510
May I take some photos for you?

519
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,360
High heels are not convenient, indeed.

520
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,660
No need.

521
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,760
Look over here.

522
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,140
Okay. One, two, three.

523
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,050
Look here.

524
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,470
Look here. Here.

525
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:38,950
Gu Muyu.

526
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,460
Sorry.

527
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,430
I have something to do today.

528
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,640
That's all for today's photoshoot.

529
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,770
Thank you all.

530
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,830
Thank you all.

531
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,160
Thank you.

532
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,340
Brother, why are you here?

533
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,730
I didn't expect you would come.

534
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,140
Aren't you...

535
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,700
I'm your brother's

536
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,600
rumored new love.

537
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,070
But don't worry.

538
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,870
I'm actually his employee.

539
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,220
An loyal employee.

540
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,470
No wonder.

541
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,390
He does not act like that.

542
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,190
But you look familiar the first time I saw you.

543
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,150
I think I've seen you somewhere.

544
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:22,860
I remember that.

545
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,130
-You look like that fairy... -Muyu.

546
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,170
Mr. Gu.

547
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,680
Long time no see.

548
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,150
You made such a big fuss.

549
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,410
I didn't expect you to deal with it peacefully.

550
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,980
I thought I wouldn't see Mr. Gu today.

551
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,950
It's beyond my expectation.

552
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:53,770
Really?

553
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,030
But meeting you here today

554
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,360
is within my expectation.

555
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,500
Please cut to the chase.

556
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,570
I heard that Gu Group is also bidding for the Yiyu Garden Project.

557
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,340
I didn't expect that the Wei family cares

558
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,220
about Gu's every move this much.

559
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,270
I only represent myself.

560
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,410
It has nothing to do with the Wei family.

561
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,660
Then is it you or the Wei family

562
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,460
who manipulated the whole thing?

563
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,620
Gu Yancheng.

564
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,160
You did something inappropriate.

565
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,750
Don't blame it on the Wei family.

566
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,260
Haodong, calm down.

567
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:27,860
Don't be like this.

568
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,300
My brother is sharp-tongued.

569
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,880
Don't take what he said seriously.

570
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,300
Brother, what did you say?

571
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,330
Must you two turn yourselves from friends to enemies?

572
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,340
Friends?

573
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,020
I've never treated him as a friend.

574
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,590
Same to you.

575
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,010
Gu Yancheng.

576
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,800
I think I've found your secret.

577
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,330
See you.

578
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,090
Please take care of my brother.

579
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,910
Are you okay?

580
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,600
Of course.

581
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,260
Do you want to dance?

582
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,250
To satisfy everyone's expectations,

583
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,360
we should dance.

584
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,030
Sorry.

585
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,090
I've already had a partner.

586
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,860
♫Finally♫

587
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,680
♫Lost over the centuries♫

588
