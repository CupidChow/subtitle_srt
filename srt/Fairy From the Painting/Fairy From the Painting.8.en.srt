00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,010
It's such a wide road. Where did you park the car?

547
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,990


548
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,700
How did you park the car?

549
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,710


550
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,070
What do you mean?

551
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,030


552
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,940
What are you doing?

553
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,950


554
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,980


555
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,700
I finally understand

556
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,360
why this chairman wants me to make a sculpture

557
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,470


558
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,770
for Yuyuan Garden.

559
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,940


560
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,830


561
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,430
This person is not simple.

562
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,650
I asked Mr. Wang's men.

563
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,910


564
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,110


565
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,030
Only Mr. Wang has seen this chairman.

566
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,500
He is very mysterious.

567
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,830


568
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,580
I sent someone to check his identity.

569
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,820


570
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,570
I gained nothing.

571
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,700


572
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,350


573
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,400
We can meet him today.

574
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,520
Mr. Gu. Mr. Shao.

575
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,750


576
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,020
Welcome.

577
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,150


578
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,869
There's still some time before the contract.

579
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,030


580
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,680
I'll take you to the lounge.

581
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,829


582
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:20,710


583
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:20,750
Thank you.

584
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,230
Please.

585
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,430


586
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,670
Can't you wait any longer?

587
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,910


588
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,650
It's just a contract. What's the rush?

589
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,020


590
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,560
I'm not talking about the contract.

591
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,750


592
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,350


593
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,230
But the fairy.

594
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,130
No.

595
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,470


596
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,080
Really?

597
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,230


598
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,540
We've been brothers for so many years.

599
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,580


600
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,670
From what I know about you,

601
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,910


602
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,120
I know you well.

603
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,470


604
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,430
Shut up.

605
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,750


606
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,740
You stubborn duck.

607
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,110


608
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,710


609
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:09,520
Mr. Gu.

610
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,350


611
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,240
Why are you here?

612
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,090
To give you a surprise, of course.

613
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,270


614
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:19,890
What do you mean?

615
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,110


616
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,950
Tell me.

617
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,230


618
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,490
What do you want?

619
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,430


620
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,700
Gu Group

621
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,790


622
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,020
will sign the Yiyu Garden Project.

623
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,150


624
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:27,870


625
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,640
Let me congratulate you.

626
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,290
I heard you agree to

627
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,460


628
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,680
carve an exclusive piece.

629
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,950


630
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,180
But do they know

631
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,310


632
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,190
that you can't carve anymore?

633
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,470


634
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,240
It's none of your business.

635
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,390


636
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,670


637
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,600
Why not?

638
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,270
If you can't carve,

639
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,470


640
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,450
the contract won't be established.

641
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,670


642
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,200
Isn't your Gu Group

643
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,340


644
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,150
cheating?

645
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,270


646
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,590
I hope you can give up the contract.

647
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,870


648
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,370
What if I refuse?

649
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,390


650
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,200
Then I'll tell everyone

651
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,310


652
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,510
that you can't carve

653
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,710


654
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,690
at the scene of your contract.

655
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,750


656
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:00,620
Hello.

657

658
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,120
Xun Yuxuan.

659
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,270


660
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,500
Hello, Gu Yancheng.

661
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,620


662
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,160
Gu Yancheng, come and save us! Gu Yancheng!

663

Gu Yancheng, come and save us!

665

Gu Yancheng!

667

668

Gu Yancheng! Help us! Gu Yancheng!

669

Gu Yancheng!

671

Gu Yancheng, come and save us! Gu Yancheng!

673
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,790

Gu Yancheng! Hey!

675

676
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,680
-Xun Yuxuan. -Gu Yancheng.

677
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,820


678
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,310
What's wrong, boss?

679
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,390


680
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,960
-Call the police. -Boss.

681
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,190


682
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,850
Something happened to Yu Xuan.

683
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,950


684
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,250
Boss, what happened?

685
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,300


686
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,140
Yuxuan was kidnapped.

687
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,150


688
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,900
She is with Muyu.

690
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,740
Call the police.

692
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,580
What?

693
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,820


694
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,790
Mr. Gu.

695
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,140


696
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,190
We're going to sign the contract soon.

697
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,230


698
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,280
Where are you going?

699

700
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,090
I'm sorry.

701
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,100


702
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,540
Mr. Gu.

703
00:20:59,030 --> 00:20:59,790


704
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,810
What happened?

705
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:02,820


706
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,350
Something must have happened to Xun Yuxuan and Muyu.

707
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,550


708
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,210
What?

709
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,230


710
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,070
Don't tell anyone.

711
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,340


712
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,420
I'll go with you.

713
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,470


714
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:07,900
Okay, let's go.

715
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,030


716
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,550


717
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,340
Let's call the police.

718
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,540
Sir, the contract may be canceled.

719
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,630


720
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,900
Mr. Gu left

721
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,100


722
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,950
in a hurry.

723
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,980


724
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,120
How did you drive?

725
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,310


726
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,410
How did you park on such a broad road?

727
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,510


728
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,840
What do you mean?

729
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,910


730
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,740
What are you doing?

731
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,750


732
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:42,520
Let her go!

733
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,630


734
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,390


735
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,260
Hello, Mr. Gu.

736
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,430
Who sent you?

737
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,630


738
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,430


739
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,320
You have only one choice.

740
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,510


741
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,400
Terminate the contract with Yiyu Garden.

742
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,870


743
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,900
Otherwise, your sister's naked photos

744
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,790


745
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,690
will appear on the internet tomorrow.

746
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,010
Her career as a star will be completely ruined.

747
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,060


748
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,850
Are you threatening me?

749
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,830


750
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,140
It depends on

751
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,150


752
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,860
how good your relationship is.

753
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,870


754
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,590
Okay, I promise you.

755
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,790


756
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,920
Where are they?

757
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:26,990


758
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,630


759
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,560
Mr. Gu, calm down.

760
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,110


761
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,050
Don't call the police.

762
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,380
After tonight,

763
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,510


764
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,480
your sister will be safe.

765
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,710


766
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,950


767
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,870
Not only my sister,

768
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,450
the other lady

769
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,670


770
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,020
can't be in any danger.

771
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,270


772
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,380
Mr. Gu,

773
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,390


774
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,300
what's wrong with Yuxuan?

775
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,390


776
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,520
How could she be kidnapped?

777
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,710


778
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,710
Why is she here?

779
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,830


780
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,210
Yuxuan invited her to the party.

781
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,310


782
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,630
I bring her along when I come back.

783
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,750


784
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,060
Cut the crap.

785
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,230


786
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:03,730
Boss,

787
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,910


788
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,830
what's wrong with Yuxuan?

789
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,910


790
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,520
Someone wants to break the contract.

791
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,710


792
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,640
They kidnapped Muyu.

793
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,750


794
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,120
Yuxuan was taken away

795
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,150


796
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,950
to save Muyu.

797
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,030


798
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,530
What should we do?

799
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,670


800
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,990


801
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,110
They are safe for now.

802
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,640
Are we just waiting?

803
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,710


804
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,580
Of course not.

805
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,590


806
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,680
Shao Jie,

807
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,830


808
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,260


809
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,990
give this to the police.

810
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,940
Try your best to cooperate with the police.

811
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,110


812
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,450
Where are you going?

813
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,510


814
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,270
Miss Gu.

815
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,500


816
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,790
Miss Gu.

817
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,910


818
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,250
Muyu, wake up.

819
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,430


820
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,090
Muyu.

821
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,310


822
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,350
Muyu.

823
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,150
Yuxuan.

824
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,230


825
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,740
My head hurts.

826
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,790


827
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,660
Where am I?

828
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,830


829
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,990


830
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,910
It looks like this is a mountainous area.

831
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,890
We are trapped here.

832
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,990


833
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,510
What should we do?

834
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,470


835
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,850
We must find a way to escape.

836
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,030


837
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,560
Why does this sculpture

838
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,670


839
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,610
look so familiar?

840
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,660


841
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,050
Is anyone there?

842
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,060


843
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,240
Open the door!

844
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,390


845
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,370
If you don't open the door.

846
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:33,380


847
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,940
We'll escaped from the window.

848
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,110


849
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,160
You can check the window.

850
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,270


851
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,050
Fine.

852
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,180


853
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,440
Do you think we're that easy to be cheat?

854
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,630


855
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,350


856
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,330
How about that?

857
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,310


858
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,100
Do you still want to break the window?

859
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,770
I heard that Mr. Gu gave up the contract.

860
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,990


861
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,630
What makes

862
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,780


863
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,950


864
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,790
you give up your calmness?

865
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,230


866
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,130
I'm curious.

867
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,510
Tell me, where is she?

868
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,670


869
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,420
Gu Yancheng.

870
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,550


871
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,840
You are crazy!

872
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,070


873
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,450
What did you say? I don't understand.

874
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,630


875
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,920
Stop pretending.

876
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,060


877
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,140
The one who doesn't want Gu Group to get the bidding

878
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,150


879
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,070
is the Wei family.

880
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,270


881
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
It must be you!

882
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,670


883
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,630


884
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,540
Muyu loves you so much.

885
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,330
But you hurt her like this.

886
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,420


887
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,830


888
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,760
I don't know.

889
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,500


890
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,470
I didn't do it.

891
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,170
I gave up the bidding.

892
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,260


893
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,650
Tell me where they are.

894
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,750


895
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:55,910


896
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:55,810
Gu Yancheng.

897
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,050
If your assistant was arrested,

898
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,110


899
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,330
you can suspect me.

900
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,470


901
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,910


902
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,750
But you should believe

903
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,630
I won't get Muyu involved.

904
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,820


905
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,170
I can trust you,

906
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,270


907
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,260
but I won't trust the Wei family.

908
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,390


909
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,630
If you really care about Muyu,

910
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,870


911
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,390
go back and investigate.

912
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,550


913
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,480
Hello?

914
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,740


915
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,430
Okay, I got it.

916
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,670


917
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,790


918
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,800
I'll be right there.

919
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,060
Gather everyone in the Security Department.

920
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,150


921
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:39,940
Okay.

922
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:39,950


923
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,430


924
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,330
I'll go with you.

925
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,190


926
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,180
What are you waiting for? Go!

927
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,600
Do we have to wait

928
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,670


929
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,810
for a miracle to happen?

930
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,910


931
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,970
Don't think too much.

932
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,190


933
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,130
Be quiet.

934
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,300


935
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,530
You can go back tomorrow.

936
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,620


937
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:19,930
Eat.

938
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:19,990


939
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,070


940
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,010
Who kidnapped us?

941
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,240
Who sent you here?

942
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,390


943
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,970
You did this for money, right?

944
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,070


945
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,140
What's the price?

946
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,150


947
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,960
We'll pay double.

948
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,150


949
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,710


950
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,570
Surprise!

951
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,430


952
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,240
Is this your work for the Golden Eagle?

953
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,070
Yes.

954
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,230


955
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:08,590
No.

956
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:08,710


957
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,460
Why are you here?

958
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,630


959
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,140
You've been in seclusion for the Golden Eagle Award for so long.

960
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,150


961
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,390


962
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,320
I haven't seen you for a long time.

963
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,390


964
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,130
I just want to see you.

965
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,690
Let's talk outside.

966
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,750


967
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:21,680
Okay.

968
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:21,910


969
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,390
This must be the Wei family.

970
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,510


971
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,110


972
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,920
If I tell Yuxuan, Haodong will be in trouble.

973
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,570
Anyway, we can get out tomorrow.

974
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,670


975
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,480
Yuxuan, the food looks delicious.

976
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,590


977
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,250
Come and try it.

978
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,430


979
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,630


980
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:55,580
Muyu,

981
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,670


982
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,490
you're too generous.

983
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,480
It's okay.

984
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,550


985
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,990


986
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,790
He said he would send us back tomorrow.

987
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,730
And I trust my brother.

988
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,030


989
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,050
He will come to save us.

990
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,270


991
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,210
But

992
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,270


993
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,270


994
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,170
I don't think he knows where we are.

995
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,670


996
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,570
He must be worried.

997
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,950


998
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,730
No.

999
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,730
I have to think of a way.

1000
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,070


1001
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,020
Boss.

1002
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,030


1003
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,060
I checked.

1004
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,070


1005
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,290
The commercial car finally drove into this neighborhood.

1006
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,470


1007
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,020
This is a premium resort.

1008
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,070


1009
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,090
It has a large area.

1010
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,110


1011
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,430
There are dozens of villas

1012
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,470


1013
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,340
in different places.

1014
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,550


1015
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,230
Let's split up.

1016
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,260


1017
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,360
Search one by one.

1018
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,230


1019
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,370
Help!

1020
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,540


1021
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,030


1022
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,950
Help me! Let me out!

1023
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,050
Help!

1024
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,110


1025
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,750


1026
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,640
Help! Help me!

1027
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,830
Let me out!

1028
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,900


1029
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:28,910
Do you believe

1030
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,110


1031
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,220


1032
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,890
my self-cultivation as an actor?

1033
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,420
-Muyu. -So hurt!

1034
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,550


1035
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,250
Yuxuan.

1036
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,270


1037
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,140
Are you okay, Muyu?

1038
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,230


1039
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,290
I have gastroenteritis.

1040
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,390


1041
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,630
It's gastroenteritis.

1042
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,710


1043
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,980
She is gastroenteritis.

1044
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,060


1045
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,420
I'll get someone help you.

1046
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,380


1047
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,060
Is anyone there?

1048
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:51,990


1049
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,120
Gu Muyu has gastroenteritis.

1050
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,990


1051
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,030
Gu Muyu has a gastroenteritis.

1052
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,110


1053
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,790
Find a doctor for her.

1054
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,950


1055
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,010
She has a gastroenteritis.

1056
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,020


1057
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,710


1058
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,680
Hurry up.

1059
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,460
It hurts so much.

1060
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,470


1061
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,940
Are you okay?

1062
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,950


1063
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,170
I'll get someone help you.

1064
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,230


1065
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,100
Call the doctor!

1066
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,190


1067
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,710
Hello?

1068
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:28,950


1069
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,390


1070
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,460
Hello, boss. I think something happened inside.

1071
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,470


1072
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,260
What should we do?

1073
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:33,900
Let's go inside.

1074
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,910


1075
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,200
If it's true,

1076
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,350


1077
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,510


1078
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,380
find a doctor.

1079
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,030


1080
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,960
Help!

1081
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,350
Help her!

1082
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,430


1083
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:47,940
Stop knocking!

1084
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:47,950


1085
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,450
-Brother. -What?

1086
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,540


1087
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,380
Take a look at her.

1088
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,390


1089
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,900
Gu Muyu really has a stomachache.

1090
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,910


1091
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,770
Let me see.

1092
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,990


1093

It hurts.

1095
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:56,980
What's wrong?

1096
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:56,990


1097
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,180
My stomach hurts.

1098
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,190


1099
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,950
Muyu, let's go.

1100
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,990


1101
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,710
Muyu, what's wrong?

1102
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,790


1103
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,710


1104
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,510
Yuxuan, I think I sprained my ankle.

1105
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:12,900
-Stop! -Run,Yuxuan,run!

1106
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,909


1107

Go! Yuxuan!

1108

1109
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,120
Leave me alone.

1110
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,230


1111
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,460
Let my brother save me.

1112
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,510


1113
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,820
Stop! Stop!

Are you okay?

1116
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,550


1117

1119
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:34,860
The police will be here soon.

1120
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:34,949


1121
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,110


1122
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,880
I didn't expect you to escape first.

1123
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,909
Sorry for startling you.

1124
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,870


1125
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,230


1126
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,250
Why is it Wei Sculpture?

1127
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,930
Can you ask where your sister is?

1128
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,950


1129
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,320
Where is Muyu?

1130
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,510


1131
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,110
Muyu?

1132
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,350


1133
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,980
Muyu is still in that house over there.

1134
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,190


1135
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,300
Someone is watching her.

1136
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,310


1137
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,270

Let's go.

Let's go.

1140

1141
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,560
He can do it alone.

1142
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,550


1143
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,210
You're her brother. It's not appropriate.

1144
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,270


1145
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,510


1146
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,310
Muyu is much happier

1147
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,720
to see him.

1148
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,830


1149
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,270


1150
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,080
Wei Haodong.

1151
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,670


1152
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,590
I'll leave Muyu to you.

1153
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:26,980
Boss.

1154
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:26,990


1155
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,810
How did you find us so soon?

1156
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,870


1157
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,620
I thought you couldn't find us.

1158
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,630


1159
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,660
So I came out to inform you.

1160
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,670


1161
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,910
I was so scared.

1162
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,070


1163
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,530
I'm sorry.

1164
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,670


1165
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,590


1166
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,550
It won't happen again.

1167
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,390
Let's go home.

1168
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:41,590


1169
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,940
Let's go home.

1170
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,150


1171
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:47,930
Muyu.

1172
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,070


1173
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,480
Are you okay?

1174
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,510


1175
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,970
Haodong.

1176
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,980


1177
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:54,820
I should have hired

1178
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,830


1179
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,310
someone to kidnap me,

1180
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,550


1181
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,990


1182
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,850
and asked you to save me.

1183
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,010
Don't talk nonsense.

1184
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:04,990


1185
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,100
Is someone watching you?

1186
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,230


1187
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,710


1188
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,670
He left after answering the phone.

1189
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,780
I don't have a car.

1190
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,870


1191
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,470


1192
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,230
So I asked Yuxuan find someone to pick me up.

1193
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,010
I didn't expect you to come.

1195

1196
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,170
Yuxuan knows me so well.

00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,950


1198
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,750
I'll thank her when I get back.

1199

1200
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,500
I'll ask the driver to pick us up.

1201
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,400
I'll take you home today.

1269
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,510


1270
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,000
Thank you.

1271
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,150


1272
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,050
Chairman.

1273
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,270


1274
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,100
I'm sorry.

1275
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,180


1276
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,780
The operation failed.

1277
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,790


1278
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,510
Maybe Mr. Wei knows it.

1279
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,580


1280
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,220
What do you want to do?

1281
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,270


1282
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,320
What are you talking about?

1283
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,470


1284
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,380
I don't understand.

1285
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,510


1286
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,550


1287
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,350
Stop pretending.

1288
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,050
I saw it with my own eyes.

1289
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,150


1290
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,190
You sent someone to kidnap Gu Muyu, right?

1291
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,270


1292
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,180
So what?

1293
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,310


1294
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,630
It's because you're unreliable.

1295
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,710


1296
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,030
Otherwise, I wouldn't have put in so much effort.

1297
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,150


1298
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,550
It's just a project.

1299
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,750


1300
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,630
Do you have to go this far?

1301
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,830


1302
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,890
What if you hurt her?

1303
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,900


1304
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,860


1305
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,750
For the Wei family, so what?

1306
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,710


1307
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,690
But why are you so angry?

1308
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,420
I didn't do anything to her.

1309
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,430


1310
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,190


1311
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,080
I forbid you to disturb her.

1312
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,550
You want to threaten Gu Group with her?

1313
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,740


1314
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,270


1315
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,160
That's a wrong plan.

1316
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:49,950
This time,

1317
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,110


1318
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,880
the Wei family did something shameful.

1319
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,990


1320
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,150
We don't deserve the Yiyu Garden.

1321
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,350


1322
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,370
Please stop wasting your energy.

1323
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,470


1324
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,080
If I find out you did this again,

1325
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,190


1326
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,220
you can retire.

1327
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,460


1328
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,490
Wei Haodong.

1329
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,550


1330
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,570
How dare you talk to me like that?

1331
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,750


1332
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,110
I'm your mother.

1333
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,230


1334
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,070
I raised you and taught you until now.

1335
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,230


1336
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,270


1337
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,080
How dare you talk to me like that?

1338
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,750
Because you are my mom,

1339
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,860


1340
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,340
I'm still standing here

1341
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,350


1342
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,300
to talk to you.

1343
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,430


1344
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,870


1345
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,860
Otherwise, the police

1346
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,880
will be here now.

1347
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,020


1348
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,590
Please remember what I said.

1349
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,790


1350
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,230
Hello?

1351
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,510


1352
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,620


1353
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,550
I'm just telling you.

1354
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,260


1355
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,090
The Wei family is not interested in Yiyu Garden.

1356
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,050
Whether Gu Group wants to sign the contract or not,

1357
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,230


1358
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,370
it's up to you.

1359
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,430


1360
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,130
