Since young,

77
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,550
and only I deserve you.

78

79
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,240
But I didn't expect

80
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,050
you were so tasteless

81
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,150


82
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,390
that you didn't fall in love with me.

83
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,630


84
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,550


85
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,450
It's beyond my expectation.

86
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,700
Now everyone knows that you rejected me.

87
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,950


88
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,329
You made me a joke.

89

90
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,310
I'm sorry.

92
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,020
This meal is on you.

94
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,170
Consider it as an apology.

95
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,220


96
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,880
From now on,

When your eyes

you will find your own happiness.

108
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:02,900
I will.

I wish you and Xun Yuxuan happy forever.

112
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,409
What are you looking at?

113

114
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,760
Haven't you seen anyone cry?

115
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,909


116
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,480
Yes.

117
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:51,670


118
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,370
I've never seen anyone crying so beautifully.

119
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,630


120
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,620
Let's go, Mrs. Lin. I'll send you home.

122
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,140
Many people must be laughing at me now.

124
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,550


125
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,180
I don't want to go home.

126
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,030
Where do you want to go? I'll go with you.

127

128
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:22,880
I want to indulge myself.

129

130
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,280
Do you know

131

134
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,760
Because he is excellent.

136
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,590


137
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,630
Only he deserves

138
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,500


139
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,220
such an excellent me.

00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,090
And we are a match.

Everyone says we are a perfect couple.

147

149
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,070
Tell me.

150
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,410
How could he not like me?

151
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,750


152
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,060
Did I do anything wrong?

153
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,270


154
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,090
Mrs. Lin.

155
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,190


156
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,310
Stop drinking.

157
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,590


158
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,350


159
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,180
Leave me alone.

160
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,980
You are good in everything.

161
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,230


162
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,740
I think he no taste.

163
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,020


164
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,540
Yes.

165
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,590


166
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,190
You are right.

167
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,390


168
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,650
Gu Yancheng has no taste.

169
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,750


170
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,909
You know?

171
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,140


172
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,010
He would rather let me expose the secret

173
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,030


174
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,430
that he can't carve

175
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,659


176
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,440
than be with me.

177
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,590


178
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,650
A secret that can't be carved?

179
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,940


180
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,500
I saw Gu Yancheng's diagnosiss

181
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,510


182
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,200
from my aunt.

183
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,420


184
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,460
It clearly states that

185
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,500


186
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,810
Gu Yancheng can no longer carve.

187
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,909


188
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,100
But I promised him

189
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,430


190
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,560
to keep his secret.

191
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,909


192
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,290
So I only told you.

193
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,710


194
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,590
Don't tell others.

195
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,670


196
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,910
Got it?

197
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,230


198
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,670
Okay, I'll keep it a secret for you.

199
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,020


200
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,390


201
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,160
By the way, Mrs. Lin,

202
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,050
I need to go to the toilet. Are you all right by yourself?

203
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,350


204
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,130
Hello.

205
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,300


206
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,490
Can we do an interview?

207
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,670


208
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,230


209
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,160
Who is it?

210
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,690
I'm a reporter from Weekly Magazine.

211
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,870


212
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,940
I want to interview you.

213
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,230


214
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,330
Is it true that Gu Yancheng

215
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,390


216
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,900
can't carve anymore?

217
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,150


218
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,340
None of your business. Go away.

219
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,390


220
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,980
Just an interview. Please say something.

221
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,230


222
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,630


223
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,350
Say something! Say something!

224
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,620
Let go of me!

225
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,700


226
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,210
Please don't go.

227
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,270


228
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,909
Let go of me!

229
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,950


230
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,790
Who are you?

231
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,830


232
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,980
Who are you?

233
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,110


234
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,430
I'm a reporter. What's wrong with an interview?

235
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,630


236
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,460
Get lost or I'll call the police.

237
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,630


238
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,420
Are you okay?

239
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,430


240
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,550
Who is that?

241
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:53,790


242
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,620
He seems to be a reporter and wants to interview me.

243
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,710


244
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,520
Lunatic.

245
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,590


246
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,090
Reporter.

247
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,300


248
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,180
Go, Mrs. Lin.

249
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,550


250
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,300
Where are we going?

251
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,510


252
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,070
Next round?

253
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,340


254
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,710


255
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,530
Let's go somewhere else. It's not safe here.

256
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,120
Let's go.

257
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,470


258
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:10,970
Let's go.

259
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,350


260
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,360
Let's go.

261
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,430


262
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,350


263
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,180
Be careful.

264
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,090
Let's go.

265
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,350


266
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,300
I didn't inherit

267
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,390


268
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,290
a good drinking capacity.

269
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,540


270
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,050
And just one cup can make me drunk.

271
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,270


272
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,340
You must drink.

273
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,550


274
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,110


275
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,890
Or I'll kick you out.

276
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,070
Hurry up.

277
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,310


278
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,919
That's more like it.

279
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,230


280
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,080
♫I'm going to marry you tomorrow♫

281
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,190


282
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,660
♫I'm going to marry you tomorrow♫

283
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,790


284
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,710


285
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,580
♫If you hadn't asked me♫

286
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,030


287
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,810
♫If you hadn't persuaded me♫

288
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,020
♫If you hadn't made me love you♫

289
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,190


290
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,270


291
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,950
♫At the right time♫

292
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,950
How is it?

293
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,190


294
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,350


295
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,260
Were you shocked by my singing?

296
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,030
Yes.

297
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,190


298
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,770
Say some objective opinions.

299
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,910


300
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,580
The skill of singing

301
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,620


302
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,480
is ordinary among Mrs. Lin's talents.

303
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,870


304
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,910


305
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,720
Are you

306
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,410
praising me?

307
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,710


308
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,430
Of course, I'm praising you.

309
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,460


310
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,530
It doesn't sound like it.

311
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,750


312
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,010
Why don't you think I can't sing well?

313
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,310


314
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,140
Let me sing another song for you.

315
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,150


316
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,950


317
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,920
Listen carefully.

318
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,510


319
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,260
Mrs. Lin.

320
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,580
You must be tired.

321
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,830


322
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,500


323
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,380
Would you like some water to moisten your throat?

324
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,500


325
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,350
No.

326
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,770
I sing with my abdominal voice. I won't be tired.

327
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,870


328
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,450
Give it to me.

329
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,630


330
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,400
Mrs. Lin.

331
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,550


332
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:14,710
Let go!

333
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:14,910


334
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,080
Let go!

335
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,270


336
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:19,860
Mrs. Lin.

337
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,870


338
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,370
Let go! Give it to me!

339
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,670


340
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,940
If you don't let go, I'll bite you.

341
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,070


342
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,510
How dare you!

343
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,710


344
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,380
There's nothing I dare not do.

345
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,710


346
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,020
Do you know

347
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,110


348
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,340
I'm a person who takes revenge?

349
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,510


350
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,450
If you bite me like this,

351
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,590


352
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,430
I will revenge.

353
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,510


354
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,110
It's no big deal.

355
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,310


356
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,010
Here.

357
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,390


358
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,150


359
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:22,900
Alright.

360
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,830


361
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,600
We're even now.

362
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,870


363
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,640
It's late. I should go home.

364
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:30,870


365
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,730
Are you not going to sing?

366
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,810
No.

367
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,030


368
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,830
Not bad.

369
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,030


370
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,270
Daughter.

371
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,590


372
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,880
You scared me to death in the middle of the night.

373
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,220


374
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,390
How is it, dad? Is it pretty?

375
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,750


376
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,900
It's not pretty. Such a big mouth.

377
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,390


378
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,960
How can you say that to

379
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,030


380
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,170
your beautiful and lovely daughter?

381
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,310


382
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,050
It depends on the timing.

383
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,390


384
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,240
If you go on a blind date,

385
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,470


386
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,970
you'll be cute and beautiful.

387
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,390


388
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,020
But if you are single

389
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,030


390
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,120
and enjoy yourself here,

391
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,350


392
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,940
that's scary.

393
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,270


394
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,980
Let me ask you something.

395
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,270


396
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,930
Aunt Li's nephew.

397
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,260


398
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,330
Will you see him or not?

399
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,630


400
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,100
No.

401
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,390


402
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,830
Daughter, are you in love?

403
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,230


404
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,800
Dad,

405
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,060


406
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,460
I will tell you

407
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,550


408
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,000
if I am in love.

409
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,190


410
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,660
Let me tell you.

411
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,990


412
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,250
I won't object to your relationship with anyone.

413
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,470


414
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,060
But it can't be that Gu Yancheng.

415
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,180


416
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,750
Why?

417
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,830


418
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,470


419
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,500
Actually, he

420
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,870
is quite nice.

421
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,990


422
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,780
You don't understand.

423
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,860


424
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,340
The sixth sense of an old man is the most accurate.

425
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,590


426
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,810
I thought he was unreliable.

427
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,230


428
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,410
Your sixth sense?

429
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,580


430
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,740
I think

431
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,750


432
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,930
you have a typical symptom of marriage syndrome.

433
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,230


434
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,420
Any father,

435
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,510


436
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,580
whenever a man approaches his daughter,

437
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,750


438
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,700
will definitely think this man is up to something.

439
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,820


440
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,500
Of course.

441
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,630


442
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,560
I...

443
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:15,750


444
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,950


445
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,940
All right.

446
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,160
Let's go. I'm going to sleep.

447
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,390


448
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,120
I'll drink milk.

449
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,270


450
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:20,980
Let's go.

451
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,030


452
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,090
Go to sleep.

453
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,230


454
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:22,770
Okay, good night.

455
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,870


456
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,310


457
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,020
I'll give you a good night kiss.

458
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,230
See you in my dream.

459
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,470


460
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,750


461
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,620
[We've kissed. See you in the dream.]

462
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,230


463
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,010
Hello?

464
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,660
Are you at home or at the flower shop?

465
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,670


466
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,080
Let's eat together.

467
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,430


468
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,550


469
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,450
I'm home.

470
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,540


471
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,210
Are you not feeling well?

472
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,110
No, I just have a stomachache.

473
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,150


474
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,820
Stomachache?

475
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,070


476
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,390


477
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,250
Stomachache? Do you have medicine at home?

478
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,090
Is your father here?

479
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,270


480
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,450
Let me take you to the hospital.

481
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,470


482
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,330
My dad went out. It's fine.

483
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,420


484
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,820
Maybe I did

485
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,030


486
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,980
too much exercise yesterday.

487
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,190


488
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,950
I just need rest today.

489
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,990


490
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,950


491
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,640
No way.

492
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,110
You have to go to the hospital.

493
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,230


494
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,890
I'll be right there.

495
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:09,950


496
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,810
No need.

497
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,070


498
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
Maybe I exercised too much yesterday.

499
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,550


500
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,750
I just need some rest at home,

501
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,790


502
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,030
and have some warm water.

503
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,390


504
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,370
Okay.

505
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:19,590


506
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,830
Have some warm water.

507
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,190


508
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,740
Why does he ask me to drink warm water

509
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,750


510
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,770
as I said?

511
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,950


512
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,840
I'm angry. I don't want to talk to you anymore.

513
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,230


514
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,270


515
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,060
Who is it?

516
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,570
I'm here.

517
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,910


518
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,450
Why are you here?

519
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,590


520
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,000
How can I not come when you're like this?

521
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,190


522
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,510
You hung up on me so quickly just now.

523
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,510


524
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,670
I thought you left me alone.

525
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,790


526
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,530
Are you angry?

527
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,670


528
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,540
Of course.

529
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,790


530
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,200
I was going to ignore you.

531
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,470


532
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,620


533
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,460
How about now?

534
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,950


535
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,840
Are you going to talk to me?

536
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,090
I'm not an unreasonable person.

537
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,390


538
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,270
This time I wronged you.

539
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,550


540
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:32,780
Here.

541
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,910


542
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,270
Take the medicine.

543
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,430


544
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,990
Daughter, open the door for your father. Hurry.

545
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,190


546
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,330
Yuxuan, hurry up. I take the food.

547
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,590


548
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,390
Come with me.

549
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,590


550
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,340
Yuxuan.

551
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,670


552
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,150
Yuxuan.

553
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,500


554
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,340
Is everything okay?

555
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,630


556
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,830


557
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,670
Yuxuan.

558
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,630
Stay here and keep quiet.

559
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,990


560
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:08,150
Okay.

561
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,430


562
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,420
Open the door.

563
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,750


564
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,770
Coming, dad.

565
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,990


566
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,420
The door is going to break.

567
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,670


568
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,599
Why didn't you open the door?

569
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,750


570
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,460
What happened?

571
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,550


572
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:23,839
Are you okay?

573
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,069


574
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,810
I just changed my clothes.

575
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,910


576
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,050
Did you just wake up?

577
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,230


578
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,190
You slept a lot.

579
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,430


580
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,660
Your dad's hand hurts.

581
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,990


582
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,360
Oh no.

583
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,830


584
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,280
I forgot to put it in the fridge last night.

585
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,550


586
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,470
What a waste.

587
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,630


588
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:45,760
Dad,

589
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,070


590
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,480
I'm not feeling well today.

591
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,790


592
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,610
How about you cook today?

593
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,910


594
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,880
How many times have I told you.

595
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,950


596
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,480
You need to eat breakfast.

597
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,710


598
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,000
You'll get guts.

599
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,190


600
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,130
You never listen.

601
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,630


602
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,300
Fine.

603
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,390


604
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,780
I'll cook for you.

605
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:07,910


606
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,600
Your father is a slave for you.

607
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,670


608
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,200
You are the best dad in the world.

609
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,510


610
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:19,990
Go and have a rest.

611
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,140


612
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,430


613
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,430
Let's go. Come with me.

614
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:44,790
Keep your voice down.

615
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,900


616
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:53,980
Let's go.

617
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,030


618
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,280
Yuxuan.

619
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,390


620
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,730
Is the fish steamed

621
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,830


622
00:18:59,050 --> 00:18:59,760
or braised?

623
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,030


624
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,170
Hello, Mr. Xun.

625
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,310


626
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,680
Dad, this is a misunderstanding.

627
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,870


628
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:05,700
Stop.

629
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,070


630
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,680
I'm not good.

631
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,990


632
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,110
Make it clear. Go back.

633
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,270


634
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,210
If you don't explain it clearly, I'll braise you.

635
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,310


636
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,540
Stand there. Hands apart.

637
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,870


638
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,990
Explain it.

639
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,190


640
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,760
What happened?

641
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,870


642
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,020


643
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,790
Dad.

644
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,080
You're giving me a small gift?

645
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,230


646
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:32,830
Dad.

647
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,030


648
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:33,810
Stay here.

649
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:33,910


650
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,860
You're good at flattering people.

651
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,190


652
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,130
Why is it this?

653
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,300


654
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,420
What is this?

655
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,630


656
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,040
This...

657
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,300


658
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,740


659
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,620
How could it be this?

660
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,590
Young man.

661
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,910


662
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,020
What medicine do you want?

663
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,340


664
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,650
I... Hello.

665
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,830


666
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,630
I want the medicine that the woman used.

667
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,950


668
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,470
What medicine specifically?

669
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,830


670
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,600
Well,

671
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,070


672
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,870
she exercised too much yesterday.

673
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,110


674
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,090
My girlfriend doesn't feel well in the morning.

675
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,310


676
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,950
Why are you so shy?

677
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,110


678
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,900
I've been there before.

679
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,110


680
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,930
I know what you want.

681
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,310


682
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,080
Do you want something better or ordinary?

683
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,310


684
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,050
The best.

685
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,350


686
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,010
The best. Okay, wait a moment.

687
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,550


688
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,620
Mr. Xun, that's what happened.

689
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,990


690
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,340
Yuxuan.

691
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,670


692
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,670
It's fine that you're dating him secretly.

693
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,020


694
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,950
But why did you have a baby?

695
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,150


696
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,010
I...

697
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,390


698
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,760
Say something. Explain it to me.

699
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,870


700
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,340
Alright, stop talking.

701
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,670


702
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,400
Are you a man?

703
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,510


704
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,770
A man should be responsible.

705
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,950


706
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,890
Explain it to me.

707
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,950


708
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,330
Mr. Xun, I really

709
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,430


710
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,350
like Yuxuan.

711
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,670


712
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,050
He asked you to explain the medicine

713
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,110


714
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,330
not to explain this.

715
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,550


716
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,760
I told you

717
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,950


718
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,510
that you can't be in love with him.

719
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,750


720
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,030
You can say that.

721
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,230


722
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,060
You're a man.

723
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,300


724
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:20,810
What should you do next?

725
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,070


726
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,280
Yuxuan, listen.

727
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,550


728
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,740
You must give birth when you're pregnant.

729
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,870


730
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,650
You're not married yet, are you?

731
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,710


732
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,820
Let me finish.

733
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,950


734
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,130
You have to think about it quickly.

735
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,390


736
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,270
The child needs to register.

737
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,510


738
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,170
No, Dad, you really misunderstood.

739
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,270


740
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,360
I'm not pregnant.

741
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,470


742
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,720
I'm still in my period today.

743
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,950


744
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,080
Why did you buy this?

745
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,390


746
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,230
Because I had a stomachache today.

747
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,430


748
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,750
And he went to buy medicine for me.

749
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,910


750
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,490
But he bought the wrong one. It was a mistake.

751
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,590


752
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,320
I misunderstood you?

753
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,630


754
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:47,510
No.

755
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,870


756
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,000
You have a stomachache.

757
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,220


758
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,690
Then why did he buy medicine for you?

759
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,830


760
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,370
Why did you hide him

761
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,590


762
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,320
secretly?

763
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,590


764
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,710
He also says he likes you.

765
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,940


766
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,670
Aren't you two dating?

767
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,140


768
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,450
Yes, Dad.

769
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,590


770
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,430
He is my boyfriend.

771
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,790


772
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:14,370
You...

773
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,470


774
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,240
You just told me.

775
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,550


776
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,810
You said you wouldn't date behind my back.

777
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,030


778
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,390
You said you were dating. You should tell me.

779
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,630


780
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,580
You won't hide it from me.

781
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,870


782
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,830
It's said that a married daughter won't come bake home.

783
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,060


784
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,160
My daughter is on other's side

785
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,350


786
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,320
before she gets married.

787
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,550


788
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:35,610
Dad.

789
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,670


790
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,450
Don't be sad.

791
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,550


792
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,600
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

793
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,820


794
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,400
It's because

795
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,630


796
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,000
you had a bad impression of him.

797
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,230


798
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,730
I thought of telling you

799
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:44,780


800
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,740
after he comes here to please you.

801
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,990


802
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,490
You are my dad.

803
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,630


804
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,400
You are my closest person

805
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,550


806
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,300
in this world.

807
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,550


808
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,460
How could I be on his side?

809
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,750


810
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,680
Right?

811
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,980


812
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,220
Uncle.

813
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,630


814
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,720
I'm sorry for letting you know our relationship

815
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,950


816
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,680
in this way.

817
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,780


818
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,380
But don't worry.

819
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,510


820
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,580
I'm sincere to Yuxuan.

821
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,790


822
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,280
Besides, I treat her not only as my girlfriend,

823
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,550


824
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,470
but also my fiancée.

825
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,510


826
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,180
Tell me the truth.

827
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,510


828
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,670
Are you pregnant?

829
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,670


830
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,580
I'm really not, Dad.

831
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,710


832
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,530
You really like him?

833
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,670


834
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,740
Since you love each other,

835
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,820


836
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,490
I'm not a villain who broke up a couple.

837
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,670


838
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,910
But you have to promise me one thing.

839
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,950


840
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,170
Mr. Xun, go ahead.

841
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,390


842
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,370
I've raised her up.

843
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,470


844
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,780
You have to be good to her.

845
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,910


846
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,030
You have to love her and take care of her.

847
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,310


848
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,080
Don't bully her.

849
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,310


850
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,130
I don't care about your family background.

851
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,390


852
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,080
If you dare to bully her, I'll risk my life

853
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,150


854
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,280
to fight with you.

855
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,470


856
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,950
Mr. Xun, don't worry.

857
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,020


858
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,750
I'll only let her bully me.

859
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,870


860
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,380
That's more like it.

861
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,590


862
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,080
Mr. Xun, if there's nothing else,

863
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,190


864
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,270
If it's okay, I'll go first.

865
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,470


866
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,730
Stop!

867
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,990


868
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,280
Dad!

869
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,420


870
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,200
You said it's okay.

871
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,430


872
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,080
We're family.

873
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,350


874
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,880
Don't mention it.

875
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,150


876
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,600
Let's have a meal.

877
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,900


878
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,250
Wait a moment,

879
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,590


880
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,670
is the fish steamed or braised?

881
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,030


882
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,540
Morning, Mrs. Lin.

883
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,670


884
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,920
It was an accident.

885
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,190


886
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,890
It was just an accident.

887
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,110


888
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,250
It's nothing.

889
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,550


890
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,190
I'm not afraid.

891
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,630


892
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,200
Come in.

893
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,430


894
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,330
What are you doing here?

895
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,630


896
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,700
Don't you have work to do?

897
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,950


898
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,890
I'm here to work.

899
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,190


900
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,770
I need you to confirm some photos.

901
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,020


902
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:00,930
Put them here.

903
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,110


904
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,610
I've seen the photos. They're all available.

905
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,780


906
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,520
Mrs. Lin, are you avoiding me?

907
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,950


908
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,620
Why should I?

909
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,900


910
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,310
That's good.

911
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,470


912
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,720
I thought you were afraid of me.

913
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,910


914
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,800
I'm afraid of you?

915
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,870


916
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,640
Get back to work.

917
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,070


918
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,270
Wait.

919
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,590


920
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,360
What? Anything else, Mrs. Lin?

921
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,740


922
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,550
I'm warning you.

923
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,780


924
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,230
Don't tell anyone anything.

925
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,270


926
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,990
Which thing?

927
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,270


928
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,910
Is it about Mrs. Lin's breakup

929
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,110


930
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,060
or is it about Mrs. Lin being drunk and telling stories?

931
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,070


932
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,950
Or is it about the fact that you can't sing well?

933
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,190


934
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,010
Or is it the fact that you bit me and I bit you?

935
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,180


936
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,620
Nothing can be said.

937
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,830


938
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,930
Okay, my CEO.

939
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,110


940
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,060
What should I do?

941
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,310


942
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,330
Yuxuan, you don't have to see me off.

943
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,550


944
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,040
Both of you are busy.

945
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,110


946
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,310
You finally have a day off.

947
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,550


948
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,820
The driver is also tired.

949
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,260


950
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,580
You don't have to see me off.

951
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,550


952
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,770
I'll take a bus and go back.

953
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,030


954
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,760
Mr. Xun, I've arranged a car for you.

955
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,910


956
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,300
Just get in the car.

957
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,550


958
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,610
We're family.

959
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,670


960
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,510
Dad.

961
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:11,790


962
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,910
It's hard for you to take the bus

963
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,110


964
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,660
with so much things.

965
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,780


966
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,380
Okay.

967
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,470


968
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,980
Don't forget your dad

969
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,180


970
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,650
after you fall in love.

971
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,790


972
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,110
Dad, how could I forget you?

973
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,390


974
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,140
You can stay with me more.

975
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,270


976
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,450
If I stay here too long,

977
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,710


978
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,520
how can you date?

979
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,790


980
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,190
I knows this.

981
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,470


982
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,060
Take care of yourself.

983
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,350


984
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,750
And you.

985
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,110


986
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,190
Take care of her.

987
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,550


988
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,860
Mr. Xun, don't worry.

989
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,140


990
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,720
Alright, you don't have to see me off. Go back.

991
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,830


992
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,580
Thank you, sir.

993
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,910


994
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,260


995
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,000
Dad.

996
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,420
Call me when you go home.

997
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,750


998
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,190
I will call you.

999
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,550


1000
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:01,670
Go back now.

1001
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,030


1002
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,530
Goodbye, uncle.

1003
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,870


1004
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,880
Honey, our daughter has grown up.

1005
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,150


1006
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,080
She has a good boyfriend.

1007
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,470


1008
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,110
Don't worry.

1009
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,550


1010
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:56,830
Seriously.

1011
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,270


1012
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,350
I'm infected by him.

1013
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,510


1014
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,580
Am I also OCD?

1015
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,990


1016
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,670
Are you talking about me?

1017
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,070


1018
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,160
Why are you walking so quietly?

1019
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,430


1020
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,480
Like a ghost.

1021
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,830


1022
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,130
I think you are guilty.

1023
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,430


1024
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,190
I'm not.

1025
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,350


1026
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,910


1027
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:28,630
No.

1028
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,190


1029
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,090
What if Uncle Du sees us?

1030
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,420
Uncle Du is off work.

1031
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,740


1032
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,200
All I want now is just you .

1033
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,350


1034
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,780


1035
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,680
Fine.

1036
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,650
You're right.

1037
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,830


1038
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,510


1039
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,100
I'm guilty.

1040
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,230


1041
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,990
There's a pervert.

1042
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,320
Yuxuan.

1043
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,630


1044
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,700
Do you know

1045
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,950


1046
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,480
how much I missed you

1047
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,710


1048
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,000
during these time you are not with me.

1049
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,270


1050
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,110
I miss you so much.

1051
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,350


1052
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,990
Good morning, Mr. Gu.

Contact all departments.

1060
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,920
We must find a suitable replacement.

1061
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,030


1062
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,580
Okay, Mrs. Lin. We'll contact right away.

1064

Man, what's wrong?

1068
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,540
Don't mention it.

1070
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,100

1080
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,530
But he suddenly told us that he went abroad.

1081
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,710


1082
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,150
He'll be back after a month.

1084
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,980

You are out of town?

1097
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,630


1098
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:31,900
Fine.

1099
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,150


1100
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,210
It's okay.

1101
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,350


1102
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,880
Let's have dinner together when you're back.

1103
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,140


1104
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,740
Okay, bye.

1105
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,990


1106
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,820
Is it bad luck?

1107
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,110


1108
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,200
Why am I so unlucky?

1109
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,430


1110
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,050
Come in.

1111
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,430


1112
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:55,750
Mrs. Lin.

1113
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,870


1114
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,330
It's you.

1115
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,550


1116
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,750
I don't have time for other work.

1117
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,950


1118
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,690
Come back later.

1119
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,950


1120
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,280
I'm not here to talk about other work.

1121
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,550


1122
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,510
I contacted someone for you.

1123
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,790


1124
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,410
He told us to get ready.

1125
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,550


1126
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,190
We can take photos when he comes.

1127
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,390


1128
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,450
Who can you contact?

1129
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,710


1130
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,010
It's none of your business.

1131
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,110


1132
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,990
He's a big shot anyway.

1133
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,220


1134
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:12,950
You'll know when he comes.

1135
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,270


1136
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,360
I don't need to introduce him to you.

1137
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,700


1138
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,850
Is he a big shot?

1139
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,110


1140
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,010
Mr. Gu never gave interviews.

1141
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,390


1142
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,620
Why are you today...

1143
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,710


1144
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,280
Are you familiar with each other?

1145
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,620


1146
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,500
Mr. Gu.

1147
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,870


1148
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,640
No, brother-in-law.

1149
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,980


1150
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,620
We can't expose our relationship.

1151
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,990


1152
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,790
That way, the boss will think I'm capable.

1153
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,110


1154
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,560
Otherwise, she'll think I'm taking the back door.

1155
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,990


1156
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:07,770
No problem.

1157
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,190


1158
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,230


1159
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,110
We're quite close.

1160
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,780
Shao Jie recommended.

1161
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,909


1162
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,020
Mr. Gu refused my invitation.

1163
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,310


1164
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,290
A mere photographer

1165
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,429


1166
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,929
made Mr. Gu give up his principles.

1167
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,219


1168
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,219
Does Mr. Gu

1169
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,469


1170
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,310
have other hobbies?

1171
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,620


1172
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,250
He's quite talented.

1173
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,510


1174
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,199
Besides, we are friends.

1175
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,469


1176
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,570
Yes, friends.

1177
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:34,949


1178
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,340
By the way,

1179
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:36,790


1180
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,639
Mr. Gu took a long way to come here.

1181
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,909


1182
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:40,670
Let's not waste time.

1183
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:40,790


1184
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,400
Let's get started.

1185
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,630


1186
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,949
Since you know each other so well,

1187
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,030


1188
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,500
you can do it.

1189
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,710


1190
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,730
Me?

1191
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,030


1192
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:48,580
Really?

1193
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,750


1194
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:50,560
Do you really believe in my ability?

1195
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,699


1196
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,659
Even Mr. Gu admires you,

1197
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,989


1198
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,880
you've helped the company a lot today.

1199
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,100


1200
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,400
I should give you this chance.

1201
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,710


1202
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,430
No problem. I'll complete the task.

1203
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,710


1204
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,130
Mr. Gu, please.

1205
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,470


1206
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,400
Three, two, one.

1207
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,790


1208
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,030
OK?

1209
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,110


1210
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,050
Yes.

1211
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,070


1212
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,170
Not bad. You are handsome.

1213
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,350


1214
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,960
I didn't expect that,

1215
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,110


1216
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,600
but his ability surprised me.

1217
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,910


1218
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,210
Mr. Gu, I'm done.

1219
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,580


1220
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,270
Thank you.

1221
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,580


1222
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:49,880
Thank you.

1223
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,150


1224
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,400
Mrs. Lin, I'm done.

1225
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,790


1226
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,530
You can interview Mr. Gu now.

1227
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,950


1228
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,120
Mr. Gu, please follow me.

1229
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,310


1230
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,070
Breaking news.

1231
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,350


1232
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,950


1233
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,730
The CEO of Gu's Group can't carve.

1234
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,480
He covered up the secret for five years.

1235
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,630


1236
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,600
Why are you looking at me like that?

1237
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,670


1238
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,340
[Breaking news that the CEO of Gu Group can't carve]

1239
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,340
[Cover up the secret for up to five years]

1240
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,040
This isn't me.

1241
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,310


1242
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,530
I saw Gu Yancheng's diagnosis

1243
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,580


1244
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,550


1245
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,280
from my aunt.

1246
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,840
It clearly states that he can't carve anymore.

1247
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:41,030


1248
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,900
Say something.

1249
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,150


1250
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,250
Let go of me!

1251
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,310


1252
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,080
Who is that?

1253
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,270


1254
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:48,070
He seems to be a reporter and wants to interview me.

1255
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,150


1256
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:48,780
Lunatic.

1257
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,950


1258
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,240
Reporter.

1259
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:49,750


1260
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,810
Mrs. Lin, you did say that.

1261
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,140


1262
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,440
Impossible.

1263
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,630


1264
00:36:59,070 --> 00:36:59,740
When?

1265
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,030


1266
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,780
Mr. Gu,

1267
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,150


1268
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,490
I'm sure Mrs. Lin didn't mean to do it.

1269
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,670


1270
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,690
She is so sad that day

1271
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,910


1272
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,540
after dinner with you.

1273
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,580


1274
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,370
So we went to a bar and had a drink and complained.

1275
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,710


1276
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,580
But we ran into a reporter.

1277
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,910


1278
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,890
Maybe he heard the conversation between us.

1279
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,230


1280
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,930
He even followed Mrs. Lin.

1281
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,310


1282
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,100
I drove him away.

1283
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,510


1284
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,970
Mrs. Lin didn't mean to do it.

1285
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,390


1286
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,120
It's true.

1287
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,510


1288
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,470


1289
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,170
I told you everything.

1290
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,780
Gu Yancheng.

1291
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,950


1292
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:43,580
I'm sorry.

1293
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,830


1294
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,210
I really didn't know this would happen.

1295
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,540


1296
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,890
I promised you.

1297
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,070


1298
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,700
It's okay. For now,

1299
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,990


1300
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,390


1301
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:53,990
it's just a rumor.

1302
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:57,820
By the way,

1303
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,230


1304
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,170
did your magazine have social media?

1305
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,620


1306
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:02,600
Yes.

1307
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,110


1308
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,080
Since I'm here for an interview,

1309
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,270


1310
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,030
why don't me give a response?

1311
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,430


1312
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,840
My Mr. Gu.

1313
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,060


1314
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,250
Huixin bought this too.

1315
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,540


1316
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,450
Huixin.

1317
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,590


1318
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,070
Why didn't you tell me

1319
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,230


1320
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,310
that you bought something good?

1321
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,510


1322
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,300
Are you afraid I'll ask you for it?

1323
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,670


1324
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,240
I got it for free. I'm waiting to return it.

1325
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,540


1326
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,630


1327
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,420
Someone gave it to you?

1328
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,410
That man?

1329
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,590


1330
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,550
That playboy

1331
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,630


1332
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,800
around Gu Yancheng.

1333
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,070


1334
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,560
He said this is company welfare and given it to me.

1335
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,030


1336
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,170
Ridiculous.

1337
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,470


1338
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,700
That's shouldn't be company welfare.

1339
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,910


1340
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,480
Gu Yancheng gave me the same one a few days ago.

1341
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,870


1342
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,250
They should have bought it together.

1343
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,580


1344
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,950
These men are good at saving time.

1345
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,220


1346
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,150
It seems that

1347
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,310


1348
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,690
Shao Jie has feelings for you?

1349
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,670


1350
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:14,570
Impossible.

1351
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,670


1352
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,900
There's nothing between us.

1353
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,110


1354
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,010
I was just saying.

1355
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,190


1356
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,060
Why are you so excited?

1357
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,230


1358
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,770
It's as if you really have something.

1359
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,030


1360
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:22,960
No.

1361
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,270


1362
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,420
I just don't want to be contacted together

1363
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,550


1364
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,400
with this playboy.

1365
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,590


1366
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,030
Don't mention that boring person.

1367
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,150


1368
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,870
Get to work.

1369
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,110


1370
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,900
Huixin, I've been working all day.

1371
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,070


1372
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,040
Can I take a break?

1373
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,260


1374
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,760
Well done. Keep working.

1375
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,950


1376
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,180
Love you, kiss you.

1377
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,350


1378
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,520
According to our reporter,

1379
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,790


1380
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,760
Gu Yancheng, CEO of Gu Group,

1381
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,870


1382
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,830
can't pick up the carving again.

1383
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,110


1384
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,720
The reason is

1385
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,790


1386
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,730
he had a car accident five years ago.

1387
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,900


1388
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,130
This is too much.

1389
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,310


1390
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,340
How can they

1391
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,350


1392
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,480
simply expose others' privacy?

1393
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,830


1394
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,830
Really?

1395
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,950


1396
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,540
No.

1397
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:08,790


1398
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,700
He's recovered.

1399
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,950


1400
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,030
What are you doing?

1401
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,110


1402
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,690
No, I have something to do. I have to go.

1403
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,100


1404
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,210
You can just up and go.

1405
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,670


1406
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,500
Fairy, why are you here?

1407
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,830


1408
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,180
I saw the news.

1409
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,470


1410
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,130
How could it be exposed?

1411
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,430


1412
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,050
Where is Gu Yancheng?

1413
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,350


1414
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,180
He didn't answer my call.

1415
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,430


1416
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,930
He went out for something at noon.

1417
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,270


1418
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,040
I sent him the news.

1419
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,430


1420
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:37,680
He only replied me three words.

1421
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,950


1422
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,100
I'll take it.

1423
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,470


1424
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,580
So, since the boss has given the order,

1425
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,790


1426
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,510
don't worry.

1427
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,910


1428
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,440
Okay.

1429
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,950


1430
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,280
I'll go back now.

1431
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,550


1432
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:02,820
Mr. Gu,

1433
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,180


1434
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,420
there's news reported that

1435
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,590


1436
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,070
you've been hiding five years

1437
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,150


1438
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,420
that you can't carve.

1439
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,700


1440
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,760
Can you

1441
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:08,990


1442
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,720
respond it?

1443
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,990


1444
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,880
You're back.

1445
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,070


1446
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,890
Why are you sleeping here?

1447
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,270


1448
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,620
I was waiting for you.

1449
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,830


1450
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,300
I fell asleep while waiting.

1451
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,510


1452
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,660
I saw the news just now.

1453
