00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,900
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,710
Lord Chieftain.

4
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,400
After Lord Ge Shan's suspension,

5
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,840
the Three Central Offices have
deliberated and decided

6
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,710
to nominate Her Highness Ning

7
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,930
to take charge of the Ministry
of Government Supervision.

8
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,690
Advisors, thank you

9
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,010
for your trust and support of Ning.

10
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,600
However, she is still young

11
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,280
and may not be up to
this great responsibility.

12
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,650
Lord Chieftain, there's no need
for such modesty.

13
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,580
As the next Chieftain,

14
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,070
this is a perfect opportunity
for Her Highness Ning

15
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,500
to gain valuable experience

16
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,500
and prepare herself thoroughly
for the future.

17
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,120
Advisor Xiao Ping, you speak wisely.

18
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,620
It's just that while Ning

19
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,450
has indeed been studying governance
diligently,

20
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,340
she still lacks real-world experience.

21
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,250
She is easily

22
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,110
influenced by various opinions.

23
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,700
Moreover, the affairs of the Ministry
of Government Supervision are complex.

24
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,300
A single mishap could jeopardize
everything.

25
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,680
I do want Ning to gain experience,

26
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,690
but not at the expense of

27
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,160
Zichuan's proper functioning.

28
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,630
That would be too high a price.

29
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,980
Indeed. Our clan's Chieftain now

30
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,710
seems to turn a deaf ear

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,860
to the suggestions from
the Three Central Offices.

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,490
Yang Minghua held power for years

33
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,940
and consistently showed little respect

34
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,130
for the advisors of
the Three Central Offices.

35
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,520
Now that the clan has regained authority,

36
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,020
we will surely respect the opinions
of all you advisors.

37
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,610
My Lord, the responsibility of
the Three Central Offices

38
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,540
is to offer suggestions to the clan

39
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,980
and supervise the Chieftain's conduct,

40
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,680
not to interfere in governance.

41
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,070
Commander-in-Chief Luo, your words
are rather harsh.

42
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,260
Advisor Xiao Ping didn't mean it that way.

43
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,740
Lord Chieftain,

44
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,220
you should understand what I mean.

45
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,010
After all, everything
the Three Central Offices does

46
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,600
is for the clan

47
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,360
and for all of Zichuan!

48
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,360
Chieftain, on this point, I believe

49
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,280
you should understand better
than Yang Minghua, right?

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,030
Of course, of course.

51
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,210
Lord Chieftain,

52
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,720
I believe that Lord Ge Shan's duties

53
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,610
are indeed vast and complicated.

54
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,500
Her suspension will cause
considerable disruption

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,480
to the work of various departments.

56
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,190
I have a suggestion

57
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,150
that might satisfy everyone.

58
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,040
I wonder if Lord Chieftain
and Advisor Xiao Ping

59
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,890
would be willing to hear me out?

60
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,980
Please, Advisor Ma Wei,
feel free to speak.

61
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,760
Her Highness Ning lacks experience,

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,690
while Lord Ge Shan currently
lacks popular support.

63
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,510
However, if they work together,

64
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,220
it could resolve the current
awkward situation.

65
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,150
Thus, I propose

66
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,000
Princess Ning serve as the Commander
of the Ministry of Government Supervision,

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,730
while Lord Ge Shan is demoted
to Deputy Commander

68
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,800
to assist Her Highness in her work.

69
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,320
What do you all think?

70
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,270
Very well.

71
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,360
Let it... be arranged as such.

72
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,030
How utterly greedy!

73
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,960
Those advisors are not only grasping
for power

74
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,630
but also extending their reach
to official appointments!

75
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,900
Shameless!

76
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,290
There are reasons

77
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,950
they nominated Ning.

78
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,120
First, Ning is young

79
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,420
and has no experience in court affairs,

80
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,570
so she can't outsmart them

81
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,650
and can be easily manipulated.

82
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,240
Secondly,

83
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,950
if any problems like this
arise in the future,

84
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,930
they can let the clan heir, Ning,
be the one to take the fall,

85
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,680
while they step back at any time.

86
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,000
Xiao Ping has already taken control

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,490
of the entire Three Central Offices.

88
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,080
His ambition has long been evident!

89
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,800
Just now, in front of everyone,

90
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,430
he dared to threaten you, My Lord!

91
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,390
If not controlled,

92
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,290
the future consequences will be
unimaginable!

93
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,090
My Lord, we can't continue to
endure this! My Lord!

94
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,850
Please, have a seat.

95
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,720
This is not unexpected.

96
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,360
Ge Shan has always

97
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,720
upheld strict discipline and followed
the rules faithfully.

98
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,850
This time, to prevent military action
against Liufeng,

99
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,720
she inadvertently exposed many of
the Three Central Offices' sore spots.

100
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,380
They've long seen her as a thorn
in their side.

101
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,680
This matter

102
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,190
simply gave them the perfect excuse

103
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,930
to remove her.

104
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,530
To appease the public,

105
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,420
Ge Shan had to be punished.

106
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,420
And though Her Highness Ning

107
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,160
has been diligently studying governance,

108
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,890
she still lacks experience.

109
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,800
Things are already set in motion.

110
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,730
We have no other choice.

111
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,990
Ma Wei... he's quite a quick thinker.

112
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,060
Seeing you studying so intently,

113
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,120
I didn't dare to interrupt you.

114
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,390
Uncle, you're here.

115
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,750
I was just reading these books.

116
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,830
Some of them are quite obscure.

117
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,830
I was so focused on reading

118
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,760
that I didn't notice you coming in.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,870
Reading books

120
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,670
can help you understand the principles,

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,530
but when you encounter
real-world problems,

122
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,920
you still need to experience them
personally

123
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,120
to truly understand.

124
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,120
Now, for you,

125
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,780
there's a great opportunity.

126
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,890
What opportunity?

127
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
The Three Central Offices and I
have decided

128
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,420
to let you take the position

129
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,510
of Commander of the Ministry
of Government Supervision.

130
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,720
Me, as the Commander?

131
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,160
But I don't have any

132
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,750
practical experience,

133
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,960
and the Ministry of Government Supervision

134
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,390
is such an important department.

135
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm afraid I'm not competent.

136
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,080
The Three Central Offices recommended you.

137
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,539
Their original intention

138
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,930
was to dismiss Ge Shan.

139
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,200
After my mediation,

140
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,240
they finally decided to demote Ge Shan

141
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,350
and have her assist with your work.

142
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,130
They have always wanted to
take this opportunity

143
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,260
to remove officials who stand
in the way of their agenda.

144
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,470
Now, at this critical moment,

145
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,750
they've chosen to recommend you

146
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,900
because if you can't shoulder
this responsibility...

147
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,340
you'll be playing right into their hands.

148
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,550
Do you understand?

149
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,020
I understand, Uncle.

150
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,270
If I do the job well,

151
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,990
they have nothing to say

152
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,190
and nothing to gain.

153
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,680
I represent the Zichuan family

154
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
and absolutely cannot be constrained
by them.

155
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,350
Uncle, rest assured.

156
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,680
I will study diligently

157
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,030
and do a good job at the Ministry
of Government Supervision.

158
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,820
Good.

159
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,150
Take a break.

160
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,790
I thought that after you got married,

161
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,320
you wouldn't come to see me
so easily anymore.

162
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,530
How is Si Yilin?

163
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,360
Still recovering.

164
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,030
I heard

165
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,290
you're taking office at the Ministry
of Government Supervision tomorrow,

166
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,620
so, of course, I had to come see you.

167
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,020
I'm just gritting my teeth
and going for it.

168
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,910
I can't bring shame to the family, right?

169
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,030
After learning so much,

170
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,690
isn't this what it was all for?

171
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,450
Actually, it's all been theoretical
until now.

172
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,520
Now that I'm really stepping into
the role,

173
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,730
I'm feeling quite nervous and afraid.

174
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,960
Overcoming fear is also
a necessary lesson.

175
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,440
It seems...

176
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,190
I'll need to take this lesson
for a long time.

177
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,030
Take it slow.

178
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,930
Why don't you stay for the night?

179
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,160
Keep me company and chat with me.

180
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,630
Alright.

181
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,540
Quick, after him! Don't let him get away!

182
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,880
Keep running, huh?

183
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,930
Who's there?

184
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,940
Sir?

185
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,420
Sir?

186
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,930
Don't panic.

187
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,190
They've already run away.

188
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,210
You seem different from other people
of the Dragon Race.

189
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,070
Did they harm you because of this?

190
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,750
The dragon horns only grow

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
on those of our Dragon Race

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,660
who have a special bloodline.

193
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,310
Because there are only a few of us,

194
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,780
we're called nobility.

195
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,530
Those Snake Race people last night

196
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,530
were actually dragon horn traders.

197
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,510
Thank you for saving me.

198
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,120
My name is Lai Duo.

199
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,600
If there's a chance in the future,

200
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,770
I'll definitely repay you double.

201
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,600
No need to wait for the future.

202
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,860
You can help me with something right now.

203
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,800
Do you know what the words

204
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,790
on this paper mean?

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,430
I'm not sure what exactly

206
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,050
this sentence means either.

207
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,320
Young lady, don't be discouraged.

208
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,550
Why don't you come with me
to the banquet in Jialai?

209
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,880
I'll ask one of our Dragon Race elders
for you.

210
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,320
He is very knowledgeable.

211
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,590
Maybe he knows.

212
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,240
Banquet?

213
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
I'm going to attend a banquet

214
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,500
at the invitation of the Governor of
Jialai District

215
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,960
and the King of Light.

216
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,150
Very well.

217
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,550
Then I'll be responsible for
escorting you to Jialai.

218
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,870
Alright, let's go together.

219
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,600
Come on, everyone.

220
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,000
Please taste the water in this cup.

221
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,600
-Come on.
-Come on.

222
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,680
Sweet.

223
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,670
This spring water is surprisingly sweet.

224
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,510
Jialai used to lack water too.

225
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,360
Now we've learned the technique
of sourcing and channeling water.

226
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,760
We found underground rivers and dug wells.

227
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,440
Now we can be self-sufficient.

228
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,580
Everyone, being able to learn
this technique

229
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,510
is truly a great blessing.

230
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,380
I've gathered everyone here,

231
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,180
hoping to take this opportunity

232
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,160
to promote the water sourcing
and channeling technique.

233
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,810
So that all our people of Yuanzhou

234
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,540
can have access to clean water.

235
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,630
-Good!
-Good!

236
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,840
Come on.

237
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,720
Come on.

238
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,670
Thank you for your generosity,
Governor of Jialai District,

239
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,000
and for bringing prosperity to Yuanzhou!

240
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,080
The one you should really thank is
the King of Light.

241
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,500
He is the one who has truly
saved Yuanzhou.

242
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,920
Thank you, King of Light! Long live
the King of Light!

243
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,750
Cheers, cheers.

244
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,440
Cheers, cheers.

245
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,640
Come on, have a drink.

246
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,390
We have water to drink now.

247
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,270
That's right.

248
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,080
Miss Lin Yu, we're late.

249
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,890
The banquet has already started.

250
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,290
I think we should sit down
over there first.

251
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,960
I'll take you to find him later.

252
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,690
Come on, drink, keep drinking!

253
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,030
Come, come, come on.

254
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,240
I think I just saw

255
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,720
a very familiar figure.

256
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,130
Why did you take off your mask?

257
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:47,910
I...

258
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,870
Well...

259
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,600
Zhang Asan.

260
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,160
Miss Lin Yu, how did you get here?

261
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,350
On my way to Yuanzhou,

262
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,040
I saved Lai Duo, the envoy
of the Dragon Race,

263
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,300
and escorted him here.

264
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,180
And why are you here?

265
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,870
I'm a minor general under
the King of Light.

266
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,000
You are a minor general under...

267
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,460
My Lord.

268
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,640
I forgot to introduce you.

269
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,250
This is Lord Baichuan.

270
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,210
A trusted and capable general
under the King of Light.

271
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,430
May I ask

272
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,080
where the King of Light is?

273
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,740
Would it be possible for you
to introduce me?

274
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,560
Yeah, where is the King of Light?

275
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,930
You want to see the King of Light?

276
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,450
Yes, all along the way,

277
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,180
I've heard many stories about him.

278
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,580
I really want to meet him.

279
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,470
What a coincidence. Just perfect timing.

280
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,430
I happen to be going to deliver
something to him.

281
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,520
Come with me.

282
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,670
Please wait here for a moment.

283
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,670
I'll go and inform the King of Light.

284
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,440
Okay.

285
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,670
Boom, got any?

286
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,420
Beat you!

287
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,310
What about you?

288
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,510
Pass, pass, pass.

289
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,700
Chief, weren't you going to
attend the banquet?

290
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,890
Put this on now.

291
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,130
Wear it, hurry up.

292
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,650
There's a woman. He calls himself
Zhang Asan

293
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,180
and has a very sleazy smile.

294
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,150
Just like yours.

295
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,720
I, Lin Yu, pay my respects to
the King of Light.

296
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,230
Please be seated.

297
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,670
Please.

298
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,720
Zhang Asan,

299
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,320
pour tea for Miss Lin Yu.

300
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,450
King of Light!

301
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,599
Earlier, you said

302
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,920
you wanted the most beautiful dancer
in the city

303
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,780
to come perform

304
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,510
as a reward for all the soldiers,

305
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,910
even at your own expense.

306
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,490
This matter should be handled
by Zhang Asan.

307
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Well...

308
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:19,790
My Lord,

309
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,859
all the delegates from various districts

310
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:22,819
are in the city.

311
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,980
You have many matters to attend to.

312
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:30,320
I'm afraid... it might not be appropriate
to indulge in entertainment now.

313
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,640
I never thought

314
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,280
Zhang Asan, who loves performances
more than anyone else,

315
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,280
would now be so considerate
of the bigger picture.

316
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,480
King of Light!

317
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,540
I think Zhang Asan is absolutely right.

318
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,970
I agree.

319
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,070
I have a suggestion

320
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,590
that we should do something practical
for our Alliance Army.

321
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,890
Raise their military pay

322
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,290
across the board

323
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,790
as an incentive.

324
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,270
This is an excellent suggestion.

325
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,160
I have decided

326
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,610
that this additional military pay
will come from my own pocket.

327
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,570
No, no, no.

328
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,740
My Lord, military finances

329
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,670
follow strict rules and regulations.

330
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,470
If you insist on doing this,

331
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,250
wouldn't that break the rules?

332
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,350
King of Light, you're truly bold
and generous.

333
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,440
This way,

334
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,650
military morale will be even more boosted,

335
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,640
and you'll be invincible.

336
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,960
Zhang Asan,

337
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,270
hurry and write an announcement to post.

338
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,020
Zhang Asan.

339
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,420
How could you hold back the King of Light?

340
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,790
My Lord, the King of Light,

341
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,330
is brave and mighty, caring for
his subordinates.

342
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,330
As for me, I am proud

343
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,400
and honored to serve under him.

344
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,400
Beautiful Miss Lin Yu,

345
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,180
may I ask

346
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,350
how you came to know our Zhang Asan?

347
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,150
Well, that's quite a long story.

348
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,940
My Lord, Miss Lin Yu has
important matters to report.

349
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,270
Why don't we hear what she has to
say first?

350
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,350
Yes.

351
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,140
This time, from Yuanzhou,

352
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,230
I saw Snake Race merchants hunting
Dragon Race nobles.

353
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,000
Their methods were extremely cruel,

354
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,750
all for obtaining dragon horns.

355
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,440
It was by chance

356
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,840
that I saved Envoy Lai Duo

357
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,020
and escorted him all the way here.

358
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,240
Through him, I learned

359
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,340
that for years, the Snake Race has been

360
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,730
kidnapping and enslaving
ordinary Dragon Race people

361
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,360
to force them to reveal
where their nobles are hiding,

362
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,030
then selling those nobles
to the North Clan

363
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,090
for profit.

364
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,440
I always knew that the Snake Race
and the Dragon Race were at odds,

365
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,200
but I never imagined

366
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,400
there was this kind of scheme behind it.

367
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,080
They are all from Yuanzhou.

368
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,010
Yet, they harm their own people!

369
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,610
Such cruelty is outrageous!

370
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,830
King of Light,

371
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,940
we must step in to stop this, right?

372
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,440
Right?

373
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,880
Well said.

374
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,400
Jialai is a crucial junction
connecting all districts.

375
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,550
Before submitting to us,

376
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,410
it was an important trading port.

377
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,760
Now in Jialai,

378
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,590
there should still be many
trapped Dragon Race nobles.

379
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,370
That's true.

380
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,090
Lai Duo heard with his own ears

381
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,750
that the purpose of their group

382
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,950
was to come to Jialai.

383
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,350
However, since it coincides with
the King of Light's grand banquet,

384
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,000
Jialai's patrols are particularly strict.

385
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,930
They cannot easily enter the city.

386
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,480
King of Light, I implore you to
act on behalf of the Dragon Race people

387
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,280
and send someone to rescue them.

388
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,320
Very well.

389
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,210
Then, I'll entrust this matter
to Zhang Asan.

390
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,970
I will not betray your trust.

391
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,990
Your Highness.

392
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,620
Lord Ge Shan.

393
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,510
This is the policy document
regarding the appeasement of refugees.

394
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,510
Please review it.

395
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,040
If there are no issues, please sign it.

396
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,200
Let me finish the work at hand first,

397
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,660
then I'll look at it immediately.

398
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,530
Work needs to be prioritized.

399
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,640
This concerns when the families

400
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,000
of injured soldiers among the refugees

401
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,930
will receive their compensation.

402
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,850
It must be addressed urgently.

403
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,170
After signing,

404
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,780
it still needs to be reviewed
by Lord Luo Minghai.

405
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,540
Okay.

406
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,310
Lord Chieftain! Lord Chieftain.

407
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,160
Advisor Xiao.

408
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,490
Lord Chieftain,

409
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,100
do you know

410
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,920
that I had to take a side path

411
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,650
and sneak in through the back door
just to see you?

412
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,580
We, the esteemed advisors of
the Three Central Offices,

413
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,180
have become like rats scurrying across
the street today.

414
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,890
The relief plan for the refugees

415
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,730
hasn't been issued yet, has it?

416
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,880
From policy release to implementation

417
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,160
takes some time.

418
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,830
Advisor Xiao, you're part of
the process too.

419
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,500
You shouldn't have been asking this,
right?

420
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,060
Some policies

421
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,260
need to be implemented with priority.

422
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,340
Instead of arguing with me,

423
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,170
why don't you rush back to your
Ministry of War

424
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,650
and sign the papers

425
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,710
to appease the people?

426
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,280
This is the real way to share the burden
of the Lord Chieftain.

427
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,040
Lord Chieftain, since you're well,

428
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,490
I'm at ease.

429
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,060
I take my leave.

430
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,520
What's going on?

431
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,750
Did Ning fail to submit the file on time?

432
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,580
I've already given orders

433
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,840
that as soon as the Ministry of
Government Supervision submits the file,

434
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,640
my Ministry of War will sign it
immediately. However...

435
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,440
However what?

436
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,170
I've been waiting all morning,

437
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,270
and I haven't received any files.

438
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,750
Then go and hurry them up.

439
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,320
Yes, sir.

440
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,810
Your Highness,

441
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,280
why haven't you reviewed and submitted
the compensation document?

442
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,330
I don't think this is the best solution.

443
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,760
Besides the refugees,

444
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,480
many citizens of the Imperial Capital
are also causing trouble.

445
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,640
Many families of the Palace Guards

446
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,970
have also been incited.

447
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,600
The families of deceased soldiers
need compensation,

448
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,690
and injured soldiers and civilians

449
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,420
also need money for treatment.

450
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,000
Shouldn't we try to find

451
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,310
a middle ground?

452
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,900
In the current situation,

453
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,790
we have to establish clear priorities.

454
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,590
There's no room for compromise.

455
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,700
If the compensation isn't released
promptly,

456
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,380
it will only trigger more conflicts.

457
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,940
And each of these conflicts

458
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,300
will be seen as our failure.

459
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,640
If we distribute the compensation first,

460
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,880
we won't have enough funds
for the injured soldiers'

461
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,410
and civilians' treatment.

462
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,200
Compared to the dead,

463
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,830
shouldn't we prioritize saving those

464
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,960
who are still alive?

465
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,470
Your Highness,

466
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,130
this is a math problem.

467
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,550
Do you know how many caregivers are needed

468
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,350
to care for one injured soldier?

469
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,720
At least one or two,

470
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,960
and they need to be by their side
at all times.

471
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,720
This means that these caregivers

472
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,920
cannot leave to join

473
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,580
the refugee protest marches.

474
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,540
So, the most vocal protesters
out there now

475
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,820
are the families of the deceased soldiers.

476
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,190
Every fallen soldier

477
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,650
leaves behind a family.

478
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,200
Men, women, old, and young are
all out there.

479
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,190
Even if the Palace Guards
are incredibly capable,

480
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,320
they can only hold them off for so long.

481
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,310
Your Highness, what you say isn't wrong,

482
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,470
but what we can solve first is
the immediate problem,

483
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,530
not the root cause.

484
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,020
I understand.

485
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,230
I'll sign it right away.

486
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,950
I'll personally deliver it to Lord Luo.

487
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,720
Your Highness,

488
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,990
please understand my decision.

489
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,550
I do.

490
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,530
This is the duty of the Ministry
of Government Supervision.

491
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,270
I'm just feeling a bit sad.

492
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,090
I've seen... those soldiers
lying injured...

493
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,930
but I can't do anything for them.

494
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,900
The road ahead is still long.

495
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,510
My Lord.

496
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,310
The people of the Imperial Capital
have spontaneously gathered,

497
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,200
and the scale is even greater
than the previous times.

498
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,860
They are heading toward here.

499
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,680
Didn't the Ministry
of Government Supervision submit the file

500
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,410
to the Ministry of War already?

501
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,000
Why is there still a gathering?

502
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,390
They're actually heading here.

503
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,480
This matter cannot be taken lightly.

504
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,890
Deploy Di Lin here.

505
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,890
Yes, My Lord.

506
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,370
Di Lin. Let me go with you.

507
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,180
What are you doing here?

508
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,050
Go back and rest.

509
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,370
I know you too well.

510
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,510
I know what you're going to do.

511
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,240
I know what you're going to say.

512
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,960
Di Lin!

513
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,710
Those people are not our enemies.

514
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,240
Many of them are military families.

515
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,510
The compensation plan has already
been issued,

516
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,790
yet those people are getting more
and more out of control,

517
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,050
disrupting Zichuan's normal life.

518
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,350
Even if they are military families,

519
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,310
I must make an example of some
to deter the others.

520
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,200
Then why are they doing this?

521
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,110
Those people

522
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,440
or their family members

523
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,260
once fought for this country.

524
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,730
But their lives now are worse

525
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,660
than they were on the battlefield.

526
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,130
Is it wrong to speak up for themselves?

527
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,470
Does speaking up warrant

528
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,670
killing some of them to warn the others?

529
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,070
Alright.

530
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,430
I'll listen to you this time.

531
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,880
Pass down the order:

532
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,070
calm the public...

533
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,350
and do not harm them.

534
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,640
Yes, sir.

535
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,000
My Lord,

536
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,640
the current situation cannot be resolved

537
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,430
by Di Lin's suppression alone.

538
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,050
The refugees need more than money—

539
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,930
they need emotional comfort.

540
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,030
I have already made promises

541
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,880
in the council hall before.

542
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,310
So right now,

543
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,810
you are not the best person to go out
and face them.

544
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,310
Stop right there!

545
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,890
My Lord.

546
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,610
I still feel this is quite inappropriate.

547
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,630
Those people

548
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,960
include refugees from Yuanzhou,

549
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,480
retired veterans,

550
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,060
families of the wounded,

551
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,800
and citizens who've been incited.

552
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,200
There are bound to be desperate criminals
among them.

553
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,550
If any accident occurs...

554
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,350
My Lord.

555
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,210
I will accompany Her Highness

556
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,950
and do my utmost to ensure
Her Highness's safety.

557
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,380
Moreover, Di Lin and Lord Si Yilin
are here.

558
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,750
They won't allow anything to happen
to Her Highness.

559
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,030
You're right.

560
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,190
Suppressing unrest

561
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,050
can't stabilize the people.

562
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,400
Only if our clan shows sincerity.

563
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,720
I've decided

564
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,510
I will personally go and comfort them.

565
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,160
Uncle.

566
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,880
My Lord, you absolutely must not!

567
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,270
Why not?

568
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,270
If someone is secretly instigating them

569
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,200
and the refugees don't back down
despite your presence,

570
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,800
our clan will have no way out.

571
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,000
But if Her Highness steps forward,

572
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,560
even if the refugees are incited,

573
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,710
you, My Lord, can still step in
to turn the tide!

574
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,430
Uncle.

575
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,160
I have been the heir to Zichuan

576
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,310
for many years now.

577
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
I'm ashamed to say

578
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,000
that in all these years,

579
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,510
I haven't made any contributions
to the clan.

580
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,590
But my work at the Ministry
of Government Supervision

581
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,750
has made me realize

582
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,110
that the reason I've been able to

583
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,640
live a carefree life, day and night,

584
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,110
is all due to the diligence
of the officials in our clan.

585
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,070
It's time for me

586
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,630
to do what I can now.

587
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,960
If I don't step up at this moment,

588
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,530
then I'm not worthy of being
the heir of Zichuan,

589
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,790
nor do I deserve to bear the Zichuan name.

590
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,570
I, Zichuan Ning, request your permission,
Lord Chieftain,

591
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,900
to pacify the people and quell the unrest.

592
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,930
This is my failing.

593
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,050
I thought I could protect you

594
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,640
and keep you from being troubled

595
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,750
by anything before you took office.

596
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,300
I'm useless!

597
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,360
Uncle.

598
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,870
Uncle.

599
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,420
This is my duty.

600
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,150
Ning... get up.

601
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,370
Ma Wei.

602
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,030
My Lord.

603
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,370
I'm entrusting Ning to you.

604
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,080
Lord Chieftain,

605
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,390
I, Ma Wei, will never let Her Highness

606
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,250
suffer the slightest grievance.

607
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,810
W-Wait a moment.

608
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,450
I know you must be very nervous.

609
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,650
But you don't need to be afraid.

610
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,580
I've got you.

611
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,310
Your Highness.

612
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,350
I suppose what you're worried about
the most

613
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,810
is not knowing what to say.

614
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,270
I've written it all down. Take a look.

615
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,070
Just memorize it.

616
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,000
With this note,

617
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,680
I feel much more confident.

618
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,830
Thank you.

619
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,880
How could I let you face

620
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,210
such a situation completely unprepared?

621
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,040
Let's go.

622
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,470
Let them see

623
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,340
the grace and poise of
Princess Zichuan Ning.

624
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,790
-Come out!
-Come out!

625
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,830
-Come out!
-Come out!

626
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,830
-Come out!
-Come out!

627
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,530
Chieftain, you owe us an explanation!

628
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,440
Yes, give us an explanation!

629
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,400
Give us an explanation!

630
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,830
We want to see the Chieftain!

631
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,640
-Let the Chieftain come out!
-Let the Chieftain come out!

632
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,920
-We want to see the Chieftain!
-We want to see the Chieftain!

633
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,020
-Let the Chieftain come out!
-Let the Chieftain come out!

634
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,550
Everyone, please be quiet!

635
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,890
The heir of the Zichuan family,

636
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,180
Princess Zichuan Ning has something
to say to everyone!

637
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,110
The Lord Chieftain is just a coward,

638
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,000
hiding behind this little girl
to fob us off!

639
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,720
-That's right!
-That's right!

640
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,310
-That's right!
-That's right!

641
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,000
Everyone, please calm down!

642
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,450
I understand how you feel,

643
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,310
but...

644
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,830
Get off! We want to see the Chieftain!

645
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,300
Let the Chieftain give us an explanation!

646
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,620
-Get off!
-Get off!

647
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,440
My Lord, I fear Her Highness Ning
may not be able to...

648
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,240
Not now.

649
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,240
We need to show the people the sincerity
of our clan.

650
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,820
Otherwise, we won't be able to
appease them.

651
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,450
I'm afraid that Ning might not be
able to handle this.

652
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,810
But this is something she must experience.

653
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,070
It's just that this day

654
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,220
might have come a bit too early.

655
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,760
I am the heir to the Zichuan family.

656
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,720
We don't want you! We want to see
the Chieftain!

657
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,680
-Get off!
-Get off!

658
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,570
-Get off!
-Get off!

659
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,890
We can't back down.

660
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,160
-Get off!
-Get off!

661
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,060
-Come out!
-Come out now!

662
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,970
Why did you just jump down from the tree?

663
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:08,840
If I hadn't done that,

664
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,640
how would I have known how much pain
you're in?

665
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,710
The best way to empathize

666
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,470
is to try it yourself.

667
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,030
Right, Ning,

668
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,280
now that I'm in pain alongside you,

669
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,800
don't you feel better now?

670
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,720
Xiu, you're an idiot.

671
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,030
Now you've also twisted your foot.

672
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,630
Who's going to carry me home?

673
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,000
How about this?

674
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,200
You've injured your left foot,

675
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,660
and I've twisted my right.

676
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,240
Let's lean on each other,

677
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,440
being each other's crutch. How's that?

678
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,100
I know.

679
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,790
You just didn't want to carry me,

680
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,990
so you deliberately twisted your foot.

681
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,570
-Come out!
-Let the Chieftain out!

682
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,930
We want to see the Chieftain!
Let him come out!

683
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,590
-Get off!
-Get off!

684
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,910
-Get off!
-Get off!

685
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,550
-We want to see the Chieftain!
-We want to see the Chieftain!

686
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,000
-Get off!
-Get off!

687
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,480
-Get off!
-Get off!

688
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,710
-Get off!
-Get off!

689
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,400
All of you, step back.

690
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,030
Step back!

691
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,280
People of Zichuan.

692
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,840
Among you are soldiers,

693
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,170
relatives of soldiers,

694
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,410
and craftsmen who helped rebuild Wayun.

695
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,420
I know.

696
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,780
Many of you have lost friends
and loved ones

697
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,030
who gave their lives to build

698
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,460
and protect Zichuan.

699
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,080
As a result, you are left hungry

700
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,150
and homeless.

701
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,050
I deeply understand your feelings...

702
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,330
and feel deeply ashamed.

703
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,760
This is a failure of our Zichuan family.

704
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,360
We failed to protect you.

705
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,220
Here, please allow me,

706
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,510
as the future heir to the Zichuan family,

707
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,150
to apologize to all of you
on behalf of the clan!

708
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,810
I'm sorry.

709
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,900
But please believe

710
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,290
that when Yuanzhou was lost
and your homes were taken

711
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,350
and you are heartbroken with grief,

712
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,410
the Chieftain and I

713
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,870
feel the same piercing pain.

714
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,150
Because we are all one.

715
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:59,270
We share the same glory and suffer
the same losses.

716
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,940
However, Zichuan doesn't just

717
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,410
have Yuanzhou.

718
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,950
To keep the people of Zichuan away
from the ravages of war

719
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,310
and to allow our clan to recuperate...

720
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,290
we had no choice but to give up Yuanzhou,

721
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,210
making you suffer.

722
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,770
The clan is now going through

723
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,030
its most difficult

724
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,490
and darkest moments, as you are.

725
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,070
But please believe

726
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,470
that this darkness and pain

727
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,760
is temporary.

728
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,150
Lord Chieftain has already
promised you all,

729
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,490
and I hereby promise you again

730
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,000
that I will do everything within my power

731
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,480
to compensate all of you.

732
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,920
I will also do my best

733
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,110
to protect Zichuan.

734
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,790
And never again will I let you

735
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,880
suffer such hardship.

736
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,460
People of the clan,

737
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,240
your enemy has never been
the Zichuan family,

738
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,510
but those who have taken away
our homeland,

739
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,070
the rebels at Chishuitan

740
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,940
who are bent on war,

741
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,110
and the North Clan that besieged us

742
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,940
outside Payi City until our supplies
were drained!

743
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,020
Zichuan must become stronger now.

744
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,940
Only then can we resist foreign clans,
reclaim our lost territory,

745
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:28,270
and everyone can live a peaceful
and stable life.

746
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,900
We need to make those foreign clans
see clearly

747
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,300
that our Zichuan is not so easy
to mess with!

748
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,190
So what we need to do now

749
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,880
is to unite as one and fight against
the enemy with all our might!

750
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,920
-Yes, that's right!
-Yes, that's right!

751
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,150
Unite as one and fight against
the enemy with all our might!

752
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,510
Yes.

753
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,330
Unite as one and fight against
the enemy with all our might!

754
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,060
Unite as one and fight against
the enemy with all our might!

755
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,820
Unite as one and fight against
the enemy with all our might!

756
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,360
Unite as one and fight against
the enemy with all our might!

757
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,320
Unite as one and fight against
the enemy with all our might!

758
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,230
I didn't expect Ning to single-handedly

759
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,190
pacify them.

760
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,960
Ning has grown up.

761
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,230
What could comfort people more

762
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,960
than a kind-hearted little girl?

763
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,860
But her approach was indeed clever,

764
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,320
redirecting their anger
toward the North Clan.

765
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,150
It seems we need to look

766
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,580
at Ning differently now.

767
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,440
Unite as one and fight against
the enemy with all our might!

768
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,030
Unite as one and fight against
the enemy with all our might!

769
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,760
Unite as one and fight against
the enemy with all our might!

770
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,610
-Unite as one and fight!
-Everyone!

771
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,600
On behalf of the Palace Guards,
I assure you all

772
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,510
that we will certainly cooperate with
Princess Ning

773
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,130
to properly settle all of you.

774
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:40,330
Moreover, I will allocate a portion
of the military funds

775
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,960
to help you

776
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,700
overcome the difficulties together!

777
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,450
Everyone!

778
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,440
My Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs
will also contribute part of

779
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,470
our budget to weather this storm
alongside the clan

780
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,420
and overcome difficulties together!

781
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,440
-Long live Zichuan!
-Long live Zichuan!

782
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,280
-Long live Zichuan!
-Long live Zichuan!

783
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,740
Ning, you've really grown up.

784
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,140
I underestimated you.

785
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,350
All those worries of mine

786
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,480
were completely...

787
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,440
completely unnecessary.

788
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,150
Now, our Princess Ning

789
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,880
can stand on her own.

790
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,030
I am very happy.

791
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,110
Thanks to Uncle's constant guidance

792
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,570
and Lord Ma Wei's support.

793
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,290
Di Lin and Si Yilin

794
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,780
also stepped forward to announce
budget cuts,

795
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,230
sharing the burden with the clan.

796
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,430
This finally pacified those refugees.

797
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,210
It's just that while Princess Ning was
comforting the people,

798
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,810
Di Lin and Si Yilin's actions

799
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,440
somewhat overshadowed her efforts.

800
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,820
As long as it truly serves the people

801
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,200
and solves problems for our clan,

802
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,590
the method doesn't matter.

803
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,790
Right, right, right.

804
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,040
Uncle,

805
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,870
if there's nothing else,

806
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,230
I'll take my leave now.

807
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,970
The Ministry of Government Supervision
still has a lot of work to do.

808
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,090
Okay, okay.

809
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,630
Then, I shall take my leave as well.

810
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,110
Okay.

811
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,170
Flowers? Flowers?

812
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,250
I'll take all of these.

813
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,400
Thank you.

814
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,010
Your Highness, these are for you.

815
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:30,930
Congratulations

816
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,400
on overcoming yourself
in front of everyone

817
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,660
and proving yourself.

818
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,760
Thank you.

819
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,630
I also feel

820
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,130
that something within me has changed.

821
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,830
My Lord, as per your instructions,

822
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,870
the refugees have been settled.

823
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,280
However, Wayun still needs to be repaired.

824
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,960
This is the budget I obtained

825
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,790
from the Ministry
of Government Supervision

826
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,960
and the allocation records from that time.

827
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,550
There's a huge discrepancy.

828
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,480
I suspect

829
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,230
that there must be corruption.

830
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,100
But you can't

831
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,250
find anything in the accounts, right?

832
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,390
It's because all the key personnel
are dead.

833
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,790
We can't trace anything.

834
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,540
I originally wanted to bring this matter
to light

835
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,250
and force the real culprits to come out

836
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,380
to solve the issue of Wayun's repairs.

837
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,960
But those old foxes
at the Three Central Offices

838
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,670
turned it right back on us,

839
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,310
pushing the problem back.

840
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,360
It seems I've underestimated
the complexity of the situation.

841
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,510
My Lord, what should we do now?

842
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,690
Form an alliance.

843
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,810
I, Luo Minghai, never indulge in alcohol,

844
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,900
and I certainly won't drink with you.

845
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,540
I know.

846
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,580
But I have a favor to ask of you.

847
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,900
This is proper etiquette.

848
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,880
You think I would agree to help you,
the Executioner on the Battlefield,

849
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,490
who kills without mercy?

850
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,730
Now that corruption is rampant these days

851
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,260
and the refugee issue
has caused quite a stir,

852
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,740
not everyone dares to investigate
the Three Central Offices.

853
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,230
If I join forces with
the Three Central Offices,

854
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,030
won't you be asking for trouble?

855
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:32,930
Lord Luo.

856
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:37,680
I believe that, as the Commander-in-Chief
of the Ministry of War,

857
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,320
you absolutely wouldn't do such a thing.

858
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,600
If this case succeeds,

859
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:45,440
your ministry will take the credit
and enjoy the rewards effortlessly.

860
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,540
Although we have old grudges,

861
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,580
we also understand each other
very well, right?

862
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,880
So, you should know that I, Di Lin,

863
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,360
never seek credit for myself.

864
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,390
As long as we uncover who's behind this,

865
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,410
all the credit

866
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,580
will be yours, Lord Luo.

867
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,330
If it fails,

868
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,440
and we offend
the Three Central Offices,

869
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,880
then my ministry will be in trouble.

870
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,030
If it fails,

871
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,480
my Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs
will bear all the consequences.

872
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,590
Alright. I agree to collaborate with you.

873
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:15,540
But

874
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,870
all the evidence you've found

875
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,100
must be shared with my ministry.

876
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:22,340
No problem.

877
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:28,410
I knew you cared deeply about Zichuan

878
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,360
and would never stand by idly.

879
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,150
I won't take your wine.

880
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,570
Let's keep it here for now.

881
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,840
I believe that one day,

882
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,250
you'll drink with me willingly.
