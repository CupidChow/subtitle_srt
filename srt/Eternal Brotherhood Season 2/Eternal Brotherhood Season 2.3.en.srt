[Episode 3]

3
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,300
In the next ten years, we can strengthen
our internal governance,

4
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,100
cease external warfare, and endure
hardships to make ourselves stronger.

5
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,960
Zichuan will soon grow powerful.

6
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,710
And you, My Lord, are still in your prime.

7
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,150
So why worry so much?

8
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,160
Moreover...

9
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,060
Moreover, Princess Ning

10
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,430
will surely witness our time
of prosperity and splendor.

11
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,070
Time... patience...

12
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,930
Oh, ancestors...

13
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,760
I am not a competent chieftain.

14
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,000
Yang Minghua has rebelled.

15
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,720
Lei Hong has rebelled.

16
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,250
Yuanzhou has rebelled.

17
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,820
And the North Clan invaded.

18
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,750
So many territories have been lost.

19
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,060
Zichuan has come to this state...

20
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,810
It's... it's my fault.

21
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,840
I absolutely cannot let the Zichuan family

22
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,860
fall at my hands.

23
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,260
And I can't let Ning

24
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,260
be left with nothing when she inherits.

25
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,730
My Lord.

26
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,740
Di Lin, you're right.

27
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,540
What does it matter if I bear
eternal infamy?

28
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,590
Compared to the survival of our family,

29
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,180
the honor or disgrace of either of us...

30
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,630
is insignificant.

31
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,940
Like a phoenix reborn from ashes,
rising through fire.

32
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,210
Let's do... as you said.

33
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,160
Yes, My Lord.

34
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,520
I can't die.

35
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,290
My Yuanzhou.

36
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,030
My Yuanzhou.

37
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,500
My Yuanzhou.

38
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,970
My Yuanzhou.

39
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,710
My Yuanzhou.

40
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,170
Yuanzhou.

41
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,860
Yuanzhou.

42
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,660
Yuanzhou.

43
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,710
My Yuanzhou.

44
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,780
My Yuanzhou!

45
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,000
Yuanzhou City is gone!

46
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,130
Yuanzhou is gone.

47
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,030
My Yuanzhou City is no more.

48
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,770
Everything happened so suddenly,
and I rushed here too hastily.

49
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,830
Please forgive me.

50
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,630
It's alright.

51
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,870
Let's go.

52
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,090
Wait.

53
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,200
Princess of the North Clan,

54
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,260
do you treat my residence as nothing?

55
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,440
Coming and going as you please?

56
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,100
I won't allow it.

57
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,830
Your Highness, we must consider
the bigger picture.

58
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,620
Ning, I...

59
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,260
If you want to leave...

60
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,510
you must get through my three trials.

61
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,480
I'll wait for you outside.

62
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,300
On the night we first met,

63
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,220
we drank until dawn broke.

64
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,130
Today, we shall also bid farewell
to each other with wine.

65
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,820
Princess Ning usually wants to
eat something after drinking.

66
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,240
Mei, don't forget to prepare it.

67
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,440
When you first arrived in
the Imperial Capital...

68
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,080
you often missed the cuisine
of your homeland.

69
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,700
Today, I've prepared delicacies
from the Imperial Capital for you.

70
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,790
You must eat them

71
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,180
and never forget them for the rest
of your life.

72
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,650
This is delicious, try it.

73
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,440
I carefully picked it.

74
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,070
Of course it's delicious.

75
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,270
This handkerchief is the one you used...

76
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,880
to wipe away wood shavings when you
first entered the residence.

77
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,560
Our friendship...

78
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,640
began with that misunderstanding.

79
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,260
After we part today...

80
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,990
we will be enemies.

81
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,980
Today, I tear this handkerchief
to break our bond.

82
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,040
We are no longer friends.

83
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,630
In my heart...

84
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,050
you'll always be my friend.

85
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,540
One day, the North Clan and Zichuan

86
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,860
will also become friends.

87
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,960
I'll ride ahead to Gray River

88
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,050
to handle important matters.

89
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,380
Be extra careful escorting the Princess.

90
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,210
Di Lin!

91
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,030
[Lin Xiujia]

92
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,800
Xiujia.

93
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,490
Xiujia.

94
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
I came back in such a hurry this time.

95
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,140
I thought you might be angry.

96
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,620
Though you look a bit weathered,
you haven't grown thin.

97
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,990
Looks like you've listened to me.

98
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,520
I thought I wouldn't see you
on this trip back.

99
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,810
Lord Canxing has treated me well.

100
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,450
Knowing that your visit would be brief,

101
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,450
he hurried to send me here to see you.

102
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,800
I won't need to return to
the Chieftain's Mansion after this.

103
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,890
Lord Canxing is indeed thoughtful.

104
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,830
Though I don't know the specifics,

105
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,370
I assume you're taking on
another important mission.

106
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,370
But don't forget what I've told you.

107
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,840
I remember them all.

108
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,090
I will come back alive.

109
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,590
Our child and I will watch you
mount your horse.

110
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,630
Don't look back.

111
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,540
Let him see his father

112
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,890
in all his heroic glory.

113
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,840
Wait for my return.

114
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,180
From this day forth,

115
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,500
cease... all warfare with the North Clan.

116
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,050
I've already dispatched Di Lin to Payi
for peace talks.

117
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,780
We will return Princess Ka Dan

118
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,090
and hand over the jurisdiction
of the 23 districts in Yuanzhou.

119
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,260
We can't do it, My Lord.

120
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,080
We absolutely can't do it.

121
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,170
My mind is made up.

122
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,120
No more discussion.

123
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,260
My Lord.

124
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,510
Yuanzhou is Zichuan's last line
of defense.

125
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,190
One falls, and the other suffers.

126
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,120
If we lose Yuanzhou, Zichuan will
be in grave danger!

127
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,870
If we mobilize our
entire clan's strength...

128
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:39,080
and fight again, we'll lose everything,
not just Yuanzhou.

129
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,940
No need to persuade me further.

130
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,520
My Lord! If we don't fight
with all we have,

131
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,380
how can we face the people of Yuanzhou?

132
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,980
Speak again... after you understand
the war situation.

133
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,170
It's too late.

134
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,579
It's too late.

135
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,210
It's too late.

136
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,890
It's too late.

137
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,270
My Lord!

138
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,960
My Lord!

139
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,260
It's too late.

140
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
Di Lin...

141
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,960
You disgraceful traitor who has yielded
and brought shame upon us.

142
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,720
I ought to kill you with one stroke
of my sword!

143
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:08,970
My Lord,

144
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,490
we've launched dozens of attacks
on the city over the past few days,

145
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,490
and our forces far outnumber theirs.

146
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,120
It's just

147
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,000
that they seem to be bewitched.

148
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,060
Every time they kill,

149
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,270
their eyes turn blood-red.

150
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,470
Don't talk nonsense.

151
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,310
We've been unable to take Payi City
for so long.

152
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,670
The Divine Emperor is watching us
from the rear!

153
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,170
We must take Payi.

154
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,400
Prepare to attack the city
at 3 AM tonight.

155
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,980
No horses, everyone moves stealthily.

156
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,310
No siege ladders,

157
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
bring only ropes.

158
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,480
This time, the goal isn't to
breach the city

159
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,590
but to shatter their spirit.

160
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,130
I want captives.

161
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,510
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

162
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,030
Eat something.

163
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:11,850
I'm good.

164
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,480
Eating at this time makes one drowsy.

165
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,010
This is also the time

166
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,620
when people's willpower is at its weakest.

167
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,530
Our opponents

168
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,100
also prefer to attack the city
at this time.

169
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,460
You should still eat something.

170
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,060
To replenish your strength.

171
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,980
I'll eat half, and you can
have the other half.

172
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:50,820
Ze.

173
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,750
Why don't you tell us another story

174
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,880
about the girls from Chunfeng Garden?

175
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,720
My Lord, the stories about the girls

176
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,540
must be saved and told sparingly.

177
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,420
Come on.

178
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,920
War is the way of deception.

179
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,190
The men are thinking about home now.

180
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,880
Their families... and sweethearts.

181
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,520
Then I don't even need to tell stories.

182
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,560
Just a song,

183
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,040
and it'll cure your lovesickness.

240
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,380
not to fight.

241
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,070
You've got some guts.

242
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,630
No wonder you dared to enter
the enemy camp alone.

243
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,470
What's your name?

244
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,670
Ge Qing, Captain of the Royal Escorts
of the Zichuan family,

245
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,520
requests an audience
with the Divine Emperor.

246
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,720
Please inform His Majesty on my behalf.

247
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,470
During my time in seclusion
and reflection,

248
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,420
I re-read the historical records

249
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,150
as Father instructed and reviewed

250
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,950
all the major and minor battles.

251
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,390
[Ka Dun, Eldest Prince of the North Clan]

252
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,590
Learning from history,

253
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,640
I've reflected on my past mistakes

254
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,490
[Lu Di]

255
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,390
and I've also gained some insights.

256
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,430
Then tell me, what's your view
on the current war situation?

257
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,600
The siege of Payi has dragged on
without success,

258
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,950
preventing us from striking at their core.

259
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,750
However, we can gradually devour Yuanzhou
to expand our territory!

260
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,950
Father, I was just careless at that time.

261
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,410
This time, with renewed determination,

262
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,910
I absolutely won't be arrogant
or impatient.

263
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,630
Please give me another chance, Father.

264
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,230
Then in your opinion,

265
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,640
how long would it take to take down Wayun?

266
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,510
Three months, Your Majesty!

267
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,870
I, Lu Di, am willing to assist
His Highness

268
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,910
in crushing Yuanzhou and seizing Wayun

269
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,190
within three months!

270
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,270
Your Majesty,

271
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,230
the Zichuan family has sent an envoy
for negotiations.

272
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,540
Would Your Majesty like to meet with him?

273
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,340
Zichuan is about to be finished!

274
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,990
Sending a hundred more messengers won't
make a difference.

275
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,450
Why bother reporting, Counsellor?

276
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,470
Just kill him.

277
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,630
You're willing to spend three months
conquering Wayun,

278
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,300
yet you can't spare a moment
to see an envoy?

279
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,220
Black Veil.

280
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,260
For you to personally announce someone,

281
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,350
I assume he's not just
any ordinary person.

282
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,710
Let him in.

283
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,540
How audacious! You are in the presence
of His Majesty the Divine Emperor.

284
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,270
Why do you not kneel in respect?

285
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,100
I am Ge Qing, envoy of Zichuan.

286
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,020
I pay my respects to Your Majesty,
the Divine Emperor.

287
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,100
Ge Qing?

288
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,540
The journey here must have been arduous.

289
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,250
What brings you here?

290
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,230
I have come here

291
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,820
bearing greetings from
the Chieftain of Zichuan

292
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,910
and the wish for peace
between our two sides.

293
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,780
Peace?

294
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,580
Peace is something the weak need.

295
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,230
We, the North Clan, have no need for it.

296
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,390
Your Majesty, throughout
the entire Xichuan Continent,

297
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,150
only your North Clan and
the Zichuan family share a border.

298
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,080
We should have become friendly
neighboring states.

299
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,100
But regrettably,

300
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,990
for the past several hundred years,

301
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,720
we have been constantly at war.

302
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,500
Now, the war has become even more brutal.

303
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,300
With such large-scale warfare,

304
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,310
it's the innocent civilians who suffer.

305
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,100
Not to mention the orphans and widows
left behind.

306
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,870
Your Majesty, as the ruler of your clan,

307
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,120
you should think of your subjects

308
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,870
and all the people under heaven

309
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,260
and end the war between our two states
as soon as possible.

310
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,670
Ge Qing, on your way here,

311
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,580
did you happen to see
our North Clan's army?

312
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,020
I was fortunate enough to see it.

313
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,740
Then...

314
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,890
what do you think?

315
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,230
Your Majesty's great army is magnificent

316
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,390
and imposing—

317
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,890
truly a formidable force.

318
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,200
And compared to your Zichuan family's

319
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,670
army?

320
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,700
Your Majesty's divine might is invincible
under heaven.

321
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,780
In your clan's history,

322
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,470
there were the Golden Khan
and the Divine Emperor Ka Xi.

323
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,600
The military strength they possessed

324
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,190
was probably no less than Your Majesty's
current force, I imagine.

325
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,910
Insolence!

326
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,660
Father, this envoy is arrogant
and conceited.

327
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,170
The Golden Khan
and the Divine Emperor Ka Xi

328
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,990
were both defeated at the gates of Wayun.

329
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,050
He is mocking your divine authority!

330
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,800
Father, please allow me

331
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,710
to kill him here and now.

332
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,710
Where are your manners?

333
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,430
Whether they're the same or not,
there's no point in talking further.

334
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:24,260
Your Zichuan family will see it
in due time.

335
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,510
Your Majesty.

336
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,060
This time, you have mobilized such forces,

337
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,260
bringing the entire clan's military might,

338
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,870
naturally aiming to achieve
something unprecedented.

339
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,910
But Wayun Fortress

340
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:34,990
is one of the strongest fortresses

341
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,850
on the entire Xichuan continent.

342
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,180
Inside, it is garrisoned by

343
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,780
hundreds of thousands of
our Zichuan elite troops.

344
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,710
Even though Your Majesty's great army
is extremely powerful,

345
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,540
I'm afraid it would be difficult
to guarantee victory

346
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,580
in taking Wayun in one fell swoop.

347
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,100
I have a humble suggestion

348
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,150
that can fulfill the desire for peace
on both our sides

349
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,910
and Your Majesty's wish to expand
your territory.

350
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,020
I wonder if Your Majesty
would be interested.

351
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,630
Go ahead.

352
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,740
If Your Majesty would open a path

353
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,670
for the Palace Guards to return home

354
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,670
and thereafter maintain peace
between our two clans,

355
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,219
our Zichuan family

356
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,179
is willing to hand over the jurisdiction
of the 23 districts of Yuanzhou

357
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,110
to Your Majesty.

358
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,620
This way, you won't need to deploy
a single soldier,

359
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,699
and the entire Yuanzhou will become
your new territory.

360
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:21,179
You want to trade the entire Yuanzhou

361
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:24,110
for the Palace Guards' Si Yilin?

362
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,139
Then, I have a question

363
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,540
to ask you.

364
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,429
Please speak, Your Majesty.

365
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:35,100
You're taking what's already mine
and offering it back to me.

366
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:36,960
The whole Yuanzhou

367
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,620
is already in my North Clan's grasp.

368
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:42,270
We've earned it with our blades!

369
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,100
You killed my daughter, Ka Dan,

370
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,600
and sent Di Lin to our clan's territory

371
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,880
to burn, kill, and plunder extensively.

372
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,179
Now you come talking peace?

373
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,410
It was you who destroyed the peace first!

374
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,750
You want me to let the
Palace Guards return? Okay.

375
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,030
Trade Wayun for it!

376
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,430
I...

377
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,740
Father is right.

378
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,900
Your Majesty's divine might
is unparalleled!

379
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,430
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

380
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,960
In addition to Yuanzhou...

381
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,820
I have prepared another gift
for Your Majesty.

382
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,920
I hope you are doing well, Father.

383
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,700
I miss you so much

384
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,790
and long day and night to return.

385
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,020
The Zichuan family promises

386
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,430
that as long as Father
withdraws the troops

387
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,870
and allows the Palace Guards
to return safely,

388
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,860
I will be able to come back to you soon.

389
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,940
If not,

390
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,340
I'm afraid I may never be able to return
to our homeland

391
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,630
and see Father again.

392
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,660
What tricks is your Zichuan family
trying to pull now?

393
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,620
Surrender to our North Clan immediately.

394
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,250
This is your only way out!

395
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,000
All of you, get out.

396
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,960
What card does the Zichuan family...

397
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,700
still hold in their hands?

398
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,100
Could it be...

399
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,140
Did you see it with your own eyes...

400
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,540
Did she really die?

401
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,310
You are the most outstanding figure

402
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,580
I've seen from the Zichuan family
in the past decade.

403
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,020
I'm impressed, Di Lin.

404
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,660
You dare to lie to my face

405
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,100
and remain so calm and composed.

406
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,790
You might be the first one to do so.

407
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,910
Lei Hong, whom you hate to the bone,

408
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,180
is now on my side.

409
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,030
I'm afraid it's meaningless

410
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,310
for you to continue holding out like this.

411
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,910
Your Majesty is indeed wise.

412
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,100
I am indeed Di Lin.

413
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,690
But a bastard like Lei Hong,

414
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,820
he's not even worth mentioning.

415
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,350
You should know

416
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,190
that I'm not the kind of person

417
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,220
who spares envoys out of principle.

418
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,690
You've killed so many

419
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,250
of our North Clan soldiers.

420
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,920
How do you still dare to come here?

421
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,760
Since I've dared to come here,

422
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,790
I've prepared myself for death.

423
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,640
Whether you want to kill or torture me,

424
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,180
just say the word.

425
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,720
But I forgot to remind Your Majesty

426
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,330
that Princess Ka Dan

427
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,100
is still in our hands.

428
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,140
If I don't return within a day,

429
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,740
our men will kill her.

430
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,200
It's easy for Your Majesty to kill me,

431
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,040
but it won't be that easy

432
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,490
if you want Ka Dan to live.

433
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,470
You're threatening me!

434
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,660
Your Majesty, forgive my frankness,

435
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,310
if I were trying to threaten you,

436
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,430
I could have used Ka Dan as leverage

437
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,180
the moment I walked in,

438
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,040
forcing Your Majesty to retreat.

439
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,220
But I didn't do that.

440
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,430
Because I know

441
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,850
that even if we temporarily
get the Palace Guards back,

442
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,100
once Princess Ka Dan returns to your side,

443
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,700
we will have no more leverage

444
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,810
against your clan.

445
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,580
Now, our Zichuan family

446
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,620
has shown enough sincerity

447
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,390
in exchange for both clans
to rest and recover.

448
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,310
I believe

449
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,740
with Your Majesty's unparalleled wisdom,

450
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,990
you will surely make the right choice.

451
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,310
This is also why I dared to
come here alone.

452
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,430
Well, that's some fine flattery.

453
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,750
Then I'll fall for your trick this once.

454
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,080
I'll release the Palace Guards' Si Yilin,

455
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,140
and you'll return Ka Dan to me.

456
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,150
We'll make the exchange on the banks
of the Gray River.

457
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,930
As for the formal peace treaty,

458
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,360
let Yun Qianxue sign it.

459
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,190
Your Majesty's wisdom is a blessing
to both clans.

460
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:22,220
I'll go back and arrange for
the withdrawal of troops.

461
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,480
I'll take my leave now.

462
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,140
Di Lin!

463
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:31,590
If you ever grow tired of
the Zichuan family,

464
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,910
our North Clan will always welcome you.

465
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,470
I appreciate Your Majesty's favor,

466
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,390
but I, Di Lin, still have
some sense of shame.

467
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,250
If you want me to betray my family,

468
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,650
that would be truly difficult to achieve.

469
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,350
Farewell.

470
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,590
Your Majesty still let Di Lin leave.

471
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,500
Did you look into his eyes?

472
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,560
In his eyes,

473
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:46,160
I saw burning ambition.

474
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,310
The Zichuan family has such
a talented person.

475
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,690
And yet, my own son

476
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,170
is willing to start a war

477
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,190
by turning against his own sibling.

478
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,990
Ka Dun is decisive but lacks strategy.

479
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,570
Ka Lan is strategic but indecisive.

480
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,270
Neither of them is fit for
important responsibilities.

481
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,750
Now... they even dare to act
behind my back.

482
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,570
Once the situation at Payi is settled,

483
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,370
I must discipline them properly.

484
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,530
The two princes still need

485
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,860
time to grow.

486
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:21,630
Black Veil!

487
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,530
I don't have much time left.

488
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,620
We border the Eastern Wilderness,

489
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,430
and now we survive only by luck.

490
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,280
Once they cross over that wall,

491
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,170
our North Clan will have no chance.

492
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,480
Our only way

493
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,100
is to conquer the entire Xichuan Continent

494
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,310
during my lifetime, and only then can we

495
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,040
ensure peace for future generations
of our clan.

496
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,390
A mere Payi has resulted in

497
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:54,590
a lose-lose situation between me
and the Zichuan family.

498
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,710
Taking the Imperial Capital...

499
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,280
is an even more distant
and unrealistic dream.

500
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,950
Your Majesty has high ambitions.

501
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,460
There's no need to dwell on the gain
or loss of individual cities.

502
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,790
Your agreement to Di Lin's deal this time—

503
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,020
gaining Yuanzhou's 23 districts

504
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,350
without losing a single soldier—

505
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,660
is wise.

506
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:23,090
The 23 districts of Yuanzhou...

507
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,470
Only sounds good.

508
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,750
Over the past few decades, hasn't

509
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,700
the Zichuan family only nominally

510
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,660
controlled the land?

511
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,060
Now it seems they control it,

512
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:43,220
but they can't truly unify it.

513
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:46,270
The Zichuan family deludes themselves
into thinking they can unify Yuanzhou.

514
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,470
But we, the North Clan, are not the same.

515
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,020
Your Majesty, you are far superior

516
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,750
to that old fellow Zichuan Canxing.

517
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,140
Your Majesty's lifespan matches heaven's,

518
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,830
and conquering Xichuan is only
a matter of time.

519
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,660
Black Veil, you’ve done so much.

520
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,980
I will dedicate my entire life

521
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,870
to assisting you in Your Majesty's
western conquest.
