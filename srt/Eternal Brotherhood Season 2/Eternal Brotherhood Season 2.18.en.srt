[Eternal Brotherhood 2]

2
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,840
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,430
Look, My Lord.

4
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,070
No matter how many tricks
the King of Light has,

5
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,330
he's ultimately just an arrogant child.

6
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,280
How could his tactics compare to
your brilliant strategies, My Lord?

7
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,210
My Lord, the granary is just ahead.

8
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,720
Let's get him.

9
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:15,800
My Lord.

10
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,870
How did the King of Light

11
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,070
manage to put the granary underground?

12
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,430
I must say, the King of Light
really knows how to pick a spot.

13
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,120
This place is deserted and very secluded.

14
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,560
It's indeed an excellent location
for storing grain.

15
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,840
He wouldn't have figured out
I'd find this place

16
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,900
even if I borrowed him another brain.

17
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,579
It's sand?

18
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,750
The King of Light?

19
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,070
I heard that Lord Lu Di

20
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,030
wanted to borrow my brain.

21
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,079
Coward!

22
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,750
Come out and fight me!

23
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,410
If you have the guts,
come in and fight me!

24
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,360
I wouldn't dare to fight you head-on.

25
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,890
Then what's the point of
keeping me locked up?

26
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,150
So, you dug wells and springs

27
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,800
not to irrigate the fields,

28
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,410
but to dig sewers to flood me.

29
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,370
Lord Lu Di is indeed incredibly clever.

30
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,120
I truly admire you.

31
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,120
Why don't you take a bath first?

32
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,750
We can have a long talk afterward.
Goodbye.

33
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,840
Wait, come back!

34
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,630
The King of Light,

35
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,160
I'll never rest
until I've settled the score!

36
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,270
Find the exit! Quickly find the exit!

37
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,070
Lord Lu Di,

38
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,000
the water resources
in Yuanzhou are scarce.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,830
Especially when marching in the field,

40
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,310
one might go several days without a bath.

41
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,290
I wonder if Lord Lu Di

42
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,100
feels the same way I do.

43
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,750
The King of Light!

44
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,830
You think you're so clever?

45
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,830
I was careless this time.

46
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,830
But if I were just a little more careful,

47
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,550
you wouldn't be a match for me at all.

48
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,800
Lord Lu Di,

49
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,270
get up.

50
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,960
You may go.

51
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,000
What are you up to?

52
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,270
I, the King of Light,
may not have much else,

53
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,670
but I have plenty of time.

54
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,750
Since Lord Lu Di, you're not convinced,

55
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,160
let's choose another day to fight again.

56
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,600
We'll fight until you admit defeat.

57
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,400
But I can't fight for free.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,430
You'll have to pay me for my troops.

59
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,770
This feather

60
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,050
can count as interest.

61
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,480
The next time we meet,

62
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,230
we'll settle everything.

63
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,400
Fine, you've let me off
the hook this time.

64
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,330
Next time, when I destroy your army

65
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,260
and reclaim the North Clan's territory,

66
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,310
I'll also spare your life.

67
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,120
Well said.

68
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,800
Just for that courage of yours,

69
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,130
if I meet you again

70
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,540
and catch you alive,

71
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,040
I'll also spare your life.

72
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,060
Run quickly!

73
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,390
My Lord, why did you give
the enemy a second chance?

74
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,720
Because Lu Di is a person

75
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,550
with a stubborn character
and unyielding spirit.

76
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,710
Chief, is that your fetish?

77
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,750
We, the Yuanzhou Alliance Army,

78
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,150
need a strong opponent

79
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,560
as a training partner.

80
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,550
Lu Di, as a training partner,

81
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,360
is really one in a million.

82
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,720
How could I not like him?

83
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,190
Alright, withdraw the troops
and return to camp.

84
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,730
My Lord, these are the key figures

85
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,160
mentioned in the letter.

86
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,150
Also, as per your instructions,

87
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,720
I've brought some refugees and craftsmen

88
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,580
and settled them at
the posthouse outside the city.

89
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,500
Let's go see our witnesses.

90
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,470
Once I leave,

91
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,630
I don't know if my wife

92
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,270
will be able to manage everything.

93
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,160
You're still worried about
that mess of yours?

94
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,330
You've been going on
about it the whole way.

95
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,300
Do you think the official
can really handle things?

96
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,600
Do you know who the official is?

97
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,120
I don't know.

98
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,290
The Executioner of Yuanzhou.
Never heard of him?

99
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,830
It's actually him?

100
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,620
What are you afraid of?

101
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,480
Of course you soldiers aren't afraid.

102
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,700
To us common folks,

103
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,280
he's like

104
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,950
the Grim Reaper.

105
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,350
Why fear the Grim Reaper?

106
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,720
He's the most ruthless
but also the fairest.

107
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,510
People with wicked hearts

108
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,570
are way scarier than the Grim Reaper.

109
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,940
These are the rioters from Wayun.

110
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,920
Yes, My Lord.

111
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,030
These few

112
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,250
dared to go all the way

113
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,790
to the Imperial Capital

114
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,950
to accuse the officials
of the Three Central Offices.

115
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,560
You...

116
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,930
So you didn't come here to uphold justice.

117
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,640
Instead, you want to exterminate us.

118
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,370
This was a trap all along.

119
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,430
If you give up on
reporting the Three Central Offices

120
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,429
and go back to persuade
other craftsmen and refugees,

121
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,929
I'll let you return alive.

122
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
We never expected

123
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,120
to make it back alive.

124
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,840
You can silence us,

125
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,190
but you can't silence the masses.

126
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,250
Nor can you quell so much anger.

127
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,420
We, as representatives, take the lead.

128
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,870
Our deaths mean nothing.

129
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,400
But there are still so many

130
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,750
wronged folks in Wayun.

131
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,390
They won't take this lying down.

132
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,000
Right.

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,790
The matter of Wayun

134
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,720
won't be brushed over that easily.

135
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,170
Even if we die here,

136
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,840
it will be a worthy death.

137
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,420
Come on, kill us if you dare!

138
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,350
If my wife finds out I'm dead,

139
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,900
she'll be heartbroken.

140
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,370
But she'll also know

141
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,550
I'm protecting her in another way.

142
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,870
Kill us!

143
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:13,920
Come on!

144
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,300
Do it!

145
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:14,930
Come on!

146
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,400
If we really reach the Imperial Capital,

147
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,930
we might face
a life-threatening situation.

148
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,860
Are you still willing to go with me?

149
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,010
For Wayun, I'd face death
a thousand times without regret.

150
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,140
Are you serious?

151
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,020
Since that Captain
came to confer honors last time,

152
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,760
Di Lin has been investigating this matter.

153
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,610
[Xiao Ping from the Three Central Offices]

154
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,490
Any news?

155
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,390
Nothing yet.

156
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,720
Don't worry.

157
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,600
He won't find any evidence.

158
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,340
Maybe

159
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,670
he's now frowning at home.

160
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,980
Advisor Xiao, this is...

161
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,320
Now that it's been cleaned,

162
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,390
it actually doesn't
look as nice as before.

163
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,800
Take it and throw it away for me.

164
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,360
If you have nothing else to do,

165
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,270
you may go back first.

166
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,760
Yes, My Lord.

167
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,260
My Lord, this is the list
of privately recruited soldiers

168
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,140
serving under the Three Central Offices.

169
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,670
Please take a look, My Lord.

170
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,790
Now it nearly exceeds 10,000.

171
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,130
Actually, this matter

172
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,020
is both a blessing and a concern.

173
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,270
My Lord, you needn't worry too much.

174
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,590
As they say, strong soldiers
make a strong nation.

175
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,160
If the soldiers under
the Three Central Offices

176
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,570
are willing to participate in recruitment,

177
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,370
we will have a large source of troops
in the future.

178
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,310
However,

179
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,080
while investigating
the privately recruited soldiers,

180
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,680
I discovered another issue.

181
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,920
Since the construction
of Wayun Fortress began,

182
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,850
progress has been extremely slow.

183
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,070
The refugees who should have been settled

184
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,080
are homeless and unmanaged.

185
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,240
As for the craftsmen,

186
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,510
their treatment is far from satisfactory.

187
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,240
This has led to
a very chaotic situation in Wayun.

188
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,590
The matter of restoring Wayun

189
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,960
has always been handled
by the Three Central Offices.

190
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,050
As this pertains to
the Three Central Offices,

191
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,080
it carries substantial weight

192
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,910
and importance.

193
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,480
Have you investigated it thoroughly?

194
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,210
The situation was too chaotic,

195
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,750
so the evidence I gathered was limited.

196
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,360
But I've brought back many witnesses.

197
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,630
In the current situation,

198
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,030
no matter what happened in between,

199
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,200
the Three Central Offices
need to come forward

200
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,630
and provide a reasonable explanation.

201
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,480
Those folks from the Three Central Offices

202
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,560
sure know how to explain things well.

203
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,400
Now there are countless refugees in Wayun.

204
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,870
Could they resolve this easily

205
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,080
with just a few words?

206
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,340
If they really have such ability,

207
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,300
it would be Zichuan's fortune.

208
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,270
If that's the case,

209
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,750
bring your witnesses

210
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,150
and let's head to
the council hall right now

211
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,750
to confront the Three Central Offices.

212
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,810
Yes, My Lord.

213
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,340
Let's go.

214
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,620
Introduce yourselves

215
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,960
to the lords.

216
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,180
My Lord, my name is Chuan Nan.

217
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,500
I'm an ordinary noodle shop owner
in Wayun.

218
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,400
Five gold coins for your noodles.

219
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,440
You're charging me
five gold coins for a bowl of noodles?

220
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,100
Yes. With meat included,
it's eight gold coins.

221
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,500
What are you doing?

222
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,610
I'm going to smash your shady business!

223
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,270
What shady business?
Who are you calling shady?

224
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,310
How dare you charge
five gold coins for a bowl of noodles?

225
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,540
Let's just calm down.

226
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,600
Let me explain it to you.

227
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,480
These days, for every ten coins we earn,

228
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,150
eight go to taxes.

229
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,340
We're left with just two gold coins

230
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,000
to support the entire family.

231
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,510
Go ask around.

232
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,790
Anyone bold enough
to open a shop under these risks

233
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,000
charges the same.

234
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,980
What risks are you talking about?

235
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,030
They're coming. I'm shutting down.

236
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,150
My Lord, I'm just a small business owner!

237
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,720
I've never done anything illegal!

238
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,570
Please don't arrest me!

239
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,600
Don't arrest me!

240
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,080
We are specialists
in restoration management.

241
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,390
The restoration is no small matter.

242
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,010
It requires a great deal of manpower.

243
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,230
As a citizen of Wayun,

244
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,000
you should do your part.

245
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,470
Take him away!

246
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:53,940
Move!

247
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,510
Please don't arrest me!

248
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,910
Don't arrest me, My Lord!

249
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,240
My Lord!

250
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,720
If I hadn't been so cautious,

251
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,270
they would've arrested me long ago.

252
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,450
Restoration should be something
the people embrace with enthusiasm.

253
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,510
If it's come to the point where they're
forcibly conscripting able-bodied men,

254
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,270
then there's clearly something wrong
with the management.

255
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,240
Go on.

256
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,070
And who are you?

257
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,980
My name is Chang Li.

258
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,910
I'm a craftsman rebuilding Wayun.

259
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,610
I've been working on construction sites
since I was a child.

260
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,140
It's been over 20 years now.

261
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,840
We craftsmen never mind poor food.

262
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,270
It just needs to be enough to fill me up.

263
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,000
But we're here to work hard,

264
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,360
not to risk our lives.

265
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,750
The safety measures are poor.

266
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,390
When people break their bones,

267
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,240
by the time they're slowly
brought to the clinic,

268
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,980
they've often passed out
several times from the pain.

269
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,960
The compensation we're given

270
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,970
isn't even enough to
feed a family for three days.

271
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,370
Isn't this pushing people to their deaths?

272
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,440
My Lord,

273
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,090
you must help us!

274
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,420
Alright.

275
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,030
Step back and stand aside.

276
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,210
What about you two?

277
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,630
Were you also arrested?

278
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,840
In response to My Lord,

279
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,270
I'm Xiang Yu from the 15th Company

280
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,400
of the Yuanzhou Army
stationed in Payi City.

281
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,790
I'm Ding Cheng from the 12th Company

282
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,960
of the Yuanzhou Army
stationed in Payi City.

283
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,280
After the war,

284
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,080
we returned to Wayun.

285
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,970
Because of our previous injuries,
we couldn't do heavy work,

286
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,330
so we became city gate guards.

287
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,890
However, we never expected

288
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,260
that the days after the war

289
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,810
would be so terrifying.

290
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,750
What do you mean by that?

291
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,600
When we were fighting in the war,

292
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,120
at least our salaries
could support our families.

293
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,860
But,

294
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,750
when everything was over,

295
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,250
our families...

296
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,730
That's impossible.

297
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,720
The compensation provided under

298
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,630
the amended Injury and Sickness Act

299
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,320
is more than enough
to support two families.

300
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,380
All we ever got

301
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,680
was 20 gold coins

302
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,870
when we left.

303
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,390
After we came out,

304
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,150
we've been living in refugee camps.

305
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,150
All the refugees

306
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,790
have never received
the appropriate subsidies.

307
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,440
Alright, thank you for your testimony.

308
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,620
You may go now.

309
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,010
Based on the words
of just these few people,

310
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,670
what can really be proven?

311
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,609
What the Advisor said

312
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:21,210
is actually something
I've thought about too.

313
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,099
That's why I had Ge Qing
bring back many witnesses,

314
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,190
including wounded and disabled soldiers.

315
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,400
There are also elderly women whose
husbands and sons have been taken away.

316
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
A few people might be bribed,

317
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,700
but if hundreds or thousands
say the same thing,

318
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,360
are you still going to deny it?

319
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,840
On behalf of the Three Central Offices,
I, Ma Wei,

320
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,930
apologize to

321
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,640
Lord Chieftain

322
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,590
and our fellow colleagues.

323
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,210
What's there to apologize for?

324
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,110
Supervising work in all areas,

325
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,500
patching up any gaps
in the clan's operations,

326
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,240
and safeguarding national prosperity

327
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,430
are the very reasons
for the Three Central Offices' existence.

328
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,280
Now Lord Di Lin insists

329
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,170
that something serious happened in Wayun,

330
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,100
yet we remain completely unaware.

331
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,800
Such a lapse in oversight

332
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,060
is a clear dereliction of duty by us.

333
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,040
We, the Three Central Offices,

334
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,010
should be punished for our incompetence.

335
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,650
My Lord,

336
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,720
please consider the suggestion
of the Three Central Offices

337
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,520
and implement restructuring
to set things right.

338
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,680
Even if there were lapses in oversight

339
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,200
or negligence,

340
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,850
restructuring the Three Central Offices

341
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,280
might be too drastic.

342
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,270
But what if it wasn't
merely poor supervision?

343
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,200
What do you mean?

344
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,550
Previously, Advisor Ma Wei
and Princess Ning

345
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,960
organized a charity gala

346
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,110
to raise funds for restoring Wayun.

347
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,720
They collected a large amount of money.

348
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,850
Now there's an issue with these funds.

349
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,960
Some people can't escape blame.

350
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,400
Explain yourself clearly.

351
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,230
Who exactly are you referring to?

352
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,670
Advisor Ma Wei, Advisor Ma Qin,
who oversees commerce and public welfare,

353
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,900
is your brother, isn't he?

354
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,440
Advisor Xiao Ping, Guan Jiu,
who oversees the military,

355
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,710
is married to

356
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,060
your niece.

357
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,380
Am I correct?

358
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,420
And you!

359
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,510
Your cousin

360
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,920
recently found a new job as an aide

361
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,780
and is doing quite well, isn't he?

362
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,740
Lord Di Lin.

363
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,000
As expected, you really have an iron fist.

364
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,370
It seems

365
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,950
we can't hide anything from you.

366
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,550
Everyone, the charitable funds
are substantial.

367
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,390
And Wayun is very far
from the Imperial Capital.

368
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,880
We've been worried day and night

369
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,790
that someone might have ill intentions

370
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,160
to embezzle funds along the way.

371
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,790
So after discussing it,
we decided to appoint

372
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,390
or discreetly inform trusted individuals

373
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,960
to fully oversee the restoration work.

374
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,550
Here are the account books
for the past three months.

375
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,970
Lord Chieftain, please judge for yourself.

376
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,010
You are

377
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,210
very conscientious.

378
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,750
It's just our duty.

379
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,400
Based on the account books,

380
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,370
post-war recovery in Wayun has been slow.

381
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,510
Amid this gradual revival,

382
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,690
there have been ups and downs,

383
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,300
but it's definitely not as severe

384
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,950
as Lord Di Lin described.

385
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,010
Three Central Offices

386
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,200
have supported the clan for many years,

387
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,720
serving with loyalty and diligence.

388
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,440
Everyone has seen that.

389
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,940
When have we ever harbored ambition?

390
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,440
Now, Lord Di Lin

391
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,160
questions the Three Central Offices
so heavily.

392
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,110
He's clearly

393
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,880
casting doubt on the Three Central Offices

394
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,410
and everything we've done.

395
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,360
Lord Di Lin, why not just say it clearly?

396
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,880
At worst, just replace us
with someone else.

397
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,240
I don't care about the position,

398
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,310
but I must stand up for
the officials who work tirelessly

399
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,480
day and night.

400
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,340
We can't be wronged

401
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,990
for no reason.

402
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,690
Advisor Xiao Ping,

403
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,390
it's actually understandable.

404
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,440
Most of those currently in Wayun

405
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,500
are former Yuanzhou Army members

406
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,830
and their families.

407
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,100
After Zichuan abandoned Yuanzhou,

408
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,700
the Yuanzhou Army's status
was never the same.

409
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,950
If they want to seek some
personal benefits for themselves,

410
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,560
it's not surprising.

411
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,610
What do you mean?

412
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,080
Those people have all
shed blood for Yuanzhou.

413
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,400
They all possess

414
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,660
a strong sense of collective honor

415
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,550
and a deep commitment
to the clan's mission.

416
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,920
They would never ignore
the family's interests

417
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,520
for personal gain.

418
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,440
They were once subordinates
of General Si Yilin.

419
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,480
I made a blunder.

420
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,890
I'm really sorry.

421
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,000
Everyone,

422
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,420
this matter is of great importance.

423
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,560
It's not something that can be decided

424
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,180
in just a few words.

425
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,900
My Lord, I suggest

426
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,680
we send someone
to investigate thoroughly again,

427
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,680
then we can discuss how to handle it.

428
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,200
I've been listening for a long time,

429
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,990
and it's given me a headache.

430
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,920
Well,

431
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,750
since everyone's got their own opinion

432
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,590
and no conclusion has been reached,

433
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,550
let's just

434
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,960
call it a day for this matter.

435
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,230
It seems they came prepared.

436
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,400
This time, you've threatened
their interests.

437
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,550
They certainly won't let you off the hook.

438
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,720
Big Brother, be careful.

439
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,240
It's fine.

440
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,790
So what's next?

441
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,970
Are we letting the refugees into the city?

442
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,240
We're not letting them in,
but we'll provide support.

443
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,060
In this way,

444
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,070
we can solve their basic problems

445
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,550
and also obtain more witness testimonies.

446
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,030
Let's settle them in the South Camp.

447
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,350
It's still vacant there.

448
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,000
Alright.

449
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,110
This is our harvest for the year?

450
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:11,720
Yes.

451
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,310
So much money.

452
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,260
Awesome, we're getting rich!

453
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:16,860
This money belongs to Yuanzhou,

454
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,910
not us.

455
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,040
I heard we're
settling accounts today, so I...

456
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,600
Close the door first.

457
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,480
I'd like to get some budget first.

458
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,070
And Ze, Gu Lei, and the others.

459
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,020
Chief, what did you just say?

460
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,930
Come here first.

461
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,720
Squat down.

462
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,070
Now that the overall situation is settled,

463
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,270
I think it's time to return Yuanzhou

464
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,630
to Elder Budan.

465
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,460
Also, I'll bring up
the profit-sharing issue.

466
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,470
How about an 80-20 split?

467
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,230
Actually, 20% is enough.

468
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,780
That's enough.

469
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,340
You and the others wait a bit.

470
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,740
After I settle accounts with Elder Budan,

471
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,960
I'll calculate separately with you.

472
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,350
Okay.

473
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,440
I think that works.

474
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,480
With so much money,

475
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,720
even if we get just 20%,

476
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,030
we won't have to worry
for the rest of our lives.

477
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,160
You're a real dummy.

478
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,810
We can't leave now.

479
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,720
Why not?

480
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,650
Lu Di has been beaten down by us,

481
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,200
and Yuanzhou is initially stable.

482
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,800
It's the perfect time
to enjoy spending money.

483
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,110
This part of Wayun
is Ling Buxu's territory.

484
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,200
And the rest is split

485
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,550
evenly between us and Lu Di.

486
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,690
It's balanced.

487
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,070
If we leave now,

488
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,830
Lu Di will definitely expand his forces.

489
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,350
Then the Yuanzhou Army

490
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,010
will be in dire straits again.

491
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,760
Looks like we can't leave until

492
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,520
things are completely stable.

493
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,160
Indeed.

494
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,070
Lu Di is now in a standoff with us.

495
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,480
He can't make a move on us,

496
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,740
and we can't make a move

497
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,480
on him either.

498
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,160
Why can't we make a move?

499
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,170
Every cracked egg had a weak spot.

500
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,730
Where's the weak spot then?

501
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,000
Stop looking.

502
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,400
You're only good at growing crops.

503
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,920
I can dig wells too.

504
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,940
What the Lord means is

505
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,830
that although many parts of Yuanzhou

506
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,110
are controlled by Lu Di,

507
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,000
but

508
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,060
some districts are self-governing.

509
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,130
If we can get these districts

510
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
to support us,

511
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,930
then we can greatly overpower

512
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,460
the North Clan in Yuanzhou.

513
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,030
That's good.

514
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,870
Chief,

515
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,110
should we send some envoys

516
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,810
to visit each district now?

517
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,710
Sounds good.

518
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,980
Baichuan, I'll leave this matter to you.

519
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,920
Prepare some local specialties and gifts.

520
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,830
We have money now.

521
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,720
The King of Light's reputation
has spread far and wide.

522
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,550
Those people are already eager

523
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,550
to throw themselves into your arms.

524
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,850
Keep a low profile.

525
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,310
You couldn't even get into the city?

526
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,200
I couldn't.

527
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,450
There wasn't any response at all?

528
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,730
They gave us no respect at all?

529
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,270
Not even a little.

530
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,680
I'm sorry.

531
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,570
I'll think of another way.

532
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,380
Get out.

533
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,530
What's the situation?

534
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,020
Wait a little longer.

535
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,780
Just a bit more.

536
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,880
I've told you over a hundred times.

537
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,590
We've been waiting for updates
since we finished testifying.

538
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,310
I don't know
when we'll get any news either.

539
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,000
We've come all the way from Wayun

540
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
just to seek justice.

541
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,490
We're here now,

542
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,830
but you're not arranging anything for us.

543
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,190
We can't even leave here now.

544
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,800
That's right.

545
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,830
So what should we do?

546
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,170
Go to the Three Central Offices

547
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,370
or storm into the Chieftain's Mansion?

548
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,930
Listen, everyone.

549
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,680
People outside are saying...

550
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,640
What are they saying?

551
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,840
What are they saying?

552
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,850
Three Central Offices

553
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,000
spent Wayun's money on buying real estate

554
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,640
and now they're passing the buck.

555
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,980
I refuse to believe there's no justice
in this Imperial Capital.

556
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,960
Where are you going?

557
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,750
Don't stop me!

558
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,960
What are you trying to do?

559
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,880
I'm going to find those officials!

560
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,480
And make them give us all an explanation!

561
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
Yes, give us an explanation!

562
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,550
Give us an explanation!

563
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,000
Have you considered

564
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,830
that this might be Lord Di Lin's strategy?

565
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,270
Under the immense pressure
of public opinion,

566
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,160
the people at the Three Central Offices
will surely yield.

567
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,240
What we can do now

568
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,350
is to wait here quietly for news.

569
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,960
If we make a bigger fuss now,

570
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,640
it will only backfire.

571
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,120
So what should we do?

572
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,240
What should we do?

573
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,790
What should we do now?

574
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,120
Let's add fuel to the fire

575
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,550
in our own way.

576
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,720
Boss.

577
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,030
I'm sorry, Miss.

578
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:35,830
The shop is closed today.

579
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,960
We're not doing business for now.

580
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,000
Why?

581
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,550
Wasn't everything fine just now?

582
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,000
How come it's closed as soon as we arrive?

583
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,790
You see, our young lady

584
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,150
hardly ever comes out.

585
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,310
We'll just buy something
and leave right away.

586
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,270
It's because...

587
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,510
Give us justice!

588
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,480
Give us justice!

589
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,550
The Three Central Offices
embezzled the relief funds!

590
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,830
-The Three Central Offices embezzled the relief funds!
-What's going on?

591
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,790
They are refugees from Wayun.

592
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,290
They say the Three Central Offices
embezzled their relief funds.

593
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,920
But the officials
at the Three Central Offices deny it.

594
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,310
It's causing quite a commotion.

595
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,310
You should also go back quickly.

596
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,960
I think the officials will be here soon.

597
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,160
Give us justice!

598
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,920
The Three Central Offices
embezzled the relief funds!

599
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,400
Let's return to the mansion.

600
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,720
The Three Central Offices
embezzled the relief funds!

601
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,800
Give us justice!

602
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,200
Give us justice!

603
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,030
The Three Central Offices
embezzled the relief funds!

604
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:18,090
The Three Central Offices
embezzled the relief funds!

605
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,240
Tell me,

606
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,160
are you involved in

607
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,510
what happened in Wayun?

608
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,860
Yes.

609
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,760
I'm not just involved but deeply involved.

610
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,740
The charity gala

611
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,310
was organized by both of us.

612
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,010
And I have personally handled

613
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,010
the allocation of the relief funds.

614
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,520
The restoration of Wayun

615
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,870
holds great significance for me as well.

616
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,190
Because it's not just
about restoring a city,

617
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,890
but also about bringing back together

618
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,510
the countless families shattered by war.

619
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,980
What about the relief funds?

620
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,230
Why didn't the relief funds
reach the refugees?

621
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,110
You haven't seen it with your own eyes

622
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,310
and may not know

623
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,640
the damage of the war

624
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,920
to a city.

625
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,320
That kind of damage can't be

626
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,690
fixed overnight.

627
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,840
Even in a thriving city
like the Imperial Capital,

628
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,570
there are still people
suffering in the corners.

629
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,790
Let alone a place as scarred

630
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,040
and remote as Wayun.

631
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,640
Your Highness,

632
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,240
I'm sorry.

633
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,020
I didn't do well enough.

634
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,110
I failed to personally oversee everything

635
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,410
and ensure it was properly handled,

636
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,550
which gave bad actors
the chance to exploit the situation.

637
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,830
But the charity gala

638
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,000
was our joint effort.

639
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,750
No matter what,

640
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,100
you have to believe that

641
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,840
what I want

642
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,520
is the same as yours.

643
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,640
You have to understand,

644
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,920
many things require
not only money and manpower,

645
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,910
but also a long time to heal.

646
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,550
But from now on, I will work harder

647
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,450
to fulfill and protect

648
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,650
our common wish.

649
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,860
Your Highness, you're tired today.

650
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,000
I'll go back first.

651
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,940
Get some rest.

652
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,850
Di Lin has always been resourceful

653
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,680
and thoughtful.

654
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,320
But now the rumors
are getting more and more intense.

655
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,650
If we let this continue unchecked,

656
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,430
it could spark unrest.

657
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,880
No, it won't.

658
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,950
Three Central Offices

659
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,040
have their own playbook.

660
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,640
Last time, they showed us
how they twist the facts.

661
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,130
They turned the battle of Yuanzhou

662
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,490
into a story of Si Yilin
being cruel and warmongering.

663
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:00,200
What kind of tactics
will they use this time?

664
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,250
Given their nature,

665
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:07,140
they will definitely give him

666
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,600
a taste of his own medicine.

667
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,920
But won't this hurt Princess Ning?

668
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,880
After all, this matter

669
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,710
was personally handled by Princess Ning.

670
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,600
I've already thought of that.

671
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,310
I have a way

672
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,960
to get Ning out of this.

673
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,090
Slow down.

674
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,270
If you drink too quickly,
you'll burn your tongue.

675
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,000
If this continues,

676
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,610
the Three Central Offices will eventually
be drowned in a flood of criticism.

677
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,480
Lord Di Lin's move is indeed powerful.

678
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,940
It's bloodless,

679
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,900
yet in an instant, it brings

680
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,580
enormous pressure
to the Three Central Offices.

681
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,640
You still have the mood to praise him?

682
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,920
Hurry up and think of a way to solve it!

683
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,909
I wonder if you two advisors
have heard the phrase,

684
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,670
"give him a taste

685
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,710
of his own medicine."

686
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,810
I have quite a few friends
in the South Camp.

687
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,710
I believe they won't refuse.

688
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,880
We protest every day
and can't even get a sip of water.

689
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,960
We've been busy for so long,

690
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,360
but no one even pays attention to us.

691
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,590
So far, there's been no response

692
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,920
from Lord Di Lin's side.

693
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,360
What should we do next?

694
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,880
Haven't you realized

695
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,020
that you're just sacrificial lambs?

696
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,960
Who are you calling sacrificial lambs?

697
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,620
Ding Cheng.

698
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,810
Why did Di Lin bring you here from Wayun?

699
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,929
Di Lin's ministry has always been
at odds with the Three Central Offices.

700
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,770
He's just using you as pawns.

701
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,580
To put it bluntly,

702
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,590
we are just soldiers.

703
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,640
Who cares if we live or die?

704
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,150
Why don't we just storm
the Three Central Offices

705
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,190
and overthrow the Ministry
of Military and Legal Affairs?

706
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,590
Make them give us justice!

707
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,800
Yes, give us justice!

708
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,630
Right? Give us justice!

709
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:13,760
Everyone!

710
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,710
Give us justice!

711
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,190
Do you really think

712
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,990
Di Lin and the Three Central Offices

713
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,920
are the real culprits?

714
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,630
Everyone,

715
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,880
the real culprits are:

716
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,610
first, Ge Shan from
the Ministry of Government Supervision.

717
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,880
Yuanzhou has suffered
continuous military defeats,

718
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,440
losing 23 districts in a row.

719
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,090
It's all because of

720
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,900
anti-war people like Ge Shan.

721
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,320
She is narrow-minded and cowardly,

722
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,190
blocking our clan's efforts
to raise an army,

723
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,150
stifling the patriotic spirit
of our young men

724
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,810
who want to join the military.

725
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,840
She has left us helpless,

726
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,800
watching our lands slip away

727
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,870
and our comrades fall in battle.

728
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,290
We are soldiers.

729
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,670
We risk our lives for the clan,

730
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,280
yet we don't receive
the treatment we deserve.

731
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,150
It's all because of those anti-war people.

732
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,800
They ignore our sacrifices

733
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,440
and dismiss our dedication.

734
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,400
Besides Ge Shan,

735
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,840
there's also Si Yilin,
the commander of the Palace Guards.

736
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,500
We fought tooth and nail
against Si Yilin at Payi

737
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,030
and suffered a crushing defeat,

738
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,880
yet he showed no remorse.

739
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,230
Instead, he came back and got promoted.

740
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,230
What about us?

741
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,030
Shouldn't they be
the ones paying the price?

742
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,670
They should!

743
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,960
Do you think that's fair?

744
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,840
It's not fair!

745
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,800
It's not fair!

746
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,630
It's not fair!

747
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,630
Punish Si Yilin!

748
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,670
Punish Si Yilin!

749
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,150
A strong army means a strong clan.

750
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,190
We demand our relief funds!

751
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,440
We demand our relief funds!

752
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,000
Restore the honor of
the Zichuan's soldiers!

753
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,590
Restore the honor of
the Zichuan's soldiers!

754
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,920
We demand our relief funds!

755
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,450
We demand our relief funds!

756
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,810
Punish Ge Shan!

757
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,760
-Punish Ge Shan!
-No wonder Lord Di Lin

758
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,960
insisted on you taking
a carriage back to the mansion.

759
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,320
I don't know what happened,

760
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,800
but overnight, public opinion
has suddenly turned against you.

761
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
All the criticism

762
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,950
is now directed at you and Lord Ge Shan.

763
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,420
Restore the honor of
the Zichuan's soldiers!

764
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,950
Restore the honor of
the Zichuan's soldiers!

765
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,230
Punish Ge Shan!

766
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,920
Punish Ge Shan!

767
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,360
We demand our relief funds!

768
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,780
We demand our relief funds!

769
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,190
Restore the honor of
the Zichuan's soldiers!

770
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,150
Don't use the main entrance.
Let's go around to the back door.

771
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,110
We demand our relief funds!

772
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,320
That wretch!

773
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,920
I must kill her this time!

774
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,270
Let's go, follow her!

775
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,400
Who's there?

776
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,450
My Lord, run quickly!

777
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,500
Stop the carriage!

778
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,780
Ge Shan and Si Yilin are over there!

779
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,580
Bring the offenders to justice!

780
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,210
Everyone, don't harm the civilians!

781
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,190
Let me in!

782
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,750
Lord Ge, let me escort you back
to the mansion first.

783
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,760
Thanks to Si Yilin

784
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,110
arriving just in time,

785
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,370
it was a close call but no harm was done.

786
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,840
Have the assassins been caught?

787
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,510
No.

788
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,550
Ge Shan is already under tight protection.

789
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,480
But Si Yilin still acts alone.

790
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,780
That's not a problem.

791
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,120
Even among the military,

792
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,180
there are few

793
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,410
who dare to confront Si Yilin directly.

794
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,550
Of course, Si Yilin wouldn't

795
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,350
harm a civilian for no reason.

796
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,840
He is a soldier.

797
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,760
What is a soldier's duty?

798
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,230
Isn't it to protect civilians?

799
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,420
Yes.

800
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:45,720
The Three Central Offices are clearly
well-entrenched and highly influential.

801
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,090
Even the winds of the Imperial Capital

802
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,880
shift in their favor in an instant.

803
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,880
No matter how strong the wind is,
it will eventually die down.

804
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,150
We just need to wait and see.

805
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,540
You've been coughing a lot lately.

806
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,000
Be careful not to catch a chill
from the wind.

807
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,640
We really have to thank you
for your idea this time.

808
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,800
If not for that, the Three Central Offices

809
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,840
might have really been
taken down by Di Lin.

810
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,900
You must be kidding, Advisor Wang Ge.

811
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,250
We at the Three Central Offices
have a clear conscience.

812
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,960
The innocent has nothing to hide.

813
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,620
Even if Di Lin did have intentions
of framing us,

814
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,830
he can't twist right and wrong, right?

815
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,150
Yes, indeed.

816
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,460
We have a clear conscience.

817
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,190
The Three Central Offices
have really made a big move.

818
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,730
Is there anything else?

819
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,970
Lord Ge Shan has been assassinated.

820
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,290
Ge Shan has been assassinated?

821
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Where is Si Yilin?

822
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,360
You can't defeat me.

823
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,920
Leave quickly.

824
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,690
Are you alright?

825
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,810
On the battlefield,

826
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,240
we believed

827
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,710
you'd lead us to victory,

828
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,840
so we could hold our heads high.

829
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,920
After the defeat,

830
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,670
we trusted you to rebuild our city walls

831
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,840
and care for the wounded.

832
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,700
But in the end…

833
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,920
We all believed

834
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,840
Di Lin would bring us justice.

835
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,700
We know we can't win against you,

836
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,200
but we're not afraid to die.

837
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,070
We're willing to give everything we have

838
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,600
for the people we swore to protect.

839
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,090
Even if we die,

840
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,280
we'll have no regrets.

841
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,070
I'm sorry.

842
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,590
My Lord...

843
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,380
Lord Si Yilin.

844
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,840
Go quickly, Ding Cheng.

845
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,070
People will be here soon.

846
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,850
Let's go.

847
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,920
My Lord,

848
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,760
you still remember who I am?

849
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,560
Of course I remember.

850
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,420
Ding Cheng from the
12th Company of Payi City,

851
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,970
Xiang Yu from the 15th Company,

852
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,110
and Ming Fei from the 17th Company.

853
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,660
I remember all of you.

854
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:01,750
My Lord...

855
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,760
Seventy thousand soldiers

856
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,170
stood with me to defend Payi.

857
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,970
But in the end, fewer than
a hundred survived.

858
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,320
My Lord.

859
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,900
You are all warriors.

860
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,500
Laying down your life
for the nation and dying in battle—

861
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,960
that's what you're meant to do.

862
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,240
But you never should have
endured such humiliation.

863
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,890
This is my failure.

864
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,550
So I'm willing to take the stab.

865
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,320
My Lord.

866
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,220
Give Di Lin some more time.

867
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,070
He will deliver the justice you deserve.

868
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,110
Go.

869
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,760
Someone's coming. Let's go!

870
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,200
My Lord!

871
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,900
Let's go!
