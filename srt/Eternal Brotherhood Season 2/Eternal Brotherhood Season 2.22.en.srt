[Eternal Brotherhood 2]

00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,680
[Episode 22]

3
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,430
Zhang Asan.

4
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,270
We've been digging here for four hours.

5
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,120
Are you sure it's here?

6
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,750
Xuebo Vine loves damp places the most.

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,400
It's different from other vines.

8
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,060
It likes to grow underground.

9
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,150
This is the place
with the most abundant water source

10
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,590
in the entire Jialai District.

11
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,960
Multiple streams converge here.

12
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,840
If it's not here,

13
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,560
then it's even less
likely to be anywhere else.

14
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,660
Don't misunderstand.

15
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,430
You should wash your face.

16
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,800
No need. I'll wash
with mountain spring water.

17
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,860
Mountain spring water
is good for beauty and skin care.

18
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,150
If I had known it would be this tiring,

19
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,210
I would have asked
Luo Jie and the others to come help me.

20
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,240
Where is it?

21
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,240
Lin Yu, come here.

22
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Look at this.

23
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,040
As expected.

24
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,290
The books don't record it clearly.

25
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,630
It's misleading.

26
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,160
But fortunately, I have good luck.

27
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,040
I don't know if it's your good luck

28
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,310
or my good luck.

29
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,310
Anyway, thank you for this time.

30
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,240
It's nothing.

31
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,390
It seems we really
have to say goodbye this time.

32
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,750
It's a long journey. Let me see you off.

33
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,950
Or I can have someone else escort you.

34
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,790
That won't be necessary.

35
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,950
I see.

36
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,290
Thank you very much this time, master.

37
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,360
Master?

38
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,110
I'm just

39
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,140
an ordinary Zhang Asan, that's all.

40
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,040
You're too modest.

41
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,920
Being able to enter
and leave the Imperial Capital unnoticed,

42
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,980
roaming freely in Yuanzhou,
expelling the North Clan.

43
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,680
I really didn't expect

44
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,950
that the famous King of Light

45
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,870
would be Zichuan Xiu,
one of the Three Heroes of Zichuan.

46
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,210
You also truly impress me.

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,270
Regaining military power during exile,

48
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,690
and entering Yuanzhou alone
to seek medicine for your father.

49
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,890
The young master of the Liufeng family,

50
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,290
the commander-in-chief
of the Baiyue Army, Liufeng Shuang.

51
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,250
It's a pleasure to meet you.

52
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,650
Brother San, I've wanted
to ask you a question for a long time.

53
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:04,800
Go ahead.

54
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,680
Why do you fight as a soldier?

55
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,160
What do I fight for?

56
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,950
For those who love me and those I love.

57
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,510
To make sure

58
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,600
all the good things I cherish

59
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,930
will not be trampled on.

60
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,870
I firmly believe there are
many things in this world

61
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,350
that I would defend with my life.

62
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,590
What about you? What do you fight for?

63
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,190
You fight for your beliefs.

64
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,850
While I fight for the Liufeng clan.

65
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,810
If saving my clan requires sacrifice,

66
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,040
I am equally willing to die.

67
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,920
If one day we meet on the battlefield,

68
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,440
please don't show mercy.

69
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,890
I'm really leaving this time.

70
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,500
Farewell.

71
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,080
Until we meet again.

72
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
If you continue this hunger strike,

73
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,030
you won't live to see the trial.

74
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,780
You don't need to stand here anymore.

75
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,260
Until I prove my innocence,

76
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,840
I will not eat.

77
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:12,750
Your Highness.

78
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,720
Ma Wei.

79
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,440
I'm fine.

80
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,280
This place is filthy and cold.

81
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,250
It's not a place you should come to.

82
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,870
Please go back.

83
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,630
If you want to prove your innocence,

84
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,710
you should live on.

85
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,030
Your Highness, you don't need to save me.

86
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,750
I'm just a political scapegoat.

87
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,090
Actually, we're quite
similar in some ways.

88
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,080
You were pushed out by your family,

89
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,510
while I was pushed out
by the Three Central Offices.

90
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,840
You were pushed out to appease the people,

91
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,780
while I was pushed out to take the blame.

92
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,200
You see,

93
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,680
aren't we quite alike?

94
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,370
So, about the corruption,

95
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,960
you didn't do it?

96
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,280
Does the answer matter?

97
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,550
Because the answer isn't up to me,

98
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,120
it's up to them!

99
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,230
Of course it matters.

100
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,320
I don't believe that in Zichuan,

101
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,200
anyone can reach the point

102
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,550
where they can
manipulate everything at will.

103
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,440
As long as

104
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,170
we are willing to investigate,

105
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
the truth will be revealed.

106
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,550
I'm grateful

107
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,840
that you came here.

108
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,790
But you're the heir to the clan.

109
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,360
You still have many things to worry about.

110
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,550
You don't need
to concern yourself with me.

111
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,550
If I can get through this,

112
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,950
then I'll get through it.

113
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,480
If I can't, I won't force it.

114
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,750
Don't be sad, Ning.

115
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,270
I'm sorry, I overstepped.

116
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,610
But in my heart, I've been thinking...

117
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,520
I've been thinking that one day,

118
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,650
I could call you by your name like this.

119
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,390
Ning.

120
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,870
Ning.

121
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,480
Ning.

122
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,600
Ning.

123
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,960
Ning.

124
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm afraid if I don't call you now,

125
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,390
I'll never have the chance again.

126
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,650
Don't say such things.

127
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,320
I have lived a proud and open life.

128
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,120
If there's any regret,

129
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,790
there's only one.

130
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,480
All along,

131
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,450
there's been a girl living in my heart.

132
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,080
She's clever and spirited,

133
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,730
she's innocent and lovely.

134
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,150
When she shoots arrows,
she's full of confidence,

135
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,750
so confident that
even the sun willingly dims.

136
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,470
When she sees suffering people,

137
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,770
she silently sheds tears.

138
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,550
Even if it's beyond her ability,

139
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,670
she still tries her best to save them...

140
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,480
Don't say anymore.

141
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
I have to say it.

142
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,450
If I don't say it now,
I'll never have the chance.

143
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,510
I don't know when it started,

144
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,100
but her face has been deeply

145
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,460
etched in my mind.

146
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,750
I'm sure now.

147
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,550
I like her.

148
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,320
Maybe it's not just like,

149
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
it's love.

150
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,120
The funny thing is,

151
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,150
I only now have
the courage to say it out loud.

152
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,640
I...

153
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,360
Ma Wei.

154
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,650
If you're truly innocent,

155
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,510
the truth will surely come to light.

156
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,660
This won't be the last time
we see each other.

157
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,010
I'm already a criminal of the Ministry
of Military and Legal Affairs.

158
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,740
The abandoned pawn
of the Three Central Offices.

159
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,320
No one is willing to

160
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,130
to prove my innocence.

161
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,940
There's still one person.

162
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,000
Before proving your innocence,

163
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,530
the only thing you need to do

164
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,840
is to live well.

165
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,750
Alright.

166
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,960
You've met?

167
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,730
Then let me escort you
back to your residence.

168
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,570
No, I need to see the Lord Chieftain.

169
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,580
For Ma Wei.

170
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,010
This matter

171
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,540
was handled by
the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

172
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,240
You want to see the Lord Chieftain

173
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,390
for no other reason
than to plead for leniency.

174
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,390
If the Lord Chieftain issues an order

175
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,650
to have the Ministry release the person,

176
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,750
wouldn't that be telling the world

177
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,030
that Lord Di Lin
is abusing his power for personal gain?

178
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,720
I think if you truly believe

179
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,780
Ma Wei is innocent,

180
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,640
you'd better not interfere in this matter.

181
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,720
Has Princess Ning left?

182
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,349
Yes.

183
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes.

184
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,000
Do we have any other options?

185
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,750
Yes.

186
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,920
We sacrifice the pawn to protect the king.

187
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,830
Ma Wei's case is minor,
the Three Central Offices' matter is major.

188
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,510
You know this as well.

189
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,750
Ma Wei, as a member
of the Three Central Offices,

190
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,180
he deceived the people
and fed his own nest.

191
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,110
Such behavior is utterly despicable.

192
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,030
He should be punished
severely to comfort the people.

193
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,400
The Three Central Offices
failed in their supervision

194
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,460
and didn't detect this early enough.

195
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,170
They should also
bear corresponding responsibility.

196
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,160
What is the punishment?

197
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,010
The Three Central Offices believe

198
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,040
he should be sentenced to

199
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,440
death.

200
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,400
All related personnel have been detained?

201
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,920
Yes.

202
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,030
We've searched Ma Wei's house thoroughly.

203
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,960
As expected, we found a secret room

204
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,070
and discovered a ledger inside.

205
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,550
It contains detailed records of

206
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,630
all the destinations
of the Wayun relief funds.

207
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,950
Most members of the Three Central Offices

208
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,280
are implicated in this.

209
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,100
Now we have solid evidence.

210
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,030
These parasites!

211
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,560
Go to the Ministry of Military
and Legal Affairs immediately

212
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,820
and inform Lord Di Lin about this matter.

213
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,720
Yes, sir.

214
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,830
What's wrong?

215
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,510
My Lord.

216
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,070
Lord Luo,

217
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,120
the Lord Chieftain requests your presence.

218
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,340
Big.

219
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,770
I bet small, I bet small.

220
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,550
Small.

221
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,480
Small.

222
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,350
Big.

223
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,400
Small.

224
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,030
Come on.

225
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,240
Place your bets, place your bets.

226
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,350
We agreed.

227
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,830
Today we're all betting with potatoes.

228
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,750
I bet twenty on big.

229
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,440
Generous.

230
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,020
Ten potatoes, I'm also betting on big.

231
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,030
Five on small.

232
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,790
Small, I bet on small.

233
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,240
Big.

234
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,300
Small.

235
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,310
Big.

236
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,030
Mine.

237
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,400
Again.

238
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,000
Again.

239
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,310
Continue.

240
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:53,840
Let's go.

241
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,200
My Lord, just watch.

242
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,110
Soon, Pang Xiya

243
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,550
will win everything
from them, even their underwear.

244
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,610
Just like you guys.

245
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,030
That's not me.

246
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,110
At least I kept my

247
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,440
underwear and one sock.

248
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,050
Luo Jie is the one
who's truly stark naked.

249
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,360
Chief, it's exactly as you predicted.

250
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,270
This gambling isn't fair.

251
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,310
How is it not fair?

252
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,070
I won fair and square, right?

253
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,740
That's right.

254
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,210
In our city, potatoes are quite valuable.

255
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,830
The value of my five potatoes

256
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,790
is equivalent to your ten or twenty.

257
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,030
But in terms of quantity,

258
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,750
it seems like I'm betting less than you.

259
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,790
By your logic,

260
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,070
haven't I lost out too?

261
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,350
I bet twenty potatoes,

262
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,610
but what I actually won

263
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,070
was your five potatoes.

264
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,400
You're being unreasonable.

265
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,020
Why don't you
just admit you can't do the math?

266
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,470
I...

267
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,550
Stop arguing.

268
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,850
I originally thought

269
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,750
betting with
the same items wouldn't be a problem.

270
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,000
I didn't expect that even the same items

271
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,580
would have different values

272
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,480
in our different places.

273
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,280
That's right.

274
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
For example, coal

275
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,800
is everywhere in our place,

276
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,490
but it's quite expensive here in Jialai.

277
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,240
Looks like we can't
start the game again today.

278
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,270
Who says so?

279
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,500
Let's find something everyone agrees on

280
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,350
with the same value, problem solved.

281
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:23,900
For instance,

282
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,110
this diamond.

283
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,640
It's a rare mineral resource,

284
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:33,720
more valuable than your ten Kerni coins,

285
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,480
my ten baskets of corn,

286
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,130
or your ten carts of coal.

287
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,680
Right, everyone can bet with diamonds.

288
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,030
Then it won't feel unfair.

289
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,560
Exactly.

290
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,970
Everyone knows

291
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,370
that these potatoes

292
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,510
are considered the most abundant

293
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,640
food resource in our Yuanzhou region.

294
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,070
The same potato

295
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,550
is worth two coins in your place,

296
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,350
but worth five corns in mine.

297
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,160
But if you want to use two coins

298
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,680
to buy my five ears of corn,

299
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,110
it's not possible
to make a direct purchase.

300
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,400
When we trade on our own,

301
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,510
we always end up with arguments like this.

302
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,070
it's not as good as

303
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,750
the peace we had
when the North Clan unified our trading.

304
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,510
What do you mean?

305
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,110
Are you suggesting we should go back

306
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,160
to relying on the North Clan?

307
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,240
I'm just expressing my opinion.

308
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,270
What opinion?

309
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,750
Our cities in Yuanzhou
have been self-governing for a long time,

310
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,000
each with its own currency system.

311
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,860
The North Clan took advantage of this

312
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,920
to control us separately,

313
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,590
preventing communication
and trade between us.

314
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,670
This way, they could once and for all

315
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,880
keep us confined within their territory,

316
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,680
working for them without worry.

317
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,960
So,

318
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,120
if all cities use currency of equal value,

319
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,800
a potato in your city,

320
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,690
your city,

321
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,590
your city,

322
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,650
or your cities

323
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,920
would all be worth two coins.

324
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,960
Then everyone can gamble

325
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,950
at the same table, right?

326
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,850
Yes, indeed.

327
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,530
So you're suggesting a unified currency?

328
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,270
Yes. When I was in the black market,

329
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,750
I noticed that merchants there

330
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,880
all used diamonds for trading.

331
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,200
In fact, diamonds circulate in every city.

332
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,790
These diamonds have a stable value,

333
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,870
so they're the most suitable

334
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,920
to use as a unified currency.

335
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,880
That makes sense.

336
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,000
I think it's feasible.

337
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,160
But diamonds come in different sizes.

338
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,070
I might say it's big,
he might say it's small.

339
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,270
In the end, we'll still end up fighting.

340
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,220
So, unifying the currency
is just the first step.

341
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,600
After that, we need to
standardize weights and measures.

342
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,880
Only by changing the system,

343
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,640
unifying our economy and institutions,

344
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,310
can Yuanzhou avoid being enslaved

345
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,680
and become independent.

346
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,720
How do we know

347
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,260
you won't become the next Lu Di?

348
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:48,720
That's right.

349
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,550
Indeed.

350
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,710
Lu Di is the kind of person

351
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,880
who would only keep power

352
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,720
in his own hands.

353
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,830
In the future Yuanzhou,

354
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,430
power will be
in the hands of every individual.

355
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,960
As for what Yuanzhou
will become in the future,

356
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,230
♪ Look at the burning flames in the sky ♪

357
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,930

Well said.

363
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,770
That makes sense.

If Yuanzhou remains forever

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,680
I am the lord of Kerni City.

374
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,880
I also agree.

375
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,670
♪ Wild and passionate ♪

376
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,640
I hope the King of Light
will keep his promise.

377
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,050
I will not disappoint you.

378
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,030
♪ Burning through the hills and plains ♪

379
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,510
To the King of Light.

380
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,140
♪ For freedom ♪

381
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,400
The Princess drank
the medicine you prescribed.

382
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,680
She's been having
night sweats for several nights.

383
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,790
It seems you're not
suitable to take care of the Princess.

384
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,790
You may leave now.

385
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,070
It's all my fault.

386
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,330
I'll take my leave now.

387
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,010
I won't trouble you
any further, Your Highness.

388
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,360
As usual, there are two prescriptions.

389
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,400
However, the Imperial Medical Office
have sent

390
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,510
the female doctor
and other medical officials...

391
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,590
My Lord, you may need
to find ways to point out their mistakes

392
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,880
and have them transferred away.

393
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
This is not a sustainable solution.

394
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,310
Her Highness is due to give birth soon.

395
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,240
The timing is off by more than a month.

396
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,370
We need to make further arrangements.

397
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,750
I have my own plans. You may go now.

398
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,080
General, Black Veil Counsellor
has arrived.

399
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,310
He's here so soon.

400
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,580
Be careful, Lord Yun.
Watch your words and actions.

401
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,850
Of course, there's no need to worry.

402
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,480
The Imperial Medical Academy said

403
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,750
that the medical officers
and female physicians sent previously

404
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,880
were mostly unsuitable for Her Highness.

405
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,030
The Divine Emperor is quite concerned.

406
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,200
He's worried Her Highness
might have some hidden illness.

407
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,730
So he sent me to check on her.

408
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,680
Thank His Majesty and you, Counsellor.

409
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,680
Her Highness is doing well.

410
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,160
She's being personally
cared for by my old medical officer.

411
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,030
I need to take Her Highness's pulse

412
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,920
to understand the real situation,

413
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,150
so that the Imperial Medical Academy

414
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,610
can arrange suitable imperial physicians.

415
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,750
Of course.

416
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,270
It's just that Her Highness
has just fallen asleep.

417
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,200
That's not a problem.

418
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,810
I can diagnose
Her Highness's pulse using a silk thread.

419
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,760
Lord Black Veil.

420
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,640
What's troubling you?

421
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,310
I've committed a serious crime.

422
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,310
I hope that you, Lord Black Veil,

423
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,010
can save my life
before the Divine Emperor.

424
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,920
Speak.

425
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,790
Those previous
medical officers and female physicians

426
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,480
didn't actually make any mistakes.

427
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,040
I deliberately
set them up and framed them.

428
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,720
You're worried that

429
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,070
the two princes have no heirs,

430
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,890
and fear they might harbor ill intentions.

431
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,720
One can't be too careful.

432
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,290
General-in-Chief, you've thought
this through thoroughly.

433
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,030
I can keep this matter from His Majesty.

434
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,370
On one condition.

435
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,080
Please speak, Counsellor.

436
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,330
In all matters,
Her Highness's safety must come first.

437
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,100
I will remember that, sir.

438
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,610
This is really too much
to ask of you, General-in-Chief.

439
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,440
Besides, I'm about to give birth.
It can't be hidden.

440
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,830
Your Highness,
you don't need to worry so much.

441
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,200
Just focus on taking
care of yourself and the baby.

442
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,610
Leave the rest to me.

443
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,240
I have a plan.

444
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,610
Even the Ministry of Military
and Legal Affairs

445
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,240
doesn't have the right
to mistreat prisoners

446
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,970
before the truth is uncovered.

447
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,830
Lord Di Lin did not mistreat me.

448
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,400
I voluntarily went
on a hunger strike in prison.

449
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,270
I've been wrongfully imprisoned this time.

450
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:06,640
A hunger strike is my only way
to protest and prove my innocence.

451
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,160
Innocence?

452
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:14,000
You embezzled Wayun relief funds
under the pretense of tree planting.

453
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,560
Do you admit your crime?

454
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,880
How can I admit what I didn't do?

455
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,060
Bring the physical evidence.

456
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,720
My Lord, the evidence
warehouse caught fire.

457
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,520
Most of the evidence was burned,

458
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,380
including the account books.

459
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,000
I have failed in my duty.

460
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,650
Could it be that there's no evidence,

461
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,310
so you're deliberately
putting on a show to deceive people?

462
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,370
It doesn't matter.

463
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,570
I admit this.

464
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,750
I did divert several sums of money

465
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,650
for tree planting.

466
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,510
The vegetation in Wayun
has been severely damaged.

467
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,070
If we don't replant trees,

468
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,170
the environment will
continue to deteriorate.

469
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,160
The consequences would be immeasurable.

470
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,270
But according to the investigation,
these charitable funds

471
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,270
were not only not used for planting trees,

472
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,470
but instead became personal property.

473
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,890
A few days ago,
when I was investigating this matter,

474
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,000
Lord Luo was assisting me the whole time.

475
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,750
Lord Luo is a witness.

476
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,400
I did indeed find some things before,

477
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,440
but they were just clues.

478
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,850
It's not as Lord Di Lin said,

479
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,870
solid evidence like account books.

480
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,370
The tree planting project
hasn't been implemented

481
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,880
because the land
in Wayun is severely desertified.

482
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,030
To advance the planting,

483
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,140
a lot of preliminary
management work is needed,

484
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,440
as well as coordination
of human and material resources.

485
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,030
If just because of this,

486
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,920
you can rashly accuse me
of embezzling charitable funds,

487
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,590
then I don't know, Lord Di Lin,

488
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,350
where do you place
Zichuan's laws and justice?

489
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,820
May I ask, Lord Di Lin,

490
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,030
is it that you can't tolerate me, Ma Wei,

491
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,850
or that you can't
tolerate the Three Central Offices?

492
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,390
Your attempt to
make the Three Central Offices

493
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,950
cease to exist,

494
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,720
does the Lord Chieftain know about it?

495
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,310
Do the ancestors
of the Zichuan family know about it?

496
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,490
Given the lack of evidence,

497
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,460
the charge of embezzlement
against Ma Wei is not established.

498
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,600
He is hereby acquitted and released.

499
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,270
But the Ministry of Military
and Legal Affairs operates

500
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,030
with impartiality
and fairness in enforcing the law.

501
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,090
We uphold justice
and fairness for the Zichuan family.

502
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,040
It is precisely
based on this fairness and justice

503
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,590
that due to insufficient evidence now,

504
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,520
I am releasing the person
in accordance with the law.

505
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,890
As for the Three Central Offices,

506
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,150
it's an institution used by the clan
to oversee administrative operations.

507
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:16,350
Its existence is irrelevant
to the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

508
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:23,430
The Ministry only
handles matters within its jurisdiction.

509
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,290
This has been the case in the past,

510
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,050
and will continue to be so in the future.

511
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,350
I have more to say.

512
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,790
Although my innocence has been proven,

513
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,690
The allegations of Wayun's
embezzlement of charitable funds

514
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,450
are not entirely baseless.

515
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,930
There's a hidden story behind it.

516
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,070
And this story

517
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,750
is related to Xiao Ping, the Chief
Advisor of the Three Central Offices.

518
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,390
You...

519
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,030
Xiao Ping is the Chief Advisor
of the Three Central Offices,

520
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,440
yet he broke the law

521
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,820
and raised over 10,000 private soldiers.

522
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,880
To fill the huge expenses,

523
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,300
you decided to use the charity money.

524
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:16,150
You chose your
relatives' shops for cooperation,

525
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,150
inflating prices and embezzling funds.

526
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,230
I had heard rumors about this before,

527
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,800
but as I wasn't certain,

528
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,800
I dared not speak out.

529
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,760
It wasn't until I was wrongfully
imprisoned that I realized the truth.

530
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,960
Just now, Lord Di Lin

531
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,630
spoke eloquently, touching our hearts.

532
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,929
Since you claim to be so fair and just,

533
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,500
I urge you to investigate
this matter thoroughly

534
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,760
to reveal the truth.

535
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,630
You...

536
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,909
Ma Wei, that's nonsense!

537
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,360
Do you have evidence?

538
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,889
There are no secrets
that can't be uncovered.

539
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,510
We'll know if it's true
or not after investigation.

540
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,540
We'll investigate.

541
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,180
Your Highness,

542
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,100
Advisor Ma Wei
has been released without charges.

543
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,700
Really?

544
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,150
Let's return to the palace.

545
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,950
You...

546
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,530
Aren't you waiting for Advisor Ma Wei?

547
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,810
No, we're not waiting.

548
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,200
I almost had to
collect your corpse this time.

549
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,550
If I had died in prison,

550
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,360
they wouldn't have
allowed anyone to collect my body.

551
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,760
Not bad. After starving for so many days,

552
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
you still haven't lost your spirit.

553
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,510
After Di Lin rejected me,

554
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,870
I went to Xiao Ping's residence,

555
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,280
but he refused to see anyone.

556
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,740
He wouldn't meet me at all.

557
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,170
So who got you out?

558
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,660
Lord Chieftain.

559
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,440
Advisor Ma Wei, please have a seat.

560
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,900
Thank you, My Lord.

561
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,920
Many people have mentioned to me

562
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,010
that you've been exceptionally
intelligent since childhood.

563
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,860
Look at this game of Go.

564
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,490
I've been studying it for a long time,

565
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,150
but I still can't solve it.

566
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,350
It's a pity about this game.

567
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,170
Just because of one wrong move,

568
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,330
it became an unwinnable position.

569
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,110
Which piece are you referring to?

570
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,030
This one.

571
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,710
Although placing it here
can cut off White's advance,

572
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,010
it also disrupts one's own formation.

573
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,730
It will eventually
become a sacrificial piece.

574
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,410
It's a pity that moves
can't be taken back in Go.

575
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,230
The board and pieces are made by people,

576
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,140
and the game is played by people.

577
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,670
What do you think?

578
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,820
If that piece

579
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,150
could foresee its own fate,

580
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,770
it would surely choose a different path.

581
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,230
If moves could be taken back,

582
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,320
I would be willing

583
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,790
to follow only
Lord Chieftain's orders from now on.

584
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,320
Please, sit down.

585
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,940
This game has come alive.

586
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,510
Xiao Ping, Speaker
of the Three Central Offices,

587
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,760
embezzled funds during his tenure,

588
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,710
disregarding the interests of the people.

589
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,200
He is now stripped of his position

590
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,530
and imprisoned awaiting further action.

591
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,510
Advisor Ma Wei, young and accomplished,

592
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,050
with noble integrity, is a role model.

593
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,440
He has been recommended by Lord Chieftain

594
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,480
and the Three Central Offices
as Chief Advisor.

595
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,400
From prisoner to Chief Advisor.

596
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,360
It feels like this Imperial Capital

597
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,920
has an invisible hand

598
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,120
pushing from behind.

599
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,110
Yes, there is indeed such a hand.

600
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,960
With a turn of the palm,
it can change everything.

601
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,760
Luo Minghai’s sudden
reversal before the trial,

602
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,100
in the entire family,

603
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,890
only one person
had the power to make it happen.

604
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,880
Are you referring to Lord Chieftain?

605
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,480
This alliance between
Di Lin and Luo Minghai

606
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,400
is truly intimidating.

607
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,480
And now, not only has their only alliance

608
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,030
been destroyed,

609
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,480
but he has also inserted his own influence
into the Three Central Offices.

610
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,010
It's indeed killing
two birds with one stone.

611
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,800
Lord Chieftain's
thoughts are unfathomable.

612
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,510
And now Zichuan
is even more of a murky pond.

613
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,950
You need to be
even more careful in the future.

614
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,660
Thank you.

615
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,060
My Lord,

616
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,720
I have failed in my supervision.

617
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,190
The evidence was destroyed,

618
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,830
not only allowing
Ma Wei to be released without charges,

619
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,480
but also letting him
become the Chief Advisor.

620
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,120
I am willing to resign
and accept punishment.

621
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,320
It's alright.

622
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,200
Without destruction,

623
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,630
there can be no establishment.
