[Eternal Brotherhood 2]

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,890
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,440
Since you've been here for a while,

4
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,710
why didn't you show yourself
sooner? I'm exhausted.

5
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,890
[Lin Yunfei, Elder of the Lin Family]

6
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,410
I have to be careful,

7
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,120
so I don't spill the breakfast
I brought for you.

8
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,720
Your favorite Hills flatbread
with bean soup.

9
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,380
Fortunately, Sen sent me a secret letter
through his emissary.

10
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,010
He and Master Xishan
are both imprisoned.

11
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,850
He hopes I can assist you
in rescuing them.

12
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,680
I've already made arrangements.

13
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,360
Both my land and sea battle units

14
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
are at your disposal.

15
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,650
I'm sure we can catch Liufeng Ming
off guard.

16
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,680
Have the other elders of the Lin family
agreed to mobilize the troops?

17
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,190
I...

18
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,190
Don't lie to me.

19
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,760
I've been able to tell when you're lying
ever since we were kids.

20
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,570
I can't just stand by and do nothing
about your situation.

21
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,050
Now the entire Liufeng territory
is under lockdown.

22
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,310
Without reinforcements,
you'll certainly be stuck.

23
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,360
I'm already very grateful that

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,960
you came to help me this time.

25
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,280
Since the elders disagree with
deploying the troops,

26
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,910
I can contact my old unit
in the Baiyue Army.

27
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,800
We can coordinate from inside and outside
to carry out the rescue.

28
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,030
I absolutely can't let my family matters
affect you.

29
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,230
Your family matters?

30
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,190
I, Lin Yunfei, from childhood
to adulthood,

31
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,560
have confessed to you, proposed,
and even pressured you to marry me

32
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,400
at least 20 or 30 times, right?

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,240
From the elders to the women and children
in the Lin family,

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,810
everyone knows my sincere feelings
for you.

35
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,640
What does it matter if they don't agree?

36
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,240
I will never leave you alone.

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,680
First of all, since childhood,

38
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,200
I've always considered you
my best sis...

39
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,480
Alright, I'll concede a bit. I've always
considered you my brother, alright?

40
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,250
Secondly,

41
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,780
when I say stay out of it,
just do so.

42
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,670
Even if this world is full of dangers,

43
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,960
I absolutely won't leave you
to suffer by yourself.

44
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,840
Protecting you is the vow I made
since childhood.

45
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,690
Do you know what my situation
is this time?

46
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,840
Bandits, pirates,

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,780
assassins, brigands,

48
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,410
or clan rebellions.

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,290
I don't care about any of these.

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,470
I've also experienced
life and death situations.

51
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,070
In the face of life and death,

52
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,940
I know what's most precious to me.

53
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,960
What is it?

54
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,650
You, of course.

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,280
If I remember correctly,

56
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,340
this should be your 79th
confession, right?

57
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,750
This is Bulu Village.

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,650
Around it are the defensive positions
of other races of the Alliance Army.

59
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,350
This time, let's change
our attack strategy.

60
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,460
This is the defensive area of
Sun Shi from the Snake Race.

61
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,720
He's the most cowardly one.

62
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,710
If provisions run low,

63
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,400
he definitely won't be able to
hold the position.

64
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,959
Let's start with him

65
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,750
and defeat them one by one.

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
What do you think?

67
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,790
How's the situation?

68
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,140
Lu Di's forces have surrounded us
from three sides.

69
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,390
The situation is extremely
critical, My Lord.

70
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,909
What did the King of Light say?

71
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:45,340
He told us to defend our position
to the death.

72
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,470
Defend to the death?

73
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,990
If we keep holding on, we'll really die.

74
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,230
How much food do we have left?

75
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,110
If we cut back, it should hold out
for three more days.

76
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,060
But some soldiers are already fighting

77
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,090
over the insufficient rations.

78
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,120
At a time like this, there's
still infighting?

79
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,200
Wait.

80
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,160
Quickly, go grab some food
from the granary

81
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,570
and hide it.

82
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,640
It's better to be prepared.

83
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,880
Also, send someone to Bulu Village
immediately to request reinforcements.

84
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Tell them we can't hold on
much longer. Hurry!

85
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,930
Understood!

86
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,110
If Lu Di defeats Sun Shi,

87
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,910
then the next in danger

88
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,160
will be Men Luo of the Dragon Race
and Lu Yi of the Gnomes.

89
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,960
We've been tensely preparing for battle
here in Bulu Village,

90
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,790
but unexpectedly, Lu Di
doesn't even dare to come.

91
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,230
It's not that he doesn't dare.

92
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,490
His strategy is indeed much better
than a frontal assault.

93
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,840
Moreover,

94
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,230
even if Lu Di mounts a frontal assault
on Bulu Village now,

95
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,230
we might not be able to withstand it.

96
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,350
My Lord, Sun Shi has sent another
messenger to report.

97
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,470
They can no longer hold out and
are requesting reinforcements.

98
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,110
How many more days can
their food supply last?

99
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,950
Three days.

100
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,030
Yes.

101
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,960
All races lack experience in
defensive battles.

102
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,030
Although their food supply can last
three more days,

103
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,090
I doubt they can even hold out for one.

104
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,030
If Lu Di is only feigning the attack,

105
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,080
and we deploy troops out of the city now

106
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,350
only to be ambushed,

107
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,400
it would be a costly mistake.

108
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,520
But if this goes on any longer,
chaos will ensue.

109
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,790
Let Gu Lei continue to pose
as the King of Light

110
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,840
and harass Lu Di's rear...

111
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,650
Let's hold our position and
wait for His Lordship to return.

112
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,050
If we lose the frontline,

113
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,810
Bulu Village will be in danger.

114
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,770
My Lord, a force suspected to be
the King of Light's

115
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,370
is engaging our rear forces.

116
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,890
Should we deploy reinforcements to help?

117
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,600
Does the King of Light take me
for a three-year-old child?

118
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,380
This must be his decoy force.

119
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,810
A diversionary tactic,

120
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,770
just to make us abandon our
attack on Sun Shi.

121
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:42,960
What does this tell us?

122
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,990
What?

123
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,200
That our strategy is working!

124
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,200
Our approach of striking hard
at small enemy forces is correct.

125
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:57,590
I knew this King of Light was
nothing special.

126
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,360
I estimate the main force of his Alliance Army
is no more than a few thousand men.

127
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,090
He surely won't dare to leave the city
for a decisive battle with us.

128
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,360
Pass down the order:

129
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,150
continue the attack on Sun Shi.

130
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,550
Tonight, I'll have his head!

131
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,400
My Lord, we can't hold much longer!

132
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,590
Lu Di is about to break through!

133
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,320
So fast?

134
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,660
H-Has the food been hidden?

135
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,730
Send the order: retreat!

136
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,310
This Lu Di has become quite clever.

137
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,750
Harassment tactics aren't working anymore.

138
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,620
You're back just in time.
Sun Shi fled.

139
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,120
What? Didn't he still have three days
of supplies left?

140
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,540
We also just received the news.

141
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,530
Lu Di has already occupied Sun Shi's camp

142
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,659
and is heading east.

143
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,909
He's probably in pursuit of them.

144
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,040
Quickly, lead a team to support them.

145
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,460
Stop!

146
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,680
My Lord, we're about to enter
the mountain forest ahead.

147
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,200
The mountainous terrain is
unfavorable for our army.

148
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Moreover, the forest here is dense.

149
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,860
There might be enemy ambushes waiting.

150
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,050
Stop the pursuit. Return to the camp.

151
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,600
We'll use this method

152
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,300
to remove the Yuanzhou army's camps

153
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,100
outside Bulu Village one by one.

154
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,710
Let's see who will be able

155
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,710
to assist Bulu Village by then.

156
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,640
You hide comfortably here,

157
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,090
giving us orders,

158
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,400
just telling us to hold our ground
at all costs.

159
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,130
Do you have any idea how
hard it is for me?

160
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,010
Do you know how long it's been

161
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,540
since we've had a full meal?

162
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,050
Why have you still not sent us supplies?

163
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,450
Where's the King of Light?
I want to see him.

164
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,630
King of Light, come out! King of Light!

165
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,620
The King of Light has caught a cold
and is resting.

166
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,070
Right.

167
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,960
He's sick?

168
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,860
Did we choose him as our leader

169
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,480
so he could comfortably

170
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,260
lie in bed and sleep?

171
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,080
Of course not.

172
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,330
You've finally decided to come out.

173
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,490
I heard everything you said,

174
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,690
and you're absolutely right.

175
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,990
I know how hard you've been
fighting and suffering

176
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,510
on the front lines,

177
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,460
That's why I had Luo Jie

178
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,190
bring back supplies specifically
to reward you.

179
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,860
Luo Jie, come in.

180
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,520
Open it.

181
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,360
See?

182
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,630
I'll have someone deliver all of this

183
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,780
to you later.

184
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,890
Do you truly mean that?

185
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,840
Absolutely.

186
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,490
Moreover, I can assure you that

187
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,440
I will capture Lu Di alive

188
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,320
and avenge you.

189
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,980
Alright, I'll trust you one more time.

190
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,220
I'll deliver it to you in a moment.

191
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,820
Chief, you're really back.

192
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,480
So we have food now?

193
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,080
There's no food at all.

194
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
Chief had me fill this bag with dirt.

195
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,260
However, there're indeed supplies.

196
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,380
I've already sent Gu Lei to rendezvous
with the transport unit.

197
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,510
The supplies will arrive in a few days.

198
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,060
This Lu Di is really troublesome.

199
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,900
Fighting with him is like
playing whack-a-mole.

200
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,950
It just never stops.

201
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,870
This Lu Di is really persistent, isn't he?

202
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,160
Not bad.

203
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,180
He's gotten a taste of success this time.

204
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,990
What should we do? Strike back?

205
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,730
No, we retreat.

206
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:44,740
Retreat?

207
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,760
Are we just going to hand over the

208
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,830
territory we worked so hard
to occupy so easily?

209
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,660
We'll fight a guerrilla war
against them.

210
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,620
Since Lu Di wants to act like a mole,

211
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,960
then we'll be the flies. Let's see
who gets annoyed first.

212
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,880
My Lord. We've achieved victory
without bloodshed.

213
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,190
The Alliance Army

214
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,380
has been utterly routed.

215
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,890
They're already mentally shattered.

216
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,410
Why do I feel like something's not right?

217
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,910
It seems like every time we've faced
the King of Light,

218
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,170
I've had this feeling.

219
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,490
Report, My Lord.

220
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,100
All units have occupied camps as ordered

221
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,160
without any resistance. However...

222
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,630
However what?

223
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,680
However, few of our patrol companies
were ambushed.

224
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,630
40 to 50 men were killed.

225
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,420
How many?

226
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,680
40 to 50.

227
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,910
It's fine. We'll retaliate tomorrow.

228
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,360
My Lord.

229
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:42,980
My Lord?

230
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,400
My Lord!

231
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,500
My Lord, scouts from various places
report that

232
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,650
many alliance troops have emerged,
well-versed in the terrain.

233
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,240
They don't engage with us for long.

234
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,360
They kill about 50 of our men
each time and then retreat.

235
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,560
After a day like this,

236
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,480
we've lost over 1,000 of our men.

237
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,040
All troops must not linger in battle.

238
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,090
Kill 50 men and then retreat.

239
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,590
By the end of each day,

240
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,700
Lu Di will be down by at least
1,000 soldiers.

241
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,590
But Lu Di has tens of thousands of troops.

242
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,080
Are we supposed to just
keep killing forever?

243
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,010
Besides, Lu Di won't

244
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,630
let us keep killing his men
like this every day.

245
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,210
Don't worry. Lu Di is more anxious
than we are now.

246
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,270
I understand now.

247
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,780
He wants to devour us bit by bit.

248
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,560
We must not take this lightly.

249
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,300
This must be the King of Light's scheme.

250
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,940
Such combat power, such tactics.

251
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,040
The King of Light must have sent

252
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,190
his main forces.

253
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,740
What Lu Di wants to know most right now

254
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,340
is where our main force is.

255
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,390
Because he believes with his strength,

256
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,510
he can easily

257
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,050
wipe out our main force
and be done with it.

258
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,920
If that's the case, let's let him know

259
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,680
where our main force is.

260
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,930
Also, we need to strengthen our defenses

261
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,060
and try to disrupt their
intelligence system.

262
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,780
We should act quickly and decisively,

263
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,010
striking directly at their vital point.

264
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,810
We must not let the King of Light's
scheme succeed.

265
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,260
How can we let him know

266
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,700
where our main force is?

267
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,420
The King of Light.

268
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,130
Wherever the King of Light is,
that's where the main force is.

269
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,160
Doesn't Lu Di

270
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,630
care for the King of Light the most?

271
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,820
My Lord, our troops

272
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,580
got ambushed near the mountain forest.

273
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,170
The enemy forces keep coming, and it's
hard to determine their numbers.

274
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,440
The ones we've encountered recently

275
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,970
have all been small troops.

276
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,750
Now there's a sudden increase in troops.

277
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,100
This must be the King of Light's
main force.

278
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,100
Very well.

279
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,060
Have Fu Ge take half the company
to pursue the enemy.

280
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,420
The rest shall stay to guard
the main camp.

281
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:14,850
Report!

282
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,460
My Lord.

283
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,490
Another enemy force has appeared
in the northeast direction.

284
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,220
This force is very likely

285
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,180
the main force stationed in Bulu Village.

286
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,610
What makes you think they're
the main force?

287
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,340
Because the King of Light has personally
taken to the battlefield.

288
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,790
The mountainous terrain here

289
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,080
is clearly more suitable for
hiding the main force.

290
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,370
This is obviously a trap!

291
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,670
Tell the entire army

292
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,830
to ignore this force

293
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,700
and continue pursuing the main company.

294
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,430
Yes, My Lord!

295
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,890
Chief.

296
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,230
Lu Di's troops haven't approached us.

297
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,130
They're still pursuing Busen's whereabouts
in the mountain forest.

298
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,820
Very good. Let's continue resting.

299
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,630
We'll resume the act in a moment.

300
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,360
Understood.

301
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,730
Report!

302
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,510
Bad news, My Lord.

303
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,540
The force we were after

304
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,400
immediately scattered and fled
after entering the mountain forest.

305
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,010
This King of Light is toying
with me again!

306
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,770
Moreover, the force that just appeared

307
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,010
in the northeast direction

308
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,610
has advanced another 3 miles or so.

309
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,490
And... And while advancing,

310
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,960
they're beating gongs and drums.

311
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,060
Attack! Send people over there

312
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,180
to pin down this force and
beat them to death!

313
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,910
Yes, My Lord!

314
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,770
My Lord, please calm down.

315
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,210
Now, near the mountain forest,

316
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,650
another unit of the Dragon Race
has appeared.

317
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,490
But we can't determine

318
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,290
which one is the real main force.

319
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,880
What weapons are the Dragon Race carrying?

320
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,490
They're uniformly equipped with spears
and also carry bows and arrows.

321
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,180
Yuanzhou is scarce in resources.

322
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,370
Only a few soldiers can be equipped
with spears, bows, and arrows.

323
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,250
The King of Light must think
I'll act impulsively.

324
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,610
He's actually using such a low tactic
as beating gongs and drums.

325
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,850
It's just a bluff,

326
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,300
which in reality, is to hide

327
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
the true position of his main force.

328
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,040
I almost fell for his trick again.

329
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,040
Fu Ge.

330
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,790
Take half the troops and personally

331
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,940
lead the pursuit of the Dragon Race.

332
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,670
Yes, My Lord.

333
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:25,540
Chief.

334
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,530
Lu Di has sent people to chase
after the Dragon Race this time.

335
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,610
This Lu Di is so...

336
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,220
So clever as to step on every move I make.

337
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,770
Luo Jie.

338
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,370
Tell everyone to gear up.

339
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,200
It's time to fight.

340
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,650
Chief, are we really...

341
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,650
Yes, we're going to fight,
but not against Lu Di.

342
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,370
If we fight him now,

343
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,960
he will kill us.

344
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,880
If we're not fighting Lu Di,
then who are we fighting?

345
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,250
You bunch of useless fools!

346
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,890
You don't even know where
the main force is!

347
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,190
I'll kill you,

348
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,849
and then kill him!

349
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:09,869
My Lord.

350
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:12,780
Several forces have appeared
in the mountain forest this time.

351
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,819
The King of Light... He's also among them.

352
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,880
This time, I'm sure I'm not mistaken.

353
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,690
Didn't you say

354
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,220
the King of Light was beating
gongs and drums?

355
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,369
That side was indeed fake.

356
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,340
Send my order! Emergency assembly!

357
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,850
I'm going to take
the King of Light's head!

358
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,020
Behave yourselves and kneel properly!

359
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,650
Lu Di's camp is quite impressive.

360
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,840
It's just his temper is
a bit unpleasant.

361
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,050
Such a nice thing got broken.

362
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,780
What a pity.

363
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,780
My Lord.

364
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,170
Chief, we've packed up the supplies.

365
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,460
Happy times are always short.

366
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,470
It's time to say goodbye again.

367
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,690
But I can give Lu Di a little gift.

368
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,410
I'm sure he'll be happy.

369
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,460
My Lord!

370
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,470
Our camp was attacked.

371
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,470
W-What did you just say?

372
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,030
Our camp has been attacked.

373
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,280
My Lord, the inventory is complete.

374
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,440
All our provisions and equipment

375
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,270
have been looted by the King of Light.

376
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,810
Report!

377
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,640
My Lord, the Yuanzhou Alliance Army has
passed through the mountain forest.

378
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,730
They've entered the Huailuo Plain.

379
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,160
It seems their next target is...

380
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,920
Yongfeng District.

381
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,790
Send someone to notify the garrisons
of Yongfeng, Talin,

382
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,720
and Yasuda districts that
the enemy is approaching.

383
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:52,850
Hurry!

384
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,680
Yes, My Lord!

385
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,760
My Lord.

386
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,240
My Lord, please calm down.

387
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,150
He's really gone too far!

388
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,020
Alright, My Lord. Don't cry, don't cry.

389
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,290
My Lord, please don't cry. Don't cry.

390
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,100
Governor of Talin, Governor of Yasuda.

391
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,980
Guys, why don't you calm down first?

392
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,820
Get up and talk.

393
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,860
My Lord, we didn't have time to
defend at all.

394
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,980
We didn't expect them to
suddenly appear

395
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,210
outside Yasuda City.

396
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,340
Their people were everywhere.

397
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,300
I had just received news of
the sneak attack,

398
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,930
and immediately after,

399
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,850
I heard the sound of the city gate
being breached!

400
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,610
It was the same for us in Talin.

401
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,090
Fortunately, My Lord, your messenger
arrived in time.

402
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,330
Otherwise, the two of us

403
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,540
would have ended up like the
Governor of Yongfeng District,

404
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,580
killed by the chaotic troops.

405
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,950
My Lord, you should take a rest too.

406
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,560
You've been through a lot.

407
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,690
Go back and rest.

408
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,680
My Lord.

409
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,710
Please avenge us, My Lord!

410
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,020
Leave.

411
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,780
King of Light...

412
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:49,630
Come on.

413
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,740
Give us a hand.

414
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,490
We've struck it rich!

415
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,500
Chief, we've really made
a fortune this time.

416
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,620
So much grain.

417
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,980
We won't have to worry about

418
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,210
the other units asking us for
supplies anymore.

419
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:00,850
They

420
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,850
are probably busy cleaning up
the battlefield now.

421
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,170
In this battle, we've gained districts,
the city, and military supplies.

422
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,760
Everything we wanted and needed

423
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,840
has been secured.

424
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,000
Moreover, after this battle, Lu Di

425
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,460
is probably severely weakened

426
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,990
and won't take any action
against us in the short term.

427
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,520
The grain for the Imperial Capital
has also been delivered.

428
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,180
We can finally catch a breath.

429
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,260
Did Xiu go through this too?

430
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,950
Every martial artist who wants to
become a master

431
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:39,940
must endure

432
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,190
pains that ordinary people cannot bear.

433
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,050
Practicing the horse stance is
just the first step.

434
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,740
I used to think

435
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,860
he was naturally that talented.

436
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,300
I never imagined...

437
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,640
No one is born talented,

438
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,010
and neither are you.

439
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,730
Being an heir isn't something
you were born into,

440
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,120
but you'll eventually become qualified.

441
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,590
It's just that this process,

442
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,650
compared to the boring horse stance,

443
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,580
might be even more agonizing.

444
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,630
Your Highness, Advisor Ma Wei
requests an audience.

445
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,360
Take a break.

446
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,210
Since the last attack,

447
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,220
I've been wanting to give Your Highness
a weapon for self-defense.

448
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,070
I asked the best craftsman in the city

449
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,670
to custom-make this for you.

450
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,480
This crossbow bolt...

451
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:41,930
Try it.

452
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,780
It has some weight to it.

453
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,160
Let me teach you.

454
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,440
Stand firm.

455
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,310
Raise your arms.

456
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,910
Place your fingers loosely.

457
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,230
I hit it!

458
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,510
This is quite interesting.

459
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,200
Thank you.

460
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,300
Your Highness, there's no need
to be so polite.

461
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,500
It's a nice crossbow,

462
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,380
but it's a pity that
you're a scholar, Mr. Ma.

463
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,820
Now that I've delivered the gift,
I won't disturb you further.

464
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,880
I'll invite Your Highness to try the
crossbow in the suburbs another day.

465
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,980
Your Highness, let me take it and
keep it safe for you.

466
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,580
If you don't like it, Li Qing,

467
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,600
I don't like it either.

468
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,530
It's just a crossbow.

469
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,820
What's there for me to like or dislike?

470
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
I'm not talking about the crossbow.

471
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,000
Ma Wei is just an ordinary person to me.

472
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,940
He is Your Highness's friend.

473
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,900
Well, I've never had many friends
since childhood.

474
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,860
I know

475
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,220
who genuinely cares about me.

476
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,760
Let's continue practicing then.

477
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,090
Listen to me.

478
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,370
Through this battle,

479
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,450
we gained quite a lot of supplies.

480
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,380
That's right.

481
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,210
This time, the King of Light

482
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,370
has truly opened our eyes.

483
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,100
We didn't even see Lu Di in person,

484
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,540
but we got everything we wanted.

485
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,410
I never thought

486
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,430
a battle could be fought like this.

487
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,820
So, remember this,

488
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,010
we can't confront them head-on.

489
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,220
As you know, this Lu Di,

490
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,900
although somewhat dull,

491
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,830
has battle-hardened soldiers
under his command.

492
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,650
That's right.

493
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,310
If we confront them directly,

494
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,770
it will surely result in
mutual destruction.

495
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,830
Yes. That's right.

496
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,820
So if we want to win the battle,

497
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,210
we must use tactics.

498
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,820
It's a pity

499
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,760
that Yuanzhou has been enslaved
for so long.

500
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,960
We never had the chance
to learn these things.

501
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,680
As a result, in many aspects,

502
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,970
we are indeed inferior to the North Clan.

503
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,220
That's indeed the case.

504
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,140
Before His Lordship returned,

505
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,300
when Lu Di attacked the
Snake Race's position,

506
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,100
Sun Shi clearly had three days
of provisions left,

507
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,230
but what happened?

508
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,840
The position was lost in
less than half a day.

509
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,240
We can't blame him for that.

510
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,260
The Snake Race soldiers' discipline is
indeed not as good as the North Clan's.

511
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,980
But now, we've got the King of Light.

512
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,820
If the King of Light could
teach us tactics,

513
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,880
once we learn them,

514
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,260
we could better protect our Yuanzhou.

515
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:19,850
Right?

516
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,720
Right!

517
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,600
That's right.

518
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,050
Our stamina far surpasses that
of the North Clan.

519
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,850
If we could learn to use tactics,

520
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,160
the North Clan would be no match for us.

521
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:31,850
Right?

522
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,560
Right!

523
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,170
King of Light!

524
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,250
King of Light?

525
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,310
King of Light?

526
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,810
King of Light!

527
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,180
Right, that makes sense.

528
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,580
Let's do it then.

529
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,200
Great!

530
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,120
Great!

531
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,170
Great.

532
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,790
The methods I just mentioned

533
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,340
are all about fighting on the move,

534
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,210
also known as mobile attacks.

535
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,170
Remember these key points of tactics:

536
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,340
surprise the enemy,

537
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,200
attack when they're unprepared,

538
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,260
use a small force to defeat a larger one,

539
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,020
and

540
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,960
wait at ease to wear out the enemy.

541
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,440
In short, we need to

542
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,500
manipulate the enemy
in the palm of our hands,

543
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,760
making them fight according to our pace.

544
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,810
This way,

545
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,110
we can firmly grasp

546
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,930
victory in our own hands.

547
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,290
That makes sense.

548
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,950
Listen carefully.

549
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,080
In war, you must always remember:

550
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,450
don't be arrogant when you win,

551
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,930
don't be frustrated when you lose,

552
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,090
and never act impulsively.

553
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,580
Your brain is a valuable asset.

554
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,810
Make sure to bring it with you in battle.

555
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,950
Class dismissed.

556
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,930
After all these calculations,

557
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,100
what can we conclude?

558
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,330
We can conclude that our chances
of victory are 80%.

559
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,340
This is already an extremely
high probability of success.

560
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,300
If we take the initiative to
attack at this point,

561
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,480
our chances of winning will
be greatly increased.

562
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,240
If this result is below 50%,

563
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,130
each one of you,

564
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,500
carefully consider

565
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,100
whether it's worth launching
an attack or not.

566
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,210
Is it worth it or not?

567
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,470
Good question.

568
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,950
If you rashly attack

569
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,450
and end up being surrounded,

570
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,310
and coincidentally, food supplies
are insufficient,

571
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,100
then at that moment,

572
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,690
the issue of rational food distribution

573
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,850
becomes a crucial problem.

574
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,650
Do you understand?

575
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,690
I'll explain it again.

576
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:55,970
I understand.

577
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,040
We got it.

578
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,330
Do you want to know

579
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,090
if there's any secret to
guaranteed victory?

580
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,890
Of course.

581
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:12,170
My answer is definitely yes.

582
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,580
Having fought so many battles,

583
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,890
I've never lost.

584
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,260
Today, I'll teach you

585
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,170
this secret to guaranteed victory.

586
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,300
Do you want to hear it?

587
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,780
Yes.

588
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,780
Louder.

589
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,340
Yes!

590
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,300
This secret is:

591
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,640
if you can't defeat them, run.

592
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,290
Don't give others a chance to win.

593
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,720
This way, you won't lose.

594
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,790
Not losing means guaranteed victory.

595
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,840
Don't you think what I'm saying
makes sense?

596
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,410
De Lun.

597
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,540
Tell me if what I'm saying makes sense.

598
00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:00,690
When you think about it carefully,
it does make sense.

599
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,460
Busen, do you think you can beat me?

600
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:08,610
Yes, I can.

601
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,590
Fine, I'll run.

602
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,710
So I won't lose.

603
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:16,930
One!

604
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:18,900
Two!

605
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,370
Three!

606
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,100
Good, very good.

607
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,100
King of Light.

608
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,780
King of Light!

609
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,450
Let me take a look.

610
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,580
So energetic.

611
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,750
Did you have a rash a couple of days ago?

612
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,600
Do you want to try this?

613
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,860
How did you know?

614
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,050
My Lord, you even know he has a rash.

615
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,600
I don't just know about him.

616
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,130
I also know about you.

617
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,480
You should eat more.

618
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,030
You've been having diarrhea and
got dehydrated, right?

619
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,440
Try this. It will help regulate your body.

620
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,690
Thank you, My Lord.

621
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,600
Thank you, My Lord.

622
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,330
No need. Continue practicing.

623
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,540
Stay focused and continue training.

624
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,290
How did you know they had
rashes and diarrhea?

625
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:16,820
This medicine doesn't look like
something you'd carry around.

626
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,820
After following me for so many years,

627
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,150
you still don't know me?

628
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,640
What a considerate leader
to the subordinates I am.

629
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,740
Actually,

630
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,740
besides the guerrilla tactic...

631
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,190
What's wrong with you?

632
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,670
I've got a rash. It's an old problem.

633
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,980
I've been having diarrhea for three days.

634
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,910
You have no idea.

635
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,300
I didn't leave the toilet at all
last night.

636
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,120
I really am a perfect leader.

637
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,410
I immerse myself among them,
get to know each of them,

638
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,500
think what they think,
and do what they need.

639
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,350
You dare to chat in my class?
Do you wish to die?

640
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,000
Six!

641
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,350
Seven!

642
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,980
Looks like this old leg

643
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,310
of mine is done for.

644
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,320
Liufeng Ming, what are you doing here?

645
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
Don't be nervous.

646
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,450
I just want to have a simple
meal with Father.

647
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,380
The two of us, father and son,

648
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,580
haven't eaten together for a long time.

649
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,710
Get out of here!

650
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,830
What are you trying to do?

651
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,890
Liufeng Ming! Tell them to let him go.

652
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,590
I see that Father has really spoiled you.

653
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,940
Now, I just

654
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,250
wish to have a meal with Father.

655
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,830
Are you even going to interfere with this?

656
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,720
Father,

657
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:01,830
please.

658
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:10,300
This first toast is to your
great daughter,

659
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,940
my dear sister,

660
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,850
the greatest general of
the Liufeng family,

661
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,230
Liufeng Shuang.

662
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,929
Oh, right. I just received news.

663
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,110
The Black Tiger Gang has spotted her

664
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,110
at the Lin Residence and
at the border of Zichuan.

665
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,840
They've successfully intercepted
and killed this traitor.

666
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:39,100
Shuang is your own sister.

667
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,580
May I ask you, Father,

668
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,870
have you ever considered me
as your family?

669
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,170
You always treat me with such coldness,

670
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:50,440
as if you're ready to discard me
at any moment.

671
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,130
I think you

672
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,000
simply don't like me from
the bottom of your heart.

673
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,330
It's true.

674
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,450
I'm not as good as Shuang in
leading troops and fighting battles,

675
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,380
and I'm not as good as Sen in
joking and entertaining.

676
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,990
But I have my own strengths.

677
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,600
I have ambition

678
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,710
and strategy.

679
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,010
But you still don't like me.

680
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
Father, do you remember this place?

681
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,610
You once ordered

682
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,740
to lock me up here and starve me
for three days and nights.

683
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,590
Just because I lost to Shuang in hunting,

684
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,030
I wasn't even worthy of drinking water!

685
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,210
In others' eyes,

686
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,710
you are a local tyrant,

687
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,780
a great hero.

688
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,280
But in my eyes,

689
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,850
you are just an incredibly cruel father!

690
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,410
I know you don't want me as your son.

691
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,100
You, Liufeng Xishan,

692
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,760
can't have such a useless son.

693
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,820
You even wanted to

694
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,180
starve me to death back then!

695
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,500
You're absolutely insane!

696
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,060
Sen, ignore him!

697
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,830
He only treated you so harshly

698
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,660
because he had high expectations for you!

699
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,890
Liufeng Ming! What are you trying to do?

700
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:21,500
Ming...

701
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,480
I told you

702
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,840
not to disturb me and Father
while we're eating!

703
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,850
Sen! Go away! Sen!

704
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,130
General Shuang!

705
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,130
Please rise.

706
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,730
This is a former subordinate of mine
from the Baiyue Army.

707
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,130
Along the way, it was thanks to him
helping me gather the old unit

708
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,160
and supporting me in secret

709
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,760
that I was able to return to
Yuanjing smoothly.

710
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,030
Everything has been arranged in the city.

711
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,530
The news of your assassination
by the Black Tiger Gang

712
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,940
has already reached the palace.

713
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,690
At this moment, the defense at the
East Gate is very tight,

714
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,930
while the defense at the West Gate
is very lax.

715
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,420
We just need to disguise ourselves a bit,

716
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,280
and we can sneak into the city
through the West Gate.

717
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,800
No. We will enter the city
openly and righteously.

718
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,600
General, this might cause trouble.

719
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,680
Not only that,

720
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,480
but we'll also make a big scene.

721
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,060
You ordered people to spread
false news of your death.

722
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,650
Wasn't it to sneak into the city quietly

723
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,970
and catch Liufeng Ming off guard?

724
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,050
I did it just to make him afraid.

725
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,490
Ying Mulan, go to the North Gate.

726
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,500
You, go to the South Gate.

727
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,900
Fei, the West Gate is yours to guard.

728
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,250
General, what about you?

729
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,860
I'll open the East Gate by myself.

730
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,900
I want those who attempt to destroy
the Liufeng family,

731
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,150
both internal traitors and external
enemies, to know

732
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,860
that I, Liufeng Shuang,
have returned.

733
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,480
These useless fools!

734
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,810
How could they handle this like that?

735
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,270
What's the situation now?

736
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,110
All the city gates have been attacked.

737
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,340
We have no idea where she entered from,

738
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,130
but it's certainly her who commanded
people to do it.

739
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,020
The North Gate was breached
using siege ladders,

740
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,080
clearly the tactics of a combat unit.

741
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,510
A big fire broke out at the South Gate.

742
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,980
The guards at the East Gate
have turned against us.

743
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,920
The West Gate was forcibly breached.

744
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,650
It seems... It seems like
the Lin family's doing.

745
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,010
What?

746
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,270
The Lin family is here too?

747
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,680
We're really done for.

748
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,250
Go, gather all our forces immediately.

749
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,100
Hurry!

750
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,860
Yes, My Lord!

751
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,800
Why are there so few people?
Where is everyone?

752
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,150
Call everyone here!

753
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,770
Young Lord, rest assured.

754
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,500
This place is heavily guarded.

755
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,210
Liufeng Shuang absolutely cannot enter.

756
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,270
Young Lord!

757
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,760
Young Lord!

758
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,420
The place where Master is
imprisoned is under attack.

759
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,860
They can barely hold on!

760
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,280
What did you say?
Liufeng Shuang has returned?

761
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,130
Yes.

762
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,280
All of you, go

763
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,460
and bring her back to me!

764
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,820
Everyone go!

765
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,890
Wait, make sure to kill her.

766
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,110
Understood.

767
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,020
Everyone, follow me!

768
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,610
Yes!

769
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,000
General Shuang.

770
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,970
We haven't located Master yet.

771
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,800
Although Ming wants to be
the head of our family,

772
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,640
he doesn't dare to bear the name
of patricide and regicide.

773
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,480
This doing

774
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,130
is probably for revenge.

775
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,090
Revenge?

776
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,560
The map.

777
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,940
Years ago, Father imprisoned him here

778
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,690
to reflect on his actions in solitude.

779
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,340
So it's very likely that Liufeng Ming

780
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,420
has imprisoned Master Xishan here.

781
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,520
Then I'll leave Father to you.

782
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,910
I need to go somewhere else.

783
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,730
Ming.

784
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,420
Ming.

785
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,730
Remember when we played hide-and-seek
when we were kids?

786
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,790
As soon as I started singing outside,

787
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,560
you'd be so scared that you'd
run out on your own.

788
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,910
After all these years,

789
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,860
you're still such a coward.

790
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,520
Why do you always like

791
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,340
to take what belongs to me?

792
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,510
Today, I won't let you take it away!

793
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,170
Don't come any closer!

794
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,060
Where's everyone? Guards!

795
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,100
You've sent them all out to kill me.

796
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,780
Don't you remember?

797
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,750
Don't come any closer!

798
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,650
If you come closer, I'll kill you!

799
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,130
Guards! Come quickly!

800
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,250
Where is everyone?

801
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,710
Where are the guards?

802
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,600
Guards, lock him up.

803
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,590
Shuang.

804
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,380
You're hurt.

805
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,150
I'm okay.

806
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,150
I just don't understand why Father

807
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,420
refuses to come out.

808
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,460
Father, sorry that I came late.

809
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,640
The rebellion has been quelled.

810
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,060
Ming is being held in custody by me,

811
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,320
awaiting your orders.

812
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,040
I'll order someone

813
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,450
to remove these barricades right away.

814
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,010
Keep them as they are.

815
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:32,440
Everything has its cause and effect.

816
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,780
I have some responsibility for

817
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,900
the way Ming turned out.

818
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:41,950
Shuang.

819
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,480
Send him back home.

820
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,020
He and I, father and son, will
never see each other again.

821
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:58,000
Father!

822
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,760
Is Master Xishan alright?

823
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,860
Father is unwell after this incident.

824
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:22,210
He can't see you this time.

825
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,010
But he told me

826
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,440
to thank you

827
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:30,510
for your assistance to the
Liufeng family this time.

828
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,640
There's no need for thanks between us.

829
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,100
You were willing to go against
the wishes of your clan elders

830
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,410
to lead your troops and help me
quell this rebellion.

831
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,390
Our Liufeng family

832
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,630
will definitely remember this kindness.

833
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,510
No matter when,

834
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,100
I will never turn a blind eye

835
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,770
to your matters.
