2
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,820
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,110
My Lord,

4
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,690
all our provisions have been taken away.

5
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,310
More importantly...

6
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,400
More importantly,

7
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,200
we don't even know where

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,660
the enemy's main force is.

9
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,110
My Lord,

10
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,600
we must beg forgiveness
from the Divine Emperor.

11
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,560
First, we concealed

12
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,720
the failure of the attack
on the sacred temple,

13
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,820
then the Yuanzhou
Alliance Army's rebellion,

14
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,800
followed by the King of Light's uprising.

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,660
Now we've lost three more cities.

16
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,870
We haven't mentioned any of this

17
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,600
to the Divine Emperor, My Lord.

18
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,050
If we report the truth,

19
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,320
do you know what awaits us?

20
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,370
In the battle of Moon Bay,

21
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,300
I killed countless enemies,

22
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,360
which led to my current position.

23
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,150
If we surrender now,

24
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:59,590
all our previous efforts will be in vain.

25
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,710
So we must fight on

26
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,630
until we win.

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,150
My Lord, a troop is approaching us.

28
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,520
From which direction?

29
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,650
From the southwest.

30
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,520
From the southwest?

31
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,140
There shouldn't be
any enemy troops in the southwest.

32
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,340
It's not the enemy coming.

33
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,280
Then who is it?

34
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,530
Chief, we just received news

35
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,030
that Ling Buxu of the North Clan

36
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,430
is leading his troops
towards Lu Di's camp.

37
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,079
Ling Buxu has been stationed

38
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,079
in the Southwest Camp east of Wayun,

39
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,990
supporting each other with Lu Di.

40
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,720
If their forces join together,

41
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,100
I'm afraid we won't be able to handle it.

42
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,700
Then we should strike first!

43
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,660
No, with Ling Buxu's arrival,

44
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,250
I actually feel a bit sorry for Lu Di.

45
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,250
Chief, have you lost
your mind from all the fighting?

46
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
There's no reason
to feel sorry for your enemy.

47
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,000
The provisions for the Southwest Camp

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,730
have always been
supplied from two sources.

49
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,320
First, supplies are transported
from within the North Clan territory,

50
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,530
But the route is long.

51
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,880
It's very troublesome.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,240
So the other main source

53
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,150
is Lu Di's grain collection
from various parts of Yuanzhou.

54
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,269
As we all know,

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
Lu Di doesn't have time now

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,510
to transport grain for the Southwest Camp.

57
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,680
A couple of days ago, near Talin,

58
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,740
we intercepted
a North Clan squad transporting grain.

59
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,780
Now it seems that this squad

60
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,360
must have been the supply team
heading to the Southwest Camp.

61
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,190
That's right.

62
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,240
So, Ling Buxu's trip

63
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,450
not for reinforcement,

64
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,950
but to ask for punishment.

65
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,870
If that's the case,

66
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,700
let's say a prayer for Lu Di?

67
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,600
You've been beaten
so badly by the Yuanzhou people

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,000
that you even lost Talin.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,750
[Ling Buxu]

70
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,600
The King of Light's military strategy
is indeed extraordinary.

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,860
Those are all excuses.

72
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,830
The North Clan was routed
by the people of Yuanzhou.

73
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,070
It's unheard of.

74
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,540
General, how do you plan
to explain this to the Divine Emperor?

75
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,480
Explain what?

76
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,720
The defeat.

77
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,070
Am I defeated?

78
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,310
Arent' you?

79
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,080
Nonsense.

80
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,160
As if those Yuanzhou scum could defeat me.

81
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,270
They're just a bunch of farming slaves.

82
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,010
A pack of dogs.

83
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,810
Is that so?

84
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,830
It seems you've been bitten
quite badly by these dogs.

85
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,720
Please calm down, My Lords.

86
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,760
We should unite
against our common enemy now.

87
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,500
We can't let outsiders
take advantage of this situation.

88
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,030
My Lords.

89
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,190
Please, My Lord.

90
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,520
Here, My Lord.

91
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,560
I was just careless
for a moment and fell into their trap.

92
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,140
Once I regroup,

93
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,160
I'll definitely twist off
the King of Light's head

94
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,420
and use it as a wine jug.

95
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,000
Good.

96
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,420
Then I'll be waiting
for news of your victory, General.

97
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,230
However, for now,
I need to send a messenger

98
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,160
to thoroughly investigate
your battle losses

99
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,480
and verify each detail

100
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,600
so I can report truthfully
to the Divine Emperor.

101
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,000
General.

102
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,270
Take care of yourself.

103
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Farewell.

104
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,950
Who does this Ling Buxu think he is,

105
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,680
daring to speak to me like that?

106
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,310
If it weren't for
the Divine Emperor's sake,

107
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,570
I would have already ripped his head off.

108
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,430
My Lord, please calm down first.

109
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,270
The most important thing for us now

110
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,730
is to focus on
how to defeat the King of Light.

111
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,159
General Ling has left a messenger.

112
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,070
Soon, the news of our defeat

113
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,930
will be sent back to Sairong City.

114
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,090
If the Divine Emperor learns
that we have no more victories,

115
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,090
we'll surely feel worse than death.

116
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,630
Where are your provisions located?

117
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,370
Speak quickly.

118
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,120
My Lord.

119
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,390
You may go.

120
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,790
My Lord, General Ling has ordered me

121
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,610
to come and inventory
your remaining provisions and supplies,

122
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,050
as well as assess the battle losses.

123
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,260
I kindly request your cooperation
in providing this information.

124
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,380
How do you plan
to report this to the Divine Emperor?

125
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,909
Naturally, I will report truthfully.

126
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,520
General Ling!

127
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,770
Leep an eye on Ling Buxu.

128
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,970
Kill everyone

129
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,130
who was sent to the Divine Castle.

130
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,280
Yes.

131
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,750
If we lose again this time,

132
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,970
I'll have no place left to stand.

133
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,190
So the King of Light must die.

134
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,350
Candied hawthorns for sale!

135
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,310
Young lady, would you like a skewer?

136
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,970
Ma'am,

137
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,950
what did you make these candied haws?

138
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,120
You jest, young lady.

139
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
Of course, candied hawthorns are made with

140
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,750
hawthorns and malt sugar.

141
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,150
I see.

142
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,440
Malt sugar as sweet as you.

143
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,270
So, how's business?

144
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,450
If you're not buying,
don't disturb their business.

145
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,840
You're the one disturbing.

146
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,750
It's alright.

147
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,630
Business has been good these days.

148
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,000
I was just about to hire some help

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,980
to make candied hawthorns with me.

150
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,580
Is that so?

151
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,930
Lord Xiu will be pleased to hear this.

152
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,080
-Next time.
-Bye.

153
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,120
Since when did Xiu

154
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,510
develop a habit
of eating candied hawthorns?

155
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,840
How long has it been since you've seen

156
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,650
a candied hawthorn vendor in Yuanzhou?

157
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,530
Look at it now.

158
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,740
Yuanzhou used to be poor.

159
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,940
Everything was waiting to be rebuilt.

160
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,670
People couldn't even afford to eat.

161
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,800
They only hoped to harvest more grain.

162
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,030
But now, after the revival of business,

163
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,030
besides necessities,
people can even afford sweets.

164
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,720
It shows that the people of Yuanzhou
are becoming more prosperous,

165
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,180
with higher aspirations.

166
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,860
This is all thanks to Lord Xiu's efforts.

167
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Do you know what Yuanzhou lacks now?

168
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,920
What?

169
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,660
Chunfeng Garden.

170
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,080
You...

171
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Stop right there!

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,790
I'm back.

173
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,010
What is it?

174
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,370
It looks heavy.

175
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,280
Did you go shopping?

176
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,010
No.

177
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,860
These are from the people of Yuanzhou.

178
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,390
They said it's stationery
for our office use.

179
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,480
It seems the commerce
in Bulu Village is recovering well.

180
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,910
It's not just Bulu Village.

181
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,790
The other administrative areas

182
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,920
have also gradually resumed farming.

183
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,640
According to Chief's strategy,

184
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,310
to recuperate.

185
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,210
our taxes are extremely low.

186
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,270
The people now

187
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,910
are highly motivated to farm.

188
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,370
Then how do we
manage our military expenses?

189
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,230
We don't need military expenses.

190
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,590
We only need provisions and weapons,

191
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,370
and funds
for troop movement and relocation.

192
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,560
Based on the current tax revenue,

193
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,720
we have enough.

194
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,300
We even have a surplus.

195
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,710
I didn't expect this.

196
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,230
You have the talent
to be a Chief Remonstrator.

197
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,240
Luo Jie,

198
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,200
have the North Clan soldiers
we captured earlier

199
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
help with mining.

200
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,390
Before Lu Di initiates negotiations,

201
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,600
they might as well be put to work.

202
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,330
Understood.

203
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,230
Will Lu Di negotiate with us?

204
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,060
It's only a matter of time.

205
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,870
Besides, mining
is very beneficial for us now.

206
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,200
In fact, I've already
sent scouts from the Xiu Battalion

207
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,800
west of Wayun
to establish trade connections.

208
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,750
Establish trade?

209
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,360
Chief,

210
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,390
you want to engage
in border trade with Zichuan?

211
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,670
The regulations
for goods circulation within Zichuan

212
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,480
have resulted in

213
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,320
very difficult circulation
of goods within Zichuan.

214
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Meanwhile, Yuanzhou
is rich in mineral resources.

215
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,000
Some types of minerals

216
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,750
are very scarce

217
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,360
resources within Zichuan.

218
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,240
So this is our advantage.

219
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,870
However, we can
only trade with gold coins.

220
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,600
But we don't lack anything now,

221
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,320
why bother doing this?

222
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,670
If we truly want the people of Yuanzhou

223
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,200
to have a better life,

224
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,630
what we're doing now is far from enough.

225
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,370
In the battle against Lu Di,

226
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,770
we've always been afraid to face head-on.

227
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,000
The real reason

228
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,390
is that Yuanzhou's infrastructure

229
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,550
is far inferior to the North Clan's.

230
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,150
Not to mention
compared to the Zichuan family

231
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,570
and the Liufeng family.

232
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,430
Agricultural
and construction technologies,

233
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,180
schools, armories, and hospitals...

234
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,240
All these things beneficial to

235
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,270
the development of Yuanzhou's people,

236
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,360
we need to go back
to Zichuan to learn about them

237
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,210
in order to develop Yuanzhou.

238
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,730
This is our true purpose and mission.

239
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,090
Chief, regarding this matter,

240
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,330
who do you think would be suitable?

241
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,000
My stomach hurts. It hurts so bad.

242
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:52,690
Chief.

243
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,470
Although I know the food
in the Imperial Capital is delicious,

244
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,820
the beds are comfortable,
and the wine is good,

245
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,150
not to mention Chunfeng Garden...

246
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,780
Chief,

247
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,690
this time you can't
go back no matter what.

248
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,420
We need to resolve
Lu Di's matter first, at least.

249
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,610
You guys...

250
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,390
Alright.

251
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,670
Then let's at least

252
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,030
solve the lunch problem first.

253
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,440
Okay.

254
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,520
The noodles are here.

255
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,800
Thank you, sir.

256
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,140
Sir, we didn't order this.

257
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,410
It's on the house.
Enjoy your meal.

258
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,320
Thank you.

259
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,090
Chief, do you have a stake in this place?

260
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,510
Why does the taste
of these noodles seem so familiar?

261
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,440
The taste of the Imperial Capital.

262
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,050
It's my exclusive recipe

263
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,680
that I gave to this owner.

264
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,840
It tastes exactly the same
as the noodle stand

265
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,010
at the city gate of the Imperial Capital.

266
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,140
I suddenly realized

267
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,360
that I'm quite accomplished
in culinary arts as well.

268
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,450
No wonder.

269
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,910
The owner of the noodle stand
in the Imperial Capital

270
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,580
never adds meat for free.

271
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,700
Hurry up and eat.

272
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,970
Someone get me another bottle.

273
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,420
How many dishes
did you have to get this drunk?

274
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,920
Let's drink.

275
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,030
The Chief must be especially happy today.

276
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,350
Have you ever seen him drink this much?

277
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,950
We could even eat Zichuan noodles today.

278
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,840
Indeed.

279
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,840
Who would have thought
Yuanzhou could develop like this?

280
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,920
You're right.

281
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,220
When we were kicked out
of the Imperial Capital,

282
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,750
we never imagined
it would turn out like this.

283
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,550
The Chief has found his value here.

284
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,850
[Si's Mansion]

285
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,270
I'm Tu Wa, Captain of the 15th Battalion
of Yuanzhou Army in Wayun,

286
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,650
Greetings, Lord Di Lin.

287
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,830
Captain. You must have been tiring.

288
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,030
Please, have a seat.

289
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,130
Thank you, My Lord.

290
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,430
You've returned to the Imperial Capital
this time to receive honors?

291
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,710
I have served
in the army for exactly 40 years now.

292
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,960
Once I finish reporting my duties,

293
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,090
I'll retire and return to my hometown.

294
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,620
You've spent
your entire life in military service.

295
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,850
I deeply admire you.

296
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,360
But you should go to the Ministry of War.

297
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,790
Why have you come to my Ministry
of Military and Legal Affairs?

298
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,530
My Lord,

299
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,560
I heard the Ministry of Military
and Legal Affairs is upright and strict.

300
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,190
I've come to make
a petition to you, My Lord.

301
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,270
This time, I've also brought
some of my comrades with me.

302
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,750
I humbly request, My Lord,

303
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,550
that you allow them
to petition along with me.

304
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Very well, then please
have them come in together.

305
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,240
That won't be necessary, My Lord.

306
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,630
They are already here.

307
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,910
You also came from the military, My Lord.

308
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,690
I believe you're familiar with
some of the unwritten rules

309
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,660
in the military camps.

310
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,300
Before going into battle,

311
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,790
all soldiers would write their names

312
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,440
on their belts.

313
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,540
This way, even if they lost their heads

314
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,500
or their faces were mutilated,

315
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,030
they could still
be identified by this belt

316
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,859
and find their way home.

317
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,220
We'd know whose child they were.

318
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,190
This one is Lu Jia.

319
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,420
He was fairer than most girls.

320
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,950
He was often teased because of this.

321
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,340
But on the battlefield,
he was fiercer than anyone.

322
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,400
Before he died, he lunged forward

323
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,810
and killed an enemy soldier with
the very blade that had pierced his chest.

324
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,700
This one is my old buddy.

325
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,900
He also guarded
Yuanzhou for over 20 years.

326
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,320
The two of us buried a jar of wine

327
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,950
behind the military camp.

328
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,480
We promised that when we retired,

329
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,610
we'd have a hearty drink together.

330
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,960
But now,

331
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,370
they can't come anymore.

332
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,800
I can only bring them here

333
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,930
in this manner.

334
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,560
As men, it's our duty to protect
our homes and defend our country.

335
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,790
From the moment
each of us entered the military,

336
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,440
we were prepared to be
wrapped in horsehide upon death.

337
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Over all these years,

338
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,120
I've watched soldiers in the camp

339
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,890
fall one by one,

340
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,320
and new batches come to fill their places.

341
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,520
Wayun City has also changed its appearance

342
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,520
through numerous battles.

343
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,840
But in my heart,

344
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,590
I've never been shaken.

345
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,440
The repair work in Wayun

346
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,090
is now proceeding normally.

347
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,020
The Lord Chieftain
has also provided compensation

348
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,480
to the families of the soldiers.

349
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,610
The clan will not mistreat any soldier,

350
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,580
whether they are alive
or have sacrificed themselves.

351
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,570
Yes.

352
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,500
When we heard the news,

353
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,580
we were

354
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,550
as happy as a festival.

355
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,590
But as days went by,

356
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,500
we started to worry and fear.

357
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,840
What are you afraid of?

358
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,300
We fear that
before Wayun is fully repaired,

359
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,550
the people's spirits will collapse first.

360
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,970
My Lord, on behalf of

361
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,660
the soldiers who lost
their lives for Wayun City

362
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,240
and the civilians who still live there,

363
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,730
I humbly request that you go and see

364
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,440
what Wayun City

365
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,100
has become now, My Lord.

366
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:01,720
My Lord.

367
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,250
I am willing to go to Wayun
to conduct an investigation.

368
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,050
Please rise, Captain.

369
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,600
Rest assured, Captain.

370
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,470
In a few days,

371
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,750
the meeting of all commanders
of the Imperial Capital.

372
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,960
The Wayun issue needs to be resolved

373
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,620
openly and justly.

374
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,470
Vice Commander Lin Bing.

375
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,880
How are things in Wayun now?

376
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,740
From the front view of Wayun,

377
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,730
the North Clan's
Southwest Camp is very calm.

378
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,110
This is due to
the rebellion within Yuanzhou,

379
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,670
which has further intensified.

380
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,000
The leader of Yuanzhou, the King of Light,

381
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,750
is leading the Yuanzhou people
in resisting the North Clan's rule.

382
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,720
Therefore, the North Clan's
frontline combat troops

383
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,540
have been withdrawn
to suppress the rebellion.

384
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,300
Do you know which tribe

385
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,790
is the King of Light from?

386
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,800
There is no definite news yet.

387
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,370
Since the Yuanzhou rebellion,

388
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,800
the North Clan
has been our biggest headache.

389
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,950
But the appearance of the King of Light

390
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,050
is actually very beneficial to us.

391
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,640
Go investigate

392
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,590
and find out the truth.

393
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,110
Yes.

394
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,140
Ming Hui.

395
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,880
Present.

396
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,930
How are things in the west now?

397
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,760
At the northwestern border,

398
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,480
the Liufeng family's combat troops

399
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,880
have ceased their frequent provocations.

400
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,000
This is closely related
to the Liufeng family's internal turmoil,

401
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,400
which is closely linked.

402
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,580
My Lord.

403
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,550
I believe Commander Ming Hui's
speculation is correct.

404
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,640
According to reports
from my spies in the Liufeng family,

405
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,270
after Liufeng Ming's rebellion,

406
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,110
Liufeng Xishan quickly took over

407
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,770
the Liufeng family's regime.

408
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,000
It will take some time
to clean up the aftermath.

409
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,840
The Liufeng family's

410
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,590
civil unrest has not subsided,

411
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,230
and its political
situation remains unstable.

412
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,680
Ming Hui, how shall we proceed?

413
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,070
I believe,

414
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,080
we should seize this rare opportunity

415
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,860
to destroy
the Liufeng family in one strike

416
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,510
and advance the Zichuan family's ambition

417
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,160
to unify the Xichuan Continent.

418
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,890
Eliminate the Liufeng family?

419
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,130
Everyone, what are your thoughts?

420
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,400
My Lord.

421
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,580
Now

422
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,130
it’s a good time
to attack the Liufeng family.

423
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,270
but we need to consider
various aspects comprehensively.

424
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,270
In terms of military and logistics,

425
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,040
long-term planning
and preparation are needed.

426
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,000
Si Yilin.

427
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,880
Present.

428
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,940
Do you have confidence
in fighting the Liufeng family?

429
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,850
From a purely military perspective,

430
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,470
it depends on how much
the Liufeng family's internal turmoil

431
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,070
has depleted their forces,

432
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,430
and how our troops have recovered.

433
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,950
As things stand now,

434
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,510
the two armies
are quite evenly matched, but...

435
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,600
I strongly oppose.

436
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,750
Lord Si Yilin.

437
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,440
In recent years, as to the number
of troops our clan has lost,

438
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,500
you should have
detailed statistics, right?

439
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,960
I haven't done detailed statistics,

440
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,310
If you need it...

441
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,330
-No need.
-I can...

442
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,730
I can give
an approximate number right now.

443
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,920
In 781, our family enjoyed

444
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,320
a period of good fortune.

445
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,630
Although we were defeated

446
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,270
by Liufeng Shuang in the west,

447
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,240
we won victories in Yuanzhou.

448
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,640
By the end of the year,

449
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,790
the number of soldiers
injured was about thirty thousand,

450
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,190
which can be considered normal attrition.

451
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,850
At the beginning of 783,

452
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,480
Lord Di Lin was very active in Yuanzhou,

453
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,210
winning successive victories.

454
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,110
But I estimate that there must have been

455
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,350
fifty to sixty thousand casualties, right?

456
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,200
Next,

457
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,510
during the suppression
of Yang Minghua's rebellion,

458
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,200
the casualties among the military
and civilians in the Imperial Capital

459
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,260
were at least another 10,000 people.

460
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,550
Lord Di Lin, do you have any objections?

461
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,860
In the rebellion in Yuanzhou,

462
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,110
Lei Hong rebelled.

463
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,270
The damage of the garrisons,

464
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,510
the devastating defeat at Chishuitan,

465
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,440
resulted in a total of
230,000 military casualties.

466
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,480
Then, the North Clan's sudden attack.

467
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,880
The casualty data
for this period is very chaotic,

468
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,680
but the overall casualties

469
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,960
was empty.

470
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,230
The military losses reached 400,000.

471
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,440
Lord Ge, this isn't my...

472
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,350
Lord Si Yilin,

473
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,300
in the heroic resistance
against the North Clan in Payi,

474
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,900
with nearly
110,000 troops before the battle,

475
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,870
less than 50,000 returned to Wayun.

476
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,720
The information is now mostly complete.

477
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:32,960
In total...

478
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,350
I'd like to make a statement.

479
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,160
This is based on the most
conservative data available.

480
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,050
There may be many things
I haven't noticed,

481
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,310
possibly overlooked.

482
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,200
770,000.

483
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,960
My Lords, 770,000.

484
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,480
For you, My Lords,

485
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,780
soldiers and troops

486
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,500
may only be a number,

487
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,270
But soldiers and troops
don't appear out of thin air.

488
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,790
Every soldier

489
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,380
were raised by their parents.

490
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,600
From a crying baby

491
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,260
to a grown man,

492
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,440
it takes at least 20 years.

493
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,550
The time and resources
spent are incalculable.

494
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,960
Men in their prime,
who should be the main workforce,

495
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,160
are being drafted
into the army in large numbers,

496
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,830
consumed on the battlefield.

497
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,000
This greatly reduces

498
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,050
the production capacity of other sectors,

499
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,110
leading to a shortage
of daily necessities,

500
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,030
soaring prices,
and rampant black market trading.

501
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,940
Our economy is shrinking.

502
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,000
If we need to deal with the crisis now,

503
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,710
by tightening
our belts for a short period,

504
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,640
I believe the people can endure it.

505
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,450
But if it's for the vain glory
of dominating the world,

506
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,440
waging war recklessly without purpose,

507
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,880
imposing military expenses and taxes on

508
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,400
the overburdened people...

509
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,790
Regarding the issue of military expenses,

510
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,110
I believe if it's beneficial for Zichuan,

511
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,110
then the people will surely support it.

512
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,480
That's because
you're deceiving the people,

513
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,350
saying that all disasters

514
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,270
are caused by foreign invasions.

515
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,740
Should war erupt,

516
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,610
it will lead to continuous strife

517
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,220
and heavy casualties.

518
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,170
We will all become sinners.

519
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,580
By then,

520
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,080
what should we tell the people?

521
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,240
How many more 770,000 able-bodied men

522
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,200
can the clan afford to sacrifice?

523
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,280
Lord Chieftain,

524
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,890
they are all our flesh and blood.

525
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,630
Are you finished?

526
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,750
Let's adjourn the meeting for now.

527
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,240
Everyone, take a break.

528
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,340
The waiting time is so long.

529
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,110
The meeting hasn't resumed yet.

530
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,990
Big Brother, I actually think

531
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,040
what Lord Ge Shan said

532
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,200
makes sense.

533
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,770
Even if she has ten thousand reasons,

534
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,270
she shouldn't have said it like that.

535
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,400
After all, the person
who wants to fight this war the most

536
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,360
is Lord Chieftain.

537
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,210
Because after the defeat in Yuanzhou,

538
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,440
he naturally hopes
that future history books will record

539
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,840
that Chieftain Canxing,

540
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,880
after a small setback in Yuanzhou,

541
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,160
completely annihilated

542
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,830
the Liufeng clan,
Zichuan's century-old enemy.

543
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,030
What a great achievement that would be!

544
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,610
That's why he's in such a hurry

545
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,340
to recall Ming Hui and Lin Bing.

546
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,170
It shows he's made up his mind.

547
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,300
But Ge Shan is being insensitive.

548
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,270
What about you? Do you want to fight?

549
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:08,000
Me? If I'm told to fight, I'll fight.

550
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:13,350
But as Lord Ge Shan said, it's true that

551
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,200
if we attack rashly,

552
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,900
we might end up in a lose-lose
situation with the Liufeng family.

553
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,700
If the North Clan attacks again,

554
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,900
it's not worth it.

555
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,000
What about you, Big Brother?

556
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,080
To be honest, Ge Shan
is thinking about people's livelihood,

557
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,330
while I'm thinking about
Zichuan's long-term development.

558
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,390
Within five years,

559
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,420
if we don't annihilate the Liufeng family,

560
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,020
Zichuan will surely perish.

561
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,240
What do you mean?

562
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,510
Is it strange?

563
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,640
Before the battle of Yuanzhou,

564
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,770
we were on par with the Liufeng family.

565
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,320
But after we lost Yuanzhou,

566
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,670
as time goes by,

567
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,960
our clan's strength will gradually
fall behind the Liufeng family.

568
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,020
Within five years,

569
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,830
they will have outpaced us.

570
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,220
But it hasn't been long since our defeat,

571
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,240
we don't have enough troops.

572
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,310
If you're worried
about the source of troops,

573
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,500
I have an idea.

574
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,040
Before we continue the meeting,

575
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,450
I have an announcement to make.

576
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,240
Zichuan Ning will
participate in clan affairs.

577
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,550
Today is her first time attending

578
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,680
the clan's decision-making meeting.

579
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,680
She has grown up.

580
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,250
She can participate in clan affairs

581
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,850
and share the clan's burdens.

582
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,760
I don't want her to start in the army.

583
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,880
She'll go to the Ministry of War and
the Ministry of Government Supervision.

584
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,350
Luo Minghai, Ge Shan.

585
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,530
Yes, My Lord.

586
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,890
Ning will work under you from now on.

587
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,670
If she does anything wrong,

588
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,040
you can criticize and help her.

589
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,400
Yes.

590
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,240
Lord Commander-in-Chief, Lord Ge Shan,

591
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,370
please guide me.

592
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,750
Princess Ning is extremely intelligent.

593
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,640
Our Ministry of War has gained another

594
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
pillar of talent.

595
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,270
Ning, take a seat.

596
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,200
Alright, let's continue our meeting.

597
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,010
Lord Chieftain, I have two proposals.

598
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,680
First,

599
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,030
we can focus our next recruitment

600
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,440
on the refugees from Yuanzhou.

601
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,250
This proposal is excellent.

602
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,240
After Yuanzhou
submitted to the North Clan,

603
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,640
Wayun gained millions of displaced people.

604
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,000
This has caused significant hidden dangers

605
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,660
to the local social security.

606
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,240
Moreover, every month

607
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,980
we have to spend a large amount of money

608
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,190
to provide them with subsidies and food.

609
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,990
That's right.

610
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,400
If we conscript the young
and able-bodied among these refugees

611
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,680
into the army,

612
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,720
one soldier

613
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,540
can support a family of three.

614
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,800
Even if we only recruit

615
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,620
400,000 people from the million refugees,

616
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,580
it's equivalent to

617
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,380
supporting 1.2 million people.

618
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,830
Moreover, from my experience,

619
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,750
these refugees have lost their homes

620
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,400
and harbor only hatred for the North Clan.

621
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,660
With a bit of training,

622
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,720
they can become a company

623
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,790
of fearless and invincible warriors.

624
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,840
Si Yilin is watching the whole situation.

625
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,330
He's very thoughtful.

626
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,620
It's clear he's put
a lot of thought into this.

627
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,950
Ge Shan, what's your opinion?

628
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,830
It's a good idea,

629
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,230
but forming an army
from a large number of refugees

630
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,790
would require
at least a year or more of training.

631
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,030
If we launch an attack
on the Liufeng family

632
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,350
in a year and a half,

633
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,750
I will raise no objections.

634
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,000
My second proposal

635
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,760
should alleviate Lord Ge Shan's concerns.

636
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,930
It's not that
the Zichuan family lacks soldiers,

637
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,670
but that the soldiers
are not under our command.

638
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,730
Then tell us, whose hands are they in?

639
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,440
According to our investigation,

640
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,820
among the the Three Central Offices,
23 advisors hold

641
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,940
have private soldiers,

642
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,100
300,000 in total.

643
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,450
Is this information accurate?

644
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,400
It can be basically confirmed.

645
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,320
If we incorporate these private armies

646
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,570
into our regular forces,

647
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,690
we can definitely engage
in battle with the Liufeng family.

648
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,900
My Lord, as far as I know,

649
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,680
in the agreement between our clan
and the Three Central Offices,

650
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,810
it's clearly stated

651
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,160
that nobles are not allowed to raise
private armies exceeding 3,000 men.

652
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,090
Without a doubt,

653
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,390
these advisors
have already violated the law.

654
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,070
If this is true,

655
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,560
according to the clan law,

656
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,730
they can be charged with treason...

657
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,710
Wait a moment, Uncle.

658
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,810
Lord Chieftain,

659
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,270
My Lords.

660
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,110
Excuse me.

661
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,170
But before you make a decision,

662
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,100
may I say a few words?

663
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,010
Of course.

664
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,310
As Lord Di Lin has said,

665
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,410
these advisors
have indeed violated the law.

666
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,960
However, the law stating that nobles

667
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,880
cannot have armies exceeding 3,000 men

668
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,270
is over 200 years old.

669
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,720
If Lord Di Lin hadn't reminded us,

670
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,270
even I would have forgotten about it.

671
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,140
These advisors

672
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,430
may not be rebellious.

673
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,690
So I humbly request, Lord Chieftain,

674
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,790
to give these erring advisors a chance.

675
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,270
If they are willing
to hand over their military authority,

676
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,720
we could refrain from
pursuing the matter further.

677
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,440
This would also demonstrate

678
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,840
our clan's magnanimity.

679
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,860
What if they refuse
to hand over their military authority?

680
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,000
If they refuse,

681
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,240
then we can hand the matter
over to the Three Central Offices

682
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,920
for them to make a judgment.

683
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,630
23 nobles in the Three Central Offices

684
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,030
are only a small fraction.

685
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,240
I believe it won't affect

686
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,240
the Three Central Offices'
ability to make a fair judgment.

687
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,310
Moreover, couldn't we also

688
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,720
offer some appropriate
compensation to the advisors?

689
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,530
Or,

690
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,850
we will use the military

691
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,470
to "purchasing troops".

692
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,110
This might be more acceptable to them.

693
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,240
Princess Ning has thought this
through very thoroughly.

694
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,530
I am truly impressed.

695
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,110
My Lord.

696
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,620
I failed to supervise this matter.

697
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,750
My Lord, please entrust this matter to me.

698
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,610
I can make amends for my mistakes.

699
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:51,000
It's understandable

700
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,810
for a reason.

701
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,380
Given the situation,

702
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,890
we shall proceed to

703
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,330
recruit troops from among the refugees.

704
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,500
Di Lin can simultaneously

705
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:14,340
investigate the Three Central Offices'
unauthorized private armies.

706
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,739
Once our forces are recruited and trained,

707
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:20,790
we will launch
an assault on the Liufeng family.

708
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,530
Big Brother.

709
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,150
If you didn't have two solutions,

710
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,360
I don't know how long

711
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,690
this meeting would have been deadlocked.

712
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,920
But if you already had ideas,

713
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,480
why didn't you speak up
yourself instead of making me say it?

714
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,840
If this military suggestion

715
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,170
had been proposed by me,

716
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,100
Lord Chieftain
would certainly have been wary,

717
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,960
and Luo Minghai
would have obstructed it further.

718
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,320
But with you proposing it,

719
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,330
it becomes a natural course of action.

720
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,330
No one can object.

721
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:50,889
Firstly,

722
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,219
we can mobilize troops
to attack the Liufeng family.

723
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:55,280
Secondly, I can regain the authority

724
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,280
to investigate the Three Central Offices.

725
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,360
So you've been wanting to investigate
the Three Central Offices for a while.

726
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,610
After the meeting ended,

727
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,740
I sent Ge Qing to Wayun to investigate.

728
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,550
What does this have to do with Wayun?

729
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,110
Because previously, a Captain from Wayun

730
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,110
came to see me.

731
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,920
Yes, Tu Wa knows.

732
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,070
The situation he described is indeed true.

733
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,470
If that's the case,
why wasn't it reported?

734
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,960
Though the construction
of the Wayun Fortress has been slow,

735
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,440
there are no major flaws.

736
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,070
This matter will be
followed up by the Three Central Offices.

737
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,920
Though I command all of Yuanzhou,

738
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,380
I no longer have
the authority to interfere.

739
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,170
So before the meeting,

740
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,300
you already wanted to investigate
the Three Central Offices.

741
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,230
That's correct.

742
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,070
Because of the Yang Minghua incident,
Lord Chieftain

743
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,030
utilized the power
of the Three Central Offices.

744
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,960
Since then,

745
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,920
the Three Central Offices have
essentially returned to court power.

746
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,740
When jurisdiction
over Yuanzhou was handed over,

747
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,880
the Three Central Offices
suffered heavy losses.

748
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,960
They now harbor great resentment
toward the Lord Chieftain.

749
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,870
Now, after the charity banquet,

750
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,070
they are likely to use

751
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,310
in the name of renovation

752
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,550
for personal gains.

753
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,320
They'll abuse various
privileges and act recklessly.

754
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,930
Lord Chieftain can't
say much about it either.

755
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,660
So restraining the Three Central Offices

756
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,790
was also Lord Chieftain's intention.

757
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,670
I'm just going with
the flow by doing this.

758
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,880
What I want is to regain
the authority to investigate.

759
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,080
Chief.

760
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,280
Chief,

761
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,520
are you feeling unwell?

762
00:36:59,510 --> 00:36:59,920
Yes.

763
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:04,210
I don't feel well.
My whole body feels uncomfortable.

764
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,400
You're sick?

765
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,870
What on earth is Lu Di up to?

766
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,480
So it's because of Lu Di.

767
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,040
He hasn't been harassing us lately.

768
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,250
That's why you're feeling
unwell all over, My Lord.

769
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,890
Yes, no wonder
I feel uncomfortable all over.

770
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,030
It's because I haven't
fought Lu Di for too long.

771
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,960
Lu Di is conserving his strength.

772
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,490
He doesn't have the energy to fight us.

773
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,150
Our military strength is insufficient.

774
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,800
And the quality and ability
of our individual soldiers

775
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,280
are far behind theirs.

776
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,500
We can't take the initiative to attack.

777
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,470
We need to think of a good plan.

778
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,900
To make them come and attack us first.

779
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:38,770
During this period,

780
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,980
Emperor Lu didn't attack Bulu Village.

781
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,090
But he has been harassing

782
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,360
in other cities.

783
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,800
The map, bring it out quickly.

784
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,140
Hurry, bring it out.

785
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:52,920
Turn it over.

786
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,050
Harassing the surrounding areas.

787
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,440
It seems he wants to surround

788
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,300
the administrative areas
we previously captured.

789
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,960
This idea is not bad.

790
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,310
But this way,
the supply routes will increase.

791
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,030
The consumption will increase.

792
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,070
So

793
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,030
they will run out of food soon.

794
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,630
I know what to do now.

795
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,460
Hurry.

796
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,230
Go get Ze and Li Nong here.

797
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,410
Alright.

798
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,730
Don't move.

799
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,570
I thought we were fighting Lu Di.

800
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,840
Why did the Chief ask us two

801
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,190
to come here and dig holes?

802
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,850
This is called well drilling.

803
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,400
Isn't this for irrigation?

804
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,370
What does this
have to do with fighting Lu Di?

805
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,490
Don't ask anymore.

806
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,150
We do as Lord Xiu says.

807
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,090
How dare you push me!

808
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,150
Get to work.

809
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,300
My Lord,

810
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,400
the King of Light is sending
people everywhere to dig wells.

811
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,260
Digging wells?

812
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,640
Mark them for me.

813
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,450
Hurry up.

814
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,510
Here, and here.

815
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,920
This is to divert water
for irrigation and develop agriculture.

816
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,180
They're putting down roots completely.

817
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,710
This King of Light is short-sighted.

818
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,470
Once I form an encirclement,

819
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,370
I'll surely capture him in one fell swoop.

820
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,400
There are dozens

821
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,480
of paths

822
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,710
around Bulu Village.

823
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,380
And this is our granary.

824
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,590
So,

825
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,710
how can we avoid the scouts of Lu Di

826
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,510
and successfully transport the grain

827
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,510
from our granary?

828
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,710
You two, tell me your plans.

829
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,350
My Lord, you are the commander.

830
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,440
Isn't it natural for a commander

831
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,550
to listen to reports from subordinates?

832
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,280
Now, around our Bulu Village,

833
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,590
Lu Di's scouts must be everywhere.

834
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,080
But they can't handle our many routes.

835
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,550
If we transport
on ten routes simultaneously,

836
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,080
who can tell which is which?

837
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,250
I think it's feasible.

838
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,250
But Lu Di has always been suspicious.

839
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,910
This smokescreen needs
to be done beautifully.

840
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,550
Let's do it this way then.

841
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,760
The granary is our lifeline.

842
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,400
So you must be very careful.

843
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,070
You absolutely cannot
let Lu Di's people discover it.

844
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,010
Understood?

845
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,360
This is all the information

846
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,840
I've got.

847
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,960
Please make your decision, My Lord.

848
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,590
My Lord,

849
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,670
the enemy has dispatched
over a dozen grain transport vehicles.

850
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,670
They are heading in different directions.

851
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,930
This must be to confuse our perspective,

852
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,630
making it difficult for us to distinguish

853
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,320
which route actually leads to the granary.

854
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,550
In my opinion,

855
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,960
we should send out
more than ten groups of our forces.

856
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,500
We'd rather exhaust ourselves

857
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,880
than let it slip by.

858
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,110
No hurry.

859
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,880
Send someone to keep investigating.

860
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:12,300
Report to me if there is any news.

861
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,760
My Lord, you are indeed
brilliant in your calculations.

862
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,300
Those dozen or so
grain transport teams they sent out during the day

863
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,960
must have been a smokescreen.

864
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,670
The real grain carts
moved out secretly at night.

865
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,470
Those were the real grain carts.

866
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,880
To think that the King of Light

867
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,650
was digging wells
and springs just a few days ago.

868
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,730
Little did he know

869
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,470
that

870
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,920
we will set a fire in the backyard.

871
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,150
My Lord, what should we do next?

872
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,240
Yes!

873
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,190
My Lord.

874
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:19,840
My Lord!

875
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:21,800
My Lord.

876
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,590
My Lord!

877
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,750
Baichuan, what are you doing?

878
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,760
Why are you covered with a white cloth?

879
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,090
I thought you were dead.

880
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,670
Yuanzhou is so dry,

881
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,810
after staying here for a few days,

882
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,230
my face is like a desert.

883
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,070
This is my self-invented
face hydration method.

884
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,530
Why don't you give it a try?

885
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,310
News from the front line says

886
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,480
Lu Di has already
led his troops to follow Luo Jie

887
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,440
towards the direction of the granary.

888
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,920
My Lord, we should
depart as soon as possible.

889
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,440
No rush, no rush.

890
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,150
Baichuan, I'm not criticizing you, but

891
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,280
as a young lady,

892
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,540
you should take better care of yourself.

893
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,860
Lack of hydration
can easily cause wrinkles

894
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,510
and premature aging.

895
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,850
Fortunately, we dug wells in advance,

896
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,760
so now we have an abundant water supply.

897
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,800
Zichuan Xiu,

898
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,760
military matters cannot be delayed.

899
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,780
If you continue like this,

900
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,310
don't blame me for insubordination.

901
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,850
Don't.

902
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,800
Don't be in such a hurry.

903
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,700
Look, lack of water

904
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,110
can also easily lead to irritability.

905
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,480
Look at Lu Di's hot temper,

906
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,740
it's obvious he's severely dehydrated.

907
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,370
Marching through the night in Yuanzhou,

908
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
many soldiers

909
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,280
probably haven't even
had a chance to wash their faces.

910
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,190
When you give a rose,
your hands retain the fragrance.

911
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,450
Since we've dug wells,

912
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,440
we should take care
of our neighboring state

913
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,400
and fulfill our duties as hosts, right?
