00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,810
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,990
[Si's Mansion]

4
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,180
Apply the medicine
according to the prescription.

5
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,240
Change it twice a day.

6
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,890
When will he wake up?

7
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,650
The wound nearly reached
his liver and spleen.

8
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,810
He's lucky to be alive.

9
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,500
As for when he'll wake up,
it's up to fate.

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,680
I see.

11
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,020
When Si Yilin wakes up,

12
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,430
let me know immediately.

13
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,960
Okay.

14
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,470
The assassins have been captured
by the Ministry of War.

15
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,329
I'll go back first
to prepare for tomorrow's trial.

16
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,860
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,190
Let me ask you, how is Si Yilin?

18
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,160
He's still unconscious.

19
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,480
Don't worry, My Lord.

20
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,170
He'll live.

21
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,840
Those two people

22
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,890
dared to attack
a Zichuan general in broad daylight.

23
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,910
Such blatant lawlessness

24
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,710
must be severely punished without mercy.

25
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,190
Let Di Lin handle the trial.

26
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,920
He'll give a fair judgment.

27
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,100
It's almost time, right?

28
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,829
The water's about to overflow.

29
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,640
When the bubbles are like fish eyes
and faintly audible,

30
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,900
that's the first boil.

31
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,680
When they rise
like a string of pearls by the rim,

32
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,829
that's the second.

33
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,960
It's not the time yet.

34
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,090
Only at the third boil will the flavor

35
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,800
truly infuse into the brew.

36
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,870
By then, what everyone remembers

37
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,710
is the taste of the tea.

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,120
No one will care about who sold it

39
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,560
or where it came from.

40
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,870
Then how do we reach that third boil?

41
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,020
As long as we
don't extinguish the fire underneath,

42
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,240
we don't need to worry
the tea won't be fully brewed.

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,240
But Chieftain...

44
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,600
I think if Lord Chieftain

45
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,230
really wants to take action,

46
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,310
after Lord Ge Shan was injured,

47
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,350
those people won't have a chance.

48
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,360
Si Yilin has followed
Lord Chieftain for years.

49
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,800
They look like father and son,

50
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,630
but in fact... they are not that close.

51
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,190
Compared to us,

52
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,310
of course Lord Chieftain

53
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,100
is closer to Si Yilin.

54
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,430
But compared to the clan's stability...

55
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,560
Gentlemen, the tea is ready.

56
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,280
Si Yilin is my subordinate,

57
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,520
but he is also my family.

58
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,070
If Si Yilin knows Lord Chieftain

59
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,600
came to see him personally,

60
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,040
he'd be deeply moved.

61
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,170
Thank you
for taking care of him these days.

62
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,650
When he wakes up,

63
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,080
let me know immediately.

64
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay.

65
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,120
Stop.

66
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,600
I smell some fragrance.

67
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,680
Fragrance?

68
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,880
Help!

69
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,480
Stop.

70
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,430
You're saying Luo Jie rescued a carriage

71
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,490
of women from Jialai District
from the North Clan?

72
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,290
That's right.

73
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,580
He ran into one of them who had escaped,

74
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,190
and rescued all of them.

75
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,990
How do they look?

76
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,040
They are quite attractive.

77
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,270
Are they all married?

78
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,510
What does that have to do with you?

79
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,240
It has everything to do with me.

80
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,510
Baichuan.

81
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,630
Yes.

82
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,310
From now on, those women

83
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,480
shall be placed
under top-level protection.

84
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,570
You shall

85
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,060
personally oversee everything.

86
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,000
Before we arrive in Jialai District,

87
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,720
I want them to be glowing

88
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,950
and plump.

89
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,800
Send them back to Jialai District?

90
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,870
That's right. We leave tomorrow.

91
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,830
Tell everyone:

92
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,800
all men

93
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,860
should stay away from that carriage.

94
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,770
Is Lord Xiu
really interested in those women?

95
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,510
They are not just ordinary women.

96
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,900
They're a gift from Heaven—
a key to open Jialai's gates.

97
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,039
It's really Jialai.

98
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,320
We're home.

99
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,720
Come. Be careful.

100
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,480
Yeah.

101
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,710
This scene

102
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,960
makes me want to recite a poem.

103
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,020
Be careful.

104
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,120
The savior of Jialai.

105
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,270
Chief had a point.

106
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,960
Control the inner desire,

107
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,760
and you'll control
the hearts of Jialai's people.

108
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,180
I heard

109
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,260
Jialai's governor

110
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,200
is a young beauty.

111
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,760
Are you sure?

112
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,520
I'm Commander Hu Cheng of Jialai.

113
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,450
I express gratitude to you
on behalf of the governor.

114
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
You're too polite, General.

115
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,550
It's a heroic tale

116
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,680
that we risked our lives

117
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,730
to save those women

118
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,630
from the enemy,

119
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,440
but for the sake of justice,

120
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,320
the Yuanzhou Alliance Army
should still be responsible.

121
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,000
Since the governor heard
that you traveled so far

122
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,320
to return the women,

123
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,510
she's been unable to sleep every day.

124
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,990
And she's been thinking
of your kindness every day.

125
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,060
Thanks to King of Light this time,

126
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,600
Jialai...

127
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,470
will face a calamity.

128
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,280
What?

129
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,650
Take them down!

130
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,050
What's going on? What's wrong?

131
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,050
We rescued them! How is that wrong?

132
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,090
Rescuing people isn't wrong,

133
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,890
but we rescued the wrong people.

134
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,150
Those women were probably sent

135
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,550
as gifts for them.

136
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,460
Well, General,

137
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,750
I surrender.

138
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,290
You ungrateful bastards!

139
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,000
I should have hijacked

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
all those women!

141
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,830
Then you'd have no gifts to give!

142
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,370
I think I can unlock this.

143
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,650
With what? Everything's gone.

144
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,610
Try poking it with this.

145
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,700
That's going to take forever.

146
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,000
Chief, what should we do?

147
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,320
What else can we do? Sleep.

148
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,830
The governor

149
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,850
wants to interrogate King of Light.

150
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,400
-He's here for you.
-He's here for you.

151
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,570
Who's here for me?

152
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,680
This is Jialai's specialty,
the ox blood tea.

153
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,040
[Jialai's governor: Pang Xiya]

154
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,500
It's specially for honored guests.

155
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,160
It indeed tastes good.

156
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,330
It has

157
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,630
a primitive flavor of raw meat and blood.

158
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,000
This is our first meeting,

159
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,390
and you drank the ox blood tea so calmly.

160
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,200
King of Light is indeed
no ordinary person.

161
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
I'm flattered.

162
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,580
You invited me to drink tea

163
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,790
in your room on our first meeting.

164
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,910
Jialai's governor
is no ordinary person as well.

165
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,960
My name is Pang Xiya.

166
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,550
My name is King of Light.

167
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:28,980
You can also call me

168
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,460
Light, King, or Light King.

169
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,600
King of Light
never reveals his true identity.

170
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,890
Always so mysterious.

171
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,390
But I respect you.

172
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,010
You are the only female governor.

173
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,550
And you're imposing. I admire you.

174
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,710
I guess being invited for tea
right after you set foot in Jialai

175
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,830
must make King of Light

176
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,720
a bit nervous.

177
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,020
And I guess

178
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,740
those women were gifts for Lu Di.

179
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,810
Unexpectedly, I intercepted them

180
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,630
and returned them openly.

181
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,960
Lu Di must think

182
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,270
Jialai has sided

183
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,130
with the Yuanzhou Alliance Army.

184
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,490
Now you must be

185
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,980
more nervous than me.

186
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,070
If I give you to Lu Di,

187
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,340
I'll surely be rewarded.
Why should I be nervous?

188
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,960
The North Clan

189
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,840
has been defeated repeatedly

190
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,570
by the Yuanzhou Alliance Army.

191
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,330
You're afraid of offending Lu Di,

192
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,270
and also afraid of taking the wrong side.

193
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,330
You invited me to your room

194
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,270
at this hour for tea.

195
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,740
I guess you already have a plan

196
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,580
although you're flustered.

197
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,820
King of Light, you're indeed
clever and perceptive.

198
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,440
Then I'll be straightforward.

199
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,830
Jialai District can be
on friendly terms with the Alliance Army.

200
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,630
We can even pledge allegiance.

201
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,630
I sense a "but" coming.

202
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,550
That's right.

203
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,970
But you have to marry me.

204
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,490
I'm a lazy man.

205
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,480
And I like to bully my subordinates.

206
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,150
I often deduct their salaries.

207
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,830
I'll take care of everything at home.

208
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,690
And your subordinates' salaries—

209
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,510
Jialai will double them.

210
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,400
I love drinking,

211
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,150
especially at pleasure houses.

212
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,110
I might not come home for 10 or 15 days.

213
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,370
Jialai has many women,

214
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,670
more than anything else.

215
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,600
If you like,

216
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,630
you can have 8 or 10 each night.

217
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,550
I promise you won't
see the same face twice in a month.

218
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,320
I have two subordinates.

219
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,600
One is knowledgeable,
and the other is skilled in martial arts.

220
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,360
The knowledgeable one
knows every military text in history.

221
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,440
The other one can take on 10 men at once.

222
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,360
It has to be you.

223
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,390
I don't really want to do this either.

224
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,050
It's just that every city
that can supply water to Jialai

225
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,790
is under control of the North Clan.

226
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,600
If I can't trust you completely,

227
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,020
I really can't

228
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,100
break off with the North Clan.

229
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,830
I can provide water too.

230
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,150
Then how are you
any different from the North Clan?

231
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,350
If you don't marry me,

232
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,860
Jialai can't stand by

233
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,750
the Alliance Army without worry.

234
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,160
Before you arrived,

235
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,150
I'd already considered every outcome.

236
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,630
The best case:

237
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,510
you fall for me

238
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,330
and propose marriage yourself.

239
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,060
The middle ground:

240
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,320
we admire each other

241
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,750
and have a marriage of convenience.

242
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
As for the worst case...

243
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,190
Is it to kill me and give me

244
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,360
to Lu Di to beg for forgiveness?

245
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,380
I'll give you one day to think it over.

246
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,180
Come on. Bottoms up.

247
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,850
Our governor is indeed awesome.

248
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,070
She's made King of Light fall for her.

249
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,330
Of course.

250
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,670
Come on. Drink.

251
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,150
Chief,

252
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,750
I think

253
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,270
you might as well just marry her.

254
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,360
You won't lose out.

255
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,450
If you really can't do it, let me.

256
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,550
Instead of talking nonsense,

257
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,150
you should save your energy.

258
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,760
My Lord, please come up with a solution.

259
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,000
Have you ever heard of a saying—

260
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,310
"Fortune favors the virtuous"?

261
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,870
Chief, did you dig that with your eyes?

262
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,200
With your head?

263
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,890
What Chief meant

264
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,420
is that brain is a handy thing.

265
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,020
Remember to use it next time.

266
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,000
Come on. Let's go.

267
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,180
Lord Xiu had this all planned
from the start.

268
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,600
You guys escorted the women to Jialai.

269
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,370
I followed you secretly with a team.

270
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,830
Even if anything went wrong,

271
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,240
Lord Xiu had the terrain maps ready.

272
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,840
I'd dig a tunnel to save you.

273
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,770
Thankfully,
Xiu took precautions in advance.

274
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,520
Otherwise,

275
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,960
he would have to marry the governor.

276
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,490
Let's go.

277
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,600
The governor is quite good-looking.

278
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,720
She's just a bit old.

279
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,080
Good-looking? Her hair's all split ends.

280
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,510
Her skin is dull and not glowing at all.

281
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,840
She must have stayed up too late.

282
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,390
You're right.

283
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,960
Who are we?

284
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,670
The Xiu... Pretty and attractive.

285
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,470
A perfect match.

286
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,619
Brave and resourceful governor,

287
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,200
if any of us could marry you,

288
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,109
it would be a blessing

289
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,109
for the Yuanzhou Alliance Army.

290
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,740
My dignity has been hurt.

291
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,690
A few days ago,

292
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,610
Lord Ge Shan
of the Ministry of Government Supervision

293
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,240
and Lord Si Yilin, the commander
of the Palace Guards,

294
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,570
were both attacked.

295
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,370
Lord Ge Shan was slightly injured,

296
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,740
while Lord Si Yilin was severely wounded.

297
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,010
The assassins were captured on the spot.

298
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,590
They will stand trial today, in public.

299
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,160
Bring in the prisoners!

300
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,670
-Heroes!
-Heroes!

301
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,590
-Heroes!
-Heroes!

302
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:22,680
-Heroes!
-Heroes!

303
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,640
Ding Cheng, the evidence against you
for attempted assassination is conclusive.

304
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,440
Do you have anything else to say?

305
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,390
During the attack on Ge Shan,

306
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
we accidentally killed a coachman.

307
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,330
He was around 30 years old.

308
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,000
Surely he had a wife and children.

309
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,960
I know the pain of losing

310
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,110
someone you love.

311
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,160
So I'm willing to take full responsibility

312
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,150
for his death.

313
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,310
As for Lord Si Yilin,

314
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,220
he once led us through blood and fire.

315
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,880
I'm very sorry

316
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,240
that I had to harm him.

317
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,840
But I don't regret it.

318
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,720
Very well.

319
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,180
Ding Cheng, the culprit,
and Chang Li, an accomplice—

320
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,740
you are guilty of treason and murder.

321
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,070
According to Zichuan's law,
I sentence you to death.

322
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,890
You'll be executed in three days.

323
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,270
I object!

324
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,510
Wayun has stood
as Imperial Capital's shield

325
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,920
for centuries.

326
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,350
Every son and daughter of Wayun
on the battlefield

327
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,890
disregarded life and death!

328
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,680
But what have we received in return?

329
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,440
We've received

330
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,510
weak armies and miserable people!

331
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,480
We lost

332
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,160
the 23 districts in Yuanzhou!

333
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,790
But Imperial Capital is still crawling

334
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,380
with greedy and corrupt officials!

335
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,210
That's right!

336
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,340
Someone has to shed blood
to wake the world.

337
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,550
Someone has to clear the way
for Zichuan's future.

338
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,410
We are willing to be those people.

339
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,750
Even if we die, we die for a worthy cause!

340
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,830
-Die without regrets!
-Die without regrets!

341
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,600
-Die without regrets!
-Die without regrets!

342
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,330
-Die without regrets!
-Die without regrets!

343
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,180
My Lord!

344
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,100
This is a petition
signed by 10,000 citizens

345
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,260
from Wayun and Imperial Capital.

346
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,510
They're warriors who have fought bravely

347
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,000
for the clan.

348
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,270
They deserve a special pardon!

349
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:22,270
-Pardon!
-Pardon!

350
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,160
You're awake. Do you feel any discomfort?

351
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,190
What about the two who attacked me?

352
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,640
They are still on trial.

353
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,560
Have they been sentenced?

354
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,790
Not yet.

355
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,240
But just now, Wen He sent a message.

356
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,400
A petition signed

357
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,070
by 10,000 citizens has been delivered,

358
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,640
pleading for their pardon.

359
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,440
Given your current condition,
you can't go there.

360
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,590
If there's something you want to say,

361
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,540
you can write it down,
and I'll deliver it for you.

362
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,230
I have to go myself.

363
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,790
My Lord,

364
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,120
someone at the trial submitted a petition

365
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,650
signed by 10,000 citizens,

366
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,170
requesting clemency for the two assassins.

367
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,410
I see.

368
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,700
Looks like you had anticipated this.

369
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,810
How dare you!

370
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,540
You two

371
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,550
are guilty of treason and murder!

372
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,200
And you've incited the public!

373
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,350
Your crimes are even more heinous!

374
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,480
According to Zichuan's law,
you shall hang yourselves!

375
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,920
Execute immediately!

376
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,480
You're all in this together!

377
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,750
If you won't release them,
we'll save them ourselves!

378
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,900
-Save them!
-Save them!

379
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,340
-Save them!
-Save them!

380
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,970
Anyone who obstructs the law

381
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,470
will be punished as an accomplice!

382
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,960
-Release them!
-Release them!

383
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,720
Let me go!

384
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,830
Let me go!

385
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,590
I'm not guilty!

386
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,110
-Release them!
-Release them!

387
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,830
Let go! Let go of me!

388
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,160
Wait!

389
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,890
-Release them!
-Release them!

390
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,790
Di Lin.

391
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,590
What are you doing here?

392
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,920
I have something to say.

393
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,260
Please give me a moment.

394
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
As the plaintiff in this case,

395
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,430
I want to withdraw the charges

396
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,480
and request leniency.

397
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,960
I am the commander of the Palace Guards.

398
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,310
My soldiers love and trust me,

399
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,000
but I failed to lead them

400
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,000
to bring victory back to Zichuan.

401
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,990
That is my dereliction of duty.

402
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,040
I bear the responsibility.

403
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,270
I failed to maintain order in Zichuan,

404
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,510
causing Lord Ge's injuries.

405
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,590
And I made the people want to rebel!

406
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,220
That is my negligence!

407
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,350
Therefore,

408
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,740
I'll take responsibility for their crimes.

409
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:35,450
I deserved that stab.

410
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,750
But it doesn't mean I forgive you.

411
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,480
Nor does it mean you're not at fault.

412
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,880
I just want you to understand

413
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,900
you can't escape
the consequences of defeat.

414
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,350
I know you're disappointed in Zichuan.

415
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,310
You want Zichuan

416
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,680
to be a fair and strong clan.

417
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,330
But with the North Clan still a threat,

418
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,170
you can't turn your blades

419
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,700
against your own people.

420
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,070
If you really think

421
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,970
that my death

422
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,810
can solve this problem,

423
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,560
I'm willing to sacrifice myself.

424
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,860
Warriors.

425
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,080
Brothers!

426
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,920
You all have shed blood for this clan.

427
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,070
So what is this clan?

428
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,790
It's your home!

429
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,800
A home

430
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,510
will never abandon its people.

431
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,960
Nor will it ever abandon its lands!

432
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,020
Eventually,

433
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,460
you will have

434
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,600
the respect and dignity

435
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,000
you deserve.

436
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
-Well said!
-Well said!

437
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,600
That's right!

438
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,390
Well said!

439
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,270
That's right!

440
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,420
Well said!

441
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,350
Well said!

442
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,340
Di Lin.

443
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,730
The law is the law.
Crimes must be punished.

444
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,330
But Di Lin,

445
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,990
this is our own problem.

446
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,710
But justice can be tempered with mercy!

447
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,330
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

448
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,200
Release them!

449
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,400
Release them now!

450
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,550
Release them!

451
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,830
Release them now!

452
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,650
Justice tempered with mercy

453
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,880
is the very spirit of law.

454
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,440
They did something wrong,

455
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,550
but they did it for a reason.

456
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,440
And Si Yilin has withdrawn the charges,

457
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,550
requesting clemency.

458
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,960
As for the compensation
and the restoration of Wayun,

459
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:15,300
the clan will give you an explanation.

460
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,930
-Long live the chieftain!
-Long live the chieftain!

461
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,530
Lord Ge.

462
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,440
Lord Si Yilin,

463
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,120
there's something I'd like to say to you.

464
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,630
A kind heart can't tame wolves.

465
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,450
I had no choice. I'm a soldier.

466
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,310
Foolish one.

467
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,690
My Lord, you were put
in a difficult position today.

468
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,830
Lord Chieftain's presence made you

469
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,040
a villain who punished the heroes.

470
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,550
Our chieftain, Lord Canxing,

471
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,790
sees clearer than anyone.

472
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,350
He's the one
who asked me to handle the case.

473
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,130
He's also the one
who asked me to release them.

474
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,400
Thus,

475
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,630
the Three Central Offices
will no longer act recklessly.

476
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,750
I've become the heartless one
in the people's eyes,

477
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,210
while he has won the people's hearts

478
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,490
and saved his dignity.

479
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,680
The law can be bent

480
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,330
due to his words.

481
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,640
Fairness and justice

482
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,290
are not as important as political balance.

483
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,110
Our Lord Chieftain

484
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,260
has placed everyone over the fire,

485
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,990
while he stays untouched.

486
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,570
Lord Chieftain,

487
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,530
the refugee crisis
spiraled out of control.

488
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,350
Everyone has been punished.

489
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,010
As their commander,

490
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,790
I should accept severer punishment.

491
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,590
Indeed, you should be punished.

492
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,140
I accept the punishment.

493
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,570
Do you know why you should be punished?

494
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,170
Not because you did something wrong,

495
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,090
but because we need to give
an explanation to the people.

496
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,400
You'll be suspended.

497
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,640
Someone else will handle the affairs

498
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,100
at the Ministry of Government Supervision.

499
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,550
We can't attack the Liufeng family now.

500
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,290
When there are too many refugees,
they'll become vagrants.

501
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,470
Once vagrants become bandits,

502
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,310
the world will fall into chaos.

503
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,690
Everything you said before was correct.

504
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,840
Thank you, Lord Chieftain.

505
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,060
Our priority now

506
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,740
is to comfort the refugees.

507
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,240
I understand.

508
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Then I'll take my leave.

509
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,720
Okay.

510
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,400
Lord Chieftain,

511
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,950
I thank you on behalf of the people.

512
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,810
Safe journey.

513
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,920
Doctor, how is my father?

514
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,560
This is a case of atrophy.

515
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,790
His limbs are weak and feeble,

516
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,440
unable to be used for now.

517
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,960
My prescription

518
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,680
can only delay the decline.

519
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,380
If it worsens to the point
where he can't speak,

520
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,290
there'll be nothing we can do.

521
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,580
Is there really...

522
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,150
Is there really no other way?

523
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,190
As long as you can cure my father,

524
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,110
the Liufeng family
will reward you handsomely.

525
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,240
Doctor, please figure something out.

526
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Help her.

527
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,590
I do have an ancient prescription.

528
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,440
But it's said
it's hard to find the medicine.

529
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,680
Even if you find it,

530
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,110
I'm not sure if I can cure him or not.

531
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,130
No matter what,

532
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,690
I'm willing to give it a try.

533
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,260
The peak of the mountain,
the horn of the dragon.

534
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,200
Where heaven and earth bleed,
swallows return home.

535
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,400
What does that mean?

536
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,780
Doctor, thank you for your guidance.

537
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,270
What did he mean?

538
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,790
What he meant is

539
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,750
the medicine is in the far east.

540
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,450
The prescription is written on the paper.

541
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,550
It depends on you whether you can get it.

542
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,310
Now that I know the general direction,

543
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,550
I'll go find it myself.

544
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,550
I'll go with you.

545
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,000
You're an elder of the Lin family.

546
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,930
I can't waste any more of your time.

547
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,890
When I come back with the medicine,

548
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,290
I'll thank you properly.

549
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,680
It's a promise then.

550
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,510
A promise.

551
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,660
They say a wise man
submits to circumstances.

552
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,350
In my opinion,

553
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,200
King of Light, you're the wisest of all.

554
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,770
They also say the prettier a woman is,

555
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,300
the sharper her mind is.

556
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,120
Governor, you are also impressive.

557
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,410
Aren't we a perfect match then?

558
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,050
No.

559
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,060
The more alike two people are,

560
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,920
the more likely they are

561
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,440
to clash.

562
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,440
So,

563
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,480
you don't like any of these robes?

564
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,690
They're too flashy.

565
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,460
They don't match my style.

566
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,460
I'm

567
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,830
a low-profile and extravagant person.

568
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,310
Why don't we hear

569
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,070
what your subordinates think?

570
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,150
They've followed you for so long.

571
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,719
They must know your preferences well.

572
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,040
I think the first one is good—

573
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,570
noble and elegant.

574
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,460
This is not about which one is good.

575
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,320
In my opinion, they're all great.

576
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,920
It's like they're tailored for him.

577
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,310
My Lord, choose whatever you like.

578
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,639
I'm not afraid of death!

579
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,469
But I know you definitely won't do that.

580
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,239
Shut up.

581
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,850
One more word

582
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,210
and I'll walk out naked!

583
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,340
That sounds good too. I like that.

584
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:48,270
No. I think the first one is good.

585
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,670
My Lord!

586
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,690
Water's seeping into the dungeon!

587
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,540
My Lord, after so many years with you,

588
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,630
I'm truly reluctant to part from you.

589
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,660
But at the thought

590
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,550
that you're finally going
to be someone else's trouble,

591
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,320
I'm somewhat relieved.

592
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,480
I bade you farewell by the river.

593
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,630
You're already married when you return.

594
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,960
I never expected

595
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,910
that Lord Xiu is getting married.

596
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,860
I didn't expect it either.

597
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,840
All these years,

598
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:39,960
I always thought

599
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,290
you were too heartless for love to matter.

600
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,360
I never expected you
to have such a relationship.

601
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,620
I'm so frustrated.

602
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,110
How did I suddenly

603
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,440
become such a crybaby?

604
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,050
Chief.

605
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,580
I hope in the future, when you get drunk,

606
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,140
someone will take you home.

607
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,230
When you earn money,

608
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,360
don't hand it all over.

609
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,110
Keep some for yourself.

610
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,330
I can't bear to part from you.

611
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,400
I can't go on.

612
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,530
Well, why are you crying?

613
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,200
Stop crying.

614
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,090
Chief!

615
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,440
Is the Xiu Battalion

616
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,730
going to break up just like this?

617
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,920
I'm so sad.

618
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:55,720
Don't be sad.

619
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,710
I'm sad too. I'm heartbroken.

620
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,890
I never thought I, the Flower of Yuanzhou,

621
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:01,890
would now...

622
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,770
King of Light!

623
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,970
Did you dig the tunnel?

624
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,970
Why did you choose that location?

625
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,030
I did it to save Chief.

626
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,360
The earth near the underground river
is soft. It's easy to dig.

627
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,700
There really is
an underground river beneath Jialai?

628
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,960
You've solved the water source problem?

629
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,310
We've been under the control
of the North Clan

630
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,500
because of the water shortage.

631
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,710
Can you find another location
to drill for water?

632
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,480
He's my subordinate.

633
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,920
I'll answer your question.

634
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,630
Xiya, I...

635
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,440
Call me Governor.

636
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,920
We're not that close.

637
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,510
It shouldn't be a problem.

638
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,850
That's great.

639
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,460
If we can break free from their control

640
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,930
over the water source,

641
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,280
my people

642
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,340
will no longer be at the mercy of them.

643
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,870
Jialai's independence
will be within reach.

644
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,160
Come on, get up.

645
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,800
Stop crying. Sit.

646
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,000
If Li Nong solves

647
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,590
the water source issue,

648
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,200
does that mean
we don't have to get married?

649
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,120
With water, who'd still want you?

650
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,480
Wake up.

651
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,210
I suddenly feel a bit upset.

652
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,550
It's like I bought a rope to hang myself,

653
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,350
but suddenly,

654
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,460
the rope broke.

655
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,960
Still, you helped Jialai find the key

656
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,520
to breaking free from their control.

657
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,270
It's credited to you.

658
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,200
So, if Li Nong stays

659
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,490
to help you solve the water source issue,

660
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,650
does that mean
the Yuanzhou Alliance Army and Jialai

661
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,350
have reached an agreement?

662
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:58,850
Of course.

663
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,190
Good. It's a pleasure working with you.

664
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,460
Come on.

665
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,360
Hello. Don't be afraid.

666
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,990
I just want to ask

667
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,710
if you know what this note

668
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,840
means.

669
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,390
I don't know.

670
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,030
Are you from the North Clan
or the Alliance Army?

671
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,130
Don't talk to the people riding horses.

672
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,120
If we run into the North Clan's men,

673
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,180
we'll be arrested.

674
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,750
Sister,

675
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,010
go ask Elder Budan at the sacred temple.

676
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,210
He knows everything.

677
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,320
Hurry, let's go.

678
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,640
Okay, thank you.

679
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,930
I, Lin Yu, request an audience
with Elder Budan.

680
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,620
Are you from the west?

681
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,510
Yes.

682
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,300
He's been waiting for you.

683
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,810
The peak of the mountain,
the horn of the dragon.

684
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,060
Where heaven and earth bleed,
swallows return home.

685
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,620
Let me ask you a question.

686
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,070
Go ahead.

687
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,700
To cure your father,

688
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,540
would you harm innocent people?

689
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,210
Of course not.

690
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,650
My father has taught me since childhood

691
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,900
that villains must be punished,

692
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,540
but the innocent must never be harmed.

693
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,000
Now I can answer your question.

694
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,800
Many people know the meaning

695
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,760
of this note,

696
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,510
including me.

697
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,690
But those who can decipher

698
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,550
the positive meaning of this note

699
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,400
might only mislead you.

700
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:34,880
Mislead?

701
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,480
You are a kind person.

702
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,610
Among Ke City, Jialai,

703
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,030
and Pingyang District,

704
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,630
there are a few mountain passes

705
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,760
with lax management.

706
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,290
Smuggling of forbidden items
happens there.

707
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,580
There,

708
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,500
you may find clues to what you seek.

709
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,810
Thank you. I'll set out immediately.

710
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,550
Elder,

711
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,790
this could harm the Dragon Race.

712
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,920
Why did you still guide her?

713
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,340
This is fate.

714
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,960
She will walk towards the light.

715
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,670
I've compiled

716
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,030
the water distribution
and redirection methods near Jialai.

717
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,070
I put them into a booklet
with illustrations.

718
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,730
Please take a look, Governor.

719
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,010
Have a seat.

720
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:53,980
Sit!

721
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,590
It's clear, detailed,
and easy to understand.

722
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,930
Let's get to the main point.

723
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,230
Most of the districts in Yuanzhou

724
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,760
are under the control of the North Clan.

725
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,400
It's not just a matter
of weak military strength.

726
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,550
The main reason is

727
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,170
they don't have sufficient resources.

728
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:16,100
If we could share the technology
of water sourcing and irrigation

729
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,300
across Yuanzhou,

730
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,490
maybe we could
help them change their fate.

731
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,700
But promoting it
to so many districts one by one

732
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,510
would take too much time.

733
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,710
So, I want to host a banquet

734
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,070
in Jialai.

735
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:31,590
We'll invite the envoys

736
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,990
not under the control of the North Clan

737
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,680
to learn the technology here.

738
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,220
We can also take this opportunity

739
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,970
to unite all of Yuanzhou.

740
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,790
It's an excellent idea.

741
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,300
Water is essential.

742
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,350
Now that the water source issue
can be solved,

743
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:53,950
I believe no one would say no.

744
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:54,720
Yeah.

745
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,460
But...
since you'll host a banquet in Jialai,

746
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,000
it wouldn't be too much if I charge you

747
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,360
some venue fees, right?

748
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,750
You really don't make any deal at a loss.

749
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,520
But I like that.

750
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,000
In that case,

751
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,060
I'll charge you some tuition fees too.

752
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,370
In my name,

753
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:21,610
send invitations to the districts.

754
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,550
Jialai will host a banquet.

755
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:34,640
Good.

756
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:49,760
Good.
