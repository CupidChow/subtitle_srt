00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,729
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,120
Xiu.

4
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,230
Oops, I mean the King of Light.

5
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,440
Since the battle
to defend the sacred temple,

6
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,570
the name of the King of Light

7
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,360
has spread throughout Yuanzhou.

8
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,400
Recently, people from Yuanzhou
joining our Alliance Army

9
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,470
have been arriving in endless streams.

10
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,840
Though Bulu Village
has expanded its borders

11
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,070
and fortified its walls,

12
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,200
I still can't accommodate all of them.

13
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,940
Bulu Village is really becoming Bulu City.

14
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,240
Luo Jie and I are leading
the Xiu Battalion

15
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,590
to train new recruits from Yuanzhou.

16
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,430
The leaders of various races

17
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,870
have also joined the training team.

18
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,960
We're managing so far, but

19
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,560
while having a large army is good,

20
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,400
our current food supplies
are insufficient.

21
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,000
As the number of soldiers increases,
our food is dwindling.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,190
I'm afraid we can't sustain this for long.

23
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,360
Yes, we're now stationed in Bulu Village,

24
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,560
which is very safe,

25
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,520
but the surrounding land

26
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,030
is still controlled by the North Clan.

27
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,030
If we don't find a solution quickly,

28
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,720
we really won't be able
to hold on much longer.

29
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,910
What's wrong with you?

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,150
We're talking about serious matters here.

31
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,730
Why do you keep making those sounds?

32
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,930
Can you stop using only interjections?

33
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,030
Well...

34
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,320
I can't take this anymore.

35
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,870
I actually have a good idea.

36
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,990
Who are you?

37
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,870
Why do you always make him
play along with you?

38
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,870
Aren't you bored?

39
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,430
If I weren't bored,

40
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,360
would Bulu Village have
so many strong soldiers and horses

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,320
gathered here?

42
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,710
I'm also very familiar with this routine.

43
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,400
Recently, Lord Xiu has been
appearing everywhere

44
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,590
as the King of Light,

45
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,120
recruiting people from Yuanzhou
to join us.

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,780
Half of those times,
it was me filling in for him.

47
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,870
My substitution

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,079
was seamless.

49
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,520
I'm simply excellent
in both civil and military affairs.

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,190
Good.

51
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,120
What's the use of
recruiting so many soldiers?

52
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,079
The most important thing right now is

53
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,960
to ensure we have enough medicine
to treat the wounded,

54
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,630
and then to obtain more food

55
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,230
to support
the entire Yuanzhou Alliance Army.

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,800
Have you forgotten?

57
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,710
De Lun,

58
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,470
please update Baichuan

59
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,310
on the latest situation
of the Wealth Building Hall.

60
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,970
Since we reorganized
the Wealth Building Hall,

61
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,150
taking advantage of the war,
we've regrouped Yuanzhou's

62
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,610
merchants, big and small.

63
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,750
As of now,

64
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,470
our assets have already reached

65
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,270
five times the amount when it was

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,860
first founded.

67
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,560
Even with all that money,

68
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,720
the land near Bulu Village is still

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,240
occupied by the North Clan.

70
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,480
Trade routes remain blocked.

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,120
Surely you're not planning
to buy grain from Lu Di?

72
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
That's right.

73
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,910
If we can't buy grain from the North Clan,

74
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,430
we can buy it from Zichuan.

75
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,450
So I've decided to return to Zichuan

76
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,360
to procure grain at the Imperial Capital.

77
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,310
Are you tired of living?

78
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,240
You're wanted in the Imperial Capital.

79
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,390
Are you seriously going back just to die?

80
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,800
Yes, what will we do if you leave?

81
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,720
You should know that
without the King of Light,

82
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,000
Lu Di will surely come to cause trouble.

83
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,950
As for me, you don't need to worry.

84
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,159
As for Lu Di...

85
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,340
Can't you just come here directly?

86
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,330
King of Light will keep guarding
Bulu Village.

87
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,430
[Ge Shan, Commander of
the Ministry of Government Supervision]

88
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,560
Since Di Lin has taken
a leave of absence recently,

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,480
the investigation into the dereliction
of duty in the capital patrol case,

90
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,510
the prison break
of five inmates from Huan City,

91
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,360
the corruption case
in the Ministry of Provisions, and others

92
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,620
have all been stalled.

93
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,270
The deadline for pending trials
has already passed.

94
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,920
If these cases, which have been
delayed for over a month,

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,560
are not addressed soon,

96
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,620
they will hold up the progress

97
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,150
of other ministries' work.

98
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,570
My Lord, Lord Ge speaks the truth.

99
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,040
The Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs
is currently leaderless,

100
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,510
to the extent that some appointments
and dismissals in the Ministry of War

101
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,070
are also affected as a result.

102
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,040
Why don't you remind Di Lin?

103
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,310
Di Lin's mansion is currently
closed to visitors.

104
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,190
The Ministry of Government Supervision
sent a warning letter there before.

105
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,390
It was delivered to the doorstep.

106
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,830
However, half a month later,

107
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,430
that letter was still there.

108
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,100
Reminders and urges
are no longer effective.

109
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,040
In my view,
this offense warrants punishment.

110
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,450
Lord Di Lin and his wife
are deeply in love.

111
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,120
Their current grief over
losing their child is understandable.

112
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,020
However, as Lord Ge said,

113
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,560
the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs
upholds Zichuan's laws and order

114
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,630
and bears the responsibility
of supervision and vigilance.

115
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,630
In such a critical time, we must not
relax our efforts.

116
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,780
What do you think should be done?

117
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,800
The Ministry of War
is not short of military talents.

118
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,770
Supervising the training drills
of the Military Inspection Team

119
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,100
should not be a problem.

120
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,920
I am willing to offer
what little strength I have

121
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,780
to help ease Lord Di Lin's burden.

122
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,000
Commander Luo,

123
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,050
you are usually occupied with paperwork.

124
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,860
If you take on the role
of Military Inspection Team captain,

125
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,840
I'm afraid you might neglect
one duty or the other.

126
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,280
Di Lin has been on leave for several days.

127
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,520
He should return to court soon.

128
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,580
There's no need for
Commander Luo to worry about it.

129
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,680
Lord Si Yilin is on good terms
with Di Lin.

130
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,810
Even he cannot specify
the exact time of Di Lin's return.

131
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,770
If Lord Di Lin cannot recover,

132
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,870
it would jeopardize
the important duties of the Ministry.

133
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,800
Who should bear the consequences?

134
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,150
Lord Luo makes a valid point.

135
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,070
Di Lin indeed needs time to recuperate,

136
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,060
but the affairs of the Ministry
should not be delayed for too long.

137
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,680
Si Yilin is getting married soon.

138
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,500
He's busy with trivial matters.

139
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,310
It's not suitable for him
to take over Di Lin's duties.

140
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,570
Let's temporarily hand over
the Military Inspection Team

141
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,750
to Commander-in-Chief Luo for management.

142
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:24,950
Yes.

143
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,120
My Lord, forgive my incompetence.

144
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,549
Speak.

145
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,559
The people we sent to take over
the Military Inspection Team

146
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,679
were driven out.

147
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,380
Those guys in the Military Inspection Team

148
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,080
are nothing but a bunch of thugs.

149
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,510
They don't follow any orders

150
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,720
except those from Di Lin.

151
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,120
Since Di Lin took control of the
Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs,

152
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,550
it has developed rapidly
and established a strong foundation.

153
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,480
The army is extremely formidable.

154
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,670
Lord Chieftain surely
wouldn't have expected

155
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,240
that such a sharp blade

156
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,020
would one day recognize a new master.

157
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,190
My Lord, Di Lin is currently
staying at home and not going out.

158
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,000
This is the best opportunity
to take over the Ministry.

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,260
If we miss this chance,

160
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,440
I fear that in the future, Di Lin

161
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,700
will truly become the next Yang Minghua.

162
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,120
I've spoken out of turn.

163
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,030
Rise.

164
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
The Ministry has become
Di Lin's personal domain.

165
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,440
That's correct.

166
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,200
But to replace him,

167
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,790
I'm not the one.

168
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,840
I already control the Ministry of War.

169
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,670
If I were to take control of the Ministry
of Military and Legal Affairs as well,

170
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,390
wouldn't others think that I

171
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,740
also want to become the next Yang Minghua?

172
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,840
Even the smallest tripod

173
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:49,270
needs three legs to stand steady,

174
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,410
how much more so does a clan.

175
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,670
My Lord, Lord Si Yilin has arrived.

176
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,150
Brother.

177
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,520
Big Brother.

178
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,700
It's about time you went out for a walk.

179
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,810
I need to stay home with Xiujia.

180
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,390
What's up? Any news about Xiu?

181
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,440
No.

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,200
Then why are you here?

183
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,220
It's like this.

184
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,470
Today, the Ministry of War attempted to
take over your ministry.

185
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,260
Did they succeed?

186
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,980
Of course they were rebuffed.

187
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,060
However, they proposed to the Chieftain

188
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,630
that the governance of the Ministry and
the Inspection Team be separated.

189
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,030
If Luo Minghai can really accomplish that,

190
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,750
I'll actually think more highly of him.

191
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,320
Xiujia, you're awake.

192
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,960
Si Yilin has arrived?

193
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,120
I didn't let him disturb you.

194
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,870
I wonder if there are bayberries

195
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,590
in season now.

196
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,100
As long as you want to eat them,
they'll definitely be available.

197
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,790
Wait, I'll go buy some for you.

198
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,420
My Lady,

199
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,570
you don't need to worry about
the rumors outside.

200
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,710
Lord Di Lin

201
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,720
will certainly not be transferred
from the Ministry.

202
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,390
No.

203
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,900
I absolutely cannot
let him bear this alone.

204
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,730
Xiujia, look.

205
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,970
Where's the madam?

206
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,450
She went to the shop.

207
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,240
Here's our signature seafood
fried noodles. Please enjoy, gentlemen.

208
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,770
Is there anything else you need?

209
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,840
A catty of braised beef
and a bottle of the finest Nüerhong wine.

210
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,750
Please wait a moment.

211
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,360
Lu, a catty of braised beef.

212
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,030
Alright.

213
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,960
I'll do it.

214
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,730
Thank you for your hard work.

215
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,560
Xiujia, thank you.

216
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,630
What are you thanking me for?

217
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,870
You're putting on a brave face
because you're afraid I'll get criticized.

218
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,330
How could I not understand
your intentions?

219
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,630
But your body hasn't fully recovered yet.

220
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,180
Why push yourself so hard for my sake?

221
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,410
Since you understand my intentions,

222
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,730
you must also know my determination.

223
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,200
I'll have to pull myself together
sooner or later.

224
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,910
Why not start now?

225
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,120
At this crucial moment,

226
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,650
I'll muster my strength
to get through this with you.

227
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,050
Then I'll do as you say, my dear.

228
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,440
If you find it too difficult,

229
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,290
don't push yourself too hard.

230
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,170
You've always been
a strong and decisive person.

231
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,050
If I were an ordinary woman,

232
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,870
fearful and avoiding hardship,

233
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,000
how could I be your wife?

234
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,270
Of course, if I were an ordinary woman,

235
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,110
I would have let you take a concubine

236
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,300
to continue your lineage long ago.

237
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,780
You're all I need.

238
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,550
Lord Chieftain, Lord Luo has arrived.

239
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,360
My Lord.

240
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,790
Lord Luo,

241
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,750
Di Lin has taken up his post today.

242
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,630
Did you know?

243
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,310
I did, but I still believe

244
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,490
the Ministry and the Inspection Team
should be governed separately.

245
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,910
I heard that when you went to
take over the Military Inspection Team,

246
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,740
you were rebuffed.

247
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:31,910
That's right.

248
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,960
It shows Di Lin's influence
runs deep in both the Ministry

249
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,360
and the Inspection Team.

250
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,870
However, the Military Inspection Team

251
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,860
should belong to Zichuan's forces,

252
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,620
not just Di Lin's men.

253
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,790
Today is the day of
the Inspection Team's drill, right?

254
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,720
Yes.

255
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,200
Then let's go take a look.

256
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,880
Outrageous!

257
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,820
How dare you behave
so recklessly before the Lord Chieftain!

258
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,880
Stop the training!

259
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,120
My Lord, we apologize
and ask for your punishment.

260
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,600
What is there to punish?

261
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,800
You've trained them well.

262
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,350
Their archery skills are impressive.

263
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,870
They even pierced the target.

264
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,480
I won't punish you.

265
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,319
And you shall not punish them later too.

266
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,210
Understood.

267
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,270
Please review the formation, My Lord.

268
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,920
Very well.

269
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,359
Though Di Lin has been away,

270
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,960
the training of the Inspection Team
has never been neglected.

271
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:27,750
Indeed.

272
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,310
Such an elite force is truly rare.

273
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,790
Di Lin, this is all your achievement.

274
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,600
I don't deserve such praise.

275
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,640
How is it?

276
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,640
Have you taken care of everything at home?

277
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,080
Everything has been taken care of.

278
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,840
There were rumors before

279
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,000
that the Military Inspection Team
sheltered bandits.

280
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,200
It seems those were baseless,

281
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,510
unfounded rumors.

282
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,270
With such well-trained troops,

283
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,310
I'm confident those rumors
will fade quickly.

284
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:01,920
Indeed.

285
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,550
However I believe that

286
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,300
delaying military affairs
is a serious mistake.

287
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,160
With so many eyes watching,
it can't go unpunished.

288
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,920
Lord Luo is right.

289
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,110
Please punish me.

290
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,400
The Military Inspection Team's strength

291
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,960
comes from Di Lin's dedication.

292
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,900
And Di Lin's revived spirit is also

293
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,990
thanks to Lord Luo's efforts.

294
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,920
I humbly do not claim that credit.

295
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,720
With both of you here
in the Imperial Capital,

296
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,330
I can finally feel at ease,

297
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,750
and the whole of Zichuan can be at peace.

298
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,850
As for punishment,
I think we can let it go.

299
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,030
If necessary,

300
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,160
dock a season's salary,

301
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,440
and pay respects at
the Holy Spirit Hall for a week.

302
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,300
Yes, My Lord.

303
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,720
Very well.

304
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,550
My Lord, your presence today
at the South Camp

305
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,460
has greatly lifted our brothers' morale.

306
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,590
It's good to have you back.

307
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,000
You've all worked hard.

308
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,920
It is our duty.

309
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,160
However, during your absence,

310
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,240
Luo Minghai tried repeatedly
to meddle in the Ministry's affairs.

311
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Now he's filed a complaint
to get you punished,

312
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,900
which is a clear provocation.

313
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,890
Luo Minghai has done
plenty of provocative things.

314
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,160
However, what the court fears most
are petty men.

315
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,680
Luo Minghai is not a petty man.

316
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,280
He just hates me, that's all.

317
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,240
Besides, taking care of
the Holy Spirit Hall

318
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
isn't a bad thing.

319
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,770
It's been a while
since I've been here anyway.

320
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,810
What's wrong?
Is there something you don't understand?

321
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,990
My Lord, I was thinking...

322
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,960
You keep giving in
to Luo Minghai like this.

323
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,680
Are you afraid that
his ambition to seize power

324
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,080
is actually what the Lord Chieftain wants?

325
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,840
Indeed, it is Lord Chieftain's intention.

326
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,620
Calling me back in such a hurry

327
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,420
isn't just about replacing me
with Luo Minghai.

328
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,170
What he wants is a balance of power.

329
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,200
Though Luo Minghai and I often

330
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,460
have verbal disputes,

331
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,750
I hold no personal grudge against him.

332
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,350
It's just that Luo Minghai's

333
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,200
talent lies in
assisting with court affairs,

334
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,360
not in leading troops as the
commander-in-chief of the Ministry of War.

335
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,680
So, based on what you're saying,

336
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,490
the ideal setup would be

337
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,200
for you to oversee the Ministry of War,

338
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,070
and for Luo Minghai to take over the
Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

339
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,870
That's right.

340
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,110
However, after the incident
with Yang Minghua,

341
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,270
Lord Chieftain won't appoint any

342
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,640
strong-willed person
to lead the Ministry of War anymore.

343
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,560
This might keep internal stability

344
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,140
and allow people
to live and work in peace,

345
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,940
but when external enemies come,

346
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,450
we'll face far greater challenges.

347
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,650
Then why don't you share your thoughts

348
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,850
with Lord Chieftain?

349
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,910
I believe,
for the greater good of Zichuan,

350
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,550
Lord Chieftain will surely understand

351
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,440
your good intentions.

352
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,880
This is not something
for you and me to consider.

353
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,470
Got it.

354
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,200
The dispute between Luo Minghai and me
is a small matter.

355
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,510
There are more important things

356
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,640
waiting for us to do.

357
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,510
By the way, during the days I was away,

358
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,660
is there any new information?

359
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,630
Yes, there is.

360
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,870
About a month ago,

361
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,900
a "King of Light" appeared in Yuanzhou.

362
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,240
He's now uniting various races there
to resist the North Clan's army.

363
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,900
A "King of Light" in Yuanzhou?

364
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,500
Yes.

365
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,540
Has his identity been confirmed?

366
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,490
Not yet.

367
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,700
Are the Three Central Offices
and Lord Chieftain aware of him?

368
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,960
They're still unaware.

369
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,270
Since the jurisdiction of Yuanzhou
was ceded,

370
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,880
our intelligence network
has been completely cut off.

371
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,010
Besides some spies from
our Ministry,

372
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,030
it's the intelligence network
you took from Xiao Long

373
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,200
at that time.

374
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,310
It has now been transformed
into the Seventh Ministry.

375
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,750
The Seventh Ministry
isn't fully established yet.

376
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,310
Yes.

377
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,830
Keep this matter confidential for now

378
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,410
and watch the King of Light's
movements closely.

379
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,140
Understood.

380
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,550
Why are you treating me like this?

381
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,830
One month's worth of homework
isn't that much.

382
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,550
I haven't even finished
looking through all of these yet.

383
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,070
What I mean is,

384
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,090
I won't check these assignments
until a month from now.

385
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,890
I hope you won't disappoint me
when the time comes.

386
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,650
So it turns out you're the one
trying to slack off.

387
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,850
This month,

388
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,520
I need to prepare for my wedding
with Lord Si Yilin.

389
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,800
What's wrong?

390
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,750
It's nothing.

391
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,960
I just suddenly feel

392
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,470
like everyone has grown up.

393
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,480
Should I grow up too?

394
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,510
I think I'm the only one

395
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,370
against your marriage to Li Qing.

396
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,480
Your Highness, isn't it too late

397
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,270
to oppose it now?

398
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,130
Isn't this decision

399
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,110
a bit too hasty?

400
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,760
I've thought it through.

401
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,170
If you marry Li Qing,

402
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,030
you'll end up hurting two people.

403
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,070
Don't you love Ka Dan anymore?

404
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,750
I do.

405
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,850
I love her deeply until death do us part.

406
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,800
Then why don't you wait for her?

407
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,240
Your Highness,

408
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,230
do you know?

409
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,930
You're lucky; at least you can wait.

410
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,710
But for us,

411
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,860
we may never

412
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,430
see each other again.

413
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:25,820
Yes.

414
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,920
No one can force me

415
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,580
to marry someone I don't like.

416
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,660
At least not yet.

417
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,510
Do you think I'm being naive?

418
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,640
Princess Ning,

419
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,750
in this world,

420
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,640
people can follow their hearts,

421
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:54,680
but some things are just
beyond our control.

422
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
So, do you have feelings for Li Qing?

423
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,060
I told you,

424
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,740
some things are beyond our control.

425
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,280
When people grow up,

426
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,710
people can only submit to
their surroundings,

427
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,850
doing things they don't want to do.

428
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,920
Li Qing said you didn't want to grow up.

429
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,070
The sadness you felt then…

430
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,870
Wasn't it half for Ka Dan

431
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,670
and half for Xiu?

432
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,790
Xiu loves you.

433
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,550
He wants to be with you,

434
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,770
but he feels he's not good enough for you.

435
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,340
This feeling of "not being good enough"
isn't about power,

436
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,290
nor is it about status.

437
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,600
It's that he feels
he doesn't have the ability

438
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,270
to protect you yet.

439
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:13,960
Ning,

440
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,400
it's time for us

441
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,890
to shoulder our own responsibilities

442
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,780
and fulfill our mission.

443
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,010
On the day of your wedding,

444
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,070
I'll come to drink the wedding wine.

445
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,270
Everyone must shoulder
their own responsibilities

446
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,850
and fulfill their mission.

447
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,720
It's a bit desolate,

448
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
but it's livable.

449
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,900
Black Tiger Gang?

450
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,440
A woman?

451
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,020
I just cleaned up this room.

452
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,290
They'd better not get in here.

453
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,570
If you must fight, do it outside!

454
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,280
It's spacious out there. Thanks.

455
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,500
Gentlemen, it's alright.

456
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,650
I'm just staying here for one night.

457
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,410
Just pretend I'm not here.

458
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,470
But I have to say something.

459
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,570
Isn't it a bit much

460
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,860
for a bunch of grown men

461
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,890
to be going after a little girl?

462
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,330
Look at my foul mouth. Carry on.

463
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,170
This girl's martial arts skills
are impressive.

464
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,170
Looks like she doesn't need my help.

465
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,200
She's surprisingly sharp

466
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,580
with that retreat-to-advance move.

467
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,330
Surround!

468
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,610
Kill!

469
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,560
Watch out!

470
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,680
You guys

471
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,780
are really crossing the line

472
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,360
using such dirty tricks.

473
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,090
This is getting troublesome.

474
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,910
You're forcing me to step in.

475
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,600
Can you still hold on?

476
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,550
It's a small matter. No problem.

477
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,920
You're not bad.

478
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,220
You're not bad too.

479
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,180
Brothers, retreat!

480
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,290
Let's go!

481
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,450
Your blade-catching technique just now

482
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,680
was quite ingenious.

483
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,140
We should spar sometime
if we get the chance.

484
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,000
Who are you?

485
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,720
I... You're repaying kindness with enmity!

486
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,480
Are you alright?

487
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,670
Are you alright?

488
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,450
It's raining heavily.

489
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,840
I'm not trying to take advantage of you.

490
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,020
This is the only way.

491
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,500
You're awake. Don't get any ideas.

492
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,660
I've stopped the bleeding for you.

493
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,640
The most severe wound
on your body right now

494
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,040
is on your back shoulder.

495
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,160
If you don't get timely treatment,

496
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,310
you might just...

497
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,160
You...

498
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,550
What are you doing?

499
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,350
I'm a gentleman.

500
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,290
If you want to repay me in this way,

501
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,500
I... I won't accept it.

502
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,920
Weren't you going to
put some medicine on me?

503
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,750
Hurry up then.

504
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,200
You...

505
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,790
You can praise my skin,

506
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,200
or even call my scapula beautiful.

507
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,250
But you don't have to tell me

508
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,350
how badly I'm hurt.

509
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,250
Alright, I'm going to start now.

510
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,940
Bear with it.

511
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:12,840
It's done.

512
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,760
You're tough. You can really endure pain.

513
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,730
Let me wrap it now.

514
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,060
You...

515
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,330
Hold the left side.

516
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,230
Give it to me.

517
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,350
Wrap it around once more. Hold it again.

518
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,070
It's done.

519
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,020
My cloak is soaked. I'll wear yours.

520
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,560
Mine?

521
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,130
No...

522
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,880
Wait.

523
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,760
Look.

524
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,650
My clothes are wet too.

525
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,510
Fine.

526
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,530
Guess I'll just be the good guy
till the end.

527
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,230
I'm done.

528
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,660
Thank you, Uncle.

529
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,030
"Uncle?"

530
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,000
Do I look like an uncle to you?

531
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,320
You look exactly like one.

532
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,800
If I had known you were so bad
at compliments,

533
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,260
I wouldn't have saved you.

534
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,750
Then what should I call you?

535
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:40,590
I am a wanderer who has
traveled far and wide,

536
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,190
the dashing and handsome Zhang Asan.

537
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,090
Uncle San.

538
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,040
Can't you just call me "Brother San?"

539
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,780
Stop pretending. Get up.

540
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:03,080
If you don't want to call me that,
you don't have to pretend to be asleep.

541
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:06,880
Miss.

542
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,840
Miss.

543
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:14,860
I'm sorry.

544
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,590
It's not good to put pressure
on your wound.

545
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,030
Get up.

546
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,590
You're a young lady.

547
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,230
Why were so many men in black
chasing after you?

548
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,690
You're lucky you ran into me.

549
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,930
I'm a good person.

550
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,060
So hot.

551
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,240
Miss, wake up.

552
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,530
Don't bother me. I want to sleep.

553
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,210
Take your medicine first.
Come on, drink it quickly.

554
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,060
Last sip.

555
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,390
Such a high fever. What should I do?

556
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,180
I have such a high fever. It's too cold.

557
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,780
If I catch a cold again,

558
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,920
not even immortals could save me.

559
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,560
I didn't expect you

560
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,190
to value your life this much.

561
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,370
Pervert!

562
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,840
You...

563
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,760
I slapped you for the sake of my dignity.

564
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,480
You slap me first thing in the morning

565
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,080
for the sake of your dignity?

566
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,000
You know very well

567
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,460
what happened last night.

568
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,740
Couldn't you just give me a break?

569
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,480
Give you a break?

570
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,130
If I hadn't seen you were
in such a bad state yesterday,

571
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,520
I wouldn't have bothered to hold back.

572
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,170
You...

573
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:37,830
Don't come any closer.

574
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,160
Your wound has healed now, right?

575
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,000
Looks like your fever has gone down too.

576
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,370
The wound on your back
should be fine as well, right?

577
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,800
Hungry?

578
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,400
No.

579
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,190
Not bad. Your body is quite honest.

580
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,000
Why don't you ask me what my name is?

581
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,550
My name is Lin Yu.

582
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,150
That's quite nice.

583
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,190
You were drenched in rain all night,

584
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,520
so you're called Lin Yu.

585
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,350
Miss Lin Yu,

586
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,970
how much do you owe others?

587
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,800
Why are so many people after you?

588
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,440
My father is a textile merchant
in the Imperial Capital.

589
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,770
Those people yesterday

590
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,320
were trying to kidnap me for ransom.

591
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,760
I shouldn't have asked this question.

592
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,540
Would the Black Tiger Gang

593
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,480
care about such things?

594
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,440
My father is no ordinary merchant.

595
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,910
Miss Lin Yu,

596
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,940
it's already dawn outside

597
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,430
and the rain has stopped.

598
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,240
But

599
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,870
you should be more careful in the future.

600
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,770
Thank you for your advice, my benefactor.

601
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,590
You're welcome.

602
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,200
So you do know I'm your benefactor.

603
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,990
Yet you treated me so rudely?

604
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,550
I woke up with a slap.

605
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,080
Well, you can slap me back.

606
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,600
A gentleman doesn't fight with a lady.

607
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,150
Since you've helped me so much,

608
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,010
how would you like me to repay you?

609
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,960
I, Li Awu, sleep under the sky
and rest upon the earth,

610
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,160
wandering the world's corners
to do good and help others.

611
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,630
To me,

612
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:10,510
saving your life is just
what I'm supposed to do.

613
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,230
How could I possibly ask for any reward?

614
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:19,070
How vulgar. How nice indeed.

615
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,800
Just a small gift.

616
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,690
Are you satisfied?

617
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,360
Sure.

618
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,960
Now that's how you treat a benefactor.

619
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,070
But you said

620
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:54,230
you called Zhang Asan last night.

621
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,480
Today, you've become Li Awu.

622
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,500
As for me,

623
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,860
in the morning, I'm called Li Awu,

624
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,450
at noon, I'm Wang Asi,

625
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,380
and by evening, I'm Zhang Asan.

626
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,270
To wander the martial world freely,

627
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,420
a name is just a name.

628
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,380
You can call me whatever you like.

629
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,280
For example, you could call me
Third Brother,

630
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:19,880
Third Master...

631
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:25,320
Or even Third Grandson, if you prefer.

632
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,920
Traveling the martial arts world
with military rations and animal hides,

633
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,340
your identity...

634
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:47,710
I don't mind telling you my identity.

635
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,540
In the morning, I really am Li Awu,

636
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,190
at noon, I really am Wang Asi,

637
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,530
and in the evening,
I really am Zhang Asan.

638
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,370
I'm not hungry at all.

639
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:45,920
So you eat like this too?

640
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:47,730
Is there a problem?

641
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,880
Would a rich lady

642
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,970
eat so roughly?

643
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,070
I'm just adapting to local customs.

644
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,870
There's nothing rough about it.

645
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,670
Besides, the taste isn't bad at all.

646
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,280
Yesterday,

647
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,850
I helped you

648
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,740
because you're just a young lady.

649
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,190
I didn't expect a young lady
from a wealthy family

650
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,250
to have such ordinary table manners.

651
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:25,590
I also didn't expect

652
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,270
you to be such a handsome guy,

653
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,770
just a bit naggy and long-winded,

654
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,530
and not a word of truth in what you say.

655
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,900
Likewise.

656
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,450
Actually, I'm the type

657
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,220
who's usually quite neat,

658
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,630
takes good care of myself,
and bathes every day.

659
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,700
It's just that I got caught
in the rain yesterday

660
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,550
and slipped into a puddle…

661
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:02,100
So I'm temporarily a bit disheveled.

662
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,350
You hide first.
