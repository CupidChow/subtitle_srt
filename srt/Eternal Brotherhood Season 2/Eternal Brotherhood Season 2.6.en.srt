[Eternal Brotherhood 2]

2
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,670
[Episode 6]

3
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,270
If you act so
recklessly again next time...

4
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,350
Can you at least think it through first?

5
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,810
Surrendering just to assassinate Lei Hong,

6
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,610
a garbage plan like that isn't worth
dying for, even with nine lives.

7
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,450
Honestly,

8
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,590
I never planned to come back alive.

9
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,400
Just for Lei Hong?

10
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,060
Is that really worth the risk?

11
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,150
It is.

12
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,650
Even if you can never return to Zichuan,

13
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,270
never go back to the Imperial Capital?

14
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,860
What, you feel wronged
following me around?

15
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,430
Not at all.

16
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,490
I actually kind of like being an outlaw.

17
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,800
Don't worry,

18
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,520
I won't let you be a bandit for long.

19
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,390
I won't.

20
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,760
I won't.

21
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,690
Friend,

22
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,580
since you're already here,

23
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,640
why not come in?

24
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,370
What are you waiting for? Go!

25
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,240
Zichuan Xiu!

26
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,360
Shaozi?

27
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,130
What, letting you go wasn't enough?

28
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,060
You really came back to finish me off?

29
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,000
Only by killing him

30
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,070
can we go home.

31
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,230
Baichuan.

32
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,750
Step forward.

33
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,360
Help me read this out.

34
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,290
It's fine. Read it.

35
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,150
Zichuan Xiu defected to the North Clan,

36
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,090
betraying the Zichuan family,

37
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,040
a disgrace of the highest order.

38
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,870
By the name of the seventh Chieftain,
I hereby declare:

39
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,480
Zichuan Xiu is stripped of all duties,

40
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,600
and his Zichuan name revoked.

41
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,800
Let it be known throughout the clan,
among all troops and civilians:

42
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,720
Lin He and his Xiu Battalion

43
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,240
are traitors to the Zichuan clan,

44
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,560
to be executed on sight.

45
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,210
Everyone, you can't return
to Wayun anymore.

46
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,920
Yes, sir.

47
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,800
They're hunting
Zichuan traitors everywhere.

48
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,400
We can't even enter the city.

49
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,630
Unless we bring your head back.

50
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,120
What did you say?

51
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,650
Traitor!

52
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,480
Betrayer!

53
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,040
Calm down!

54
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,800
You bastard!

55
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
You traitor!

56
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,270
Lord Xiu treated you well!

57
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,510
How can you say that?

58
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,640
Do you even have a conscience, Shaozi?

59
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,250
You think I wanted this?

60
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,810
I didn't have a choice.

61
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,600
So many died in this war.

62
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,230
I barely made it out alive.

63
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,070
I want to live.

64
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,040
Is it wrong to want to go home?

65
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,330
My mother is still
lying in bed waiting for me.

66
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Who doesn't want to go home?

67
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,560
Lord Xiu,

68
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,000
you trained me yourself.

69
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,680
Trying to kill you was wrong,

70
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,580
but this was my only shot at going home.

71
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,000
I had to try.

72
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,200
Now I can't go back either.

73
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,160
Please kill me.

74
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,040
I'll kill you right now!

75
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,270
Luo Jie! Calm down! He's just a kid!

76
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,310
Let them go.

77
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,190
Chief!

78
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,870
I said let them go.

79
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,480
Move.

80
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,710
Zichuan Xiu.

81
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,780
Today it's them trying to kill you,

82
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,680
tomorrow it'll be a thousand more,

83
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,799
ten thousand more.

84
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,220
I'll take care of myself.

85
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,090
Move.

86
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,390
Move aside.

87
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,510
Baichuan, untie them.

88
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,970
Shaozi, you three take care.

89
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,320
Foolish boy.

90
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,750
You're blind,
yet you're standing by the pond.

91
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,550
Aren't you afraid of falling in?

92
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,340
If I fall, some people would be thrilled.

93
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,770
At first,

94
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,320
I thought I could explain everything.

95
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,160
But now, there's no explaining it.

96
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,480
Not because of whether I'm a traitor,

97
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,540
but because they no longer want me.

98
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,320
Your Highness, the Lord
is attending to official business.

99
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,480
You may not go in.

100
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,830
My Lord.

101
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,800
Please, have a seat.

102
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,870
Lord Di Lin,

103
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,240
they say the Ministry of Military
and Legal Affairs's eyes

104
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,370
are everywhere in Xichuan Continent.

105
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,510
If I were you,

106
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,120
I'd mobilize every resource

107
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,390
to uncover the truth.

108
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,810
But Yuanzhou

109
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
is no longer under Zichuan control.

110
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,960
How can we investigate the truth?

111
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,470
You were the first to know

112
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,000
that Xiu and Si Yilin
were trapped in Payi.

113
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,910
When I was in Yuanzhou, you were

114
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,240
the one who sent word to Sunset Valley.

115
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,170
I know you have agents in Yuanzhou.

116
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,910
But the intel they sent back

117
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,240
matches the captured soldiers' testimony.

118
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,270
They all say Xiu betrayed the clan.

119
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,520
Then their intel isn't the truth.

120
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,550
You lead the Ministry
of Military and Legal Affairs.

121
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,960
All wrongful convictions in Zichuan

122
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,790
are under your authority.

123
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,360
If I were you,

124
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,720
I'd seek the truth

125
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,730
and fight for Xiu's innocence.

126
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:55,390
The Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs
operates on solid evidence.

127
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,710
Your Highness is free to examine

128
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,750
all of Zichuan's legal codes.

129
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,550
Not a single one

130
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,090
allows judgment based on trust alone.

131
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,420
Even so, it must be investigated, no?

132
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,200
Zichuan law states:

133
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,770
Any unjust verdict

134
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,960
is no different
from tearing a man to pieces.

135
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,080
So we must act with virtue
and caution in punishment.

136
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,320
Surely, Lord Di Lin,
loyal as you are to Zichuan,

137
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,920
you haven't forgotten that.

138
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,600
Thank you for the reminder, Your Highness.

139
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,570
I won't forget.

140
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,360
But in pursuit of impartiality,

141
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,570
the law also says.

142
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,410
Those outside
the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs

143
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,810
must not interfere in our investigations.

144
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,960
So whether we investigate, or how,

145
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,870
that's our business.

146
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,270
You shouldn't get involved.

147
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,620
Your Highness,

148
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,340
what the Lord means is

149
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,670
we are already doing
our best to uncover the truth.

150
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,930
You know how close those brothers are...

151
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,670
But whether you believe it or not

152
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,240
doesn't matter.

153
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,480
What matters is whether
Lord Chieftain believes it.

154
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,870
Do you think you can

155
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,600
change Lord Chieftain's mind?

156
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,960
Someone has to try.

157
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,330
If you won't, then I will.

158
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,260
My Lord,

159
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,010
Princess Ning does have a point.

160
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,120
The intel Lord Xiu sent

161
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,450
is now several days old.

162
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,250
And we've received no new reports.

163
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,770
Gathering intelligence in secret

164
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,170
has been very difficult.

165
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,480
If we could leverage Wayun's forces...

166
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,680
You think I don't want to know the truth?

167
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,910
But the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs
belongs to the Zichuan family,

168
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,200
not to Zichuan Xiu.

169
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,300
If we investigate,

170
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,840
all eyes are on us.

171
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,840
If the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs
investigates Xiu's alleged betrayal,

172
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,270
no one will believe we're impartial.

173
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,790
It'll only make us
look like we're protecting our own,

174
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,620
which would hurt his case even more.

175
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,840
My Lord, the Chieftain's Mansion
has already issued the wanted notice

176
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,030
to Wayun.

177
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,200
So this matter,

178
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,130
is it truly beyond redemption now?

179
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,390
At this point,

180
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,000
all we can do is wait for Xiu

181
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,860
to come back and explain himself.

182
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:13,870
My Lord,

183
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,720
do you think Lord Xiu

184
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,840
really betrayed us?

185
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,120
If this were happening to me

186
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,910
instead of Xiu,

187
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
do you think I would betray the clan?

188
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,360
Absolutely not.

189
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,500
Then neither would he.

190
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,560
Lord Chieftain.

191
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,960
You summoned me?

192
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,960
Li Qing.

193
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,200
About the marriage I arranged last time,

194
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,660
I didn't consider things carefully enough.

195
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,270
I've wronged you.

196
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,750
You don't need to apologize.

197
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,390
Come, sit here.

198
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,000
I had

199
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,750
planned to give you some time,

200
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,480
let you rest well,

201
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,030
and not be affected by all these rumors.

202
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,520
Who would've thought

203
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,870
you went over there

204
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,000
to reorganize the Black Banner Army,

205
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and even turned an old unit

206
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,200
into a well-ordered force?

207
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,030
You've done a great job.

208
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,960
You flatter me, My Lord.

209
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,440
Though peace talks have ended,

210
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,610
the situation
in Yuanzhou is still unstable.

211
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Helping to stabilize
the southwest border is my duty.

212
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,080
But rest assured.

213
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,790
I won't be swayed
by rumors from the Imperial Capital.

214
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,750
Good. That's exactly
what I admire about you.

215
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,500
You always put the bigger picture first.

216
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,230
I called you

217
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,240
here today

218
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,150
for a small favor.

219
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,510
Since you did so well
reorganizing the Black Banner Army,

220
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,290
I believe

221
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,230
you can also keep
an eye on this person for me.

222
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,510
My Lady,

223
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,480
those Zichuan war captives
who returned from Yuanzhou,

224
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,359
no one knows where they were sent.

225
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,270
Our scouts report

226
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,670
they're nowhere to be found.

227
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,000
I'll go look myself.

228
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,790
My Lady.

229
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,090
Your Highness only wants to find them

230
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,020
to learn about Zichuan Xiu's

231
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,620
situation and whereabouts.

232
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,870
If you truly want to find him,

233
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,830
I can help you leave.

234
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,970
Spare me the fake kindness.

235
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,930
I know my uncle sent you to watch me.

236
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,030
Yes, Lord Chieftain did assign me.

237
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,920
But what I've told you

238
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,550
isn't just out of duty.

239
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,810
If you've really made up your mind,

240
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,440
we can leave right now.

241
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,590
Of course I have.

242
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,300
Why are you going to find Zichuan Xiu?

243
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,310
Are you worried
about which side he's on now,

244
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,270
or just curious where he is?

245
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,640
Xiu would never betray the Zichuan family.

246
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,960
Then clearly,

247
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,040
you're not worried
about the first question.

248
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,320
Let's talk about the second,

249
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,510
where is he?

250
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,070
Even the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs's
network of spies is at a loss.

251
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,750
Do you really believe that
just the two of us

252
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,510
can find Zichuan Xiu?

253
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,120
Let me go a step further,

254
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,110
even if we did find him,

255
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,480
if you take even

256
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,720
one step outside this door today,

257
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,400
Lord Canxing's hatred toward Zichuan Xiu

258
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,590
will deepen even more.

259
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,250
Is that something
you're willing to see happen?

260
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,270
I'll stay at the manor for now.

261
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,250
If Your Highness ever truly make up your mind,

262
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,350
I'll go with you anytime.

263
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,440
Give it back.

264
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,750
Give it back!

265
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,160
Get out of my way!

266
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,640
Don't take it!

267
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,680
I said don't burn it!

268
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,270
Don't! Stop it!

269
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm going to burn it!

270
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,440
Give it to me!

271
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,270
What's the point anymore?

272
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,200
Calm down.

273
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,350
Move!

274
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:40,920
Chief!

275
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,110
Listen to me.

276
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,960
Chief, something happened.

277
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,070
Ze tried to burn the banner,
Li Nong wouldn't let him,

278
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,600
and they started fighting.

279
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,400
Burn it!

280
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,550
Quiet, everyone! Lord Xiu is here.

281
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,880
Lord Xiu.

282
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,790
Ze nearly burned the banner.

283
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,570
Chief, the Zichuan family sent people to assassinate you.

284
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,000
You tell me,

285
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,680
are we still part of the Zichuan family?

286
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,030
Exactly.

287
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,830
Where's the banner?

288
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,490
Right here.

289
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,030
Step aside.

290
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,960
Don't get worked up.

291
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,200
Brothers,

292
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,270
before, I acted recklessly

293
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,450
and dragged you all into this.

294
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,760
Right now,

295
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,720
please allow me to say

296
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,820
I'm sorry.

297
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,830
Chief, we're not blaming you.

298
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,040
It's Zichuan that doesn't want us anymore.

299
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,960
But Zichuan will always be our home.

300
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,720
The thread used on this banner

301
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,480
comes from a small town in
southern Zichuan

302
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,160
called Jinchuan.

303
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,070
Ming Yu.

304
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,920
If I remember right, that's your hometown?

305
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,310
Yes, it's mine.

306
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,440
And the gold leaf on this flag

307
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,350
can only be made in Guta.

308
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,070
Luo Jie,

309
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,960
you were born in Guta, right?

310
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,950
Yeah, Guta's my home.

311
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,510
The blood running through our veins

312
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,200
is Zichuan blood.

313
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,480
So home is where we must return.

314
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,550
But my lord, how can we go back?

315
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,550
Let me ask you one question.

316
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,960
Brothers,

317
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,750
what do you want most right now?

318
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:38,830
Ming Yu.

319
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,400
You go first.

320
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,200
I want to defeat the North Clan,

321
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,070
restore Yuanzhou to the Zichuan family,

322
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,720
and wish Lord Chieftain long life.

323
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,790
Bullshit.

324
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,440
Luo Jie, you say it. Be honest.

325
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,830
I want peace in the world.

326
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,720
I may be blind, but I can

327
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,050
still beat you to death.

328
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,200
Ze, your turn.

329
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,920
I want to marry Hua.

330
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,840
Then why haven't you?

331
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Because I'm poor.

332
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:17,240
Her dad married her off
to a noble from Zichuan.

333
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,120
Why are you all laughing?

334
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,290
Aren't you poor too?

335
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,790
Let me tell you.

336
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,510
Hua loves me.

337
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:24,830
Li Nong.

338
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,160
What about you?

339
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,070
I want endless money.

340
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,310
To buy whatever I want.

341
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,910
To drink however much I like.

342
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,030
One bowl down, one bowl up.

343
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,200
I want money too.

344
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:34,990
Chief,

345
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,720
I have a wish too.

346
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,720
I want to marry a beautiful woman,

347
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,880
one of those soft and gentle types.

348
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,200
Well said.

349
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,960
Baichuan.

350
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,790
Baichuan!

351
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,270
I hope you shut up soon.

352
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,130
That's more like it.

353
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
You all spoke exceptionally well.

354
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,720
All from the heart.

355
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,350
And you know what?

356
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,790
I can guarantee,

357
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,030
with your current situation,

358
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,720
none of those wishes

359
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,160
will come true.

360
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,400
But right now, fate has given you

361
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,950
something priceless.

362
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,800
And that is...

363
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,340
Opportunity.

364
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,070
Yes, opportunity.

365
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,130
Sounds about right,

366
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,440
but kind of familiar.

367
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,830
You're not wrong.

368
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,110
Last time Lord Xiu gave a speech,

369
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,880
we ended up joining the Xiu Battalion.

370
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,790
That's right!

371
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,920
Yeah!

372
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,510
Luo Jie.

373
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,720
Here, higher.

374
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,880
Let me get higher, quick.

375
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,740
Lift your foot.

376
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,200
Brothers, hear me out.

377
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,740
The Zichuan family...

378
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,440
Everyone, the war between the Zichuan family

379
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,760
and the North Clan is far from over.

380
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,490
These troubled times
will drag on for years.

381
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,170
But for all of you...

382
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,240
For all of you,

383
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,590
chaos

384
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,310
means the chance
to make a name for yourselves.

385
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,130
Don't know why,

386
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,110
but I feel like crying.

387
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,880
Me too.

388
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,160
Look at our commander.

389
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,960
Even blind, he still has dreams.

390
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,070
We really can't

391
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,310
go on living aimlessly.

392
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,030
I'm going to train hard
and make something of myself!

393
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,440
Yeah!

394
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:28,840
Right!

395
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,450
You're all absolutely right.

396
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,440
Even though I'm blind now,

397
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,720
my heart can feel

398
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,920
your determination.

399
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,590
Li Nong asked a good question just now.

400
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,790
He asked when we'll be able to go home.

401
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,110
But actually,

402
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,480
that question should be
asked of yourselves.

403
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,350
Do you want wealth and glory?

404
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,400
Yes!

405
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,750
Do you want to return home in triumph?

406
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,550
Yes!

407
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,000
Do you want to be respected?

408
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,070
Yes!

409
00:24:59,270 --> 00:24:59,830
Good.

410
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,720
Then we must rely on our own strength

411
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,560
to make our way back home.

412
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,510
Because of me,

413
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,510
Zichuan has temporarily disowned us.

414
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,840
But we must never forget

415
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,000
we are from Zichuan.

416
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,960
One day, we'll return.

417
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,640
And when we return,

418
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,720
we'll bring victory with us,

419
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,240
honor with us,

420
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,030
and dignity with us.

421
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,360
Chief,

422
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,230
we'll follow you,

423
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,880
even if it costs us our lives.

424
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,330
We follow Lord Xiu, death before retreat!

425
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,570
We follow Lord Xiu, death before retreat!

426
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,880
We follow Lord Xiu, death before retreat!

427
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,270
Here we go.

428
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,100
I, Baichuan...

429
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,160
I, Luo Jie...

430
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,440
I, Ming Yu...

431
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,680
Swear

432
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,680
to follow and serve
Lord Zichuan Xiu for life.

433
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,350
Even if our blood turns to ash...

434
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,880
Our loyalty remains eternal.

435
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,270
Yes.

436
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,100
Eternal loyalty!

437
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,450
Eternal loyalty!

438
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,750
Eternal loyalty!

439
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,160
Eternal loyalty!

440
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,070
Eternal loyalty!

441
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,330
[Guqi Mountains]

442
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,350
The steps…

443
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,680
My Lord, didn't you just say

444
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,580
the Xiu Battalion
is heading back to Zichuan?

445
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,310
Why'd you skip morning drills?

446
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,650
Little things like that

447
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,580
can be left to Luo Jie and Ming Yu.

448
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,800
But why did you
bring me to the Guqi Mountains?

449
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,310
To lead the way, of course.

450
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,330
I'm blind. How else

451
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,440
am I supposed to climb a mountain?

452
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,110
I meant, why are we here,
in the Guqi Mountains?

453
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,270
What do you think?

454
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,080
The Guqi Mountains
are an impassable barrier.

455
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,510
They divide
the clan's core from Yuanzhou.

456
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,510
Wayun is the only
pass through them.

457
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,570
Now that Wayun is no longer an option,

458
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,070
you're not seriously
thinking of crossing the Guqi Mountains

459
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,800
to get back to Zichuan, are you?

460
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,350
Right now, going back would mean nothing.

461
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,200
Baichuan, you're my most trusted officer.

462
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,270
So no matter what you see today,

463
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,790
don't ask questions.

464
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,940
And especially...

465
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,680
Don't tell Luo Jie or Ming Yu.

466
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,640
Got it?

467
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,710
Always with the mystery…

468
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,310
Since following you,

469
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,440
nothing really surprises me anymore.

470
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,200
Then doesn't it strike you as odd

471
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,720
that there's such a vast cavern

472
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,550
inside the Guqi Mountains?

473
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,960
Now that you mention it...

474
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,640
Wait, you're blind.

475
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,820
How did you find your way here?

476
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,800
I know this place
like the back of my hand.

477
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:53,890
This way.

478
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,880
Just a mishap.

479
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,370
Getting harder to see.

480
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,100
How do we move forward now?

481
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,110
Baichuan, come here.

482
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,650
You knew there'd be torches here?

483
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,930
Oh, I know a lot more than that.

484
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,350
What is this place?

485
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,030
My master's residence.

486
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,680
Your master?

487
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,480
Who?

488
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,000
Master Zuo Jiaming.

489
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,750
Master Zuo Jiaming?

490
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,920
Isn't this a cliff?

491
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,030
Yes.

492
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,880
You're lying again.

493
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,750
Master Zuo Jiaming guards the Lin family.

494
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,880
Why would he be here?

495
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,110
My master's elusive.

496
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,620
He can protect
the Lin family from anywhere.

497
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,490
This place

498
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,110
is where I trained under him.

499
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,380
And besides,

500
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,050
with the bond we share,

501
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,720
he'll appear the moment

502
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,200
I need him.

503
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,400
If you're really his disciple,

504
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,570
why haven't you ever mentioned it?

505
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,630
Blame my sense of humor.

506
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,240
Joking aside, you don't go around
name-dropping your master.

507
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,900
And now that

508
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,750
I'm blind,

509
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,010
I really have no choice

510
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,310
but to ask him to be my eyes.

511
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,150
A legendary figure like Master Zuo Jiaming

512
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,880
took you as a disciple?

513
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,310
What's wrong with me?

514
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,720
My master likes me a lot!

515
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,830
I'm just

516
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,640
like him when he was young.

517
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,440
Stop.

518
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,680
You really think these lies

519
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,590
will ruin how I see him?

520
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,440
Why?

521
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,550
Right now, on your left, your right,

522
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,720
front left, front right, and behind you,

523
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,580
aren't there torches all around?

524
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,200
Yeah.

525
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,590
Watch carefully.

526
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,750
Are they lit?

527
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,640
Nope.

528
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,030
This time for sure.

529
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,200
Lit yet?

530
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,480
No.

531
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,240
Okay, okay.

532
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,370
Master. Your disciple kneels before you.

533
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,350
Please light the torches!

534
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,210
I beg you!

535
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,880
Now?

536
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,610
They're lit.

537
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,570
Wait.

538
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,960
Are you standing in front of me right now?

539
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,110
How can you be there

540
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,420
when I was kneeling right in front of you?

541
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,510
Baichuan, you...

542
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,160
Forget it.

543
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,200
Aren't you amazed

544
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,790
by this place?

545
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,920
Stop the theatrics.

546
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,400
What's with these torches?

547
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,550
It means we're on the right path.

548
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,110
If you keep talking like that,

549
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,510
I'll leave you here.

550
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,720
Don't!

551
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,510
Even though I know

552
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,240
this cave well,

553
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,910
I still need you to guide me out.

554
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,810
Glad you understand.

555
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,300
Now, what is this place?

556
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,830
Haven't you noticed

557
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,440
we haven't walked in a straight line

558
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,830
since we came in?

559
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,170
We've been twisting and turning.

560
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,280
My master's powers are unmatched.

561
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,070
Otherwise, any random guy

562
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,130
could stumble upon this place.

563
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,750
You mean this cave is a maze?

564
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,200
Glad to see you're learning something.

565
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,080
That's right. This is a maze.

566
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
One wrong turn,

567
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,880
and you're lost forever.

568
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,880
Where does it lead?

569
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,620
To Zichuan.

570
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,350
Zichuan?

571
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,000
Yep.

572
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,460
This maze runs under the Guqi Mountains,

573
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,590
cutting straight through?

574
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Told you,

575
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,790
my master's amazing.

576
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,350
How can you be so calm?

577
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,130
Do you realize what this means?

578
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,070
If Wayun is blocked,

579
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,350
this becomes the only route
from Yuanzhou to Zichuan.

580
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,630
If the Xiu Battalion

581
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,230
rises again,

582
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,480
this tunnel

583
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,010
could transport supplies,

584
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,920
or launch surprise attacks on Yuanzhou.

585
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,070
A strategic advantage
for both offense and retreat.

586
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,330
It could be the key to retaking Yuanzhou.

587
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:53,060
So, any other questions?

588
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,310
Why are you showing me

589
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,480
this passage?

590
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Because you

591
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,640
are my most loyal officer,

592
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,690
and my dearest brother.

593
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,100
What do you think?

594
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,960
Touched, right?

595
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,330
If you are, here, take it.

596
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,590
I'm a woman.

597
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,230
Oh.

598
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,440
Sorry!

599
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,320
You're my best sister.

600
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,920
Alright?

601
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,340
Here, hold on.

602
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,630
Hold tight.

603
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,480
This way.

604
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,780
Slow down.

605
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,929
There are no more torches on this side.

606
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,630
Are you ready?

607
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,090
Ready for what?

608
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,400
My Lord.

609
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,070
Lord Xiu!

610
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,710
Zichuan Xiu!

611
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,630
My Lord!

612
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,590
Zichuan Xiu!

613
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,880
Zichuan Xiu! Where are you?

614
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm right here.

615
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,670
What is this place?

616
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,590
I told you,

617
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,670
this is my master's residence.

618
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,480
Why did you suddenly disappear just now?

619
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,920
I went to see my master.

620
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,060
Where did you see him?

621
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,660
I didn't see anything at all.

622
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,710
You didn't?

623
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,560
That means your skills aren't up to par.

624
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,280
I've told you

625
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:42,280
to train properly
with me, but you didn't listen.

626
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,230
Now you see the gap between us, don't you?

627
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,010
If you really saw Master Zuo Jiaming,

628
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,150
why are you still blind?

629
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,110
Well...

630
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,690
My master is a peerless healer,

631
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,110
but he only
treats rare and difficult cases.

632
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,150
My problem is too trivial for him.

633
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,920
Didn't you come here
specifically to fix your eyes?

634
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,320
That doesn't matter now.

635
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,620
I've seen my master.

636
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,880
It's time we left.

637
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
Tell me clearly

638
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,190
why disappeared

639
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,630
and why you suddenly showed up again.

640
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,510
We'll talk about that later.

641
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,040
Let's move quickly for now.

642
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,070
Wait, slow down, watch your step.

643
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,490
The stairs.

644
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,110
Your Majesty,

645
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,810
regarding Zichuan Xiu,

646
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,440
we've already dispatched
several teams to search for him,

647
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,510
but there's still no sign of him.

648
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,150
Zichuan Xiu's crimes are unforgivable,

649
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,320
but whether he lives or dies now

650
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,800
is irrelevant.

651
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,190
As long as he can't return to Zichuan,

652
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,440
his life is worthless.

653
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,670
So there's no need for concern.

654
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,840
When the previous Chieftain,

655
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,960
Zichuan Yuanxing, ruled Zichuan,

656
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,920
the land was stable,
the people prosperous.

657
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,590
Ge Yingxing oversaw Yuanzhou,

658
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,170
and stood toe-to-toe
with our North Clan.

659
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,480
Now both men are gone.

660
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,390
This is Zichuan's moment

661
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,700
of political weakness.

662
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,970
We must take full advantage

663
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,360
of this rare opportunity.

664
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,840
Your foresight is unmatched, Your Majesty.

665
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,840
Zichuan has men like Di Lin, Si Yilin,

666
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,150
and Zichuan Xiu,

667
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,230
fearless warriors who charge ahead.

668
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,400
But we North Clan also have talents
like you, General-in-chief,

669
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,000
diligent, disciplined,
and formidable in battle.

670
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,480
It's just

671
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,480
we must improve our psychological warfare.

672
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,450
Understood, Your Majesty.

673
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,490
[Di's Mansion]

674
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,840
These are reports
from my six spies at the border,

675
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,800
each sent back from Yuanzhou.

676
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,670
But the contents
are exactly the same as before.

677
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:17,800
Xiu has been named Grand Marshal of Yuanzhou
by Divine Emperor of Sairong.

678
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:18,800
He's completely defected.

679
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,480
Useless information again.

680
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,450
Not necessarily.

681
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,810
Big Brother, you mean

682
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,440
the fact that all
reports say the same thing

683
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,730
is actually good news?

684
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,840
This time, Divine Emperor of Sairong
is playing psychological games.

685
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,710
For the Zichuan clan,

686
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,020
this is a crushing blow.

687
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,970
But there's one good thing.

688
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,220
It means Xiu is innocent.

689
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,250
Then that simplifies things.

690
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,440
If you and I are here in the Imperial Capital,

691
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,700
once Xiu arrives,

692
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,710
we can help clear his name.

693
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,120
It's not that simple.

694
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,050
With the recent military losses,

695
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,000
they need a scapegoat.

696
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,290
People don't care about the truth.

697
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,400
They just want someone to blame.

698
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,230
Recently,

699
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,370
Vice Commander Lin Bing set out from Wayun

700
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,500
to search for the traitor Zichuan Xiu.

701
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,460
But he encountered
North Clan troops on the way,

702
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,230
and returned empty-handed.

703
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,190
Thank him for his efforts.

704
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,480
However, Yuanzhou

705
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,030
is no longer within our territory.

706
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,190
Sending troops to search for him

707
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,230
should probably stop here.

708
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,960
If he truly is a traitor,

709
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,290
how can we just let it go?

710
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,840
Ning, what are you doing here?

711
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,190
Didn't you tell me
to attend more meetings,

712
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,190
to learn from the senior officials?

713
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,510
I just happened to overhear

714
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,590
Lord Luo Minghai's report.

715
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,150
I believe this matter must not be dropped.

716
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,170
Fine.

717
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,550
You sit in.

718
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,070
Come,

719
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,830
have a seat and speak.

720
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,570
Everyone else is still standing.

721
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,720
Please, everyone, take a seat.

722
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,080
You all say Zichuan Xiu is a traitor,

723
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:17,570
the greatest disgrace
to the family in a hundred years.

724
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,000
Then tell me, how can such a traitor

725
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,840
still be allowed to roam free?

726
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,320
Right, Lord Luo?

727
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,440
Yes.

728
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,400
I'm willing to personally
lead a unit to Yuanzhou

729
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,000
and kill Zichuan Xiu myself.

730
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,100
Lords, you're afraid

731
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,630
of trouble and hardship...

732
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,390
Li Qing,

733
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,850
I entrusted Ning to you,

734
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,720
told you to watch over her.

735
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,680
How could you...

736
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,280
I've said all this.

737
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,080
Surely someone should respond?

738
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,650
Your Highness, let's go.

739
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,290
Didn't you call him a traitor?

740
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,440
Then why haven't you caught him?

741
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,100
Why haven't you executed him?

742
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:05,970
Your Highness.

743
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,940
Isn't there a better way?

744
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,250
Ning's just being emotional.

745
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,680
That's enough.

746
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,480
Today's meeting is over.

747
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,760
Everyone dismissed.

748
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:13,300
I know you want to scold me. Go ahead.

749
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,050
No.

750
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,570
You were brave in court today.

751
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,280
Brave, but useless.

752
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,110
True.

753
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,400
But better than crying and sneaking out.

754
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,460
Things are different now.

755
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,000
Before, when I acted up with Uncle,

756
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,710
he'd eventually give in.

757
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,590
But now, no matter what I say,

758
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,050
he completely ignores me.

759
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,150
I know this is stupid. Reckless, even.

760
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:53,590
But I just can't think

761
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,880
of a better way.

762
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:57,280
I simply can't sit here and do nothing.

763
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:58,930
Your Highness,

764
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,670
there's still a lot you can do.

765
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:10,050
Are you ready to face him?
