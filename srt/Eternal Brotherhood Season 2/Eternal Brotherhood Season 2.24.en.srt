[Eternal Brotherhood 2]

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,890
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,180
My Lord, you're wise.

4
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:49,070
Once we station our troops in Payi

5
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,030
and use it as a base to counterattack,

6
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,560
we can gain a foothold in Yuanzhou

7
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,509
and gradually reclaim our lost territory.

8
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,509
They must be desperate
to occupy this place right now.

9
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,040
Send the order—advance at full speed!

10
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,790
King of Light,

11
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,430
I know I'm not welcome,

12
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,640
so I want to prove my loyalty to you.

13
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,520
I can help you take Payi without shedding

14
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,780
a single drop of blood.

15
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,570
Is that so?

16
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,430
Let me think.

17
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,070
What's your brilliant plan?

18
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,460
When I first arrived in Yuanzhou,

19
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,320
I was stationed in Payi for a long time.

20
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,850
While I fought against you,

21
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,150
most of the soldiers there
were pulled out.

22
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,750
Now there are
fewer than 3,000 soldiers inside,

23
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,810
and most of them are my subordinates.

24
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,030
If you send me,

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,030
I'm confident
I can persuade them to surrender.

26
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,710
Is that true?

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,470
Absolutely.

28
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,160
It took me a lot of effort
to get through this door.

29
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,650
There're many people outside
shouting about killing Lu Di.

30
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,430
Chief, something happened.

31
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,150
Luo Si's army has entered Yuanzhou.

32
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,460
Our men found

33
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,750
they are advancing towards Payi.

34
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,530
To Payi?

35
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,280
Yes.

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,450
Baichuan, how far is it
from here to Payi City?

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,120
About 76.7 miles.

38
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,680
With a guide,

39
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,750
we can get there in 10 hours.

40
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,640
I'm going to make preparations.

41
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,040
I'll await your command.

42
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,760
Chief, please think twice.

43
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,210
Sound the call to march.

44
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,190
Yes.

45
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,760
Baichuan.

46
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,430
I'll set out first

47
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,490
with the cavalries and the Xiu Battalion.

48
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,510
You go to Bulu Village
to request reinforcements.

49
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,340
Remember, you must return to Payi City

50
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,690
before Luo Si gets there.

51
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,660
Understood.

52
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,040
My Lord, be careful.

53
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,250
I didn't expect you
to care about me so much.

54
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,600
I just don't want you to die
before paying back the money you owe me.

55
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,980
Can Lu Di be trusted?

56
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,380
We can only take a gamble.

57
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,520
So, I'm counting on you.

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,050
If you don't make it in time

59
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,720
and something happens to me,

60
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,930
I might end up
being crushed into a meat pie

61
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,070
by Lu Di and Luo Si.

62
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Then I could finally get what I want.

63
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,300
Payi City, I'm back.

64
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,890
My Lord, I'm ready.

65
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,580
Luo Si's army could arrive at any moment.

66
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,240
If you go in and never come out,

67
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,720
I'll be stuck between your two armies.

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,910
Then I'll truly have nowhere to go.

69
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,800
Then I could finally beat you once.

70
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,950
Don't flatter yourself.

71
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,030
Even if I deliver your head

72
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,840
to Divine Emperor at full speed right now,

73
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,870
my life still wouldn't be spared.

74
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,680
You have a point.

75
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,220
Who did you learn the skill

76
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,510
of joking around from?

77
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,730
Who else—if not you?

78
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,450
All under heaven belongs to the emperor.

79
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,190
All the people are his subordinates.

80
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,030
Okay.

81
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:04,890
Go then.

82
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,750
Chief Busen.

83
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,020
King of Light
plans to take Payi by strategy.

84
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,330
But the North Clan's Admiral Luo Si

85
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,190
is on his way to Payi with his army.

86
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,920
The two armies' strength
is vastly unequal.

87
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,120
Please lead your troops
to provide reinforcements.

88
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,800
Bulan.

89
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,190
Yes.

90
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,320
Pass my order—get ready to set out now!

91
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,600
Yes.

92
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,120
Let's determine

93
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,310
the fastest marching route.

94
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,950
Okay.

95
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,480
My Lord,
the North Clan's army is approaching.

96
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,630
How far away?

97
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,300
20 kilometers at most.

98
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,600
And the number of their soldiers?

99
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,130
At least 100,000 soldiers.

100
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,140
My Lord,

101
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,920
Baichuan's reinforcements
haven't arrived yet.

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,270
Even if we take Payi,

103
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,730
we won't be able to hold it.

104
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,510
Please think twice.

105
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,480
Perhaps we should retreat for now.

106
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,500
We can't abandon Payi.

107
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,000
Chief, don't blame me for saying this:

108
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,240
If Lu Di is pretending to surrender,

109
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,920
he'll get us killed here.

110
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,600
A trap.

111
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,640
A trap to kill me, King of Light.

112
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,480
My Lord, let me stay here
and take your place.

113
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,890
Even if the entire army retreats,

114
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,350
I'll stand my ground here.

115
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,880
My Lord, Luo Si's army
is less than 3.3 miles away.

116
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,570
Pass my order—retreat!

117
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,990
All of you, retreat to Jialai!

118
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,560
I will hold the line here alone.

119
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,450
My Lord.

120
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,480
Say no more.

121
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,130
Lu Di?

122
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,540
Still alive, huh?

123
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,000
You're still alive, Lord Luo.

124
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,930
How could I die before you?

125
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,030
I, Lu Di, and Meng Geli, Governor of Payi,

126
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,420
offer Payi to you, King of Light.

127
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,900
From this day forward,

128
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,610
all of Payi and I

129
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,180
will loyally serve King of Light.

130
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,050
We will protect Yuanzhou
and sever all ties with the North Clan.

131
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,910
Lu Di,

132
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,910
today, we took Payi
without shedding a drop of blood

133
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,610
and armored the entire Yuanzhou region.

134
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,790
This achievement

135
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,090
will earn the admiration
of every race in Yuanzhou.

136
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,280
The generals who surrendered...

137
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,640
No. The generals
who have pledged allegiance...

138
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,770
From today onwards,

139
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,860
the generals who have pledged allegiance
will be reorganized into new units.

140
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,380
When Baichuan returns,

141
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,040
we'll feast together

142
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,750
with Busen's reinforcements.

143
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,180
My Lord, I really don't want
to rain on your parade,

144
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,080
but have you forgotten

145
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,960
that outside Payi City, there are still

146
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,840
hundreds of thousands
of Luo Si's soldiers?

147
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,380
You...

148
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,400
Do you know why, among the three of you,

149
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,880
I like you the least?

150
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,120
No, you like Baichuan the least.

151
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,660
But she's not here,

152
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,000
so I said her lines.

153
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,850
Where is she?

154
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,410
No news at all.

155
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,640
My Lord, we've been on the move all night.

156
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,120
I'm afraid our men can't take it.

157
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,750
No, we can't stop.

158
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,930
Pass the order—
rest the men, but not the horses.

159
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,390
Rotate them on horseback.

160
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,080
Yes.

161
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,870
How long can Payi City's

162
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,230
supplies last?

163
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,630
I don't think
Luo Si will give us a chance.

164
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,360
If it were me,
I'd also opt for a quick victory.

165
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,160
I'll go prepare the city defenses now.

166
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,550
I've got a plan.

167
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,240
I want to...

168
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,950
negotiate with them.

169
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,670
I can't believe
King of Light seized the initiative

170
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,000
and took Payi.

171
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,850
My Lord, it's all because of Lu Di.
He betrayed the North Clan

172
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,330
and handed over Payi just like that.

173
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,460
This time, we must kill Lu Di.

174
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,080
Are the siege engines ready?

175
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,390
Prepare for battle!

176
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,600
Wait, My Lord. Look at this.

177
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,170
Where did you get this?

178
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,510
There are still
many of Lu Di's former men in Payi

179
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,910
who are unwilling to surrender.

180
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,360
When we sent scouts to assess

181
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,560
their defenses, they were discovered.

182
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,890
But they used the North Clan's method
of message delivery,

183
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,480
shooting arrows into targets
to deliver information.

184
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,380
They claim to have captured Lu Di
and plan to return to the North Clan?

185
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,930
Yes.

186
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,090
Pass my order—
send a unit of cavalries to harass them.

187
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,200
Use the chance to deliver a message.

188
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,790
They leave the city at midnight tonight.

189
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,030
I'll meet them outside the city.

190
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,030
Could it be a trap?

191
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,120
Should we prepare a backup plan?

192
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,960
Fighting head-on is what I fear the least.

193
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,460
My Lord, they're here.

194
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,440
Admiral Luo Si, long time no see!

195
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,960
Lu Di,

196
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,360
you traitor!

197
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,280
You're not qualified to call my name!

198
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,640
I'm going to kill you!

199
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,080
Wait, killing me won't change anything.

200
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,820
You have a more important mission.

201
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

202
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,000
King of Light wants to see you.

203
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,370
King of Light, I admire your courage.

204
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,710
But... you've lost.

205
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,200
No, you lost
the moment you came here today.

206
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,050
This.

207
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,340
I wonder if you have the courage

208
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
to have a drink with me.

209
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,450
Let me tell you

210
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,960
how you lost.

211
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,100
Let's talk privately.

212
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,840
80 years ago,

213
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,130
on the white marble steps of Sairong City,

214
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,300
soldiers of the Jialin Tribe

215
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,030
slaughtered the entire royal family
of the Yesai Tribe.

216
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,360
Even infants were dashed
against the stones.

217
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,860
Soon after, at the same place,

218
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,170
the triumphant Divine Emperor
of the Jialin Tribe was imprisoned

219
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,840
and left to starve to death in a cellar.

220
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,360
The Lei Tribe's Divine Emperor
occupied the Divine Castle.

221
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,000
He was reckless, cruel, and bloodthirsty,

222
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,720
causing a three-year civil war,

223
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,080
until a stronger tribe

224
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,940
rose and took their place.

225
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,780
What are you trying to say?

226
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,520
The so-called North Clan

227
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,870
is made up of 12 tribes.

228
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,000
You revere power and violence

229
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,180
and believe that might makes right.

230
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,360
The Divine Castle is still
the same Divine Castle.

231
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,870
It just changes names
depending on the rulers.

232
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,910
It used to be called the Thunder Castle.

233
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,000
Now it's called Sairong City.

234
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,590
King of Light,

235
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,500
if you came here today to teach me
the history of the North Clan,

236
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,930
I already know it. Save your breath.

237
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,460
The Data Tribe, the second largest tribe
of the North Clan,

238
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,750
is strong enough
to surpass the Sairong Tribe.

239
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,170
Why don't you just rename Sairong City

240
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,870
to the Data Divine Castle?

241
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,840
If you're here to sow discord,

242
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,270
let me tell you, it won't work.

243
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,670
I'm loyal
to the Divine Emperor of Sairong.

244
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,870
How does he treat you?

245
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,200
He treats me like a brother.

246
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,440
Then why did he send you

247
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,080
to Yuanzhou to deal with me?

248
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,770
Because he trusts me.

249
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,480
Is that so?

250
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,200
The Yuanzhou Alliance Army

251
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,360
took the entire Yuanzhou region

252
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,080
within just one year.

253
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,170
Is it because Lu Di is incompetent?

254
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,640
Even if Lu Di is incompetent,

255
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,300
aren't your current efforts to stop us

256
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,480
going to cost

257
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,670
the Data Tribe dearly?

258
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,440
If I'm not mistaken,

259
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,360
it was Prince Ka Lan

260
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,240
who sent you here, wasn't it?

261
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,000
Now Prince Ka Dun

262
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,860
has lost his edge because of Lu Di.

263
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,440
Tell me,

264
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,510
who will you side with next

265
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,910
to keep the Data Tribe's place

266
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,320
as the second largest tribe?

267
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,950
You're spreading lies and nonsense!

268
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,010
I didn't expect you

269
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,290
to be so unwavering.

270
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,120
I'm impressed.

271
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,700
You and I are having a drink and chatting.

272
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,950
All my soldiers can see it.

273
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,510
And I believe your 100,000 soldiers

274
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,040
can see it too.

275
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,700
You shameless scoundrel!

276
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,120
The non-Data troops in your army

277
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,870
must think

278
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,960
we're signing a pact of alliance now.

279
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,320
Lu Di.

280
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,200
Then I'll kill you all today!

281
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,609
And there will be

282
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,950
no rumors!

283
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,930
Wait, don't be so impulsive.

284
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:20,720
My Lord.

285
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,910
Nearly 100,000 soldiers
suddenly gathered outside Payi.

286
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,300
Not bad, King of Light.

287
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
You came here today,

288
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,350
first, to drive a wedge
between Divine Emperor and me,

289
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,610
and second, to wait for reinforcements.

290
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,310
Impressive.

291
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,240
The 100,000 reinforcements of mine

292
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,290
may not win against you in Payi City,

293
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,990
but whether or not we honor our agreement,

294
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
I will definitely spread the rumor.

295
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,100
And it

296
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,560
will soon reach Divine Emperor of Sairong.

297
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,440
You rascal!

298
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,430
Thank you.

299
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,960
But don't worry,

300
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,180
I'm not the kind of person

301
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,180
who leaves others without a way out.

302
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,800
If you insist on fighting me,

303
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,060
I will certainly do my best

304
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,720
and fight to the end.

305
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,180
Just as Divine Emperor would want.

306
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,640
By that time,

307
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,360
the Data Tribe,
the North Clan's second largest tribe,

308
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,120
will probably no longer exist.

309
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,430
So, what will it be? Make your choice.

310
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,080
Let's all walk away happy.
I'll play along.

311
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,670
Admiral Luo Si, I respect you as a hero.

312
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,100
So now I give you two choices.

313
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,340
One, sign this alliance pact

314
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,860
with me,

315
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,590
and deal with
Divine Emperor of Sairong together.

316
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,350
Two, withdraw your entire army right now.

317
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,600
I, on behalf of
hundreds of thousands of Yuanzhou people,

318
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,750
swear on their lives

319
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,550
that we will not pursue.

320
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,960
King of Light.

321
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,000
Withdraw the troops!

322
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,460
My Lord!

323
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,550
Withdraw the troops!

324
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,880
Full retreat!

325
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,680
Tell Baichuan

326
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,160
she's too slow.

327
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,050
No drumsticks for her tonight.

328
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,310
I was so scared.

329
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,750
It's alright.

330
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
If you insist on having drumsticks,

331
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,960
you can have them.

332
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,000
Can you not be so fierce?

333
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,040
You took only over 1,000 men

334
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,480
to confront Luo Si's 100,000 soldiers!

335
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,550
I also have you and Busen's 100,000 men.

336
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,590
But when you went to negotiate,

337
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,000
we hadn't even arrived!

338
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,000
Now you're here, right?

339
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,180
What if we hadn't arrived?

340
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,400
Then I would just keep acting.

341
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,170
Don't you care
about the soldiers behind you?

342
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,930
There are always casualties in war.

343
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,130
Even without war,

344
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,510
people still die.

345
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,210
In chaotic times,
human lives are as cheap as grass.

346
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,910
They just die a little earlier than we do.

347
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,440
Zichuan Xiu,

348
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,720
the reinforcements were late.

349
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,520
Didn't you have
even the slightest doubt about me?

350
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,600
If I can't even trust you,

351
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,980
who is worth my trust?

352
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,920
My Lord, we captured a few enemy scouts.

353
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,880
If I'm not mistaken,

354
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,920
their mission

355
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,120
is to go to Maple Forest and Sairong City

356
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,110
to spread the rumor that I have signed

357
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,910
a pact with King of Light. Right?

358
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,590
Yes.

359
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,750
King of Light intends to drive a wedge
between Divine Emperor and me.

360
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,480
This is within my expectation.

361
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,680
I admire King of Light.

362
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,480
I didn't expect him
to go all-in with the act.

363
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,310
Even fake news sounds convincing.

364
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,110
My Lord,

365
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,240
we can't fall for his schemes.

366
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,400
Even if I take Payi,

367
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,200
do you think Divine Emperor of Sairong

368
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,330
won't suspect me of trying
to seize Yuanzhou for myself?

369
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,960
Besides, this battle would cost

370
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,510
the Data Tribe dearly.

371
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,440
Once Divine Emperor of Sairong

372
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,070
turns his blade towards us,

373
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,790
how will the already weakened Data Tribe

374
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,480
possibly survive?

375
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,840
Withdraw our troops.

376
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,960
Yes.

377
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,510
My Lord.

378
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,350
Come, have some too. It's very delicious.

379
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,400
news just came
from the Yuanzhou Grand Road—

380
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,070
a delegation from Zichuan

381
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,070
is on its way here.

382
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,110
Do you still remember
what Yuanzhou was like back then?

383
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,110
The people were destitute,
wandering without homes.

384
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,530
Now look at it.

385
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,100
Look at these rice fields—

386
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,510
so lush and thriving.

387
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,010
You can tell at a glance

388
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,850
it's been a long time
since there was war.

389
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,960
And the people
are living in peace and contentment.

390
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,310
The roads and paths are all restored,

391
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,770
and so is the irrigation system—

392
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,510
ready to withstand disaster.

393
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,460
So,

394
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,760
it's not that Yuanzhou is ungovernable.

395
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,700
It's just that Zichuan
never governed it properly.

396
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,920
Princess Ning.

397
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,650
You've been reviewing documents
all day recently.

398
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,240
If you don't get some movement,

399
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,370
your shoulders will start to stiffen.

400
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,430
It's okay.

401
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,820
Your Highness, look.
The weather is nice today.

402
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,540
It's been a while
since you went out for archery.

403
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,850
Why don't you...

404
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,200
Lord Ma Wei just sent a message,

405
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,830
asking if you have time
to go shooting arrows with him.

406
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,030
There has always been

407
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,920
a girl in my heart.

408
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,570
When she draws her bow, she's so radiant.

409
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,110
She's so confident that even
the sunlight dims in her presence.

410
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,510
If you don't want to go,

411
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,180
I'll go reply to them now.

412
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,790
I'll just say...
say you're busy with official business.

413
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,400
Wait.

414
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,920
If you want to refuse someone,

415
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,590
would you do it with words

416
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,960
or with actions?

417
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,200
Of course it's better
to tell him face to face.

418
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,400
Clear and straightforward—
leave no room for false hope.

419
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,920
Help me change into another outfit.

420
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,510
Yes.

421
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,710
Ning, you're here.

422
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,440
Look.

423
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,270
I specially asked someone to make

424
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,880
this Crimson-Feather Arrow for you.

425
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,810
Steel-tipped, crimson-plumed.

426
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,410
It's a little heavier than the usual kind,

427
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,120
but it doesn't affect the range.

428
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,400
And it's even more accurate.

429
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,420
Try it.

430
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,460
Here.

431
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,070
Let me teach you.

432
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,140
I... can do it myself.

433
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,040
Last time,
it took all my courage to say what I said,

434
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,890
because I thought
I might never get the chance again.

435
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,740
But I didn't expect

436
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,270
that God gave me another chance.

437
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,790
From the moment I walked out of prison,

438
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,880
I've never been so sure

439
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,350
of what I want.

440
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,430
Ning, it's you. What I want is you.

441
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,030
After that farewell in prison,

442
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,590
I feared

443
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,980
I'd never see you again.

444
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,090
You came to save me.

445
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,720
I know you must know what I'm thinking.

446
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,740
Besides gratitude,

447
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,960
I'm willing to give you everything.

448
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,310
Lord Ma, you and I... we...

449
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,840
You and I will surely be

450
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,000
the most envied couple in Zichuan!

451
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,200
In the future,
you'll inherit the title of Chieftain,

452
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,680
and I'll head the Three Central Offices.

453
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,080
Zichuan's problems will be solved easily.

454
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,000
And I will do my utmost

455
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,880
to make you the greatest chieftain.

456
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,270
And Zichuan will be
the strongest Zichuan in history.

457
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,050
Ning, I'm sincere.

458
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,300
Honored envoy,

459
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,320
King of Light
has been waiting for you. Please.

460
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,260
I'm Si Yilin, the envoy of Zichuan
and the commander of the Palace Guards.

461
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,030
You really showed no mercy.

462
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,270
No wonder Di Lin asked me to bring

463
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,200
some wound medicine before I left.

464
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,760
I didn't counter

465
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,240
a few of your moves.

466
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,430
Consider it me
taking a beating from Di Lin.

467
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,400
You never say uncle.

468
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,290
So Di Lin knew all along, right?

469
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
You told him, but you didn't tell me.

470
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,820
Alright.

471
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,080
I'll help you apply the medicine.

472
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,590
When are you planning to go home?

473
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,270
Go home?

474
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,800
I want to go home too.

475
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,890
That's what happened.

476
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,140
King of Light and Admiral Luo Si
drank at the front lines,

477
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,470
then immediately withdrew their troops.

478
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,520
Your Majesty,

479
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,450
Lu Di was a general of the North Clan.

480
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,070
He was beaten by King of Light for a year.

481
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,470
Then he surrendered

482
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,060
and voluntarily gave Payi to him.

483
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:56,160
When facing Luo Si, King of Light won
without shedding a drop of blood.

484
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,830
He took Yuanzhou in just a year.

485
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,060
No one has ever seen his face.

486
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,830
I didn't expect on the Xichuan Continent,

487
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,840
someone who can rival me

488
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,200
has truly emerged.

489
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,480
Don't you think that is

490
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,200
something to be happy about?

491
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,960
King of Light is indeed
no ordinary person.

492
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,720
You've seen the face behind his mask?

493
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,790
Yes.

494
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,030
Who is he?

495
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,920
I don't know.

496
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,640
But...

497
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:35,960
What?

498
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,630
His methods are extraordinary.

499
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,560
Across the Xichuan Continent,

500
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,440
there're few people who can make you,

501
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,890
Counsellor Black Veil, say "but".

502
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,750
And you used "extraordinary"
to describe him.

503
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,970
In the confrontation with Luo Si,

504
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,590
his brilliance lies

505
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,530
not in whether he can work with Luo Si,

506
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,000
but that from now on,

507
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,270
Luo Si and I will never
truly be of one heart again.

508
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:15,070
The Data Tribe
is the North Clan's second largest tribe.

509
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,250
That means

510
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,970
disaster is coming for the North Clan.

511
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,750
Luo Si might not rebel.

512
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,180
He will.

513
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,570
King of Light only added fuel to the fire.

514
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,270
The landscape of the Xichuan Continent

515
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,340
is about to change.

516
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,880
This dull life...

517
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,680
is finally coming to an end.

518
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,160
Father,

519
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,140
I have returned to Lan City,

520
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,000
guarding the border
between Liufeng and Zichuan.

521
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,130
You can rest assured and recover.

522
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,070
However, Yuanzhou

523
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,750
has fallen into King of Light's hands.

524
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,180
His momentum is overwhelming.

525
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,750
Soon, he will surpass Zichuan.

526
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,300
Though Liufeng
has had no conflict with him yet,

527
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,190
we need to befriend him quickly

528
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,450
to prevent him from allying with Zichuan
and threatening Liufeng.

529
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,570
Your daughter, Liufeng Shuang.

530
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,410
My Lord, news from Yuanzhou has arrived.

531
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,660
Looks like the wound medicine
came in handy.

532
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,190
Does the Ministry of War know?

533
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,940
I think they've received the news by now.

534
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,239
Go with me to Chieftain's Mansion now.

535
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,610
Someone's going to lose his appetite.

536
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,110
Yes.

537
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,070
My Lord.

538
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,880
What's the rush so early in the morning?

539
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,260
Did you two plan this?

540
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,000
You both said it's urgent.

541
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,590
Si Yilin has met King of Light.

542
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,980
King of Light...

543
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,600
is Zichuan Xiu.

544
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,940
That's good news.

545
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,110
Xiu is still alive.

546
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,180
He's still alive,

547
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,540
and he's taken over all of Yuanzhou.

548
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:06,980
Good. Good.

549
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,780
Congratulations, My Lord.
Yuanzhou is ours again.

550
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,100
Great.

551
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,230
Xiu has returned home.

552
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,510
My Lord,

553
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,110
Zichuan Xiu is King of Light of Yuanzhou.

554
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,120
I know.

555
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,250
I watched Xiu grow up.

556
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,060
I know him too well.

557
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,360
He is loyal. He will come home.

558
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,300
My Lord, I suggest
we send a letter immediately

559
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,800
to call Xiu back home.

560
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,150
Okay.

561
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,770
My Lord. Shall I send a letter
to summon King of Light?

562
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,760
No hurry.

563
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,670
Notify Ning first.

564
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,170
Tell her

565
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,190
her Xiu is still alive.

566
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,710
And he's come home.

567
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,050
What are you waiting for?

568
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,960
I'll go right away.

569
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,710
Wait.

570
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,840
I want you to tell Li Qing.

571
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,700
Ask Li Qing to tell Ning.

572
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,000
You're not going.

573
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:13,970
Yes.

574
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,260
My Lord.

575
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,710
I'll go back to make preparations

576
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,800
to welcome Xiu home.

577
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,720
Okay.
This news must be spread far and wide.

578
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,670
And we must celebrate it properly.

579
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,720
Now the three of you

580
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,580
can fight for the Zichuan family again.

581
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,670
Yes.

582
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,350
Burn it.

583
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:02,910
Yes.

584
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,230
Minister.

585
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,660
Commander-in-chief.

586
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,320
With all the eyes and ears
under the Ministry,

587
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,480
you must have heard Zichuan Xiu

588
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,490
is King of Light long ago, right?

589
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,480
The jurisdiction of the Ministry
is only in Imperial Capital.

590
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,920
Yuanzhou has long been beyond our reach.

591
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,720
Naturally, I can't see that far.

592
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,480
Whether you can see it or not
is not my concern.

593
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,640
I believe you must be

594
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,710
loyal to Zichuan.

595
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,400
Of course.

596
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,480
Good. Please remember that.

597
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,920
Your Highness,

598
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,720
you've been staying up late
and rising early these days.

599
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,090
How can your body take it?

600
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,290
Lord Ma Wei
sent some bird's nest yesterday.

601
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,550
Should I prepare it to nourish your body?

602
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,940
Today, I need to go
to the Ministry of Government Supervision.

603
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,860
I can't be late.

604
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:22,480
Then...

605
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,680
Perhaps another day.

606
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,000
What about soybean milk cakes?

607
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,960
It's good for the skin and nourishing.

608
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,220
Where did you get them?

609
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,710
This morning,

610
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,710
Lord Ma Wei sent someone to deliver them.

611
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,240
He was worried
you might not like bird's nest.

612
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,640
There's no time.

613
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,510
Help me get changed,
then ready the carriage.

614
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,000
Yes.

615
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,830
Ning, I've been waiting for you.

616
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,630
Ning!

617
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,430
Ning.

618
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,710
What's wrong? What happened?

619
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,090
It's alright. Go ahead and speak freely.

620
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,850
Zichuan Xiu is not dead.

621
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,760
He didn't betray the clan either.

622
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,800
For Zichuan, he went deep into Yuanzhou,

623
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,330
gathered troops and strength,

624
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,560
struck against the North Clan,
and maintained order at the border.

625
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,520
He calls himself King of Light.

626
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,440
You're saying King of Light is Xiu?

627
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,890
Who brought this news?

628
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:03,910
Is it reliable?

629
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,620
Si Yilin went to Yuanzhou himself
and returned with the message.

630
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,880
It's absolutely true.

631
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,720
Ning, I want to tell you something.

632
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,760
Your Highness, I'll take my leave.

633
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,910
I know you've always been someone

634
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,320
who sees protecting the people of Zichuan

635
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,630
as your duty.

636
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,730
But what I want to do

637
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,240
is to be the one who protects you.

638
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,710
Will you give me that chance?

639
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,210
Marry me.

640
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,370
Be my wife.

641
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,800
Let me protect you, take care of you,

642
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,920
and cherish you forever.

643
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,560
Ning.

644
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,710
I'm sorry.

645
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,070
I can't... lie to myself.

646
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,010
You're saying the envoy of Zichuan

647
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,110
has met King of Light?

648
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,630
Yes.

649
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,160
King of Light is from Zichuan after all.

650
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,730
Will he bring Yuanzhou
back under Zichuan's rule?

651
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,810
Yuanzhou will never again

652
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,900
become someone else's slave. Never.

653
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,670
Good.

654
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,110
This is your best choice.

655
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,230
Don't miss this.

656
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,190
Thank you.

657
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,230
King of Light's woodcarvings.

658
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,710
Let's go take a look over there.

659
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,400
Have a look.

660
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:19,800
Let's go.

661
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,530
Limited-edition
King of Light's woodcarvings!

662
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,550
Wrong. Recalculate it.

663
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,360
Come.

664
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:26,880
This way, please.

665
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,800
Welcome.

666
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,330
The reserve service of the 16th company
of the Alliance Army—

667
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,400
one more member.

668
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,540
Register. Next!

669
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:08,740
I

670
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,360
am King of Light

671
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,380
of Yuanzhou.
