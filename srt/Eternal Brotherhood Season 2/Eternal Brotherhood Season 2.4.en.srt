[Eternal Brotherhood 2]

2
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,850
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,560
How are you, Commander Si Yilin?

4
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,180
Thank you for your concern,
General-in-chief. I'm well.

5
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,610
And who is this?

6
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,790
I am Commander Si Yilin's subordinate.

7
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,430
General, we can begin now.

8
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,270
Very well. Let's read
the ceasefire agreement.

9
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,980
First, an immediate ceasefire
between the two clans.

10
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,340
Second, the North Clan shall release

11
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,860
all Zichuan Palace Guards trapped in Payi City,

12
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,520
and take control of Payi City.

13
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,900
Third, the Zichuan family...

14
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,410
The Zichuan family
will pay two million silk coins

15
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,130
to redeem

16
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,880
all captured
Zichuan soldiers from this war.

17
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,760
Fourth, all 23 districts of Yuanzhou

18
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,070
shall be ceded to the North Clan

19
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,740
as war reparations.

20
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,260
Commander Si Yilin,
this will be entrusted to you.

21
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,579
General Si Yilin,

22
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,670
may I ask how many Zichuan soldiers

23
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,190
and horses

24
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,460
remain in Payi City?

25
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,570
That's all there is to see.

26
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,120
Exit the city!

27
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,290
Are Zichuan soldiers truly so cowardly?

28
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,110
You're mistaken.

29
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,230
They love Zichuan,

30
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,200
but love life even more.

31
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,080
Go, share some of our horses with them.

32
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes, sir.

33
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,060
They are a people

34
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,820
we will never truly conquer.

35
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,110
Second Brother,

36
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,130
I'll take the Xiu Battalion
to Wayun first.

37
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,650
The situation
in the Imperial Capital remains uncertain.

38
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,350
You must stay vigilant.

39
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,710
Wayun borders
North Clan territory directly.

40
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,970
Many cities still need to be handed over.

41
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,510
Be extra cautious in your dealings.

42
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,350
Understood.

43
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,040
With Vice Commander Lin Bing by my side,

44
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,380
all will be well.

45
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,350
Come.

46
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,250
Take care of yourself.

47
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,190
Second Brother.

48
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,930
It's fine. With you
and Big Brother in the Imperial Capital,

49
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,790
I have nothing to worry about.

50
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,150
Don't let us worry about you.

51
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,070
Got it.

52
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,890
On the other side
of the river is Lord Ge Qing,

53
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,420
escorting Princess Ka Dan.

54
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,110
Halt!

55
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,590
Salute

56
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,900
to Lord Si Yilin, protector of Payi.

57
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,409
To our brothers in the Palace Guards,

58
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,159
you have fulfilled your duty.

59
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,180
Salute to peace.

60
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,120
Move out!

61
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:37,990
Yes, sir.

62
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,300
Your Highness,

63
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,659
this journey must have exhausted you.

64
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,919
Shall we rest in the Governor's Mansion?

65
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:44,860

is the greatest city in the world.

What? We're returning to Wayun on our own?

83
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,900
Why don't you come with us?

84
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,500
Are you hiding
some secret stash of gold again?

85
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,190
Keep your voice down!

86
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,980
You truly are my confidant.

87
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,230
When I find it, I'll give you ten percent.

88
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,830
Stop joking.

89
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,460
Do you have money now?

90
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,940
You don't even have a single coin on you.

91
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,110
The clan's morale is already low.

92
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,380
As the leader of the Xiu Battalion,

93
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,190
you should stay to keep things steady.

94
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,230
What's so urgent

95
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,230
that you must go now?

96
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,960
Can't we wait a few days for you?

97
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,500
I'll be honest.

98
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,710
Wealth Building Hall made a deal
with the Chamber of Commerce.

99
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,110
I messed up the accounts,

100
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,440
lost a good bit of money.

101
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,780
I need to go demand repayment.

102
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,800
You think I'm that easy to fool?

103
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,590
The more people who know,

104
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,420
the more danger there is.

105
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,710
Fine, I won't ask.

106
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,770
Take care of yourself.

107
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,900
Come back soon.

108
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,950
Take this.

109
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,040
You're not taking the Xiyue Blade?

110
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,950
Where I'm going, there are only savages.

111
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,380
I'm afraid they'll try to steal it.

112
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,310
What exactly are you...

113
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,970
Didn't you just say not to ask?

114
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,290
Once I leave,

115
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,300
I don't know how long I'll be gone.

116
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,070
While I'm away,

117
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,650
you're in charge of the Xiu Battalion.

118
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,860
Bring them back to Wayun safely.

119
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,200
Alright, don't make it
sound like goodbye forever.

120
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,810
I'll go prepare the unit.

121
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,620
Come back soon.

122
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,730
I really can't lead them alone,

123
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,730
it's exhausting.

124
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,620
Go on.

125
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:41,990
My Lord,

126
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,710
most of the Palace Guards
have returned today.

127
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,790
You came back this late at night

128
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,080
afraid of public blame?

129
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,950
We lost Payi.

130
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,210
If they curse me,
if they beat me, it's only fair.

131
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,350
I just don't have the face to see them.

132
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,230
Wait a moment.

133
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,710
I knew it.

134
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,760
Some soldiers didn't make it back.

135
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,370
You're from the army, right?

136
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,400
Can I ask about someone?

137
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,260
Maocai. Do you know him?

138
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,830
He's from the Xiu Battalion.

139
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,990
This morning

140
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,660
I asked every group

141
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,590
that returned.

142
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,860
No one knew.
Never heard of him. Don't know him.

143
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,350
You think maybe he played dead

144
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,590
on the battlefield?

145
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,740
Why doesn't anyone know him?

146
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,660
I know him.

147
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,110
You do?

148
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,240
Then...

149
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,910
Then how is he? Where is he now?

150
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,910
Uncle, Maocai...

151
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,200
He's still in Payi.

152
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,960
Still in Payi?

153
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,610
He asked me to give this to you.

154
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,470
So if he has this, that means

155
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,520
he didn't act cowardly in battle?

156
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,480
Not at all.

157
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,860
Truly?

158
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,750
He's a hero.

159
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,500
He even earned a commendation.

160
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,870
That's good.

161
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,380
When will you take the fight back to them?

162
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,590
Please

163
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,090
take these eggs

164
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,440
to him.

165
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,230
His mother died when he was little.

166
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,990
I—I don't know much else.

167
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,680
All I can make is tea eggs.

168
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,540
He's been eating these since he was small.

169
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,870
He just loves the taste.

170
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,430
This child, he's such a fool, right?

171
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,310
Alright.

172
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,410
Thank you for the trouble.

173
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,190
Thank you.

174
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,990
Thank you so much.

175
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,860
I'll be going then. Thanks.

176
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,140
Goodbye, thank you.

177
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,090
Thanks again.

178
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,100
Si Yilin.

179
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,110
I have failed the clan,

180
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,640
failed the countless people.

181
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,970
I await your punishment, Lord Chieftain.

182
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,140
You and the Palace Guards

183
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,610
have no need to feel shame or guilt.

184
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,430
You are true sons of the clan.

185
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,660
As for the loss

186
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,780
of Yuanzhou's lands,

187
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,120
that was a necessary compromise.

188
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,060
The one who should bear the blame

189
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,430
is me, your Chieftain.

190
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,380
Lord Chieftain!

191
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,460
Si Yilin,

192
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,710
all these years I've seen you

193
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,140
as my own son.

194
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,200
How could I ever let my own child

195
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,440
die beneath the North Clan's iron hooves?

196
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,060
Not only could I not bear it,

197
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,630
I would never allow it.

198
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,190
You are the future of this clan.

199
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,500
Only when you return safely

200
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,270
does our clan have hope.

201
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,610
Lord Chieftain, I will

202
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,440
remember your kindness always.

203
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,730
One day,

204
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,790
we'll reclaim
everything our clan has lost.

205
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,620
The Palace Guards are ready at all times.

206
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,350
Your Highness.

207
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,840
She's gone?

208
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,200
She asked me to give this to you

209
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,760
when she left.

210
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,579
Xiu hasn't returned.

211
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,890
He was sent to guard Wayun.

212
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,300
But don't worry, he's safe.

213
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,589
That's… that's good.

214
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,740
As long as he's alive.

215
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,350
Did he leave any message for me?

216
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,800
I… I understand.

217
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,550
What are you thinking?

218
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,650
Chuan, do you think
the Commander fooled us?

219
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,430
Maybe he's already
gone back to the capital?

220
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,960
Did he ask you to just lead us in circles?

221
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,760
He ordered us to return to Wayun,

222
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,600
but something doesn't sit right with me.

223
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,330
That's why
we're waiting here on this main route.

224
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,710
Yeah, but we've been going in circles.

225
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,920
The Palace Guards

226
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,030
must be nearly back
in the Imperial Capital by now.

227
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,220
And we're still stuck out in Yuanzhou.

228
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,680
Exactly. I'm afraid
we won't find him in time,

229
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,010
and the North Clan will catch us first.

230
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,270
Then we'll be done for.

231
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,140
Chuan,

232
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,120
what exactly did Xiu say to you?

233
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,250
Just some nonsense.

234
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,320
Something about burying gold
and wanting to dig it up.

235
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,040
Then we should go find him!

236
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,410
Was he serious or just joking?

237
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,430
Does it matter?

238
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,080
You've followed him this long.
Don't you know him by now?

239
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,320
If everything were fine,

240
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,840
he wouldn't have said something like that.

241
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,440
Just wait, there'll be a surprise.

242
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,820
Any news about Xiu?

243
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,890
Not exactly.

244
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,730
They said the North Clan army
was stationed in force

245
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,370
at the strategic point in Wayun.

246
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,970
Where could Xiu possibly go?

247
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,000
This letter was sent back from Wayun by Lin Bing.

248
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,210
All communication is tightly controlled.

249
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,070
Even Lin Bing couldn't confirm Xiu's whereabouts.

250
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,730
There are many rumors

251
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,280
about Xiu and the Xiu Battalion

252
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,320
in Yuanzhou.

253
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,840
What kind of rumors?

254
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,500
Madam Qing, what brings you here?

255
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,840
Did my uncle send you to rush me again?

256
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,600
I've been practicing
calligraphy and reading.

257
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,160
You can tell my uncle not to worry.

258
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,810
Your Highness,

259
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,120
I bring word from Lord Chieftain himself.

260
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,360
He invites you
to attend an important meeting.

261
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,550
A meeting? And you came in person?

262
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,800
Do you know what it's about?

263
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,680
I do.

264
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,450
Is it urgent?

265
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,600
Very urgent.

266
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,920
Then…

267
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,440
I'll go change first.

268
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,030
Your Highness!

269
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,430
What's wrong?

270
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,730
You look like you want to
say something but don't dare.

271
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,320
I've never seen you like this.

272
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,170
You look like someone

273
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,760
bracing for the worst...

274
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,830
It's not… Xiu…

275
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,490
This isn't something

276
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,890
I should be saying,

277
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,080
but I want you

278
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,320
to be prepared.

279
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,050
Zichuan Xiu has defected.

280
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,930
And then?

281
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,650
He was taken away
by the North Clan general,

282
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,760
Yun Qianxue.

283
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,210
I don't know

284
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,320
where they went.

285
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,410
After that, the North Clan released us.

286
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,360
Think carefully.

287
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,840
Are you sure you didn't
mistake someone else for him?

288
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,730
Sirs,

289
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,100
you've asked me hundreds of times already.

290
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,700
He declared his identity
in front of everyone.

291
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,210
“I am Zichuan Xiu, Deputy Commander
of the Zichuan family.

292
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,330
From today on, I pledge loyalty

293
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,050
to the North Clan.

294
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,490
If

295
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,210
any of you wish to join me,

296
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,360
stand now.

297
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,320
Glory and riches

298
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,760
await.”

299
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,120
You!

300
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,940
We've fought for our clan,

301
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,560
endured torture, refused to yield.

302
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,230
And you, Zichuan Xiu, are a traitor!

303
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,280
A sellout!

304
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,690
That's right! A sellout!

305
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,560
A traitor! A disgrace!

306
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,650
Brothers,

307
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,120
you feel I've lost the Zichuan Clan's honor?

308
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,970
But tell me,

309
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,280
what matters more: honor or survival?

310
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
It wasn't just me.

311
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,970
Ask any of the returning captives,

312
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,410
they all saw it.

313
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,540
You can ask me two hundred more times,

314
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,940
the answer won't change.

315
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,800
Zichuan Xiu's betrayal

316
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,960
is beyond doubt.

317
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,380
Call in the next one.

318
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,590
I've had food and drink

319
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,690
in this cell,

320
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,210
and now they've even brought me

321
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,670
such a fine set of clothes.

322
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,890
General-in-chief, thank you.

323
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,200
May I ask you a few things,

324
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Lord Zichuan Xiu?

325
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,690
Go ahead.

326
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,310
Why did you defect?

327
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,250
As far as I know,

328
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,910
the Zichuan family treated you well.

329
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,460
They did.

330
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
But people

331
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,410
strive to rise.

332
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,080
The Zichuan family
had nothing more to offer me.

333
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,840
Didn't Lei Hong already surrender to you?

334
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,890
I heard he was made a marquis.

335
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,150
He's a duke now.

336
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,760
But you're not like him.

337
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,360
You don't strike me as someone

338
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,550
who'd abandon his ideals for wealth.

339
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,620
You flatter me.

340
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,840
I'm what you'd

341
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,400
call a rare talent.

342
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,730
But I couldn't rise any further
in the Zichuan family.

343
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,760
How long would I have to wait

344
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,910
to be promoted?

345
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,040
If I really wanted to surrender,

346
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,690
wouldn't the Battle of Payi
have been the perfect chance?

347
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,990
You and I could've coordinated.

348
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,080
Taking the city would've been easy.

349
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,650
General-in-chief,

350
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,890
Commander Si Yilin of the Palace Guards

351
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,210
once saved my life.

352
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,960
If I had betrayed them then,

353
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,470
I'd have killed him.

354
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,170
So you were close.

355
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,240
I once risked my life
to defend him for over a month.

356
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,380
That debt's repaid now.

357
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,730
Next time we meet,

358
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,330
we can fight fair and square.

359
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,410
I promise you.

360
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,750
Next time we meet,
if we must fight or kill, so be it.

361
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,360
Are you done with your questions?

362
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,170
If so, I'll take my leave now.

363
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,700
-Thank you.
-Where are your subordinates?

364
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,570
Why didn't they come with you?

365
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,690
Don't even mention them.

366
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,620
Just thinking of them makes me mad.

367
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,570
Shortsighted fools,

368
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,170
refused to come with me.

369
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,690
Compared to me, they lack vision.

370
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,120
Vision?

371
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,040
Exactly. Truth is,

372
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,040
I lived in Yuanzhou,

373
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,800
right on the North Clan border,

374
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,730
and I've fought
on the front lines for years.

375
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,560
So I understand the North Clan

376
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,470
better than most.

377
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,960
And after seeing how weak

378
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,040
the Zichuan Clan was at Payi,

379
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,010
I knew their days were numbered.

380
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,250
A wise bird chooses the right tree.

381
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,320
And that tree, the Zichuan Clan,

382
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,450
is hollow and rotten now.

383
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:36,330
So you sought a new path.

384
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,320
Exactly.

385
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,120
Let me make a bet with you.

386
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,880
Once the North Clan army

387
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,710
moves west of the Wayun Fortress,

388
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,170
people will come flooding in to surrender,

389
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,360
by the thousands.

390
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,930
If I waited until then to defect,

391
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,230
I'd be just another number.

392
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,600
So I acted early.

393
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,320
I'm only telling you this in confidence.

394
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,080
The Divine Emperor

395
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,090
knows how to recognize talent.

396
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,450
As long as you stay
loyal to the North Clan,

397
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,360
you'll receive power

398
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:12,760
far beyond your expectations.

399
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,320
General-in-chief. Sir.

400
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:20,550
I'll be counting on you
to speak kindly on my behalf.

401
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,280
Uncle… Xiu…

402
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,410
Xiu is not that kind of person.

403
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,340
He wouldn't betray his clan.

404
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,620
I don't want to believe it either.

405
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,270
But the captives all said

406
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,690
they saw him defect
to the North Clan with their own eyes.

407
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,690
Then there must be more to the story.

408
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,310
Which is why it's even more urgent

409
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,480
to send someone to Yuanzhou

410
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,140
and investigate thoroughly.

411
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,630
My Lord.

412
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,750
All 50 prisoners

413
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,360
have been interrogated.

414
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,560
Except for the seven absent
due to injury or illness,

415
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,730
the testimonies of the remaining 43

416
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,760
are all here.

417
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,080
Zichuan Xiu did indeed defect publicly.

418
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,320
My Lord, if Zichuan Xiu
truly wanted to defect,

419
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,450
he could have done so

420
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,320
back at Payi.

421
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,520
Why, then, did he lead the Xiu Battalion

422
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,180
to support the Palace Guards,

423
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,930
and fight alongside the clan's forces,
risking his life?

424
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,850
And now the Xiu Battalion

425
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,090
has vanished without a trace.

426
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,020
Enough.

427
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,880
This concerns the clan's honor

428
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,040
and Xiu's life.

429
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,730
The Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs
will begin an investigation,

430
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,190
and a clan assembly
will be held thereafter.

431
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,550
How we define this betrayal

432
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,170
will be decided collectively by the clan.

433
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,700
-Understood
-Understood.

434
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,450
Your Majesty, I've temporarily

435
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,980
placed Zichuan Xiu under strict guard

436
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,390
in the military camp.

437
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,070
Thank you, Your Majesty.

438
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,080
Lord Yun,

439
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,250
in your opinion,

440
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,590
did he truly come to surrender?

441
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,300
I dare not say for certain.

442
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,600
On the day of our withdrawal,

443
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,840
Zichuan Xiu

444
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,040
secretly handed us a note.

445
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,760
At the time, I was

446
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,360
more suspicious than trusting.

447
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
But now that he's

448
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,170
willingly defected

449
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,300
in front of so many Zichuan prisoners,

450
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,690
it's hard to believe he's faking it.

451
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,380
Counsellor,

452
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,430
do you know anything
about this Zichuan Xiu?

453
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,900
I've had people look into him before.

454
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,410
Zichuan Xiu's original name was Lin He.

455
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,660
His birth parents are unknown.

456
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,940
He was adopted as a child

457
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,280
by the former Zichuan Chieftain,
Zichuan Yuanxing,

458
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,140
and granted the surname Zichuan.

459
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,490
He trained
at the Yuanzhou military academy as a youth.

460
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,690
At 13,

461
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,010
when the Liufeng family
attacked the Imperial Capital,

462
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,690
Zichuan Xiu led 800 cadets

463
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,520
to break the siege

464
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,250
of Liufeng Xishan
near the Imperial Capital.

465
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,410
Then he fought seven successive battles

466
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,480
against incoming
Liufeng reinforcements, winning them all,

467
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,650
and ultimately drove Liufeng Xishan

468
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,950
out of Zichuan territory.

469
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,890
He was only 13

470
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,450
and already defeated the Liufeng Xishan?

471
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,930
Truly impressive.

472
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,690
Judging by that,

473
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,490
he was absolutely
loyal to the Zichuan family.

474
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,760
So why would he turn traitor?

475
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,120
If we look for reasons,

476
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,840
after Zichuan Yuanxing's death,

477
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,500
the power holder Yang Minghua

478
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,660
grew wary of him

479
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,210
and sent him to Yuanzhou.

480
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,800
Years later,

481
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,800
he returned and played a key role

482
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,320
in suppressing Yang Minghua's

483
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,730
coup in the Imperial Capital.

484
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,610
Yet afterward,

485
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,460
he was sent off again
to do reserve service.

486
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,080
Given all that,

487
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,650
Zichuan Xiu may well
have developed resentment

488
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,250
toward the Zichuan family.

489
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,780
But a man of honor
doesn't harbor grudges so easily.

490
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,280
What is his character like?

491
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,230
General Yulin,
have you heard of the Xiu Battalion?

492
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,650
It's the unit Zichuan Xiu led.

493
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,660
During wartime,

494
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,390
they opened shops
and used the chaos to profit.

495
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,730
So, it seems Zichuan Xiu

496
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,010
cared more about money

497
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,540
even when the clan faced life and death.

498
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,080
Counsellor, you're suggesting that

499
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,400
through the conduct of the Xiu Battalion,

500
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,350
Zichuan Xiu shows
signs of lacking loyalty,

501
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,800
making his battlefield betrayal

502
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,170
more understandable?

503
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,140
That may not be the whole story.

504
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,890
When I brought Lei Hong back,

505
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,650
he was being pursued by Zichuan Xiu.

506
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:23,120
Zichuan Xiu seemed to despise

507
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,320
traitors to the clan.

508
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:25,800
This surrender

509
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,930
may serve some other purpose.

510
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,830
After all,

511
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,040
none of us are close to him.

512
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,890
It's too early to say

513
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,210
whether he can be trusted.

514
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,250
No matter.

515
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,490
We don't need him to be trustworthy.

516
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,540
You mean, Your Majesty…

517
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,360
Our North Clan nation is powerful,

518
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,690
yet in all these years,

519
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,220
we've never conquered
the entire continent.

520
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,250
Do you know

521
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,760
why we've failed
to subdue the lands west of Yuanzhou?

522
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,490
Your Majesty speaks of… people's hearts?

523
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,360
We cannot conquer

524
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,120
a people united in will.

525
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,550
To conquer them,

526
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,290
we must first shatter their resolve,

527
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,380
and destroy their will to resist.

528
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,730
In that regard,

529
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:21,360
Zichuan Xiu is of great strategic value.

530
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,550
Regardless of whether
he came with hidden motives,

531
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,530
he is the adopted son

532
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,920
of the former Zichuan Chieftain,
Zichuan Yuanxing.

533
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,000
If the North Clan accept him,

534
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,010
it will deal a heavy psychological blow

535
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,730
to the Zichuan family.

536
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:40,120
And once the greedy and disloyal

537
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,640
see how richly

538
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,700
he is rewarded,

539
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,760
they'll come running

540
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,040
to surrender in droves.

541
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,170
So we must not only accept him,

542
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,170
we must

543
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,390
elevate him.

544
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,120
Your Majesty is wise.

545
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,660
Tonight's victory banquet
for the Battle of Payi

546
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,409
will be the perfect occasion.

547
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:13,889
Come on, brothers, let's drink!

548
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:14,719
Come on!

549
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,770
Drink up!

550
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,170
Guys.

551
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,560
Cheers! Cheers!

552
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,889
Drink!

553
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,639
Come on!

554
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:24,810
Drink!

555
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,020
Come, drink!

556
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,639
Come, my two brothers.

557
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,969
Drink up, come on.

558
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:37,520
Cheers!

559
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,010
Here.

560
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:42,889
Have some more.

561
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,600
Keep drinking.

562
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,080
You there.

563
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,090
Why don't you come sit with us?

564
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,940
Tonight is not only our victory banquet,

565
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,320
but also to welcome you
into the North Clan.

566
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,360
I was just admiring
the ladies of your North Clan.

567
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,320
I used to think

568
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,160
Princess Ka Dan
was already very beautiful,

569
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,560
but I didn't expect

570
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,760
there to be so many stunning women here.

571
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,610
Zichuan Xiu, a word of advice,

572
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:50,410
it's best not to joke about our princess.

573
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,370
See?

574
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,450
You just admitted

575
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,410
I was joking.

576
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,290
Come on,

577
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,910
let me introduce you

578
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,470
to some of our North Clan warriors.

579
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,360
Sure.

580
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,970
It's a pleasure.

581
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,240
A pleasure.

582
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,770
Come.

583
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,970
I can't drink anymore.

584
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,410
But there are still so many

585
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,810
people I haven't met yet.

586
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,080
That Prince Ka Dun,

587
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,770
and that...

588
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,480
Pingjing Duke,

589
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,890
none of them are here.

590
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,620
I wanted to toast with them too.

591
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,040
That's General Lu Di,

592
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,160
one of our North Clan's fiercest warriors.

593
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,930
The Zichuan Clan,

594
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,560
they're all

595
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,640
opportunistic cowards.

596
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,010
You know what?

597
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,600
I'd never trust them.

598
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,080
Cheers.

599
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,600
Slandering others behind their backs

600
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,940
doesn't say much for your character.

601
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,370
This here is our North Clan's top warrior,

602
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,720
champion of the warrior arena for years,

603
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,970
a master of the blade.

604
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,890
He certainly looks fierce.

605
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,410
Seems like a true weapons expert.

606
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,520
By the way, Lord Zichuan Xiu,

607
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,970
are there any outstanding bladesmen

608
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,290
in the Zichuan army?

609
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,340
There are countless skilled blade users

610
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,640
in the Zichuan Clan.

611
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,780
But of course,

612
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,220
none could

613
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,450
rival General Yulin.

614
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,450
I'd say there are plenty

615
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,290
in the Zichuan army
who are proficient with the blade,

616
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,020
and surely some who surpass me.

617
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,370
General-in-chief,

618
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,720
tonight's a night of feasting and toasts.

619
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,610
Can we not talk

620
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,300
about battles and bloodshed?

621
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Will Pingjing Duke be coming tonight?

622
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,540
You've mentioned Pingjing Duke
quite a few times this evening.

623
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,170
Do you have some business with him?

624
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,420
Well,

625
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,640
it's a little embarrassing to admit,

626
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,450
but as someone from the Zichuan family,

627
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,770
new to your North Clan,

628
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,430
I'd like to speak with someone

629
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,830
who shares a similar background.

630
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,150
Maybe it'll help me

631
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,010
fit in

632
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,820
faster with your ways.

633
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,480
Your Highness,
you really won't attend the banquet?

634
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,390
I'm not interested.

635
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,500
You may go.

636
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,020
Yes, Your Highness.

637
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,640
Is something the matter?

638
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,850
Your Highness, do you know

639
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,080
that man who just defected

640
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,480
from the Zichuan family?

641
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,200
The other maids said

642
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,980
he's a remarkable man

643
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,040
and very handsome.

644
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,730
What's his name?

645
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,670
Your Highness. He's called...

646
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,040
Zichuan Xiu.

647
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,560
Lord Zichuan Xiu, how do you find the taste

648
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,600
of our North Clan wine?

649
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,390
It's far better

650
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,280
than anything we have in Zichuan.

651
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,490
Honestly,

652
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,010
I really can't drink anymore.

653
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,640
I... I must...

654
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,890
That's Prince Ka Dun.

655
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:35,060
And behind him is Pingjing Duke.

656
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,710
[Lei Hong]

657
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,720
So you're Lord Zichuan Xiu, the one

658
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,120
who defected to our clan?

659
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,520
That would be me.

660
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,920
Welcome to our great North Clan.

661
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,620
Thank you for welcoming me into the North Clan.

662
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,560
I'll devote myself wholeheartedly

663
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,250
and serve Your Highness with all I have.

664
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,260
Allow me to toast to you.

665
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,810
You people from the Zichuan family

666
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,010
always so quick to cozy up to the strong.

667
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,090
You switch sides the moment

668
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,240
your life's on the line,

669
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,320
and now you have the nerve
to play the loyal dog?

670
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,950
This toast is for Your Highness.

671
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:57,180
Your Highness, this man

672
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,660
once tried to have me killed in Yuanzhou.

673
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,410
Not a single word

674
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,640
from his mouth can be trusted.

675
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,010
Pingjing Duke,

676
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,600
after this cup,

677
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,790
the next one will be for you.

678
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,370
What's the rush?

679
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,600
Long time no see.

680
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:31,590
Lord Lei, I hope you've been well.

681
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,010
Lord Ge Yingxing

682
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,520
sends his regards.

683
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,230
Those who betray Zichuan

684
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,430
shall be executed without mercy.
