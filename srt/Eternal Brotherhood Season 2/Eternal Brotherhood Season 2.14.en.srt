[Episode 14]

3
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,870
You two, go check over there.

4
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,320
you two, go over there.

5
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,720
After him!

6
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,160
I'm here!

7
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:14,820
After him!

8
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,890
Retreat!

9
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,540
General, I came too late to your rescue.

10
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,990
You're here. That's all that matters.

11
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,660
General, are you alright?

12
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,230
Third Brother,
I've met with the guards from home.

13
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,110
That blade is too valuable.
I'll keep it for you for now.

14
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,630
Third... Brother?

15
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,780
I am King of Light of Yuanzhou.

16
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,780
I finally made it back to my hometown.

17
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,210
I've already run out of my rations

18
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,210
before I could gather any supplies.

19
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,800
Even my blade is gone.

20
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,750
So miserable.

21
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,040
It's alright.

22
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,350
I...

23
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,370
What?

24
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,890
Prince Ka Dun is coming
to supervise the battle himself?

25
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,650
That must not happen!

26
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,480
Just tell him
there's a plague outbreak in Yuanzhou.

27
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,860
The situation is very serious.

28
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,850
I'll invite him over

29
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,250
once it's under control.

30
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:36,950
My Lord,

31
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,560
maybe we shouldn't keep hiding the truth.

32
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,360
We must win a solid victory

33
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,880
to give the prince a proper explanation!

34
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,480
Where are the soldiers I asked for?

35
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,940
They've arrived. 50,000 soldiers in total.

36
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,010
I wanted to win a swift victory

37
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,530
and take the sacred temple in one strike.

38
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,260
But we ended up stirring a hornet's nest.

39
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,630
Just dealing with the uprisings everywhere

40
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,560
has drained too much of our forces.

41
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,610
Let's stick to the original plan.

42
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,190
Strike directly at their headquarters!

43
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,090
Notify all units
we'll set out immediately.

44
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,430
Attack Bulu Village!

45
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,970
Kill King of Light!

46
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,310
Yes!

47
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,530
The team is still searching for supplies.

48
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,820
I'm afraid we won't be able
to hold out much longer.

49
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,900
Report!

50
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,050
Lu Di is leading
50,000 North Clan soldiers,

51
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,440
marching straight toward Bulu Village!

52
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,700
It seems they intend to take the village!

53
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,400
Don't panic!

54
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,230
Thankfully, Lord Xiu left us this pouch

55
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,200
before he left.

56
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,050
Surrender?

57
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,610
Next time. For sure.

58
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,180
Definitely.

59
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,060
No one is guarding the village?

60
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,860
What is King of Light up to?

61
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,310
King of Light is cunning.

62
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,720
This must be another one of his tricks.

63
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,630
Eyes. Watch your eyes.

64
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,760
I am the first deputy general
under King of Light.

65
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
On behalf of all the villagers here,

66
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,370
we surrender!

67
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,410
[We surrender]

68
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,970
Come out now.

69
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,130
What trick is King of Light playing now?

70
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,770
My Lord, I'd like to know that too.

71
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,070
King of Light heard that you, Lord Lu Di,

72
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,280
were coming with 50,000 soldiers
to attack Bulu Village,

73
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,520
so he packed up and fled last night.

74
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,000
When everyone else knew
King of Light had left,

75
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,870
they also ran off.

76
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,920
Only us—the old, weak, sick, and crippled—

77
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,680
were left in the village.

78
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,340
We know King of Light can't be relied on.

79
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,410
Instead of fighting a hopeless battle,

80
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,750
it's better for us to surrender.

81
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,580
My Lord, please be magnanimous

82
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,680
and merciful.

83
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,800
We're willing
to offer Bulu Village to you!

84
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,470
Don't move!

85
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,580
My Lord, the gates are open.

86
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,110
Please enter.

87
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,990
My Lord, it seems
there really aren't many guards.

88
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,860
We've brought enough soldiers this time.

89
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,990
Even if King of Light set a trap inside,

90
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,960
we don't need to be afraid of him.

91
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,270
Nobody move!

92
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,870
Guys!

93
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,500
Let's begin our show.

94
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,220
Stop.

95
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,330
Control the rhythm.

96
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,010
If we overact, he won't believe it.

97
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:17,980
My Lord!

98
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,790
Bulu Village has surrendered!

99
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,940
We won't fight back!

100
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,080
Please enter!

101
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,160
My Lord!

102
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,020
My Lord, what did you hear?

103
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,950
Nobody move!

104
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,400
Tell them to retreat.

105
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,630
My Lord, there's an ambush
outside the village.

106
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,820
If we go in now,

107
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,700
we'll walk right into their trap.

108
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,440
My Lord, wise move.

109
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,650
Watch your eyes.

110
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,560
King of Light

111
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,740
is not that clever.

112
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,680
Such a cheap trick

113
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,440
can only fool rookies.

114
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,250
I won't fall for it.

115
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,150
My Lord, what should we do now?

116
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,060
We have already won!

117
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,610
That's what we'll do.

118
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,670
I've seen through King of Light's trick!

119
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,530
The outcome is clear!

120
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,700
We surround the village

121
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,880
and wait for them to run out of supplies!

122
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,120
Wise as ever, My Lord!

123
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,600
Wise as ever, My Lord!

124
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,870
Wise as ever, My Lord!

125
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,360
Wise as ever, My Lord!

126
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,150
Wise as ever, My Lord!

127
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,550
Wise as ever, My Lord!

128
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,390
-Wise as ever, My Lord!
-Let's go.

129
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,720
Hurry.

130
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,030
Wise as ever, My Lord!

131
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,510
Wise as ever, My Lord!

132
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,120
Wise as ever, My Lord!

133
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,720
Wise as ever, My Lord!

134
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,440
Wise as ever, My Lord!

135
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,980
Wise as ever, My Lord!

136
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,890
[Surrender]

137
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,430
That actually worked.

138
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,450
Lu Di's army

139
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,730
has really retreated.

140
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,780
Looks like

141
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,730
they won't attack us anytime soon.

142
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,640
Being his subordinates

143
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,300
really taxes the brain.

144
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,450
He solved Bulu Village's crisis

145
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,550
even though he's in Imperial Capital.

146
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,810
He's worthy of the title of King of Light.

147
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,200
King of Light?

148
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,280
That's right.

149
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,580
But I haven't reported it

150
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,060
to Zichuan's court.

151
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,150
I got the news from my scouts.

152
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,080
They say King of Light

153
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,320
always wears a mask.

154
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,480
He's been leading Yuanzhou's races
to fight against the North Clan.

155
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,840
But his identity hasn't been confirmed.

156
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,610
Di Lin, you haven't reported it

157
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,110
because you think this King of Light...

158
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,870
I'm not sure.

159
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,950
But wearing a mask and playing mysterious—

160
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,280
that does feel like something he would do.

161
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,970
He's pretty good at playing tricks now.

162
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,060
Wait.

163
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,630
Even if he really is King of Light,

164
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,420
he's still a traitor to the family

165
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,650
since he openly

166
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,150
fought against the North Clan.

167
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,900
So,

168
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,910
that isn't really good news.

169
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,750
By the way,

170
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,070
take a look at this.

171
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,370
The Liufeng family?

172
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,000
This is a letter from Liufeng Ming.

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,660
He said Liufeng Shuang
has betrayed her family.

174
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,990
If it weren't for their internal turmoil,

175
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,060
I wouldn't have easily taken

176
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,260
three cities in a row.

177
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,510
The letter says

178
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,670
Liufeng Shuang

179
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,760
fled from the Liufeng family
towards Zichuan.

180
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,270
They want us
to keep an eye out for her whereabouts.

181
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,930
If we capture Liufeng Shuang,

182
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
they're willing to open up
the five border provinces

183
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,090
and won't engage Zichuan
in any military conflict for three years.

184
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,860
That's so insincere.

185
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,790
Given the current situation,

186
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,320
they're unable to launch any big campaigns

187
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,790
within three years anyway.

188
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,720
But no matter what,

189
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,970
we still need to find her first.

190
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,580
Whether we use her to trade for peace

191
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,650
or as a deterrent

192
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,370
will be entirely up to us.

193
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,310
Do we have any news on her whereabouts?

194
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,440
The letter was received this morning.

195
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,670
But two days ago,

196
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,320
my scouts found traces

197
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,210
of the Black Tiger Gang's members
outside the city.

198
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,410
The Black Tiger Gang?

199
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,200
The Liufeng family's assassin group,
right?

200
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,220
Yes.

201
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,960
That means

202
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,530
they failed to intercept Liufeng Shuang.

203
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,320
It's very likely

204
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,870
that Liufeng Shuang
has entered Imperial Capital.

205
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,120
Liufeng Shuang, female,

206
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,910
fierce-looking, skilled in disguise,

207
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,170
and highly trained in martial arts.

208
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,630
Anyone who reports her whereabouts
will be heavily rewarded.

209
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,230
Looks like the Zichuan family

210
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,430
has some misunderstandings about you.

211
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
Sinister and cunning—

212
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,810
that's their biggest misunderstanding.

213
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,510
Every victory we've won
was open and honorable.

214
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,270
I can hardly accept
such undeserved praise.

215
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,190
But it seems

216
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,890
they now know we're in Imperial Capital.

217
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,900
The Black Tiger Gang probably knows too.

218
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,740
We...

219
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,000
I think we'd better leave first.

220
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,950
If we want to go to the Lin family,

221
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,600
we have to pass through Zichuan.

222
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,790
And we still need medicine for injuries.

223
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,850
Imperial Capital is our best option.

224
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,330
Besides, there're lots of people
in Imperial Capital.

225
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,440
It makes it harder
for the Black Tiger Gang

226
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,510
to track us down.

227
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,390
But I suppose the inns in Imperial Capital

228
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,920
are now under strict surveillance.

229
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,490
Where exactly should we go?

230
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,430
Let me ask you,

231
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,600
if the Zichuan family is hunting down
a woman with everything they've got,

232
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,800
where is the one place

233
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,670
she would never go?

234
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,840
Mr. Peng, it's rare to see you come.

235
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,140
[Mingyue]

236
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,870
I didn't expect you to show up
for the courtesan competition today.

237
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,060
Mingyue, you are the best
in Chunfeng Garden.

238
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,670
Why would you care
about the courtesan's title?

239
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,550
Who are you?

240
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,390
It's you.

241
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,710
You still owe me money.

242
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,140
And you dare show up here?

243
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,890
Well, here I am.

244
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,260
Come upstairs with me.

245
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,960
Didn't you defect from Zichuan?

246
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,020
Imperial Capital is looking for you now.

247
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,170
You've got some nerve coming back.

248
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,170
Do you want to die?

249
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,350
Why did you come back this time?

250
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,670
Mingyue,

251
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,930
I'll be straightforward with you.

252
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,510
This time, I need you to help me find

253
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,480
a grain merchant.

254
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,130
Mind you, a big one.

255
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,530
That's it?

256
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,430
That's it.

257
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,600
Okay. But you'll have to wait a bit.

258
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,570
Today

259
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,190
is the courtesan selection.

260
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,840
Once it's over,

261
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
I'll handle it for you immediately.

262
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,320
Okay. I'll be right here,

263
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,380
waiting patiently for you to return.

264
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,240
Okay.

265
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,350
Two people?

266
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,070
With so much money,

267
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,620
why don't you stay in an inn?

268
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,300
Can you stop asking questions now?

269
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
See that woodshed?

270
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,270
You stay there tonight.

271
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,660
Although this place is quite shabby,

272
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,470
it's relatively safe.

273
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,640
What's wrong?

274
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,790
One of the two people

275
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,150
who just walked past

276
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,800
was wearing our family's jade pendant.

277
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,630
Why would someone from our family
be in Imperial Capital?

278
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,440
That might explain how my whereabouts

279
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
got leaked.

280
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,370
Should we go to another place then?

281
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,790
No need.

282
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,390
You go to the woodshed first.

283
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,080
I'll go inside
and see what I can find out.

284
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,670
Okay. Be careful.

285
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,240
She's interested
in this kind of thing too?

286
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,600
Whether you are old or young,

287
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,750
as long as you're here, you're our guests.

288
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,440
Today, you lucky folks are in for a treat.

289
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,450
Every single lady from Chunfeng Garden

290
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,770
is present and dressed to dazzle!

291
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,109
Today is the day

292
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:15,030
for selecting our monthly courtesan.

293
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,400
If any lady catches your attention,

294
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,589
spend as much money as you can on her.

295
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,310
Chunfeng Garden's ladies

296
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,960
love nothing but money.

297
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,790
The lady with the most silver

298
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,830
and silk coins before her

299
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,880
will become Chunfeng Garden's courtesan

300
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,400
for this month.

301
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,440
And the guest who contributes
the most to her victory

302
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,640
will get the chance to drink

303
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,200
under the moon
and spend the night with her.

304
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
-Great!
-Great!

305
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,310
The selection of the courtesan begins now!

306
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,510
-Great!
-Great!

307
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,080
Let's go.

308
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,030
It's me.

309
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,950
Zhang Asan? What are you doing here?

310
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,990
I'll help you lure them away.

311
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,920
Hide first.

312
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,730
How am I supposed to hide here?

313
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,110
Just dance with them.

314
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,970
Start dancing, and it'll be fine.

315
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,550
Hurry up!

316
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,880
Hurry. Go now.

317
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,100
I'll help you deliver it.

318
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,800
-Great!
-Great!

319
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,370
-Great!
-Great!

320
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,680
Gentlemen.

321
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,820
Get out of my way!

322
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,460
Gentlemen.

323
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,940
Are you looking for a lady?

324
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,440
A lady in casual clothes just walked past.

325
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,610
Did you see her?

326
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,320
A lady in casual clothes?

327
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,160
I remember.

328
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,550
There was indeed a lady in casual clothes

329
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,050
going out from here.

330
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,350
Are you sure?

331
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,110
I'm sure.

332
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,000
Let's go.

333
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,270
Goodbye, gentlemen.

334
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,160
-Great!
-Great!

335
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,790
-Great!
-Great!

336
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,420
I announce

337
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,160
the courtesan today is...

338
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,550
It must be Yu!

339
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,410
Yes, yes!

340
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,080
The courtesan today

341
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,960
is Yu!

342
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,980
Why?

343
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,960
We all spent money!

344
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,480
That's right!

345
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,270
Quiet!

346
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,510
It must be me who spent the most money.

347
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,310
We spent money too!

348
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,030
We all spent money!

349
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,090
You're not convinced, huh?

350
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,950
Then take out your money,
and let's see who has more!

351
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,310
I can't believe Yu.

352
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,210
She left without saying a word.

353
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,660
Didn't I tell you to stay in the room?

354
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,260
You always cause me trouble.

355
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,110
Who's that lady just now?

356
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,750
She took the courtesan's title from me.

357
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,160
In my heart,

358
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,280
Mingyue, you're

359
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,000
the only courtesan.

360
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,260
Just now,

361
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,930
I was just helping my friend.

362
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,640
You're very rich now.

363
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,270
This time,

364
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,330
I've repaid all the favors I owed you.

365
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,810
Oh no, my blade!

366
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,690
That guy is indeed from Imperial Capital.

367
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,530
The Black Tiger Gang is here too.

368
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,430
We can't stay here any longer.

369
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,200
I have ample grain stored
in the granaries in the northwest.

370
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,330
How much do you want?

371
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,920
A lot.

372
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,510
How much is "a lot"?

373
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,530
Enough to feed a whole city.

374
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,210
A whole city?

375
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,240
Why do you need so much grain?

376
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,930
Mr. Feng,

377
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,080
you know what? My hometown, Bulu Village,

378
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,110
barely has any grain left now.

379
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,010
Bulu Village?

380
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,940
It's not because we don't have money.

381
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,420
It's because we have no rice.

382
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,200
Isn't it in Yuanzhou?

383
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,920
Yuanzhou was given
to the North Clan long ago.

384
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,350
Besides, even though you don't have grain,

385
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,060
you can't ship grain
from the Zichuan family.

386
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,950
No.

387
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,430
A transaction of this scale—

388
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,930
if the North Clan finds out

389
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,700
the grain is from the Zichuan family,

390
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,530
it could easily spark serious conflict.

391
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,720
Even I'd be in deep trouble.

392
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,400
Well, I'm sorry that your hometown

393
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,510
has fallen into the North Clan's hands.

394
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,350
I do sympathize with you.

395
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,370
I really want to help you with this.

396
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,750
Well...

397
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,160
Still, no.

398
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,840
Mr. Feng,

399
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,270
don't worry about the money.

400
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,740
I promise

401
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,240
I will pay in cash

402
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,090
for every batch.

403
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,160
It really isn't about the money.

404
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,510
The deal is big

405
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,750
and involves two clans.

406
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,430
If something goes wrong...

407
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,580
Alright. How about this?

408
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,230
You buy grain

409
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,270
in Zichuan on behalf of me.

410
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,110
No need to ship it directly to Yuanzhou.

411
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,970
My men

412
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,770
will handle the delivery in Zichuan.

413
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,510
Even if the cross-border shipments
are ever discovered,

414
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,160
they'll only trace it to my men.

415
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,920
In this regard,

416
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,160
it's truly risk-free for you.

417
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
Buying grain on your behalf?

418
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,700
Since the peace talks with the North Clan,

419
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,350
the borders have been stable.

420
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,990
Zichuan has been able to
devote itself fully to production.

421
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,270
With abundant rainfall
in the south this year,

422
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,790
statistics from
the Ministry of Government Supervision

423
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,750
show that the grain and textile output

424
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,000
over the past quarter has completely

425
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,510
returned to pre-war levels.

426
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,910
Yes, the success of the peace talks
is of great significance.

427
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,340
The credit should go to Di Lin.

428
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,020
The successful outcome
of the peace talks today

429
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,250
proves how far-sighted he was back then.

430
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,750
Thank you for your praise, My Lord.

431
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,480
But there's one thing worth our attention.

432
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,200
Go on.

433
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,070
While Zichuan's production
of grain and goods is rising,

434
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,400
our treasury and military reserves
are far from sufficient.

435
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,790
As far as I know,

436
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,790
the most important reason

437
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,450
is the existence
of smuggling along the borders.

438
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,350
Many supplies have been sold
at high prices to Yuanzhou,

439
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,240
and even to the Lin family.

440
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,570
Merchants seek profit.

441
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,450
That's only natural.

442
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,070
But why has the Lin family purchased
so many supplies?

443
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,680
That's what should concern us.

444
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,680
The Lin family has always been close
to the Liufeng family.

445
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,810
Those supplies are likely
for the Liufeng family's use.

446
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,790
The Liufeng family is currently
in the midst of internal strife.

447
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,160
But once they catch a breath,

448
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,900
they'll surely pose a threat

449
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,350
along our borders soon.

450
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,600
Everyone,

451
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,480
do you have countermeasures in mind?

452
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,040
In fact, the issue has existed
for a long time.

453
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,070
I wonder if you remember

454
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,800
the Supplies Restriction Act?

455
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,920
I remember.

456
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,360
The Supplies Restriction Act

457
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,820
was enacted during Lord Yuanxing's tenure.

458
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,610
It has never been enforced over the years.

459
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,200
The act was established

460
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,860
precisely to prevent
what we're seeing now.

461
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,370
It's just that back then,
frequent border conflicts

462
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,200
made restoring order the top priority,
not the regulation

463
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,860
of agriculture and commerce.

464
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,680
But now, Zichuan is enjoying
its most peaceful period.

465
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,920
It is the perfect time to reintroduce

466
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,110
and enforce this act.

467
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,010
How about this?

468
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,570
Let

469
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,440
the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs
oversee this matter.

470
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
While monitoring the border trade routes,

471
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,250
they can also gather more intelligence.

472
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,510
Di Lin.

473
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,720
Without intelligence,
we're doomed to fail.

474
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,400
With intelligence, victory can be secured.

475
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:37,290
To know both yourself and your enemy
is the sure path to winning every battle.

476
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:38,920
Understood.

477
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,240
Mr. Feng, what took you so long?

478
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,700
I've been waiting for you.

479
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,420
Don't even ask. The goods aren't coming.

480
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,400
I came to let you know

481
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,460
our deal's off.

482
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,330
What happened?

483
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,400
You haven't heard?

484
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Early this morning, Imperial Capital

485
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,550
issued a revised version

486
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,410
of the Supplies Restriction Act.

487
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,650
They're tightening control
over all border trades.

488
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,470
And

489
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,100
the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs
is investigating.

490
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,610
I'm well aware of their methods.

491
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,940
You'd better find someone else. Goodbye.

492
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:14,940
Mr. Feng!

493
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,050
The Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs?

494
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,830
Am I beautiful?

495
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,370
Yes. You're the most beautiful of all.

496
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,380
Xiujia, here. Have some water.

497
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,210
Get some rest.

498
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,360
Why are those ladies from Chunfeng Garden

499
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,040
gathering in our shop?

500
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,390
He's back?

501
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,540
He's finally back.

502
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,200
Di Lin.

503
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,750
King of Light?

504
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,750
Di Lin,

505
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,890
you don't really think
I betrayed Zichuan, do you?

506
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,420
I sided with the North Clan

507
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,810
for one purpose only—

508
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,260
to kill Lei Hong

509
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,610
and avenge Lord Ge.

510
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,350
You planned to return to Imperial Capital
with Lei Hong's head

511
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,610
and claim your reward.

512
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,440
But Divine Emperor tricked you.

513
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,240
He appointed you
as the Grand Marshal of Yuanzhou.

514
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,790
With no way to prove your innocence,
you had no choice but to stay in Yuanzhou.

515
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,880
Di Lin, you know me best.

516
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,740
I don't need to explain anything.

517
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,610
Since your heart is with Zichuan,

518
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,280
why did you become King of Light?

519
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,480
Di Lin, becoming King of Light

520
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,070
was a pure accident.

521
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,160
The Xiu Battalion's men and I were running

522
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,790
guerrilla operations in Yuanzhou.

523
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,390
The North Clan was oppressing
the Yuanzhou people and even tried

524
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,430
to desecrate the sacred temple.

525
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,750
So I led my troops
and drove out Lu Di's men.

526
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,240
That Elder Budan in Yuanzhou

527
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,210
thought very highly of me.

528
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,170
He insisted I become King of Light.

529
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,240
So you're saying they forced you?

530
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,920
Yes.

531
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,310
You were very reluctant, huh?

532
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:25,960
Of course.

533
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,920
Talk properly!

534
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,970
Di Lin, you have no idea.

535
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,880
I thought long and hard.

536
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,160
Since things had come to that,

537
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,970
how could I just walk away?

538
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,030
If I left right after the battle,

539
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,010
they would still be disorganized.

540
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,730
They'd still be bullied by the North Clan.

541
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,040
So, after much consideration,

542
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,640
I reluctantly agreed to be King of Light.

543
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,750
It seems it was really against your will.

544
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,910
Indeed.

545
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,310
But do you know

546
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,420
that confirms your betrayal of Zichuan?

547
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,510
Don't worry.

548
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,630
Once I defeat the North Clan,

549
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,080
I'll return to Zichuan with Yuanzhou.

550
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,550
You brat.

551
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,250
You didn't even send a letter.

552
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,330
Yilin and I were so worried about you.

553
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,240
Di Lin, I'm sorry.

554
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,700
I should have come back to you sooner.

555
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,200
It's been so long.

556
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,710
How have you been?

557
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,770
We've been fine.

558
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,680
You didn't just come back

559
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,670
for a bath, did you?

560
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,540
I came back this time

561
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,890
to ask you

562
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,630
for a small favor.

563
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,700
You're King of Light.
You're asking me for a favor?

564
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Di Lin,

565
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,270
it's the new act.

566
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,690
I came back to Zichuan

567
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,170
to raise grain.

568
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,220
But with the new act,

569
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,450
I can't get anything out of here.

570
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,950
I'm at my wit's end.

571
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,750
That's why I came to you for help.

572
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,120
Okay. I'll figure something out for you.

573
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,440
But...

574
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,550
You're not asking me for money, are you?

575
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,710
Of course you have to pay.

576
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,430
I...

577
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,120
Can I get a discount?

578
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,640
No.

579
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,150
So heartless, Di Lin.

580
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,920
You know I've been having

581
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,110
a hard time in Yuanzhou.

582
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,750
I'm so pitiful...

583
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,410
Fine.

584
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,180
I can help raise some grain privately.

585
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,180
But if you want long-term supplies,

586
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,110
you'll still have to buy from Zichuan.

587
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,170
You can't take advantage of Zichuan.

588
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,360
As long as I get the grain, it's fine.

589
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,920
Let's go find Yilin.

590
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:30,950
Di Lin.

591
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,960
I can't see Yilin.

592
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,000
Why not?

593
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,940
With my current identity,

594
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,400
meeting him would only bring him trouble.

595
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,320
You know his temper.

596
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,480
If he sees me and acts on impulse,

597
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,680
he might tie me up
and take me to Lord Chieftain.

598
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,880
Lord Chieftain doesn't really like me.

599
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,790
But tomorrow is his wedding day.

600
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,030
Wedding?

601
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,300
Let's have a drink. Just the two of us.

602
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,970
Now?

603
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,440
Aren't we drinking later anyway?

604
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,500
That's different.

605
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,070
Later, it'll be noisy and chaotic.

606
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,800
None of those drinks
will truly reach your heart.

607
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,490
Come on.

608
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,260
Look what good wine I brought you.

609
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,190
Monkey Brew?

610
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,680
I haven't seen this wine
for a long time either.

611
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,830
A few days ago,

612
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,640
I got it from a wine merchant

613
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,960
that Xiujia knows.

614
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,520
I specially prepared it for you.

615
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,510
Back in Yuanzhou's military academy,

616
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,370
every time Xiu drank this wine...

617
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,870
♪ I remove my heavy armor ♪

618
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,640

Come on.

00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,760
Lord Si Yilin is getting married tonight.

645
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,000
We should drink heartily!

646
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,840
No going home sober!

647
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,800
-Okay! No going home sober!
-Okay! No going home sober!

648
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,960
No going home sober!

649
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,710
Let's go!

650
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,010
My Lord,

651
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,610
why are we following the Palace Guards?

652
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,760
I planned to leave Imperial Capital
after recovering.

653
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,960
But now they're not only checking people.

654
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,690
Since the new act was enforced,

655
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,110
inspections everywhere
have gotten much tighter.

656
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,710
Now, if we want to leave the city,

657
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,640
we'll need a special travel permit

658
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,510
or an access token from one of

659
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,440
Zichuan's classified departments.

660
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,440
You're targeting
one of the Palace Guards' officers?

661
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,760
Didn't they just say

662
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,000
Si Yilin is getting married today?

663
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,240
We'll do it
after they eat and drink enough.

664
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,110
It'll be much safer that way.

665
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,800
Si Yilin,

666
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,370
the most outstanding young talent
of the Zichuan family,

667
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:59,770
and Li Qing are getting married
on this auspicious day.

668
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,520
As the Chieftain of the family,

669
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,590
I'm very happy
to officiate at their wedding.

670
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,200
Yilin,

671
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,000
congratulations on your wedding.

672
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,730
Ka Dan, I attended today's wedding

673
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,290
on your behalf.

674
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,380
I remember
the first time you fell for him—

675
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
it was right here.

676
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,990
At that time, Si Yilin

677
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,500
was listening to you saying "thanks".

678
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,830
But he just stood there,

679
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:48,920
