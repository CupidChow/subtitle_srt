[Eternal Brotherhood 2]

2
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,720
[Episode 1]

3
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,280
On the vast land of Xichuan,

4
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,720
various family forces
are deeply intertwined.

5
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,430
Among them, Zichuan and the North Clan

6
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,950
have been at war for years,

7
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,550
evenly matched in strength.

8
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,200
Zichuan Xiu, an orphan,

9
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,150
was adopted from a young age
by Zichuan Yuanxing,

10
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,210
the Chieftain of the Zichuan family.

11
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,840
He grew up alongside
the family's heiress, Zichuan Ning,

12
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,360
and formed a deep childhood bond with her.

13
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,280
He also became sworn brothers
with Di Lin, the Minister

14
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,710
of Military and Legal Affairs,
and Si Yilin,

15
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,280
commander of the Palace Guards.

16
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,710
The three of them swore to protect

17
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,680
the peace of Zichuan together.

18
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,280
After being exiled to
the distant frontier of Yuanzhou

19
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,190
for many years, Zichuan Xiu

20
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,430
achieved great military success

21
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,310
and returned triumphantly
to the Imperial Capital,

22
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,800
only to find that the clan
was already riddled with crisis.

23
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,190
Internally, Yang Minghua
harbored grand ambitions

24
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,520
and plotted treachery.

25
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,400
Externally, the North Clan stirred unrest

26
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,200
at the borders, ready to invade.

27
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,590
Zichuan Xiu joined forces
with Di Lin and Si Yilin

28
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,470
to quell Yang Minghua's rebellion,

29
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,310
successfully defending
the Imperial Capital.

30
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,030
However, they were unable to

31
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,400
halt the rising conflict at the frontier.

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,030
Yang Minghua's trusted general, Lei Hong,

33
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,750
colluded with the North Clan

34
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,590
and launched a full-scale invasion
against Zichuan,

35
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,800
capturing the last line of defense,

36
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,750
Payi City.

37
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,590
Zichuan Xiu and Si Yilin

38
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,840
rushed to Payi,

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,400
recaptured the city
through a clever strategy,

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,560
and seriously wounded the enemy general,

41
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,310
dealing a major blow to the North Clan.

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,870
However,

43
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,560
the North Clan sent Lei Hong again

44
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,000
to lead a massive army to attack Payi.

45
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,000
Food was scarce in the city,

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,930
and the casualties were mounting.

47
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,630
Zichuan Xiu and Si Yilin,

48
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,630
with only a handful of troops,

49
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,810
were forced into a desperate defense.

50
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,360
At this critical moment,
Di Lin, who was guarding the capital,

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,030
was ordered to lead
reinforcements to Payi.

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,890
The three brothers were finally reunited

53
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,590
and resolved to fight side by side

54
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,000
to defend Zichuan to the end.

55
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,820
You're just walking right into a trap.

56
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,690
Didn't you just say that

57
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,950
their actions were incredibly foolish?

58
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,470
That's right.

59
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,270
Those two are the biggest fools.

60
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,820
And I'm the third fool.

61
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,050
My Lady, there's an official
requesting an audience.

62
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,700
He doesn't look familiar.

63
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,630
Could he be some newly appointed official

64
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,360
trying to curry favor with you?

65
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,810
His name is Ma Wei.

66
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,180
I'll go ask him to leave.

67
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,170
He's not just some random new official.

68
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,550
[Zichuan Ning]

69
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,930
He's the youngest advisor
of the Three Central Offices.

70
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,780
I've sent several people to Yuanzhou

71
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,370
to search for Lord Xiu's whereabouts.

72
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,780
Initially, there were no results,

73
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,909
but just yesterday,

74
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,580
my men finally located
Xiu Battalion's camp.

75
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,220
By the time we arrived at the camp,

76
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,420
it was already deserted.
Lord Xiu was nowhere to be found.

77
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,220
However, upon inspection,

78
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,220
[Ma Wei, Member of Three Central Offices]

79
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,960
the camp showed
no signs of being attacked.

80
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,010
It's clear that the soldiers
retreated in an orderly manner.

81
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,170
I believe

82
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,040
Lord Xiu was perfectly fine when he left.

83
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,880
If Lord Xiu left the camp safely,

84
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,530
[Mei]

85
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,150
then he might already
be on his way back with troops.

86
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,980
That's great news, Your Highness.

87
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,700
That guy always seems to
run faster than anyone,

88
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,710
but he would never

89
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,070
abandon Si Yilin alone.

90
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,550
He must have received some information

91
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,040
and left the camp to offer support.

92
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,930
In that case,

93
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,630
with Lord Xiu's assistance,

94
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,990
Lord Si Yilin will be

95
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,659
greatly empowered.

96
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,460
It's just that this time,
the North Clan has overwhelming forces.

97
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,900
I fear that even with
the two of them joining forces,

98
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,430
they still won't be able to
hold their ground.

99
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,250
But if they

100
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,460
are really together,

101
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,380
they can support each other.

102
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,070
Once the frontline battle begins,

103
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,600
word will surely reach
the Imperial Capital.

104
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,830
And so far, there has been no bad news.

105
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,770
It means that at least
they are safe for now.

106
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,340
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

107
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,610
I will continue searching

108
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,140
for Lord Xiu and Lord Si Yilin's
whereabouts.

109
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,760
If I receive any news,
I will report it at once.

110
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,950
Then I thank you in advance, Lord Ma Wei.

111
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,270
Looks like Lord Chieftain
was overthinking it.

112
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,340
What is it?

113
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,290
Lord Chieftain was worried

114
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,460
that this kind of news

115
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,920
would make Your Highness
even more anxious.

116
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,890
But I had already promised Your Highness,

117
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,200
so I couldn't lie.

118
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,900
I could only tell the truth.

119
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,730
I didn't expect that

120
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,350
Your Highness wouldn't
lose composure at all.

121
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,510
That's because I've been toughened

122
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,610
by Zichuan Xiu.

123
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,340
When he was away in Yuanzhou
for seven years,

124
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,570
he was always

125
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,540
getting lost in the desert,

126
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,810
or his whole army was caught
in fierce battles.

127
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,630
This time, with Si Yilin by his side,

128
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,090
I'm actually more at ease.

129
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,870
Your Highness truly has

130
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,070
a deep affection for Lord Xiu.

131
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,700
What?

132
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,070
Fearing that Your Highness might worry,

133
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,909
I specially arranged a place
for you to relax.

134
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,780
But now it seems

135
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,830
I was worrying unnecessarily.

136
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,560
Never mind.

137
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,980
Let's postpone the visit.

138
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,630
I'll take my leave now.

139
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,320
If any further news
from the front lines comes,

140
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,650
I will immediately inform Your Highness.

141
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,010
Lord Ma Wei, please wait.

142
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,930
I wonder what kind of arrangements

143
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,240
you have already made.

144
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,420
I found a few fine horses

145
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,110
and was hoping Your Highness
could try them out with me.

146
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,440
But if today is not a good time...

147
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,840
I once had a beloved horse too,

148
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,930
but it got lost.

149
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,480
Let's go.

150
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,370
After you.

151
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,530
Why do I feel like

152
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,980
I've been here before?

153
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,420
Your Highness,

154
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,140
actually, we met once
when we were children.

155
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:17,840
Right here.

156
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,260
When you came with
Lord Chieftain back then,

157
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,720
you said this road was beautiful,

158
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,720
but the sunlight was harsh and blinding.

159
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,570
You wished for shade along the way,

160
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,770
so it would be more comfortable to walk.

161
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,200
Then I pleaded with my father

162
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,610
to plant trees on both sides of the road.

163
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,770
Now, even under the blazing sun,

164
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,300
it feels cool and pleasant.

165
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,270
I never imagined that,

166
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,390
years later, I'd truly have the chance

167
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,790
to invite you here again.

168
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,010
That was just a casual remark
I made as a child.

169
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,650
I never expected you to remember it.

170
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,720
I remember at that time,

171
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
I even tumbled off

172
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,770
that big rock.

173
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,930
A little boy helped me up.

174
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,840
Was that also you, Lord Ma Wei?

175
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,010
We're about the same age.

176
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,410
Your Highness doesn't need to
be so formal.

177
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,470
Just call me Ma Wei.

178
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,360
Your Highness, why not rest on horseback?

179
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:25,840
And you?

180
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,140
I'll gladly serve as your groom,
Your Highness.

181
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,470
Come on.

182
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,230
I remember when I was young,

183
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,690
I used to love horseback riding with Xiu.

184
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,710
Back then, I even asked him to teach me,

185
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,580
but he always refused.

186
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,130
Then we had a race,

187
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,190
and I actually won.

188
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,680
Lord Xiu was surely being thoughtful
toward Your Highness.

189
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,900
He must have let you win,

190
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,160
just to make you happy.

191
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,480
Yes, back then I truly believed

192
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,960
I won because I was better than him.

193
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,680
Only later did I realize

194
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,370
he actually went easy on me.

195
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,560
When Lord Xiu returns,

196
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,720
I want to challenge him too.

197
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,180
Wh-What's wrong?

198
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,050
Did you know?

199
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,380
The Xiu Battalion and Palace Guards

200
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,180
have less than

201
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,930
ten days of supplies.

202
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,960
If we keep getting trapped here,

203
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,420
we'll all starve to death.

204
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,480
I don't believe

205
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,130
those North Clan soldiers

206
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,130
could completely

207
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,250
seal off Payi City,

208
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,010
without leaving a single gap.

209
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,960
Yeah, if we can just find a way out,
we could escape.

210
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,440
That's right.

211
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,930
So you want to be deserters, huh?

212
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,170
Who said anything about running away?

213
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,030
Think about it.

214
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:43,930
Right now, our commanders

215
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,050
are desperately trying
to figure things out.

216
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,810
If we can find a way out

217
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,020
and bring back food,

218
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,650
we'd be heroes.

219
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,910
Then, not only would we get rewarded,

220
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,320
but Lord Xiu

221
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,130
might even promote us to Lieutenants.

222
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,460
Are you sure about this?

223
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,880
I already got word from the sentries.

224
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,820
[Li Nong, Maocai, Ze]

225
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,440
The fortifications outside the East Gate
are already damaged.

226
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,250
It must be because the North Clan soldiers
cut corners before.

227
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,410
Lately, there's been no sign
of them around.

228
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,490
This is the perfect chance.

229
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,390
Most importantly, Maocai,

230
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,840
there are plenty of forests
outside the East Gate.

231
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,290
This season, it's like
a kitchen out there.

232
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,960
Wild game is everywhere.

233
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,250
Bad news, Lord Xiu!

234
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,920
There are deserters
at the East Gate of Payi City!

235
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,380
They injured our sentries

236
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,680
and escaped the city!

237
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,930
Which unit are they from?

238
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,590
They're...

239
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,670
They're from the Xiu Battalion.

240
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,250
[Zichuan Xiu]

241
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,600
Ah, the smell of nature!

242
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,520
Keep it down, or you'll attract wolves.

243
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,440
I can't believe we made it out so easily.

244
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,460
Not only is no one chasing us,

245
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,080
but there's not even
a single North Clan scout in sight.

246
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,010
I told you,

247
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,510
there's no way those North Clan soldiers

248
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,200
could've completely surrounded

249
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,330
a big city like Payi.

250
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,960
Even if they did,

251
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,360
with our skills,

252
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,460
what could possibly stop us?

253
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,800
Wait!

254
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,440
Stay alert.

255
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,100
Chief.

256
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,200
No more talk. Hurry back with me.

257
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,040
Be careful. There could be ambushes.

258
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,170
Chief, listen to me.

259
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,360
There aren't any North Clan soldiers
on this road at all.

260
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,020
We've already found a way out.

261
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,050
You left the city without permission

262
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,560
and were mistaken for deserters
by the Palace Guards.

263
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,650
[Baichuan]

264
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,230
Lord Xiu risked his life

265
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,040
to come find you.

266
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,440
If something went wrong,
we'd all be doomed.

267
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,080
Now move!

268
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,230
We weren't trying to desert!

269
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,160
Being trapped in the city
is just waiting to die!

270
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,920
We'd rather risk it outside!

271
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,110
You really think the North Clan
is that dumb?

272
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,170
They'd never miss such a gaping hole!

273
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,510
General, the enemy has taken the bait.

274
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,560
At a time like this, the forest

275
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,040
[Yun Qianxue]

276
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,190
is far too tempting

277
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,990
for those on the brink of

278
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,630
starvation.

279
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,800
Trust me.

280
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,550
We will get out of this city.

281
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,790
Not only that,

282
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,040
we'll avenge our fallen brothers.

283
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,680
We'll drive the North Clan
back to where they came from!

284
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,960
Chief, can we win?

285
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,240
Don't forget,

286
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,440
who was it that led you
to wealth and prosperity?

287
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,770
Who turned you from paupers into rich men?

288
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,740
I stake my honor on this.

289
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,980
Do you trust me?

290
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,590
Chief,

291
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,280
since when do you have "honor"?

292
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:24,910
You...

293
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,390
Ambush! Fall back to the city gate!

294
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:28,920
Let's go!

295
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,660
Run!

296
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,200
Stop!

297
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,400
Chief, I caught a rabbit in the chaos.

298
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,590
We can finally have meat tonight!

299
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,400
Baichuan, cover me.

300
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,680
Get up!

301
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,470
Chief, I'm sorry.

302
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,580
Shut up!

303
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,700
After them!

304
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,710
Hurry, keep up!

305
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,430
Hold on a little longer.

306
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,829
Luo Jie is just ahead
waiting to support us.

307
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,890
I failed to act swiftly.

308
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,420
Please punish me, General.

309
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,130
The trap at the East Gate

310
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,069
isn't just for an ambush.

311
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,900
It's also to let some escape,

312
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,350
make them believe there's no way out,

313
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,270
and then crush their hope.

314
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,960
This way, they will lose their composure.

315
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,570
The supplies in Payi City are limited.

316
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,420
They probably won't last
more than a few days.

317
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,870
However, the generals from Zichuan

318
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,900
are not only skilled

319
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,850
but also resourceful

320
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,120
and quick to react.

321
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,610
Unless Zichuan abandons them,

322
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,190
this battle will be tough.

323
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Spread the word to seal off the news.

324
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,470
Deploy more troops to patrol the roads.

325
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,280
If they encounter any Zichuan soldiers,
kill them on sight

326
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,550
to prevent reinforcements.

327
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,400
Understood.

328
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,960
Here, have some water.

329
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,410
Brother, you're lucky to be alive.

330
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,120
If not, by now,

331
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,070
I'd be burning paper money for you.

332
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,440
I wish I was hurt more seriously.

333
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,470
That way, perhaps

334
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,800
Lord Xiu wouldn't punish me anymore.

335
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,570
Oh, my wild game.

336
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,340
Oh, my big kitchen.

337
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,180
[Shaozi]

338
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,820
Big Brother, Lord Xiu is here.

339
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,680
Hurry!

340
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:02,920
Act it out more convincingly.

341
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,640
Alright, I'm counting on you.

342
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,570
Ze, my dear brother!

343
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,440
Maocai.

344
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,270
Has he woken up?

345
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,140
I think he's dead.

346
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,470
Dead?

347
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
If he can't wake up, that's a pity.

348
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,680
Looks like he can't stomach

349
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,270
my wild game anymore.

350
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,050
I can only share it with Si Yilin now.

351
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,070
Lord Xiu... Where am I?

352
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,330
Ze, how come you woke up?

353
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,820
This wild game isn't
really suitable for him.

354
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,690
I'd better send someone
to make him some porridge.

355
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,150
Lord Xiu,

356
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,970
I'm weak. I need to nourish myself.

357
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,170
Yes, he's right.

358
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,760
Yeah.

359
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,070
Maocai from the Xiu Battalion,

360
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,530
Ze from the Xiu Battalion,

361
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,100
and...

362
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,300
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

363
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,510
Forget about you.

364
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,510
You two

365
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,060
haven't improved your acting at all.

366
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,560
I haven't even settled

367
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,750
yesterday's business with you yet.

368
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,960
You almost fell into someone else's trap

369
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,570
and became their prey, just like this.

370
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,130
You've been with me for so long.

371
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,830
Haven't you grown at all?

372
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,230
It was clearly

373
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,190
a trap set specifically for you.

374
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,440
Lord Xiu, it's all our fault
for acting rashly

375
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,750
and not thinking things through.

376
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,480
We nearly got you into trouble.

377
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,990
Please punish us, Lord Xiu.

378
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,360
Alright,

379
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,030
you're banned

380
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,280
from eating for three days.

381
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,030
Don't!

382
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,230
You might as well just shoot us dead.

383
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,850
That would be too easy on you.

384
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,880
Take it.

385
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,620
Lord Xiu,

386
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,750
I'm not a hypocrite.

387
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
From today on,

388
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,130
we are brothers
who will live and die together.

389
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,610
In all of Yuanzhou,

390
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,280
no, all of the Xichuan Continent,

391
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,100
I only recognize you as my chief.

392
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,280
Lord Xiu!

393
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,130
Lord Xiu,

394
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,750
more of our brothers
have fainted from hunger.

395
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,670
And everyone has heard that Maocai and Ze

396
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,200
failed their raid at the East Gate,

397
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,470
making them believe Payi

398
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,470
[Ming Yu]

399
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,680
has no way out.

400
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,390
Emotions are running high,

401
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,850
especially among the civilians.

402
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,540
Ze, Maocai, I don't need

403
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,890
your flattery.

404
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,960
But you've got to

405
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,890
help me deal with something.

406
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,620
Chief, what is it?

407
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,710
Everyone knows

408
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,470
we don't have much food left.

409
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,880
The North Clan

410
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,470
is trying to trap us inside Payi City,

411
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,100
cut off our food supplies,

412
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,800
and make Payi City fall without a fight.

413
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,230
But we can never let that happen.

414
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,360
Right, we can't let them succeed.

415
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:39,870
Exactly.

416
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,790
Right, we can't let them succeed.

417
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,990
Well said.

418
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,060
So now,

419
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,160
I'm going to teach you

420
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,200
one of my lifetime's

421
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,310
secret martial arts.

422
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,030
Secret martial arts?

423
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,080
Is it really a secret skill?

424
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,470
It's known as the Great Art of Taking Qi.

425
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,070
Once you master this skill,

426
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,280
not only can you go
without feeling hungry for three days,

427
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,200
but you can also kill enemies
as if entering unguarded territory.

428
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:09,920
Lord Xiu,

429
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,680
that's an incredible skill.

430
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,310
Why didn't you teach us sooner?

431
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,360
Practicing this martial art
comes at a price.

432
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,950
I won't teach you

433
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,790
unless it's absolutely necessary.

434
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,270
If you had to starve for
seven days and nights,

435
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,470
would you be willing?

436
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,120
We are willing!

437
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,360
Right, brothers?

438
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,100
Yes, that's right!

439
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,570
Lord Xiu, please instruct us.

440
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,710
Alright.

441
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,750
Breathe in.

442
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,690
Swallow.

443
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,990
Breathe in again.

444
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,550
Swallow again.

445
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,920
Isn't that just breathing?

446
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,150
Breathing?

447
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,400
No, this is deep breathing.

448
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,030
It's called Taking Qi.

449
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,920
Breathing in nature's essence
and vital energy

450
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,520
restores your strength,

451
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,530
so you won't feel hungry
even after days without eating.

452
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,400
Chief, does this really work?

453
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,080
Luo Jie, come up and try it.

454
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,270
Follow me.

455
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,840
Breathe in.

456
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,600
Swallow.

457
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,200
It tastes like mutton.

458
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,130
Have you not bathed in days or what?

459
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,590
Interesting, right?

460
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,990
Luo Jie, take them to practice.

461
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,290
[Luo Jie]

462
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,710
Me?

463
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,780
Everyone, disperse now.

464
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,680
Train on your own. Train seriously.

465
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,610
Let's disperse.

466
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,760
Yun Qianxue

467
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,490
did it on purpose.

468
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,470
He's trying to disrupt our morale
and make us lose our composure.

469
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,680
Though I made up

470
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,440
the Great Art of Taking Qi,

471
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,310
at least it gives them

472
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,580
hope to hold on.

473
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,480
Our brothers

474
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,470
are already starving,

475
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,880
and the civilians inside the city
won't hold out much longer.

476
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,490
[Si Yilin]

477
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,870
Some have already fled the city.

478
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,400
I plan to open the granary
and distribute the food.

479
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
I agree.

480
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,500
The more difficult the time,

481
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,700
the more army and civilians must unite.

482
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,410
I'm just afraid we won't be able to
hold out for long.

483
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,990
My Lord, we've captured

484
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,550
several North Clan supply teams

485
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,610
and patrol squads.

486
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,110
According to one of the prisoners,

487
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,260
there is indeed

488
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,570
[Ge Qing]

489
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,880
a major battle happening in Payi City now.

490
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,160
That means Si Yilin

491
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,270
is indeed in Payi.

492
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,760
My Lord, we have many prisoners.
How should we deal with them?

493
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,830
Use their blood

494
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,880
to honor the souls of Zichuan's fallen.

495
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,390
Cut off their heads

496
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,070
and throw them into the Gray River.

497
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,680
Yes, sir.

498
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,160
Let them know that you have arrived.

499
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,940
Pick up the pace. Let's keep moving.

500
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,380
Yes.

501
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,600
Depart!

502
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,200
Let's go.

503
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:29,980
Come on.

504
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,290
The strong wind tonight
will fan the flames.

505
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,550
It's the perfect time to attack the city.

506
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,320
Pass my order: Prepare to attack the city.

507
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,550
[Ka Lan, Second Prince of the North Clan]

508
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,320
Yes, sir.

509
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,200
Report!

510
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,810
What happened? Why are you so panicked?

511
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:44,670
Your Highness,

512
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,960
one of our supply teams
and several patrol squads

513
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,310
have all been massacred.

514
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,470
The deaths were brutal.

515
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,470
All of their heads

516
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,920
were cut off and
thrown into the Gray River.

517
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,980
Zichuan actually—

518
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,370
Di Lin has arrived.

519
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,910
How could Di Lin suddenly appear

520
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,660
and reach Payi so quickly?

521
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,840
Why didn't we receive any information?

522
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,890
On Di Lin's way here,

523
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,440
he killed everyone he saw
and razed entire villages to the ground.

524
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,920
There were no survivors

525
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,440
to warn us in advance.

526
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,600
This barely counts as a pincer attack.

527
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,510
It's also difficult to
pose a threat to the rear of our camp.

528
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,840
With such weak reinforcements,

529
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,760
what kind of strategy is this?

530
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,510
Let's not worry about
the strategy for now.

531
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,360
Di Lin

532
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,410
is our sworn enemy.

533
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,070
If he's here to reinforce Si Yilin,

534
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,850
it will put us at a serious disadvantage.

535
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,850
Moreover, the timing of his arrival

536
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,960
is quite intriguing.

537
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,710
Pass my order:
Postpone the attack on the city.

538
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,910
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

539
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,390
This battle is getting
more and more interesting.

540
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,120
No matter what,

541
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,910
we must not allow him to establish
contact with those inside the city

542
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,840
and find an opportunity to strike.

543
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,170
My Lord,

544
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,590
on this side is the Yulin Army

545
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,080
led by the North Clan General Yun Qianxue.

546
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,220
On the other side

547
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,940
lies Payi City, where Lord Si Yilin
now holds position.

548
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,390
Most North Clan generals
are wild and reckless,

549
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,270
but Yun Qianxue is the only one
who is meticulous in his work.

550
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,750
He even constructed
a basic siege fortification

551
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,700
[Di Lin]

552
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,990
that allows for both advance and retreat

553
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,510
and can be equipped with
fire-starting devices at any time.

554
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,240
Payi is now surrounded
like a sealed iron bucket.

555
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,330
No one inside could escape
even if they had wings.

556
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,530
Meticulous indeed.

557
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,920
There will be a strong wind today.

558
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,030
It's the best time

559
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,930
to use the wind for a fire assault.

560
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,960
If we had arrived an hour later,

561
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,230
there'd be no way

562
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,460
to get into Payi.

563
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,730
So, My Lord,

564
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,390
should we sneak attack
the enemy camp next,

565
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,640
or join forces with Payi
for a pincer attack?

566
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,990
The gap between our forces
and the enemy's is too big.

567
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,920
Taking the initiative to attack
would be like throwing eggs at a rock.

568
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,250
We must not be reckless.

569
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,270
What if they turn around and attack us?

570
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:10,710
Wouldn't we be...

571
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,270
I know Yun Qianxue pretty well.

572
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,760
His strength is his meticulousness,

573
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,890
but that's also his weakness.

574
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,260
He's too meticulous.

575
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,990
I actually hope

576
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,170
he hesitates for a bit longer.

577
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,060
We need time too.

578
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,870
Are those vultures?

579
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,290
They're here waiting for the dead?

580
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,340
With so many battles,
the casualties keep piling up.

581
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,400
This clash between the two clans

582
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,180
has left countless
without even a proper burial.

583
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,170
They fell in battle,
yet their names are forgotten.

584
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,670
Only they are witnessing

585
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,560
and honoring the tragedy
of these chaotic days.

586
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,480
You're truly benevolent, My Lord.

587
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,030
It's not about kindness or generosity

588
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,090
but for the sake of the common people.

589
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,460
Only with peace can the people thrive.

590
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,680
The Executioner on the Battlefield
has arrived.

591
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,340
When the final assault comes,

592
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,550
there will be fierce fighting again,

593
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,920
and many more from both the North Clan

594
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,710
and Zichuan will fall.

595
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,320
Human desires never lessen,
and wars never end.

596
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,600
When will the attrition

597
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,520
between the two clans ever end?

598
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,050
My brothers,

599
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,450
we, the Palace Guards
and the Xiu Battalion,

600
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,410
have been ordered to campaign
against the North Clan in the east.

601
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,810
We've been through so much
on this journey.

602
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,600
Now, outside Payi City,

603
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
the North Clan is eyeing us covetously.

604
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,920
Inside Payi City, we're short on supplies.

605
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,540
I know everyone has suffered a lot.

606
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,990
I also know everyone is hungry.

607
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,590
I hope you all can
hold on a little longer.

608
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,030
Gentlemen, the famous military strategist,

609
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,140
Master Zuo Jiaming, once said that

610
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,120
the most important factor
in war is persistence.

611
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,990
Beyond persistence,

612
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,790
there's even more persistence.

613
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,350
Victory comes from persistence.

614
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,030
To help everyone keep going,

615
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,080
we have specially prepared

616
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,960
some delicious food

617
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,600
to replenish your strength.

618
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,740
Bravo!

619
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,230
Bravo!

620
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,880
Bravo!

621
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:33,680
Go ahead.

622
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,740
Come on, folks in the back!

623
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,360
It smells so good.

624
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,760
Don't push, one at a time!

625
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,060
Lord Wen He, have some.

626
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:45,960
It's my turn!

627
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,710
Come on.

628
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,320
Serve me a bowl first.

629
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,770
Hurry!

630
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,000
Is it enough?

631
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Hurry up!

632
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,070
Come on, next.

633
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,460
It smells so good.

634
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,220
Have some.

635
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,700
I don't want to eat.

636
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,160
It smells so good! Hurry!

637
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,620
My Lord.

638
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,380
There's enough for everyone.

639
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,310
My Lord,

640
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,530
I know you don't want to eat.

641
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,830
Do you think I want to?

642
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,670
All our brothers are here.

643
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,560
You have to set an example.

644
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,460
Here, yours.

645
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,550
It's salty.

646
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,250
It's the taste of salt.

647
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,090
Since we entered Payi,

648
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,679
this is the first time I've tasted salt.

649
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:47,330
Everyone, eat and drink up!

650
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,320
Alright!

651
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,630
Alright!

652
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,889
There's salt and meat,

653
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,420
all to help restore strength.

654
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,120
Everyone, have some.

655
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,150
Alright!

656
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,830
Second Brother, don't be so dejected.

657
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:19,170
This isn't how
the Tiger of Zichuan should look.

658
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,290
If I were truly the Tiger of Zichuan,

659
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
I'd rather strip the bones and flesh

660
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,360
to feed them.

661
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,240
Back when I was in Hengchuan,

662
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,380
I personally killed

663
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,030
a warhorse that had
followed me for five years.

664
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,720
It was our failure.

665
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,800
Second Brother, just imagine:

666
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,880
If horses were our masters,

667
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,590
and they were struggling
to defend Payi City,

668
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,150
what would you do?

669
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,310
Remember what you said just now?

670
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,200
Stripping the bones and flesh?

671
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,390
I underestimated our warhorses.

672
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:16,900
They're all heroes.

673
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,880
I have an idea.

674
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:28,250
Second Brother,
given the current situation,

675
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,850
to break the deadlock,

676
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,650
it might have to be a fight to the death.

677
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,440
I bet

678
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,990
you can't think of a better plan.

679
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,060
That's right.

680
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,970
It's not a good idea.

681
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,560
I'll lead 5,000 cavalry

682
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,250
to fight against Yun Qianxue.

683
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,990
That will tear open a gap.

684
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:52,040
You and the Xiu Battalion
take the civilians and get out of here.

685
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,480
Second Brother,
then you and those 5,000 soldiers

686
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,880
will surely die.

687
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,500
This is the best plan
I could come up with.

688
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,120
Certainly, but it's not the best.

689
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,950
Yes, if he were here,

690
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,660
he'd definitely come.

691
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,990
He won't abandon us.

692
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,880
Your bond of brotherhood runs deep.

693
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,550
Today, I'll show you

694
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,720
the power of the Bald King.

695
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:42,840
Chief.

696
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:43,990
Chief.

697
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,870
Big Brother,

698
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,960
you're a bit late today.

699
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,840
We've been bullied for quite a while.

700
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,090
Big Brother, how did you know
we were here?

701
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,490
What's so strange about that?

702
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,640
Big Brother always shows up just in time.

703
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,600
It's no time

704
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,070
to talk about that now.

705
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,360
Can't you two cause me less trouble?

706
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,370
Ask Xiu.

707
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,810
It's all because of
Second Brother, that fool.

708
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,820
He's so easily provoked.

709
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,010
You're a fool too.

710
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,220
Why did you just go along with him?

711
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,280
-And you?
-And you?

712
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,320
Knowing you two,

713
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,470
I'm the biggest fool of all.

714
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,670
Charge!

715
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,340
If Big Brother knew

716
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,050
about our situation in Payi City,

717
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,650
he would definitely come.

718
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,460
But the North Clan soldiers

719
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,590
have the entire Payi City surrounded.

720
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,840
How can he get in?

721
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,330
This isn't the military academy
in Yuanzhou.

722
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:44,280
For him, it's all simple.

723
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,470
My Lord, a sentry reports:

724
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,690
The North Clan camp
has a large number of reinforcements.

725
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,890
All troops, on alert!

726
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:51,590
Yes, sir!

727
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,910
Second Brother, do you remember

728
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,320
we confiscated
some North Clan soldiers' uniforms?

729
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,170
Go, take all the confiscated
North Clan uniforms

730
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,110
and give them to Xiu.

731
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:04,640
Yes, sir.

732
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,260
Safety is the top priority

733
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,140
when entering enemy camps.

734
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,860
Don't worry, Second Brother.

735
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,660
Stealing and slipping away—

736
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,440
that's what I'm best at.

737
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,680
Oh meat, I've missed you so much!

738
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,540
Let me take you home, alright? Okay.

739
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,680
Why are you still standing here? Let's go!

740
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,790
We hadn't heard that
the Divine Emperor was coming.

741
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,710
Why so sudden?

742
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,830
His Majesty must want to
personally oversee the battle,

743
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,270
and take down Zichuan in one fell swoop.

744
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,320
I'm not one to talk, but

745
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,200
General Yun is way too cautious.

746
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,230
If I had this many troops,

747
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,550
I would have taken down
three Payis by now.

748
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,280
Keep your voice down. Let's go.

749
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,270
Yun, with Father arriving,

750
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,520
he'll probably blame us for
not making any progress.

751
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,980
But I see

752
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,840
a bit of expectation in your eyes.

753
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,700
Your Highness,

754
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,400
the reason we're in a stalemate
with the Zichuan army

755
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,360
is all due to Di Lin's interference,

756
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,590
which has drained our military strength.

757
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,750
Now that His Majesty has led troops here,

758
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,480
the stalemate might be broken.

759
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,020
How can I not expect it?

760
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,670
You only care about war.

761
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,830
You don't understand politics at all.

762
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,190
With Father here,

763
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,170
our credit will be taken away.

764
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,040
The Divine Emperor has arrived!

765
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,520
When do you plan
to take down the Payi City?

766
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:28,680
[Divine Emperor of Sairong]

767
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,840
Do you realize how much Payi City

768
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,150
means to the North Clan?

769
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
-I do.
-I do.

770
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,270
What's the current situation
of the battle?

771
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,980
Payi City has been under siege for days.

772
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,870
They've long since run out
of ammunition and food.

773
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,250
We should have taken it down
three days ago,

774
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,690
but Di Lin's forces suddenly appeared.

775
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,420
[Black Veil, Counsellor of North Clan]

776
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,550
We had to split our forces
to deal with them,

777
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,470
which delayed our final assault.

778
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,640
Is Di Lin really that formidable?

779
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,800
Not worth mentioning.

780
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,180
But General Yun has always been cautious
in his military operations,

781
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,440
not wanting our soldiers
to make unnecessary sacrifices.

782
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:13,180
Yes, but I have crossed swords
with him before.

783
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:16,210
He's ruthless and tactically brilliant.

784
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,490
He should not be underestimated.

785
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,400
Yun,

786
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,870
you're giving
too much credit to the enemy.

787
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,250
Please forgive my bluntness,

788
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,510
but just from Di Lin's troop movements
and patrol patterns,

789
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,550
one can tell

790
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,550
he is very skilled in warfare

791
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,770
and has a thorough strategic mind.

792
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,440
Our army is fortunate to have Yun.

793
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,710
Ka Lan,

794
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,540
you are fortunate as well.

795
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,830
You may all leave now.

796
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:51,920
Yes.

797
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,840
Yun, stay.

798
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:32,540
Yun, if you have any questions,
ask freely.

799
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,080
Your Majesty is wise.

800
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,320
May I ask, how many reinforcements

801
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,070
have you brought, Your Majesty?

802
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,730
Not reinforcements exactly.

803
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,410
I've only brought
my 100,000 Royal Escorts.

804
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,850
That's more than enough.

805
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,730
Then I have a small question as well.

806
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:54,910
When can we take down Payi?

807
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:55,760
Tomorrow.

808
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:59,340
Tomorrow, I will spare no effort
to conquer Payi

809
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,640
and cut off Si Yilin's head.

810
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,690
Second Brother, have some.

811
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:10,850
It's delicious.

812
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:12,890
You went into the enemy camp.

813
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,910
But all you brought back was food?

814
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,150
A great battle is coming.

815
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:19,470
When?

816
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,100
Tomorrow.

817
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,100
Then as we discussed before,
I'll lead the breakout.

818
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:30,310
When the time comes,
you lead everyone to retreat.

819
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:33,320
If it were just ordinary
North Clan generals,

820
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,990
maybe we'd still have hope.

821
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,630
But within the enemy camp,

822
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,340
not only is General Yun Qianxue present,

823
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:43,080
the Divine Emperor of Sairong
is also personally overseeing the battle.
