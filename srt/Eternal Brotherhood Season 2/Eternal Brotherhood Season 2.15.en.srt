00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,820
[Episode 15]

3
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,360
Tonight, I will...

4
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,820
I've already had someone
prepare the study.

5
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,000
Early tomorrow morning,

6
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I still have important military matters
to attend to.

7
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,990
Then you should rest early.

8
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,240
You should also rest early here.

9
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,670
This variety is hard

10
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,079
to cultivate in the North Clan's land.

11
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,030
You must have put a lot of thought
into growing these.

12
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,280
Since they've grown,

13
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,120
it... wasn't that difficult after all.

14
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,320
The flowers are beautiful.

15
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,520
They're in perfect bloom tonight.

16
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,620
Let them keep you company.

17
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,840
I still have official business
to attend to,

18
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,240
so I'll take my leave now.

19
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,250
Lord Yun.

20
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,930
Thank you.

21
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,640
Let's go.

22
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,530
Who's there?

23
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,510
My Lord, the Military Inspection Team
has found two suspicious individuals.

24
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,480
Block all the roads right now

25
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,390
and catch them.

26
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,220
Yes, My Lord.

27
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,040
Di Lin?

28
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,400
What are you doing here?

29
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,560
Did you see anyone?

30
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,830
Just now, I saw a dark figure

31
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,070
leap over my rooftop.

32
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,330
Judging by his footwork, his martial arts
skills are probably equal to mine.

33
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,430
Some thieves have stolen
the Palace Guards' token

34
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,920
and are trying to flee the city.

35
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,050
As for their skills,

36
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,750
you're overestimating them.

37
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,800
Ge Qing has already encountered them.

38
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,530
They're just thieves who are quick
on their feet.

39
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,950
You're a newlywed now.

40
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,340
Go home and check on your wife.

41
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,960
Leave the rest to me.

42
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,200
If you hadn't insisted on
escorting me back...

43
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,060
I wouldn't have experienced
this new thing.

44
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,630
I'm glad Your Highness likes it.

45
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,040
I've already sent two to your residence.

46
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,510
The weather has been cold lately.

47
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,950
Your Highness can use them
in the carriage when going out.

48
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,870
That's very thoughtful of you, Mr. Ma.

49
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,120
How did you come up with the idea

50
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,180
of placing this item in the carriage?

51
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,920
A few days ago, I went to Wayun Fortress.

52
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,800
The cold there is even harsher.

53
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,270
The soldiers often use charcoal braziers
to keep warm.

54
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,380
After I saw it,

55
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
I was inspired.

56
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,520
Burning silver frost charcoal in a
copper-wire charcoal stove.

57
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,050
It's much cleaner this way.

58
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,000
Were you disturbed?

59
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,420
Did something happen?

60
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,360
Someone tried to steal
the Palace Guards' token.

61
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,650
Ge Qing found out

62
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,110
and fought with them.

63
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,120
I am the Deputy Commander.

64
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,750
I can take enemy generals' heads
in battle.

65
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,070
Do you really think

66
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,370
a few petty thieves would disturb me?

67
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,610
I was being presumptuous.

68
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,930
This is the first snowfall of the year.

69
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,920
Rest early.

70
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,409
This isn't the way to my residence.

71
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,830
This scenery is rare,

72
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,610
so I took the liberty of

73
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,360
inviting you to enjoy the snow.

74
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,770
The days are short and the nights
are long;

75
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,800
we should seize the moment for joy.

76
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,290
Quickly!

77
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,730
Over there!

78
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,760
Even though I am the Princess of Zichuan

79
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,640
and have lived in the Imperial Capital
since childhood,

80
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,150
with everything at my disposal,
I don't think I have ever

81
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,750
seen such a beautiful view in a place
like this.

82
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,970
Thinking about it this way,
the common people in the Imperial Capital

83
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,490
must be able to see more beautiful sights
in their daily lives.

84
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,480
Indeed.

85
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,670
They all envy power and wealth,

86
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,570
but they don't know that sometimes
we want

87
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,350
nothing more than the simple happiness
of ordinary life.

88
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,610
Your Highness.

89
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,090
I've asked someone to prepare some food
and wine.

90
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,100
So you planned this all along.

91
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,990
What did you prepare?

92
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,940
I've taken note of Your Highness's
preferences,

93
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,490
so I had some dishes prepared accordingly.

94
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,550
Please, Your Highness, have a taste.

95
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,710
Cheers.

96
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,910
The century-long history of the capital
is laid out before us.

97
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,170
How magnificent it is.

98
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,870
It's a shame I lack the talent

99
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,240
to become an asset to Zichuan.

100
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,270
Mr. Ma, you're already a noble advisor

101
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,750
at such a young age.

102
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,320
Why such melancholy?

103
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,280
Your Highness may not know this,

104
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
but my dream since childhood

105
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,150
was to become a commander

106
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,290
and fight on the battlefield.

107
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,220
Unfortunately, my father died early
from a terrible illness,

108
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,290
and my mother also fell ill from grief

109
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,390
and passed away early.

110
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,110
Only my brother and I were left,
depending on each other

111
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,640
and barely managing to
hold up our household.

112
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,040
They all say I'm mature beyond my years

113
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,010
and well-versed in the ways of business.

114
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,550
But they don't know that my ambitions
go far beyond that.

115
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Zichuan's focus now is on
farming and trade.

116
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,750
Isn't this the perfect opportunity
for you to show your skills

117
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,080
and make your mark?

118
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
The business world is treacherous.

119
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,240
How can it compare to fighting enemies
and protecting our country?

120
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,040
That would be truly exhilarating
and satisfying.

121
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,030
I didn't expect you

122
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,040
to have such aspirations.

123
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,390
I'm very happy

124
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,030
that you're willing to open up to me
like this tonight.

125
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,360
I'm glad to call you a friend.

126
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,920
This night was well worth it.

127
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,440
I've heard that Your Highness's
guqin skills are superb,

128
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,870
but I've never had the honor
of witnessing them.

129
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,270
On this beautiful night,

130
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,980
I'd like to perform a sword dance
in accompaniment.

131
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,410
May I humbly request Your Highness to
play a piece on the guqin?

132
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,210
Happy birthday, Ning.

133
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,050
You have no choice but to grow.

134
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,860
But I'll always protect you.

135
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,240
I'm a bit drunk.

136
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,510
Let's go back.

137
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,770
Okay.

138
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,750
I'll escort Your Highness back
to the estate now.

139
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,750
I got carried away

140
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,170
and didn't realize it had gotten so late.

141
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,870
Men, what's the situation?

142
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,480
Assassins were spotted
near General Si Yilin's residence.

143
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,840
They've stolen the Palace Guards' token

144
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,730
and may be trying to flee the city.

145
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,930
We're conducting strict inspections.

146
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,480
There are soldiers patrolling
everywhere here.

147
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,870
Trying to escape from here

148
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,470
is probably impossible now.

149
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,240
General, how about we fight our way out?

150
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,040
I saw that carriage earlier.

151
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,960
It's luxuriously decorated.

152
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,890
It came from Si Yilin's residence.

153
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,360
There must be high-ranking officials
or nobles inside.

154
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,820
If we seize this carriage,

155
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,870
they won't dare to act rashly.

156
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,810
Okay. I'll go distract the soldiers.

157
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,500
We'll meet up in the south of the city.

158
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,860
Who's there? Stop him!

159
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,040
Who are you?

160
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,290
Stop the carriage!

161
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,810
Why are you hijacking this carriage?

162
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,820
It's you.

163
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,750
Oh, it's you.

164
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,640
Is this how you treat someone
who saved you?

165
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,040
Then don't try to stop me.

166
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,320
Why are you following me?

167
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,840
You're the one who stole the token,
aren't you?

168
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,760
First you steal the token, and now you
want to hijack a carriage.

169
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,640
You're asking for too much.

170
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,150
This street is under strict surveillance.

171
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,150
Of course, I need a better disguise.

172
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,680
You can choose any carriage
in the Imperial Capital,

173
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,170
except for this one.

174
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,910
So, you're not following me—

175
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,650
you're after this carriage.

176
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,750
Now that you know, hurry up and leave.

177
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,579
What's so special about this carriage?

178
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,290
Looks like it's about the people inside.

179
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,040
Then what if I must hijack it?

180
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,910
You can do what you want

181
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,350
with the man in the carriage,

182
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,680
but that woman is off-limits.

183
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,830
With someone of your skill protecting her
from the shadows,

184
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,310
this woman must be

185
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,480
someone important.

186
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,020
Then, I must make good use of this.

187
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,590
Listen here, you...

188
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,270
This is the Imperial Capital.

189
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,920
The Military Inspection Team will be here
any minute.

190
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,300
Then you'll have nowhere to escape!

191
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:54,850
I know!

192
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,960
So I need to borrow a helping hand...

193
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,980
from your friend here.

194
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:01,790
Step aside.

195
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,900
You seem quite comfortable
with my Xiyue Blade.

196
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,970
Don't be so petty.

197
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,550
Who's there? Stop him!

198
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,160
Hurry and go.

199
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,200
Until we meet again.

200
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,400
You can't even handle such a simple task!

201
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,440
You're a disgrace to
the Military Inspection Team!

202
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,840
Thirty lashes tomorrow!

203
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,550
I deserve to die, My Lord.

204
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,380
Lord Di Lin.

205
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,910
What's going on here?

206
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,070
My business is none of your concern.

207
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,920
I heard there are thieves causing trouble.

208
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,030
The Ministry of War should assist
in the investigation.

209
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,490
Let's check other places!

210
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,540
We'll take our leave first.

211
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,480
Search every nearby alley thoroughly!

212
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,010
Yes, sir!

213
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,570
Why are you still here?

214
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,270
I was going to,

215
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,700
but when I heard someone had stolen
a token,

216
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,590
trying to sneak out of the city unnoticed,

217
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,450
I got worried.

218
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,020
Princess Ning is in Ma Wei's carriage?

219
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,450
Two people stole the token.

220
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,720
You weren't the other thief, were you?

221
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,960
Are you joking?

222
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,830
I saw Princess Ning's carriage
being hijacked,

223
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,160
and that's why I stepped in.

224
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,420
If you hadn't suddenly shown up,

225
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,880
I would've subdued him right then
and there.

226
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,590
The Imperial Capital is  locked down
like a steel fortress now.

227
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,210
He can't escape even if he wants to.

228
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,740
Do you still have the badge?

229
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,410
Yes.

230
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,880
Then the provisions have been prepared
for you,

231
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,000
we've also had our drinks,

232
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,260
and you have the token. Now, hurry and go.

233
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,260
Di Lin.

234
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,280
I have an unreasonable request.

235
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,190
Alright. I'll accompany you to escort
Princess Ning back to her residence.

236
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,710
Ge Qing.

237
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,110
Take Advisor Ma Wei home first.

238
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,550
I'll personally escort Princess Ning back
to her residence.

239
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,080
Yes, sir.

240
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,310
He is the one who saved you earlier?

241
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,590
Counting this time,

242
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,510
he has saved me three times.

243
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,290
As long as you're safe.

244
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,830
But after all this,

245
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,760
the token probably can't be used anymore.

246
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
Find a place to rest tonight.

247
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,350
Tomorrow, let's figure out another way
to leave the city.

248
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,210
What about you?

249
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,680
I still have some matters to attend to.

250
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,480
I'll meet up with you afterward.

251
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,110
Ning.

252
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,070
You...

253
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,270
I...

254
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,550
Actually, compared to appearance,

255
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,860
character is more important.

256
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,290
Rather than someone skilled in weapons,

257
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,480
I hope you'll find someone who is good
with words.

258
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,340
They're more considerate... and romantic.

259
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,400
And they will make you feel more secure
than I ever could.

260
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,640
You must find someone

261
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,030
who truly loves you.

262
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,630
That way, you won't ever be bullied.

263
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,890
What am I saying?

264
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,440
How could anyone ever bully you?

265
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,340
No matter who you end up with...

266
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,290
remember one thing...

267
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,030
don't think of me again.

268
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,000
Guards.

269
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,160
My Lady!

270
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,840
Lord Di Lin.

271
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,310
What's wrong with My Lady?

272
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,030
Someone attempted to hijack
Princess Ning's carriage.

273
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,790
Fortunately, the Military Inspection Team
arrived in time.

274
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,920
She wasn't harmed. Quickly,
help her inside.

275
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
Thank you for your help, Lord Di Lin.

276
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,560
You stay here for a while.

277
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,760
I'll head back first.

278
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,200

279

My Lady!

318
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,400
Mei!

319
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,960
My Lady, you're awake.

320
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,200
Mei, where's Xiu?

321
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,790
Lord Xiu?

322
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,570
Lord Xiu isn't here.

323
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,110
Xiu has returned.

324
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,070
I heard his voice yesterday.

325
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,880
You were attacked on the road last night.

326
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,010
It was Lord Di Lin who brought you back.

327
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,460
Lord Xiu wasn't there.

328
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,510
But yesterday, I...

329
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,310
I think I saw him.

330
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,830
My Lady.

331
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,440
He even played our song.

332
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,000
My Lady, are you alright?

333
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,480
Lord Ma Wei is still waiting outside.

334
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,320
Should I ask him to leave first?

335
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,060
Yeah.

336
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,970
He sent me back last night.

337
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,080
Last night, I might have...

338
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,780
really had a bit too much to drink.

339
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,910
Tell him to wait a moment.

340
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,590
Yes, My Lady.

341
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,930
I failed to protect Your Highness
last night.

342
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,750
Please punish me, Your Highness.

343
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,680
What exactly happened last night?

344
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,920
Last night, the carriage was hijacked.

345
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,180
I tried my best to protect Your Highness,

346
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,240
but I was knocked unconscious
by the attacker.

347
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,640
Fortunately, Lord Di Lin arrived
just in time,

348
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,570
and we narrowly escaped disaster.

349
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,020
I was completely unaware of this.

350
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,420
How fortunate indeed.

351
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,680
Has the assassin been caught?

352
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,010
Lord Di Lin has been busy
with this matter.

353
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,000
Lord Luo Minghai

354
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,900
also ordered the Ministry of War to
provide additional security.

355
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,630
The assassin will surely have nowhere
to escape.

356
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,080
But having frightened Your Highness,

357
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,880
I feel deeply uneasy about this.

358
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,680
You don't need to blame yourself so much.

359
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,510
I'm fine.

360
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,670
See? I'm perfectly alright.

361
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,270
I brought some honeydew melons
from the Hills.

362
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,350
They're sweet and delicious

363
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,010
and also good for sobering up.

364
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,210
Thank you for your thoughtfulness,
Lord Ma.

365
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,960
Are you alright?

366
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,400
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

367
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,970
As long as Your Highness is fine,

368
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:32,960
I am relieved.

369
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,720
Even with Di Lin personally on the scene,
we couldn't catch the intruder?

370
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,510
Indeed so.

371
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,200
By the time I arrived, he had
already escaped.

372
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,460
We searched everywhere but couldn't find
any trace of him.

373
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,680
Di Lin has been on vacation
for over a month,

374
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,680
yet he's never once eased up on
the training of the Inspection Team.

375
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,550
How could he fail to catch
even a small thief?

376
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,550
Did he not catch him

377
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,970
or let him go?

378
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:22,920
Investigate thoroughly. Keep a close eye
on Di Lin.

379
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,010
Yes, sir.

380
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,160
The city gate guards are extremely strict.

381
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,070
They're verifying passwords
and countersigns.

382
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,470
We really don't have any way
to get through.

383
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:46,550
That bearded man is truly our lucky star.

384
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,110
The badge!

385
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,950
Your unit number and today's password!

386
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,720
This is a vehicle from
the Ministry of War.

387
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,960
My Lord, why have you come personally?

388
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,550
My Ministry of Military
and Legal Affairs' men

389
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,780
were repeatedly questioned while leaving
the city.

390
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,920
It shows how seriously
the Ministry of War is taking this.

391
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,680
So, I can't be careless either.

392
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,770
We can't be negligent with
the Ministry of War vehicle either.

393
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,160
You stay here for a while.

394
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,360
I'll head back first.

395
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,710
Oh, right.

396
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,160
Take this.

397
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,630
The Ministry of War's badge?

398
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,880
Don't I already have your ministry' badge?

399
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,400
After all the commotion
you caused tonight,

400
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,830
you think you can leave tomorrow
just with a badge?

401
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,720
My plan

402
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,440
is to throw the blame
on the Ministry of War.

403
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,540
Now, speak.

404
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,110
Your unit number and today's password.

405
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,110
How tedious.

406
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,630
I'm with the Ministry of War!

407
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,050
If I'm delayed,

408
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,780
can you take responsibility?

409
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,960
He's from the Black Tiger Gang!

410
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,750
Catch him!

411
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,000
Seal the city gate

412
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,180
and strictly check all of
the Ministry of War's tokens!

413
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:02,810
My Lord.

414
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,920
That man revealed
a Black Tiger Gang tattoo

415
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,780
and forced his way out of the city!

416
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:10,920
How did my ministry's token

417
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,530
end up in the hands of
the Black Tiger Gang?

418
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,739
I've investigated, sir.

419
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,920
Recently, none of our people

420
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,650
have reported any lost badges.

421
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,420
Although we did receive reports

422
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,880
of lost badges in the past,

423
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,230
those were from several months ago.

424
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,370
How did Di Lin end up there?

425
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,550
I'm afraid it's because we were
investigating him

426
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,480
and angered him.

427
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,590
Even so...

428
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,670
how did he so coincidentally
discover this?

429
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,060
I didn't do my job well.

430
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,360
Please punish me, My Lord.

431
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,510
Punish you?

432
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,190
What use is punishment now?

433
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,300
You useless fool!

434
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,469
Lord Luo.

435
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,790
Why are you so mad at your subordinate?

436
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,280
Lord Di Lin, where is that man?

437
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,000
He got away.

438
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,110
How did he escape?

439
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,710
I had already caught up with him.

440
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,590
But because I wanted to interrogate him,

441
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,920
I didn't strike to kill.

442
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,030
As a result, I carelessly
let him slip away.

443
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,430
Someone managed to escape
from you, Di Lin?

444
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,870
Did he run away,

445
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,690
or did you never chase him at all?

446
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,180
What do you mean by that?

447
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,050
I haven't asked you yet,

448
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,580
and you're questioning me?

449
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,630
Was this really a case of
your Ministry of War

450
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,710
losing a badge,

451
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,150
or did you intentionally give it
to the Black Tiger Gang,

452
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,810
secretly colluding
to sell military supplies?

453
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
I will definitely

454
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,280
get to the bottom of this matter.

455
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,070
Good.

456
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,280
I believe you'll certainly get to
the bottom of this.

457
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,030
If you need my help, just let me know
anytime.

458
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,070
No need.

459
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,320
Then I'll be waiting for your good news.

460
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,550
My Lord, shall we investigate?

461
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,350
Investigate.

462
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,230
Find someone to sketch the appearance

463
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,360
of that bearded man.

464
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,510
I want to know exactly who he is.

465
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,590
Yes, sir.

466
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,840
Di Lin.

467
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,130
Di Lin, there are so many ministries
in the Imperial Capital.

468
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,990
You've collected so many tokens.

469
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,530
You could start a card game.

470
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,190
Alright, scram.

471
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,840
Off I go now.

472
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,840
Di Lin. Now that I'm leaving,

473
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,260
I don't know when we'll see
each other again.

474
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,190
I don't really want to see you that much.

475
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,440
Just... stay alive, that's all.

476
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,230
Go.

477
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,110
Goodbye, Di Lin!

478
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,070
Come out.

479
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,050
How did you know we were inside?

480
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,920
When I just left the city,

481
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,030
there was only one set of light
wheel tracks,

482
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,380
but by the time I turned a corner,

483
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,780
the tracks had deepened.

484
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,510
Since we were all leaving the city anyway,

485
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,170
I might as well give you a ride.

486
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,460
This should be the fourth time
I've saved you.

487
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,110
Why do you even keep count?

488
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,860
The city is heavily guarded,

489
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,390
so we had no chance to leave.

490
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,380
We had no alternative but to resort to
this desperate measure.

491
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,190
Did it ever occur to you

492
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,400
that I might not make it either?

493
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,230
Then the two of you would've been
trapped rats.

494
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,360
That wouldn't be a small risk.

495
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,200
You're a man of great skill.

496
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,840
Whatever the risk, I had to
take this gamble.

497
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,720
A man of great skill?

498
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,840
I'm just an ordinary guy, Zhang Asan.

499
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,190
Being able to obtain the badge
from the Ministry of War

500
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,920
and getting help from the Ministry
of Military and Legal Affairs,

501
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,150
how could you be just an ordinary guy?

502
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,800
Being hunted by the Black Tiger Gang

503
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,590
and being able to obtain

504
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,050
the Palace Guards' token
amidst that crowd—

505
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,630
you didn't expect me to believe

506
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,090
you're just some average woman,
Miss Lin Yu?

507
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,150
The world is vast; follow your heart.

508
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,440
Have you finished your business?

509
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,760
One thing after another.

510
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,840
As long as we live, there's always
something to do.

511
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,440
Since both of you have things to do,

512
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,970
why don't we get on our way?

513
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,440
Miss Lin Yu, until we meet again.

514
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,960
Xiu, may we meet again if fate allows.

515
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,110
Take care.

516
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,760
My Lord,

517
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,840
that young King of Light indeed
has some skills.

518
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,170
We've tried water attacks
and fire attacks,

519
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,150
but we were utterly defeated
and left in a miserable state.

520
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,360
The Alliance Army is stationed
in Bulu Village.

521
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,590
If we continue this stalemate with them,

522
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,250
I fear it won't end well for us.

523
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,470
Lord Xiu said Bulu Village was located
at the downwind exit of the valley,

524
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,480
making it easy for them
to think of using fire attacks.

525
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,510
So he had us prepare sand, stones,
and water hoses in advance.

526
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,380
He also said

527
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,280
Lu Di was impatient and rash,

528
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,440
and if the fire attack failed,

529
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,550
he'd likely attack again
within three days.

530
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,980
Because he had suffered a setback
on the water,

531
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,160
he would resort to water attacks.

532
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,000
So we were to delay him
as much as possible

533
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,480
and only fight if there was
a moon halo at night.

534
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,050
At that time, the cold wind would come,
the water would freeze,

535
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,110
and they'd retreat without a fight.

536
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,960
Lord Xiu truly had incredible foresight.

537
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,630
Baichuan!

538
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,230
Baichuan.

539
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,510
Lu Di has new troop movements again.

540
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,110
Quick, let's check Lord Xiu's
strategy pouch.

541
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,920
It's empty.

542
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,850
Another empty fortress ruse?

543
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,530
This time it's my turn, Baichuan.

544
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,670
Who are you?

545
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,590
We're about to run out of food.

546
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,760
If the King of Light doesn't return soon,

547
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,880
we'll be in serious trouble.

548
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,890
That soon?

549
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,440
Didn't you carefully calculate that we
could last for seven more days?

550
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,590
Baichuan, why not think it through
a little?

551
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,920
We've been besieged here for over 10 days.

552
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
I've been trying my best
to ration the food.

553
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,580
But if there is a battle again,

554
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,550
we'll be finished.

555
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,850
General, after passing
through this forest,

556
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:06,700
we'll reach the Lin family's place.

557
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,230
Okay.

558
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,110
You guys are really persistent,
aren't you?

559
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,360
We're paid to kill you,

560
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,160
so of course we'll do everything
to finish the job.

561
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,250
Attack!

562
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,150
General!

563
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,550
You've been waiting for me here
for so long.

564
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,360
Do you know why I had to take a detour
to the Lin family?

565
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,680
To find reinforcements.

566
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,000
Then, do you know
who my reinforcements are?

567
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,400
Does it matter who the reinforcements are?

568
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
Since you're here, come out now!

569
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,730
I can't take it anymore!
