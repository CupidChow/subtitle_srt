[Eternal Brotherhood 2]

00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,710
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,680
Is that storyteller at Chunfeng Garden

4
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,670
still performing there?

5
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,160
Yes, he still is.

6
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,509
Full audience every day.

7
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,640
Now the entire Imperial Capital

8
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,960
believes that Lord Si Yilin
and Lord Li Qing

9
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,840
are a match made in heaven.

10
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,760
However, as a result,

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,979
I'm afraid that in the Imperial Capital,

12
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,640
no one would dare to pursue
Lord Li Qing anymore.

13
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,520
Do you think so too?

14
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,430
Yes, indeed.

15
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,800
With Lord Si Yilin as such a fine example,

16
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,350
who would dare to be so tactless as to

17
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,680
try to win Lord Li Qing's favor?

18
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,220
How do you think Qing's situation is now?

19
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,320
The reputation of their union
has spread far and wide.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,680
Unless you arrange another
marriage for her, My Lord,

21
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,400
to suppress the gossip,

22
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,470
Lord Li Qing

23
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,600
will likely have to bear this
reputation indefinitely.

24
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
That's good then.

25
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,720
Since You can see it clearly,

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,470
I believe Si Yilin can see it clearly too.

27
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,960
However, given Lord Si Yilin's
temperament,

28
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,430
he wouldn't let others suffer
on his account.

29
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,280
Among the younger generation of Zichuan,

30
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,630
the most capable ones are

31
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,030
the three brothers,

32
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,910
Di Lin, Si Yilin, and Zichuan Xiu.

33
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,190
As for Di Lin, he's deep in thought,

34
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,040
and sometimes, even I can't figure out

35
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,240
what's on his mind.

36
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,840
As for Zichuan Xiu...

37
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,520
Let's not talk about him.

38
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,890
He's already a traitor.

39
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,310
As for Si Yilin,

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,240
my only hope is that

41
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,010
he can remain consistent throughout.

42
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,630
If he could join hands with Qing,

43
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,770
it would surely stabilize the court.

44
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,410
They're obviously the perfect match,

45
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,360
yet he has to make me worry
about this for him.

46
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,220
It's really...

47
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,520
My Lord, you're doing this
for their own good.

48
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,030
I believe they will understand one day.

49
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,860
Yes. I hope so.

50
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,630
Previously, Uncle ordered me

51
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,370
to oversee the renovation of
the Wayun Fortress.

52
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,370
Lord Di Lin was once stationed here,

53
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,240
so I came specially today

54
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,630
to seek some advice.

55
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,600
The Wayun Fortress is located in
a strategically crucial position,

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,390
easy to defend but difficult to attack.

57
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,800
However, after years of warfare

58
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,060
and multiple battles,

59
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,830
key locations throughout the city
have all been compromised.

60
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,870
The eastern city wall, in particular,
is the most severely damaged.

61
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,480
Although it was repaired
before the battle,

62
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,800
it was only an emergency fix.

63
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,930
To fully repair it would require
a large amount of funds.

64
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,160
But now that the war has just ended,

65
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,040
Wayun's treasury is completely empty.

66
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,700
Our clan can hardly afford
any expenses either.

67
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,120
So this matter

68
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,270
is a hot potato to begin with.

69
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,000
If we could squeeze some money

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,270
from Lord Ge Shan,

71
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,330
Uncle wouldn't have sent me here
to handle this matter.

72
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,830
Previously, Lord Si Yilin and Lord Di Lin,

73
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,600
you worked together to handle
Gu Lan's corruption case.

74
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,430
The political atmosphere in the court
has greatly changed.

75
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,030
Now, if we want to target
those high officials,

76
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,320
I'm afraid I can only

77
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,790
issue a few medals for honest officialdom.

78
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,560
It seems I'll have to find a way
to raise the money myself.

79
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,200
This is the most tricky part
of this matter.

80
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,070
In the past, Zichuan was prosperous.

81
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,750
Not only in government, but even
more so in commerce.

82
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,150
Before Gu Lan, the clan
had immense wealth.

83
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,800
It wasn't just through heavy taxation
and extortion,

84
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,390
but more through collusion
between officials and merchants.

85
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,190
That's right.

86
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,120
Now, only the Three Central Offices

87
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,970
can plug this gap for the clan.

88
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
After the war,

89
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,750
our clan's power and the nation's strength
were greatly diminished.

90
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,510
But those nobles in the
Three Central Offices

91
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,720
still frequently build mansions

92
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,490
and expand their residences.

93
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,950
So they should be the ones to pay for it.

94
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,410
I think this is a good idea.

95
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,320
But there's one problem.

96
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,730
Those people only take and never give.

97
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,750
Without some forceful measures,

98
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,080
I'm afraid they won't be easy
to deal with.

99
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,560
Princess Ning, do you have any plans?

100
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,920
Send a petition first. Show courtesy
before resorting to arms.

101
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,310
If we want to extract funds from
the Three Central Offices,

102
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,510
it won't be easy, of course.

103
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,190
But we need to make them realize

104
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,159
that their money

105
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,820
isn't all rightfully earned.

106
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,560
If they're willing to hand over the money
obediently, that's fine.

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,050
If they're not willing,

108
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,480
in the past, when Zichuan
faced great disasters,

109
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,950
the clan temporarily nationalized
the salt and mining industries

110
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,010
to replenish the national treasury.

111
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,380
Father did this when he was still around.

112
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,720
If they don't want to cut off
their own profits

113
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,390
by sticking to old practices,

114
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,160
then they'd better show some sincerity.

115
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,310
Si Yilin.

116
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,750
Your complexion looks good today.

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,390
The way you looked so depressed
a few days ago,

118
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,410
I was really worried about you.

119
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,820
Who would have thought

120
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,360
the Tiger of Zichuan had this side to him?

121
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,240
Sorry for making you worry,
Lord Chieftain.

122
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,310
I'm alright now.

123
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,750
When you live to my age,
you'll understand.

124
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,130
There's no love that can't be forgotten,

125
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,990
and no person who can't be let go.

126
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,040
It's all just a struggle with
one's own obsessions.

127
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,720
By the way, the battle report on
the conflict with the Liufeng family...

128
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,520
It was my oversight.
I'll get it done right away.

129
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,480
No, no.

130
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,540
I only mentioned this to tell you that

131
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,240
Qing has already written it for you.

132
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,420
You only need to go to the Ministry of
Government Supervision and sign it.

133
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,960
This girl Qing,

134
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,950
she's just like that.

135
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,310
Always doing things quietly,

136
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,040
and never mentioning it.

137
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,270
This kid,

138
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,770
I really admire her.

139
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,210
After you recaptured the
three cities this time,

140
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,520
everyone in the court and beyond
was full of praise,

141
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,740
and your marriage was brought up again.

142
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,000
But Qing told me

143
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,650
not to mention it anymore.

144
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,090
I asked her why.

145
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,820
She said she didn't want to put you
in a difficult position.

146
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,940
But who would comfort her

147
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,120
for the grievances she's endured?

148
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,870
Alright. You young people

149
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
handle your own affairs.

150
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,670
I'm just here nagging a little.

151
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,270
Someone actually released a Sky Lantern
in the Imperial Capital.

152
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,270
What's going on?

153
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,390
Lord Si Yilin.

154
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,350
Bring it here.

155
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,080
My Lord.

156
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,650
We don't know when this got here.

157
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,800
It probably drifted in from
outside the city.

158
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,170
Go on, don't delay your duties.

159
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:15,900
Yes.

160
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,730
Your Highness.

161
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,030
It was my fault for accidentally releasing
the Sky Lantern.

162
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:41,030
I will go to the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs
tomorrow to receive my punishment.

189
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,910
You've visited all the nobles of
the Three Central Offices

190
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,310
in the Imperial Capital?

191
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,100
And you've only got this much?

192
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,360
Chief Advisor Xiao claimed to be ill
and refused to see anyone.

193
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,090
Most of the other advisors said

194
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,080
that this is all they have left
in savings.

195
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,870
Advisor He even kicked us out

196
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,350
and injured the attendant
who went with us.

197
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,210
He also said...

198
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,610
That Your Highness hasn't even
ascended to the throne yet,

199
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,320
but is already asserting your authority
and exploiting people,

200
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,680
which is disrespectful and defiant
to the martyrs of Zichuan.

201
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,540
Absurd! How dare he slander
Her Highness like that!

202
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,770
He should be sent directly to the Ministry of
Military and Legal Affairs for punishment.

203
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,670
Advisor He knows

204
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,370
that the reason why Lord Chieftain
sent me to handle this matter

205
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,860
is that he cannot personally intervene.

206
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,800
Issuing a decree to collect money,

207
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,960
I have no legal support,

208
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,080
nor do I have any power to rely on.

209
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,720
Of course he dares to speak brazenly
and without fear.

210
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,920
It's because my foundation is too weak.

211
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,930
I simply can't hold them down.

212
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,550
Have you visited Mr. Ma, Ma Wei?

213
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,980
What did he say?

214
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,390
I have. The housekeeper of the
Ma Residence said

215
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,630
that Mr. Ma Wei is out on a business trip

216
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,760
and won't be back until the afternoon.

217
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,510
Prepare the carriage.

218
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,840
I'll make a visit to the Ma Residence
myself.

219
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,570
Yes, My Lady.

220
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,010
If Your Highness has something
you want to say,

221
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,270
I can convey it for you.

222
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,920
I know

223
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,390
you're worried that others
will speak ill of me.

224
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,670
But if I go in person,

225
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,490
Ma Wei will have to show me some respect.

226
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,560
Most of the Three Central Offices still
paid some money.

227
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,370
That means they don't want to offend me

228
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,840
or the clan.

229
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,950
They're still waiting to see what happens.

230
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,750
The Ma family is a rising star in
the Three Central Offices.

231
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,750
If he acts too attentively,

232
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,720
the other advisors will surely worry

233
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,780
that we're getting too close,
which would benefit him.

234
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,430
This way, they won't dare to neglect me.

235
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,290
I didn't expect Your Highness to
have such insight.

236
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,430
It seems I was too narrow-minded.

237
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
What insight could I possibly have?

238
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,910
I was just thinking about

239
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
what Xiu would do in this situation.

240
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,090
I know the clan is going to repair
the Wayun Fortress,

241
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,480
and Your Highness is in charge of
overseeing it.

242
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,540
Therefore, I went through every part of
the Imperial Capital overnight,

243
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,440
urgently mobilizing all liquid funds from

244
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,280
the Ma family’s banks in all regions.

245
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,360
Although it's not enough to
support the repairs,

246
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,760
I hope it'll be a good start for
Your Highness's fundraising.

247
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,150
I heard long ago that Your Highness's
favorite drink is osmanthus tea.

248
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,810
Last year, I personally harvested
the osmanthus from the garden.

249
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,790
I'm truly delighted that

250
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,090
my wish can be fulfilled today.

251
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,130
That's very thoughtful of you, Mr. Ma.

252
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,660
I love osmanthus tea

253
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,930
only because when I was little
and together with Xiu,

254
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,160
he loved to drink it.

255
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,240
I most admire

256
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,210
someone like Your Highness,
who loves so deeply,

257
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,829
because I am the same way.

258
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,329
I'm sure Your Highness's visit here

259
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,270
isn't solely because of me.

260
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,170
Has the fundraising encountered
some obstacles?

261
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,369
On my way back to the city,

262
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:31,110
I also heard some disrespectful words
from Advisor He.

263
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,590
Advisor He drove away my attendant
and spoke ill of me.

264
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,520
This shows disrespect to the clan.

265
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,830
I want to make an example of him

266
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,240
to intimidate those advisors
who are unwilling to contribute.

267
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,350
However, the powers behind
the Three Central Offices

268
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,270
are deeply entangled and very complex.

269
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,400
So I'd like to hear your advice, Mr. Ma.

270
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,600
Advisor He's actions are
disrespectful to the clan,

271
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,310
which is indeed disheartening.

272
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,000
It's just...

273
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,240
Please speak freely, Mr. Ma.

274
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,290
If I continue speaking,

275
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,640
I'm afraid I might end up like Advisor He,

276
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,440
overstepping my bounds and
being disrespectful.

277
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,680
Mr. Ma, what you're saying today

278
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,680
is not in the capacity of an advisor,

279
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,790
but rather as a friend giving advice

280
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,850
to another friend.

281
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,420
How could that be considered overstepping?

282
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,110
The reason why Chieftain entrusted
this matter to Your Highness is that,

283
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,640
on one hand, he couldn't
intervene directly;

284
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,030
and on the other hand, it's a test
for Your Highness,

285
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,160
to see if you have the political acumen

286
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,690
befitting an heir to the clan, right?

287
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,220
Then, what if...

288
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
I mean, hypothetically,

289
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,510
if Your Highness takes this chance
to severely punish Advisor He,

290
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,900
the other nobles in the Three Central
Offices would surely petition together,

291
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,690
accusing you of ruthless exaction
and deeming you unfit to govern.

292
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,830
How should Your Highness
handle that situation then?

293
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,830
After all, there's no law in Zichuan

294
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,070
requiring merchants

295
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,270
to donate for the clan's difficulties.

296
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,990
If more than half of the members
of the Three Central Offices

297
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,790
threaten to strike and boycott,

298
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:17,980
Zichuan's finances

299
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,240
would collapse within ten days.

300
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,330
How do you think the Chieftain
would handle this, Your Highness?

301
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,930
At worst, I'll follow the old precedent

302
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,560
and nationalize the mining
and salt industries.

303
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,570
This move does conform to the old system,

304
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,310
but currently, the clan has no department
for commerce or salt affairs.

305
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,270
If you were to actually implement it,

306
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,440
without years of planning and preparation,

307
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,350
it would be difficult to make a profit
in the short term.

308
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,070
It might even lead to shortages of goods
in various regions,

309
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,800
causing further civil unrest.

310
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,510
So according to what you're saying,

311
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,550
this money

312
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,640
cannot be raised from the
Three Central Offices?

313
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,970
That's not what I meant.

314
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,180
Your Highness has issued
a fundraising notice,

315
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,980
which is a way to test the waters.

316
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,270
I believe most advisors have donated
something, more or less,

317
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,930
but that was out of fear of
the clan's authority.

318
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,690
If Your Highness is willing to
take a step back

319
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,620
and use both carrot and stick,

320
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,510
they will have no choice
but to compromise.

321
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,480
Hold a charity banquet

322
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,140
initiated in the clan's name.

323
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,940
Those advisors can claim
they have no money,

324
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,050
but their wealth and assets are there
for all to see.

325
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,700
They can't possibly say they don't have

326
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,280
even a single piece of precious antique
to offer, can they?

327
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,170
Once they see the opportunity,
they'll be eager to participate.

328
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,320
If there are clan treasures
that can be donated,

329
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,780
they will be even more eager
to get involved.

330
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,500
If there can be an auction,

331
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,320
the price will likely soar,
bringing considerable income.

332
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,550
I have quite a few jewels in my residence

333
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,110
that can all be donated for sale.

334
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,510
My father and uncle

335
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,550
have also bestowed many precious items
upon me.

336
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,590
I also have a collection of
valuable porcelain.

337
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,200
I'll have my servants pack them up shortly

338
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,110
and send them to
Your Highness's residence.

339
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,450
Merchants have the strongest
sense of competition.

340
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,550
When those advisors see how generous I am,

341
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,550
they'll surely speculate that this move
will bring future benefits.

342
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,510
They will definitely be lining up at
Your Highness's doorstep

343
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,070
to deliver their treasures.

344
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,680
At that time, I'll have a word with
the advisors I'm familiar with

345
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,050
and explain a thing or two.

346
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,400
This will surely stir things up.

347
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,400
Yesterday's battle went pretty well.

348
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,310
Although we didn't capture Bulu Village,

349
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,680
we did get to test our strength.

350
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,480
Turns out those people are
all equally weak.

351
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,240
Today, you all eat and drink well.

352
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,960
Tomorrow, let's take the sacred temple
in one go!

353
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,240
Victory to the North Clan!

354
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,700
Victory to the North Clan!

355
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,520
Come on, have some vegetables.

356
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,440
I said have some vegetables, not the meat.

357
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,160
Now that

358
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,210
we've already conquered most of Yuanzhou.

359
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,100
If we take the sacred temple,

360
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,030
then this rabble in Yuanzhou

361
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,960
will lose their spiritual pillar.

362
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,050
As for the remaining areas,

363
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,710
we can attack however we want.

364
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,400
As long as we capture the sacred temple,

365
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,130
it's first come, first served
for what's inside.

366
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:18,830
Eat.

367
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,350
My Lord.

368
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,920
The North Clan soldiers brought by Lu Di

369
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,120
are less than 10,000.

370
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,130
They're stationed near Longya Mountain.

371
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,070
The combined forces of all races
in Yuanzhou

372
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,350
are twice their number.

373
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,080
Although we have a significant

374
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,310
advantage in numbers,

375
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,680
last time, Lu Di, with just
a few thousand soilders,

376
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,390
defeated us thoroughly.

377
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,920
If they attack again,

378
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,290
I estimate their target

379
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,950
will be the sacred temple
behind Bulu Village.

380
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,030
Although this time, Elder Budan

381
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,440
has publicly ordered all races to unite,

382
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,210
these people have been fighting separately
for a long time.

383
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,680
I'm afraid they may have agreed
on the surface,

384
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,810
but in reality, it won't be effective.

385
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,440
Luo Jie.

386
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,200
I asked you to gather the
leaders of each race

387
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,510
for pre-battle assignments.
How's that going?

388
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,440
I'm almost too embarrassed to say,

389
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,720
but the Snake Race and the Gnomes

390
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,720
played rock-paper-scissors to decide
who guards the city gate.

391
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,850
The Snake Race lost,

392
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,350
but they refused to honor the bet
and went back on their word.

393
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,350
And then there's the Dragon Race.

394
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,210
The Dragon Race was cooperating
well with the Orcs,

395
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,880
but when the Dragon Race found out
that the Orcs' supplies

396
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,340
far exceeded their own...

397
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,350
You know,

398
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,100
those Orcs are all like that,

399
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,740
with such big appetites.

400
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,830
But the Dragon Race doesn't care.
They just want food.

401
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,440
In this case,

402
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,270
the Elves are the most sensible.

403
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,680
Look at this.

404
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,400
This is the report they
submitted privately.

405
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,830
Submitting private reports doesn't
seem like the Elves' style.

406
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,230
This isn't a complaint, but a resignation.

407
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,790
They wrote so long,

408
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,250
but the message is simple:

409
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,960
they're saying they lack
the ability to help,

410
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,880
so we should leave them out of it.

411
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,270
My Lord! We crouched in ambush all night

412
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
and finally caught a North Clan soldier.

413
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,000
They have a cavalry unit
that's reached here,

414
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,640
and their supply wagons have arrived here.

415
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,880
This is great news.

416
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,240
They've retreated?

417
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,960
No, they're coming to attack.

418
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,750
Chief.

419
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,720
Look at the mess we're in now.

420
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,920
Everyone's fighting their own battles.

421
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,200
Even if they come to attack,
we can't handle it.

422
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,930
What's there to be happy about?

423
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,480
These people are giving me a headache
with all this arguing.

424
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,000
I just want one battle, to die and
be done with it.

425
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,400
Let Lu Di give us a quick end.

426
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,770
Why should we, the Snake Race,
be used as bait?

427
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,750
Are you looking down on our strength?

428
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,550
We can fight! We want to stand
in front of the sacred temple.

429
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,920
We'll give those North Clan brats
a taste of our fists!

430
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,680
We won't be

431
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,000
hiding in the woods, throwing stones,

432
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,130
or setting up ropes.

433
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,960
For those petty tricks,

434
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,200
we'd better leave them to
the little Elves.

435
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,160
Who are you calling little?

436
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,000
I think

437
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,270
the Dragon Race should be the bait.

438
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,640
You don't even have to fight.

439
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,480
All you have to do is run for your lives.

440
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,110
What did you just say?

441
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,030
Say that again!

442
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,030
You want to fight, huh?

443
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,830
What did I say?

444
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,400
Bring it on!

445
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,120
Stop arguing, all of you!

446
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,680
I trust Lord Xiu.

447
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,350
Let's hear what he has to say, okay?

448
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,830
Go ahead.

449
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,680
If you ask me,

450
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,350
you should all stop fighting

451
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,200
and just save yourselves.

452
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,960
How can we do that?

453
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,640
Why not?

454
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,690
The North Clan is about to attack,

455
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,490
and what are you all doing?

456
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,070
Still arguing endlessly here.

457
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,350
I think you might as well invite Lu Di in

458
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,240
and give him your sacred temple

459
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,350
as a welcoming gift.

460
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,960
We'll live or die with the sacred temple!

461
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,790
How can we surrender just like that?
We won't surrender!

462
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,830
Right, we won't surrender!

463
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,640
Fine, you said it.

464
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,790
Let me be blunt then.

465
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,370
My men of the Xiu Battalion and I

466
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,110
have already packed our bags

467
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,110
and are ready to retreat at any time.

468
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,750
Whether the sacred temple
can be preserved

469
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,170
and whether Yuanzhou can find peace,

470
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,960
it's all up to you.

471
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,920
What is he doing?

472
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,680
What Lord Xiu means is that

473
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,120
If you want to live,

474
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,070
shut your mouths.

475
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,160
Guys.

476
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,500
Let me ask you this:

477
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,920
in terms of speed and climbing ability,

478
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,160
who's better than the Snake Race?

479
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,790
So, other than the Snake Race,

480
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,200
who's more suitable to be the bait?

481
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,440
And you Elves.

482
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,530
You're good at archery and setting traps.

483
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,830
I need you to lead everyone

484
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,290
to set up traps in advance.

485
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,090
And you Dragon Race

486
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,030
is born with incredible arm strength

487
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,310
and fighting prowess.

488
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,590
You're perfect for dealing with the
North Clan members who fall into the traps

489
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,320
and confronting them head-on.

490
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,810
This time, I hope

491
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,570
everyone can bring out their best skills

492
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,550
and show them what we're made of.

493
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,720
Let me first explain my plan.

494
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,270
First, I need the Snake Race
to split into two groups

495
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,790
and guard outside Bulu Village.

496
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,250
If you encounter the enemy,
just curse them.

497
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,270
Shout all those foul words

498
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,440
right at them.

499
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,160
But remember, don't engage in combat.

500
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,920
When the time comes,

501
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,640
lead them all into the city.

502
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,790
Later,

503
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,240
the Dragon Race and the Elves
will take over.

504
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,480
What if they don't come to support us?

505
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,790
This is the biggest problem with
all the races of Yuanzhou:

506
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,590
a lack of trust among each other.

507
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,350
If the Dragon Race and Elves

508
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,720
don't provide support as instructed,

509
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,440
then my Xiu Battalion will stand by
and do nothing.

510
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,590
At that time, you'll have to
watch helplessly

511
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,400
as your Elder Budan

512
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,970
has his head chopped off by Lu Di

513
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,200
and your sacred temple gets desecrated
by the North Clan.

514
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,980
And this place

515
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,560
will be your final resting place.

516
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,720
Guys.

517
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,310
Only by unity and coordination

518
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,920
do we have a chance of
winning this battle,

519
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,480
and only then will Yuanzhou have
any hope of survival.

520
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,310
Unite as one, defend the sacred temple!

521
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,320
Unite as one, defend the sacred temple!

522
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,140
Unite as one, defend the sacred temple!

523
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,260
Unite as one, defend the sacred temple!

524
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,370
Unite as one, defend the sacred temple!

525
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,750
How can I protect you

526
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,570
when I don't even have iron bars?

527
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,100
If we don't have iron bars, we can
bite with our teeth.

528
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,200
We can smash them with
stones from the roadside.

529
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,610
If we don't have weapons,
we can use wooden sticks or sharp tiles.

530
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,090
As long as we can

532
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,810
After we fight a battle,

533
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,070
we'll have everything we need, won't we?

534
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,960
Don't worry.

535
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,150
We'll definitely win.

536
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,050
Thank you, Lord Xiu.

537
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,270
With this knife,

538
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,680
I can accomplish

539
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,300
even the most dangerous mission.

540
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,960
My Lord, whatever you want me to do,
just name it.

541
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,720
Stay alive.

542
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,720
You're just a bunch of scumbags
and bastards!

543
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,550
Bastards!

544
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,530
You are born to be a bunch of cucumbers,

545
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,520
begging to be slapped!

546
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,440
Begging to be slapped!

547
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,030
You are born to be walnuts,

548
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,920
begging to be smashed!

549
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,430
Begging to be smashed!

550
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,370
Coward!

551
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,990
Coward!

552
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,890
Coward!

553
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,850
What a bunch of useless rabble.
Fire the arrows!

554
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:20,750
Hurry!

555
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,640
Hurry!

556
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,440
Petty tricks.

557
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,900
Be careful and search carefully!

558
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,410
Search!

559
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,240
My Lord, the village is empty.

560
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,640
There's no sign of life.

561
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,640
Catch him!

562
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:36,850
After him!

563
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,160
Let's go!

564
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,360
My Lord.

565
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,740
Don't panic. Keep moving forward!

566
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,510
My Lord.

567
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,670
These bastards are asking for death.
Set the fire!

568
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,540
Set the fire!

569
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,090
Let's go!

570
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,370
A bunch of lunatics!

571
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,780
Burn it down further!

572
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,180
That bastard Lu Di is coming for us.

573
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,760
Prepare to fight!

574
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,590
Guys, let's fight to the death!

575
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,530
Fight to the death!

576
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:54,310
Fight to the death!

577
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,090
Elder, should I go help?

578
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,630
Quick, hide and don't come out.

579
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,400
Charge!

580
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,280
Budan.

581
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,700
Didn't expect to be captured alive
by me today, did you?

582
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,070
Who are you?

583
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,350
You kept saying

584
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,100
you wanted to capture me alive.

585
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,870
Don't you recognize me now?

586
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,950
You're not Budan. Who are you?

587
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,000
I am...

588
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,800
Your grandpa!

589
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,580
The hell!

590
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,080
I'll chop off your head today

591
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,440
and offer it at my grandpa's grave!

592
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,730
Lord Lu Di.

593
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,550
It seems your army has suffered
heavy losses.

594
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,840
Who on earth are you!

595
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,410
Does it matter who I am?

596
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,070
I was careless this time.

597
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,110
I didn't expect this bunch of losers
from Yuanzhou

598
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,920
to have learned to use tactics.

599
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,090
The loser becomes the bandit.
Just kill me.

600
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,440
You may go.

601
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,210
If you don't kill me this time,

602
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,360
I'll definitely kill you next time.

603
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,230
Sure.

604
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,150
I'll keep this for you.

605
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,870

606
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,110

Brother Xiu, we won!

608
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,700
You were really brave.

609
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:32,510
Elder Budan. We won.

610
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,460
You should go out now.

611
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,620

and welcome.

We suffered significant casualties
in the battle at the sacred temple.

690
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,350

00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,280
No way!

692
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,400
Careful! It hurts.

693
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,160
Alright.

694
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,530
If other North Clan generals find out

695
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,510
that I was captured by Budan
and then released,

696
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,170
they'd laugh their heads off.

697
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,280
They might even treat me

698
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,190
as Budan's spy and
deal with me accordingly.

699
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,390
This matter must be kept confidential.

700
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,230
But I can't swallow this anger.

701
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:52,440
One day, I will raze that sacred temple
to the ground!

702
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,140
Is the person who captured you

703
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,790
really Elder Budan?

704
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,630
If it were him,

705
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,150
why would he have let you go?

706
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,110
I don't know who Budan is.

707
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,760
But that guy's voice sounded familiar,

708
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,630
and he was wearing a mask.

709
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,710
It might be

710
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,960
another trick of that old bastard Budan.

711
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,440
No matter what scheme he uses,

712
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,300
one day I will raze that sacred temple
to the ground.

713
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,090
If I can't defeat him by force, I'll
outsmart him.

714
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,590
You...

715
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,230
It hurts!

716
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,360
Only by uniting all races of Yuanzhou,

717
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,150
each contributing their strengths,

718
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,750
can we secure the long-term
peace of Yuanzhou.

719
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,080
I, Zichuan Xiu, belong to Yuanzhou.

720
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,730
Thank you, Lord Xiu, for saving my life.

721
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,480
This is a gift for you, Lord Xiu.

722
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,310
The king who dispels darkness.

723
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,070
The light that illuminates the world.

724
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,210
The divine prophecy passed down
in the sacred temple

725
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:29,970
has finally come true today.

726
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,810
From this day forward,

727
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:35,500
he shall be the King of Light of Yuanzhou.

728
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:39,940
He will lead all the people of Yuanzhou

729
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,670
to regain freedom!

730
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:46,090
King of Light!

731
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,960
King of Light!

732
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:54,520
King of Light!

733
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,290
King of Light...
