00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,770
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,640
Then let's stick to the plan.
I'll break through their lines.

4
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,330
You'll lead everyone to retreat.

5
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,710
If it were just an ordinary general
from the North Clan,

6
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,970
we might have a chance.

7
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,640
But besides

8
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,470
Admiral Yun Qianxue,

9
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,000
Divine Emperor of Sairong
will be there too.

10
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,070
Divine Emperor of Sairong?

11
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,420
Never mind.

12
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,840
Being able to fight
alongside you on the battlefield—

13
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,170
it would be worth it even if I die.

14
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,870
Tch!

15
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,340
Don't jinx it like that.

16
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,360
I plan to live to 99.

17
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,210
Second Brother.

18
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,550
With the war upon us,

19
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,630
are you thinking about
Princess Ka Dan of the North Clan?

20
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,250
Yes.

21
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,200
But I'm on the battlefield now.

22
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,960
And tomorrow,
I'll face her father in battle.

23
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,910
Don't worry.

24
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,200
You can't harm Divine Emperor of Sairong.

25
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,620
He can't harm you either.

26
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,400
You'll still have a chance to meet again.

27
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,540
Will we really meet again?

28
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,760
And you? Who are you thinking about?

29
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,520
Me?

30
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm thinking about so many people.

31
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,260
Like Hua,

32
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,970
Duo, Li,

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,590
and Fang.

34
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,430
In short,
I'm thinking about lots of people.

35
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,220
Even before death,
you're still full of nonsense.

36
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,150
Divine Emperor sent 100,000 soldiers
as reinforcements.

37
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,080
Payi City has been tightly surrounded.

38
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,750
What odds do we have?

39
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,290
80%.

40
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,950
Only 80%?

41
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,610
With Divine Emperor's arrival, our morale

42
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,010
is at its peak now.

43
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,960
It's indeed the perfect time to strike.

44
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,430
Then why only 80%?

45
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,310
Di Lin.

46
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,650
Di Lin often makes me uneasy.

47
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,100
Di Lin only has

48
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,990
tens of thousands of soldiers.

49
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,280
I think what you're really worried about

50
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,050
is my brother

51
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,510
and Lu Di. Right?

52
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,450
You're indeed my confidant.

53
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,690
Now, Prince Ka Dun and Lu Di

54
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,320
have been watching.

55
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
I must win this battle.

56
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,880
Only by taking Payi

57
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,220
will they no longer be your threats.

58
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,490
But Di Lin...

59
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,780
Can he fly or something?

60
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,390
Now, Payi is as good as ours.

61
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,920
Let's hope so.

62
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,510
Are the animal hides and oil ready?

63
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,659
Yes.

64
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,270
Based on when Si Yilin's men entered Payi,

65
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,780
they must've run out of supplies days ago.

66
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,810
Now, even an idiot can

67
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,280
take them down, let alone Yun Qianxue.

68
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,770
My Lord, we are

69
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,670
far from Payi.

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,120
And there are numerous soldiers

71
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
of the North Clan between us.

72
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,480
To deliver supplies and intel—

73
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
I'm afraid it's like reaching the heavens.

74
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,600
Is it difficult to reach the heavens?

75
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,000
You mean...

76
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,330
using war falcons to deliver the supplies?

77
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,390
But one war falcon can't carry much.

78
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,430
One or two might not be enough.

79
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,270
But what about 100 or 200 war falcons?

80
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,400
Then all the war falcons we brought...

81
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,120
My Lord.

82
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,409
Those who are besieged in Payi City

83
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,610
are my brothers.

84
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,690
The North Clan's army is assembling.

85
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,440
Today is the day
you make a name for yourselves!

86
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,070
For Divine Emperor's great cause!

87
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,470
For Divine Emperor's great cause!

88
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,540
For Divine Emperor's great cause!

89
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,310
For Divine Emperor's great cause!

90
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,210
Look, what's above the North Clan's army?

91
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,330
Dark clouds?

92
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
It's Big Brother.

93
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,780
Every war falcon is worth a fortune.

94
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,700
They're practically
Big Brother's most prized possessions.

95
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,160
My Lord, all the war falcons

96
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,960
are on the way to Payi,
fully loaded with supplies.

97
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,770
Archers, prepare!

98
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,000
Loose!

99
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,520
Here they come!

100
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,380
Here they come!

101
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,360
Big Brother didn't even leave us a note.

102
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,740
We're here risking our lives
to guard Payi City.

103
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,740
He's probably...

104
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,600
Speechless?

105
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,270
It's Di Lin.

106
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,800
Archers, draw full!

107
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,950
What are you looking at?

108
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,350
I'm looking at whatever you're looking at.

109
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,550
My lords, with war upon us,

110
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,270
would you like to eat something
and prepare for the battle?

111
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,050
No time to eat.

112
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,450
There's not enough time.

113
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,240
You're... just looking at the sky?

114
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,730
What we're doing
is a matter of life and death.

115
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,590
If we don't hold on,

116
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,180
all of us will die.

117
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,970
What could possibly make both of you die?

118
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,000
Could it be...

119
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,850
He's here.

120
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,460
Everyone, get out of the way!

121
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,500
Watch out!

122
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,320
You were too slow.

123
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,330
Big Brother.

124
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,820
You big fool, how did you get injured?

125
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,810
It's nothing. You two are the real fools.

126
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,050
You've been surrounded for so long.

127
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,650
You're surrounded,
yet you're still gathering together.

128
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,650
Clearly, all three of you are fools.

129
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,200
We missed our best opportunity.

130
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,270
On my command!

131
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,690
Are you going to attack?

132
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,960
Their morale is sky-high.

133
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,030
We'll be at a disadvantage!

134
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,230
We have to strike now.

135
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,800
If we wait for them to rest and regroup,

136
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,330
we'll truly have no chance.

137
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:58,670
Okay.

138
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,750
On my command! Full attack!

139
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,340
Full attack!

140
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,320
Kill!

141
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,600
Kill!

142
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,080
Today, let the three of us

143
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,760
give the North Clan
a drink they'll never forget.

144
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,620
Is it worth it?

145
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,120
It's the only way.

146
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,540
No one retreats.

147
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,040
No one retreats!

148
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,910
Press the attack!

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,850

Second Brother, you're the one going soft.

161
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,040
Then let's see whose blade is faster.

162
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,030
Cut the crap.

163
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,910
On the battlefield,

164
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,240

Big Brother, you sacrificed so much

170
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,270
in order to save us.

171
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,150
The Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs

172
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,580
spends so many silk coins every year

173
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
training a few hundred war falcons.

174
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,720
After this battle,

175
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,190
most of them are gone.

176
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,240
More than half of them are gone.

177
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,800
I knew you're the best.

178
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,900
You care about me.

179
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,330
Cut it out.

180
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,010
Second Brother, I'm fine.

181
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,860
By the way, Big Brother,

182
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,270
um... your wings were so cool.

183
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,410
Although they're broken,

184
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,100
I think they can still be used
with some repairs.

185
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,560
Why don't you give them to me?

186
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,290
I want to fly in the sky too.

187
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
No wonder you said those nice words.

188
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,670
So you want my wings?

189
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,750
You made a lot of money

190
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,950
through the Wealth Building Hall, right?

191
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,070
Give me the money.

192
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,600
No problem.

193
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,670
As long as you give me the wings,

194
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,550
I'll give you the money
as soon as I leave.

195
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,010
From what I know about you,

196
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,800
if you're saying that,
it means there's not much money.

197
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,160
I...

198
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,520
You what? Do you have any money?

199
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,570
I have money.

200
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,550
Big Brother, I'm broke anyway.

201
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,670
The Palace Guards
are out of ammunition and food.

202
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,860
I know you well enough.

203
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,600
You've never had much money.

204
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,600
But

205
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,930
if the Palace Guards

206
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,290
can remember my kindness, that's enough.

207
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,240
Second Brother, the three of us

208
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,490
are together again.

209
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,870
And we have enough supplies for now.

210
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,230
But the North Clan's army is strong.

211
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,990
Facing them head-on might be a bad idea.

212
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,710
Moreover, from what we know

213
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,300
about Yun Qianxue,

214
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,470
he will constantly attack the city

215
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,400
to wear us down.

216
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,840
The supplies I brought

217
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,300
can only meet our needs for now.

218
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,580
It can't turn the tide.

219
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,640
If the North Clan
launches a full attack now,

220
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,849
even the three of us

221
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,200
might not be able to win.

222
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,440
We're on our own now.

223
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,099
If we put up a desperate fight,

224
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,240
there might be a slim chance of survival.

225
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,640
But that would cost many soldiers' lives

226
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,480
and even involve innocent civilians.

227
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,440
Such a victory
would be no different from a defeat.

228
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:29,780
Big Brother, we dragged you into this.

229
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,780
We're brothers. Enough of that.

230
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,370
But what I'm most worried about now

231
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,680
is the 300,000 soldiers
stationed outside the city,

232
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,400
and the Divine Castle's

233
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,850
one million fully prepared soldiers.

234
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,970
Their whole clan is ready for war.

235
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,480
Even if they take Payi,

236
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,260
they won't stop.

237
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,880
That's right.
Based on the current situation,

238
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,490
I guess they want to break through Payi,

239
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,280
take the entire Yuanzhou,
and go straight to Imperial Capital.

240
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,610
Divine Emperor is quite ambitious.

241
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,020
Divine Emperor is too arrogant!

242
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,100
But...

243
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,120
what if I have a way

244
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,640
to make them retreat without fighting?

245
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,150
Big Brother,

246
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,080
you mean peace talks?

247
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,240
Only peace talks can minimize
our family's losses

248
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,240
and save the lives of our soldiers.

249
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,640
Whether Imperial Capital

250
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,240
would agree is one thing.

251
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,530
Now is not the best time for peace talks.

252
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,730
Given the current disparity
in military strength between us,

253
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,030
it seems that peace talks and surrender

254
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,200
are not much different.

255
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,450
That's because
we have too few bargaining chips.

256
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,180
Unless...

257
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,200
The military supplies brought by Di Lin

258
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,880
have been transported into Payi City.

259
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,270
I wanted to attack Payi at all costs,

260
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,780
but unexpectedly,

261
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,550
Di Lin had a backup plan.

262
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,480
They used oil to set fire to our camp.

263
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,950
I lost many soldiers. I'm unforgivable.

264
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,990
Please punish me, Divine Emperor.

265
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,600
I also suffered defeats when I was young,

266
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,750
but I am different from you.

267
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,800
I never admit mistakes.

268
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,750
Because I know that on the battlefield,

269
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,830
every decision I make is correct.

270
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,590
If it were me,

271
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,920
I would have done the same today.

272
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,740
I dare not compare myself to you.

273
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,640
Please grant me death, Divine Emperor!

274
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,660
Save your life

275
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,530
to fight the three brothers from Zichuan.

276
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,390
What you just said

277
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,900
has reminded me of a strange thing.

278
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,160
Last night, when I went
to the North Clan's camp

279
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,440
to gather intel,

280
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,750
I found the flags hanging

281
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,960
on their tents were black.

282
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,680
Those are usually used to mourn

283
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,050
members of the North Clan's royal family.

284
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,920
Ka Lan and Ka Dun are still alive.

285
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,330
Could it be that they're mourning Ka Dan?

286
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,910
You mean...

287
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,010
they believe
Ka Dan died in Imperial Capital?

288
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,180
The assassination attempt
on Ka Dan in Imperial Capital last time

289
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,710
was the North Clan's doing.

290
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,320
But

291
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,920
they failed.

292
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,400
However, they still spread the word

293
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,330
that Ka Dan died.

294
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,600
After that, Lord Ge sent people
to the North Clan many times,

295
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,930
trying to clear up the misunderstanding.

296
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,580
Looks like the message

297
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,680
never reached Divine Emperor of Sairong.

298
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,080
I came to Yuanzhou before

299
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,310
because Divine Emperor
believed Ka Dan died

300
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,710
and sent troops out of anger.

301
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,570
They all say Divine Emperor
cares much about Ka Dan.

302
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,880
Looks like it is true.

303
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,790
There's another possibility.

304
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,400
Divine Emperor of Sairong knows
Ka Dan is still alive,

305
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,480
but he still needs that excuse.

306
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,830
Otherwise,

307
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,960
why didn't he send someone
to Imperial Capital

308
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
to confirm whether Ka Dan was alive?

309
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,480
Big Brother,

310
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,270
it's too risky to have peace talks.

311
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,560
How will we know if we don't try?

312
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,240
And this time,
I will personally meet Divine Emperor.

313
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,700
Personally meet Divine Emperor of Sairong?

314
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,400
Alone?

315
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,550
Big Brother, that's a gamble.

316
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,600
Do you have another idea?

317
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,040
Don't worry.

318
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,880
I will ask Ka Dan

319
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,210
to write a letter first.

320
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,440
Otherwise, I'd have no proof even if I go.

321
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,550
As long as Divine Emperor
cares about Ka Dan's life,

322
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,570
with this letter,

323
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,270
he will agree to meet me.

324
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,640
But even if we let Ka Dan go,

325
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,960
he won't stop the war, right?

326
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,350
Ka Dan's brother
has always wanted her dead.

327
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,990
He'll definitely try to sabotage things.

328
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,530
Given the current situation,
that is our only option.

329
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,770
And the more cards we have, the better.

330
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,830
Ka Dan will be our most important one.

331
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,000
But don't worry.

332
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,730
I will try my best
to control the pace of the negotiation

333
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,990
and make as few concessions as possible.

334
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,750
It's getting late.

335
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,370
Let's go check on your second brother.

336
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,560
Second Brother,

337
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,370
I just got a bottle of good wine

338
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,540
from that tavern in Payi City.

339
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,430
The owner was so stingy.

340
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,400
It cost me half a sack of grain
to trade for it.

341
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,390
Why don't the three of us find a place

342
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,650
and drink it together?

343
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,070
It's been a long time
since we had a drink together.

344
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,350
Judging from the current situation,

345
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,480
war can't end war.

346
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,940
Having peace talks is the best solution.

347
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,190
But you're my brother.

348
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,140
If you want to put on a desperate fight
against Divine Emperor's army,

349
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,810
the three of us together
might not necessarily lose.

350
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,470
Second Brother,
I'm not afraid of death either.

351
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,770
I'll follow your lead.

352
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,290
I won't become a sinner of Zichuan.

353
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,040
Take good care of Ka Dan for me.

354
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,730
Big Brother, Second Brother,

355
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,750
I miss home so much.

356
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,970
Big Brother, go.

357
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,920
Leave Payi to us.

358
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,070
Kill!

359
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,020
Hold the line!

360
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,630
Hold the line!

361
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,030
Are you all blind?

362
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,730
How dare you stop Lord Di Lin from the
Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs?

363
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,920
Luo Minghai, you're quite well-informed.

364
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,260
I just returned to Imperial Capital,
and you're already here.

365
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,340
[Luo Minghai]

366
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,890
Di Lin, you're supposed
to be stationed in Wayun.

367
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,880
Why are you in Imperial Capital?

368
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,000
I have urgent matters
and must see Lord Chieftain.

369
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,000
What matters?

370
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,680
Military secrets. I can't tell you.

371
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,030
I am the commander-in-chief
of the Ministry of War.

372
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,230
All military affairs

373
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,480
must first be reported
to the Ministry of War.

374
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,680
Looks like
you're not just neglecting your duties.

375
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,200
You're also disregarding
Zichuan's military discipline!

376
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,050
Luo Minghai!

377
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,110
I don't have time to waste words with you.

378
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,070
Get out of my way!

379
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,760
[Li Qing]

380
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,570
Chieftain wants to see

381
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,820
Di Lin, Minister
of the Military and Legal Affairs,

382
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,950
in Chieftain's Mansion immediately.

383
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,070
Let them pass.

384
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,000
Withdraw!

385
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,370
Thank you for helping me, Lord Li Qing.

386
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,160
No need for that.
It's my duty to pass orders.

387
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,140
I just returned to Imperial Capital,

388
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,900
and Lord Chieftain already knows?

389
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,450
My Lord, you just came back,

390
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,540
and Luo Minghai already knows too.

391
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,230
You seem to like this bouquet.

392
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,740
What's it called?

393
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,130
[Ka Dan]

394
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,290
It's called...

395
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,550
Forget-me-not.

396
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,000
Only after coming to Imperial Capital

397
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,800
did I learn such a flower exists.

398
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,360
I had never seen it
when I was in the North Clan.

399
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,780
I guess only Zichuan's soil and water

400
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,850
can nurture it.

401
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,500
Forget-me-not?

402
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,210
Your Highness,
Lord Di Lin requests an audience.

403
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,840
Lord Di Lin came?

404
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,860
Isn't he supposed to be in Yuanzhou?

405
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,550
He said he came to see Princess Ka Dan.

406
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,960
So I came to ask you for a favor.

407
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,810
Divine Emperor of Sairong

408
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,100
doesn't know you're still alive.

409
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,090
So please write a letter to prove

410
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,370
you're safe and sound.

411
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,460
I see. I'll write it now.

412
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,540
I'll give it to you shortly.

413
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,790
Thank you, Princess.

414
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,670
Princess Ning,
I have other matters to handle.

415
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,120
I'll take my leave first.

416
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,570
Are they okay?

417
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:57,740
They're fine.

418
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,830
They're in Payi now.

419
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,280
The city is easy to defend
and hard to attack,

420
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,650
and they have sufficient supplies.

421
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,600
You can rest assured.

422
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,380
Goodbye.

423
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,590
Li Cheng.

424
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,320
You haven't eaten all day.

425
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,350
Big Brother has been gone
for ten days, right?

426
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,030
Yes.

427
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,520
If he traveled non-stop

428
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,270
at full speed,

429
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,950
I guess
he's arrived in Imperial Capital by now.

430
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,210
And if he travels non-stop again,

431
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,930
he could be back within ten days.

432
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,800
Then we need to make our food
last for at least ten days.

433
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,010
The North Clan has retreated for now.

434
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,460
But I guess

435
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,520
they'll launch the next attack soon.

436
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,750
We need to rotate our defenses quickly.

437
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,990
They attacked us ten times
within five days.

438
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,640
Looks like they're trying to wear us down.

439
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,070
The North Clan
has stationed a massive army here.

440
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,630
It's draining them too.

441
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,440
What was their advantage—sheer numbers—

442
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,790
has now become a burden.

443
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,410
They must be growing anxious.

444
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,840
Their attacks

445
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,880
will only grow fiercer.

446
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,440
Let's continue.

447
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,670
Second Brother, you've been at it all day.

448
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,110
Get some rest. I'll take your shift.

449
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,240
They say Di Lin treats his wife very well.

450
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,930
[Zichuan Canxing]

451
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,760
He combs her hair every day.

452
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,260
Now that I see your skills,

453
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,390
it seems the rumor is true.

454
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,110
My Lord, I thought you were resting.

455
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,820
I didn't mean to disturb you.

456
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,880
I was waiting for you.

457
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,180
You've toiled day and night. Thank you.

458
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,100
When I left Imperial Capital,

459
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,410
I didn't see so much gray hair.

460
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,640
One city, one strand of gray hair.

461
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,030
It's fine.

462
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,530
It's natural as one gets old.

463
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,540
If my hair were still pitch black,

464
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,610
that would make me a monster.

465
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,680
Alright, let's not talk about hair.

466
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,030
Come.

467
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:45,510
Tell me about the situation in Payi.

468
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,750
Payi… is on the brink of fall.

469
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,420
Is there

470
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:11,659
food in Payi?

471
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,540
The supplies I delivered there
can only last for ten days at most.

472
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,280
Are there

473
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,670
soldiers in Payi?

474
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,159
We lost over half of the Palace Guards
and the Xiu Battalion's soldiers.

475
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,969
What about the North Clan's army?

476
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,679
Divine Emperor is there
overseeing the battle himself.

477
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,280
They're unstoppable
with one million soldiers.

478
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,239
My Lord.

479
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,889
The North Clan's formation
is vast and formidable,

480
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,889
stretching over 33.3 miles—
an awe-inspiring sight.

481
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,960
I once compared myself to Yama.

482
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,800
But when I was standing
atop Payi's city walls

483
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,000
and watching their army surge forward,

484
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,110
all I felt was despair.

485
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:15,930
If that's the case,

486
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,540
not just Payi is on the brink of fall.

487
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,610
So is Zichuan.

488
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,140
Fang Jin's Black Banner Army,

489
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,720
Ming Hui's Border Appeasement Army,

490
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,320
and Si Yilin's Palace Guards

491
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,830
have all suffered devastating losses.

492
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,100
Zichuan's foundation has been damaged.

493
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,360
Over the next ten years,
there will be constant war.

494
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,800
There will be reckless conscription,

495
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,170
and the farmland will be taken.

496
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,230
The people will suffer.

497
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,840
Zichuan is facing a calamity.

498
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,000
So I came back

499
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,630
to beg you

500
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,030
to allow me to have peace talks
with the North Clan.

501
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:13,150
There's a vast strength disparity
between the North Clan and us.

502
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,780
They could easily crush us

503
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,880
and march straight to Imperial Capital.

504
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,800
Why would they want peace talks?

505
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,640
So I beg you

506
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,810
to agree to two conditions.

507
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,700
Go ahead.

508
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,940
First, return Ka Dan.

509
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,950
When we fought them up close,

510
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,810
we learned

511
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,010
Divine Emperor believes Ka Dan is dead.

512
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,480
It's partly
due to Yang Minghua's interference,

513
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,480
and partly because
Prince Ka Dun concealed the truth.

514
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,800
Divine Emperor loves his daughter deeply.

515
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,000
If we return Ka Dan,

516
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,550
and she mediates,

517
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,780
there'll be hope for peace talks.

518
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,010
That's right.

519
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,150
In that case,

520
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,070
having peace talks

521
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,880
is reasonable.

522
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,530
As for the second condition...

523
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,360
My Lord, please...

524
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,520
give up the jurisdiction
over the 23 districts in Yuanzhou.

525
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,760
That is the only way.

526
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:40,530
Di Lin!

527
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:44,230
Do you know what you're talking about?

528
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,030
I understand.

529
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,030
Yuanzhou has belonged to Zichuan
since the time of our ancestors.

530
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,960
Yuanzhou is like an arm of Zichuan.

531
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,630
The pain of losing an arm
is like losing one's soul.

532
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,100
Yuanzhou is like the flesh of Zichuan.

533
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,240
Without flesh, our bones can't stand.

534
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,820
If we give up Yuanzhou,

535
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,360
you''d be a chieftain
who surrenders your sovereignty.

536
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,810
And I'd be a traitor to the country.

537
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,240
We'd be despised
by our ancestors in the Holy Spirit Hall,

538
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,780
scorned by the world,

539
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,150
and reviled through history.

540
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,110
Then do you

541
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,280
still want to cede Yuanzhou?

542
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:31,880
Please allow me to explain three things.

543
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,790
First, in this chaos
across the Xichuan Continent,

544
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,760
only armies

545
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,280
and strength matter.

546
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,380
As long as we have troops,

547
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,490
everything we've lost can be taken back.

548
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:54,230
Zichuan's only remaining elite force now

549
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,940
is the Palace Guards.

550
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,320
We must protect it at all costs!

551
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,070
Second,

552
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,190
the Zichuan family has suffered

553
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,590
too much in recent years—

554
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,510
the North Clan's invasion

555
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,350
and the loss of the Chishuitan

556
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,770
and the Moon Bay.

557
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,030
We've lost over a million soldiers.

558
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,880
We are battered.

559
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,200
And now the North Clan
is as fierce as a tiger.

560
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,360
As we struggle against them,

561
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,110
the Liufeng family is eying us covetously!

562
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:32,000
If we fight, we'll have
no chance of winning.

563
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,530
In three years, Zichuan will fall.

564
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,250
When that happens,

565
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,320
how should we face our ancestors?

566
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,820
Please continue.

567
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,580
Third,

568
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,450
our family needs time to recover.

569
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,990
We need mothers to birth new children.

570
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,590
We need granaries
and treasuries to be full again.

571
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,280
My Lord.

572
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,630
Ten years. We only need ten years.

573
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,230
Then we can have an army
of two million soldiers again.

574
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,920
Si Yilin, Xiu,

575
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,450
and I will help you reclaim everything

576
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,660
you've lost!

577
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,830
Ten years...

578
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,830
I wonder if I'll still be alive by then.

579
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,090
Time and patience

580
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,830
are all we have left.

581
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,960
During the ten years, we can
strengthen our administration,

582
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,420
cease war beyond our borders,
and endure hardship in silence.

583
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,210
Zichuan will soon become powerful again.

584
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,170
Besides, you're still in your prime.

585
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,960
There's no need to worry so much.

586
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,920
Furthermore...

587
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,590
Furthermore, Princess Ning

588
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,540
will surely live to see the day
of peace and prosperity with her own eyes.
