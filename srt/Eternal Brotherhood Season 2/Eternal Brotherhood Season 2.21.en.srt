[Eternal Brotherhood 2]

00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,729
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,870
My Lord.

4
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,400
Whatever it is, we'll talk about it
when I get back.

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,950
My Lord.

6
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,789
The envoys from different districts
have broken into a fight.

7
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,650
What happened?

8
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,789
Weren't you supposed to be
leading them

9
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,570
in learning the techniques of open-source
water diversion?

10
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,000
It's precisely because of this.

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,280
This afternoon, after touring the wells

12
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,790
and learning the techniques of
well-digging and water diversion,

13
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,200
they decided to trade their cities'
specialties

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,530
for tools to bring back.

15
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,630
That's exactly what
Lady Pang Xiya expected.

16
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,470
Is there a problem?

17
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,110
The problem arose with the tool exchange.

18
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,710
Each city has different specialties.

19
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,870
Some brought a piece of diamond to trade,

20
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,240
some brought a sea buckthorn seedling,

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,910
and some even brought a large
piece of smoked meat.

22
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,280
Those who brought sea buckthorn seedlings

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,560
felt that those with stones
were getting too good a deal.

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,910
They argued, "This stone of yours can't be
eaten or used,"

25
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,560
"why should it get you so many tools?"

26
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,680
Then those who brought smoked meat

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,190
said to those with
sea buckthorn seedlings,

28
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,190
"You're getting too good a deal.

29
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,750
We'll suffer losses
if you trade this way."

30
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,840
Just like this, no one was
willing to yield,

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,800
and in the end, they started arguing
and even got into a physical fight.

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,870
Fortunately, Lady Pang Xiya

33
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,960
ordered to halt all exchanges,

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,020
which finally calmed the situation.

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,079
This is indeed a problem.

36
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,430
Yuanzhou is now under the jurisdiction
of the North Clan.

37
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,310
The gold and silk coins of the
Zichuan family

38
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,240
are no longer in circulation here.

39
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,560
Their measure of value

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,870
lacks a unified standard.

41
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,120
When faced with such issues,

42
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,980
it's indeed impossible to
conduct fair exchanges.

43
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,590
I'll tell you more next time.

44
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,400
Wait. My Lord.

45
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,960
What should we do about it then?

46
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
Those envoys from various
districts

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,190
have traveled a long way here
to learn techniques.

48
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,790
We can't let them return empty-handed,
can we?

49
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,770
We do need to ensure they return
with both techniques

50
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,770
and tools.

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,090
As for Lady Pang Xiya,

52
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,810
we need to ensure she receives
her due benefits.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,600
When it comes to techniques,

54
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,680
it takes at least a day or two to learn.

55
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:22,870
How about this?

56
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,650
Go back and tell Lady Pang Xiya

57
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,030
that all exchanges will be suspended
for now

58
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,870
so that they can focus on
learning the techniques.

59
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,670
As for the method of exchange...

60
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:31,930
Come on.

61
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,150
Give me a couple of days to think it over,
and I'll let you know.

62
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,140
Yes, Sir!

63
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,490
I came to Yuanzhou to seek medicine
for my father.

64
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,910
I didn't expect to get involved
in this incident.

65
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,570
And I certainly didn't expect to
encounter you.

66
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,870
I'm even more surprised that you,
Miss Lin Yu,

67
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,800
would stand up for the Dragon Race.

68
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,170
It's truly admirable.

69
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,530
I've asked around.

70
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:00,890
The black market for dragon horn
trading is right here.

71
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,860
Then let's pretend to be a married couple,

72
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,300
seeking a cure for your sickness.

73
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,160
Remember that.

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,280
Sure.

75
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,300
I love role-playing the most.

76
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,600
Check it out.

77
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,370
This outfit of mine.

78
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,990
I, Zhang Asan, can truly play
any role convincingly.

79
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,420
I'm truly amazing.

80
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,870
You look way too radiant for someone

81
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,930
supposedly suffering from atrophy.

82
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,180
You...

83
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,070
Thank you.

84
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,690
Wait for your husband.

85
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,340
Are you sure it's here?

86
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,140
I've investigated thoroughly.

87
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,290
I'm sure it's here. Let's go in.

88
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,110
[Pharmacy]

89
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,170
What would you two like to buy?

90
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,390
Sir.

91
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,700
My husband's been struggling

92
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,480
with atrophy for a while.

93
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,600
We heard...

94
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,790
We heard that the dragon horn
can cure all diseases.

95
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,920
Do you have any here?

96
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,090
The dragon horn is forbidden.

97
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,220
We run a legitimate business here.

98
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,830
If you want medicine,

99
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,230
I can prescribe you some.

100
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,950
But don't get any wrong ideas.
Please leave.

101
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,480
Could we have really been wrong?

102
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,680
I observed carefully just now.

103
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,880
There were no flaws.

104
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,310
However, forbidden items are
traded underground.

105
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,830
It takes the right connections

106
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,240
to avoid detection.

107
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,870
I suppose we looked like outsiders

108
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,210
and he didn't trust us.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,210
What should we do now?

110
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,990
The trafficking of the Dragon Race is
strictly prohibited in Jialai District.

111
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,190
Once discovered, it's a serious crime.

112
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,590
You were well aware of the law,
yet you defied it.

113
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,920
What punishment do you think you deserve?

114
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,510
Officer.

115
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,720
My husband has been suffering
from atrophy.

116
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,640
If there were any other cure,

117
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,670
we wouldn't be taking this risk.

118
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,040
Please, Officer, have mercy.

119
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,010
Honey.

120
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,680
You look pretty young.

121
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,850
You do seem pitiful.

122
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,870
However, the dragon horn is
a forbidden drug.

123
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,480
With you asking so openly and blatantly,

124
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,140
even if he had it,

125
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,180
he wouldn't dare to sell it to you.

126
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,550
Please, Officer, enlighten us.

127
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,540
Think about it.

128
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,640
This is not appropriate.

129
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,120
Officer, please give us some advice.

130
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,600
I'm putting my life in your hands.

131
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,800
No need for that.

132
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,500
Don't you have any diamonds?

133
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,290
No.

134
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,380
If you want good stuff,

135
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,390
you need to follow their rules.

136
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,310
As soon as you enter, you should ask

137
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,310
for black medicine jars,

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,330
the three-legged ones.

139
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,289
This way,

140
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,970
he'll know you're a regular customer.

141
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,240
Sir.

142
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,030
Sir, do you sell medicine jars?

143
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,360
Yes.

144
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,320
We have them in purple clay, black
pottery, and plain clay,

145
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,450
with no legs, three legs, or four legs,

146
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,240
and in square, round, long,
and flat shapes.

147
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,500
Which kind do you want?

148
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,910
The three-legged black pottery
medicine jars.

149
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,870
I need a large quantity of them.
Do you have enough in stock?

150
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,600
You've come to the right place.

151
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,360
I want to inspect the goods
before buying.

152
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,390
This way, please.

153
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,840
Please.

154
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,920
They're regular customers.

155
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,690
Have a seat.

156
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,270
Those who can enter this room

157
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,670
are all sincere buyers,

158
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,260
but not many require to inspect.

159
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,630
The dragon horn here

160
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,270
comes from freshly killed dragons.

161
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,670
Inspecting the goods is against the rules.

162
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,680
What if I want to buy them all?

163
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,280
That's quite a bold statement.

164
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,080
You've seen my condition.

165
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,030
I've been seeking treatment for years
without success.

166
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,320
If the dragon horn can really
cure my illness,

167
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,410
then I certainly don't mind the cost.

168
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,200
I know you've got the resources,

169
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,660
so I'll make an exception.

170
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,160
But we don't accept gold coins.

171
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,140
Since we do business here in Yuanzhou,

172
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,910
we only accept diamonds.

173
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,320
Alright, I'll go exchange for diamonds.

174
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,180
Hold onto the goods for me.

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I want them alive.

176
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,590
Rest assured.

177
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,510
Why do merchants in Yuanzhou

178
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,800
all want diamonds?

179
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
What use is this worthless rock?

180
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
It's sturdy.

181
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,510
Sturdy?

182
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,160
How sturdy can it be?

183
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,220
This thing

184
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,650
can't be cut by a knife or
damaged by fire.

185
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,160
It won't shatter when frozen.

186
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,760
If you put it under sunlight,

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,320
it's dazzling.

188
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,350
It can be preserved forever.

189
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,670
No wonder some governors

190
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,480
use it to decorate headpieces,

191
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,840
make clothes, and such.

192
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,320
Last time, you told me

193
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,250
about two envoys who quarreled
over a trade,

194
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,630
who brought diamonds with them. Which
district are they from?

195
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,630
Shaluo District.

196
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,480
Shaluo District...

197
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,910
Tell me the details.

198
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,200
Shaluo District is in the northern part
of Yuanzhou.

199
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,320
It's not large, mostly mountainous.

200
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,960
Not suitable for growing crops.

201
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,870
So the people there

202
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,870
often don't have enough food to eat.

203
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,720
Yeah, the land over there isn't
fit for farming.

204
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,850
They can only dig up some...

205
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,440
Stones.

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,660
Put it back.

207
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,090
In Shaluo District,

208
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,360
you probably can't even exchange this for

209
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,320
a bag of grain.

210
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,540
But in Sairong City or the
Imperial Capital,

211
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,110
it's priceless.

212
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,120
You know what?

213
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,200
It's because the Imperial Capital
and the North Clan

214
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,280
don't have this thing.

215
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,720
Rarity increases value, you know.

216
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,180
That's exactly the point.

217
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,620
Rarity increases value.

218
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,910
Things in Yuanzhou don't have
clear price tags,

219
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,040
but these diamonds circulate freely.

220
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,320
We can use these diamonds

221
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,380
as the unified currency for Yuanzhou

222
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,240
and control its production areas.

223
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,170
This way, people won't need
to barter anymore.

224
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,320
Everything can be settled with diamonds,

225
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,770
right?

226
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,550
Li Nong, go

227
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,370
get the envoy from Shaluo District
for me.

228
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,790
The Three Central Offices are indeed
cautious in their work.

229
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,590
But with the efforts of the entire
Ministry of War,

230
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,800
we still found a flaw.

231
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,120
Ma Wei was once in charge of

232
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,390
the barren mountain management
work at Wayun Fortress.

233
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,240
Under the guise of planting trees,

234
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,790
he diverted several batches of funds.

235
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,390
That money wasn't used for
planting trees at all.

236
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,790
The numbers don't add up.

237
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,670
It's time we report to Lord Chieftain.

238
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,630
Now that we have this,

239
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,000
we can arrest Ma Wei

240
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,670
to obtain more evidence.

241
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,600
We should go now without delay.

242
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,010
The repair work of Wayun Fortress

243
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,850
was originally the responsibility
of the Three Central Offices.

244
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,550
But the residents of Wayun were
suffering terribly.

245
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,630
The compensation funds weren't
properly distributed,

246
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,240
causing refugees to cause trouble.

247
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,000
Yet they tried to divert attention,

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,670
claiming that the refugees' unrest
shows a lack of support for the army,

249
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,930
which led to the Yuanzhou Army's defeat.

250
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,950
But the compensation funds had been
allocated to the Three Central Offices.

251
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,270
Now, they want the clan

252
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,360
to bear these costs

253
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,950
so they can get away scot-free.

254
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,530
Those from the Three Central Offices

255
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,620
are going too far.

256
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,530
The Three Central Offices have
numerous members,

257
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,590
and the forces behind them are both
extensive and deep.

258
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,360
It's a delicate situation where
one move affects everything.

259
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,390
Previously,

260
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,670
the Three Central Offices were suppressed
by Yang Minghua.

261
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,330
Now that Yang Minghua is gone,

262
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,490
they've regained their strength
and are reorganizing.

263
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,880
Our clan is being held back by them,
unable to make any moves.

264
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,080
Zichuan can no longer

265
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,320
withstand any more blows.

266
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,120
But if we don't investigate,

267
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,000
it would be indulging
the Three Central Offices.

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,200
Once the seeds of corruption take root,

269
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,120
they will only become more
rampant in the future.

270
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,200
You're right.

271
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,270
Zichuan has faced many hardships.

272
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,760
If the poison of corruption
becomes deeply rooted,

273
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,410
it will be too late.

274
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,360
You two have always been
diligent, dutiful,

275
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,790
loyal, and responsible.

276
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,600
I'll entrust this matter to you guys.

277
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,670
The key is to give the people of Wayun

278
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,830
a proper explanation.

279
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,350
-We won't let you down, Chieftain.
-We won't let you down, Chieftain.

280
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,160
My Lord.

281
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,040
Have you really decided to take action
against the Three Central Offices?

282
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,250
They are willing to make
contributions to me.

283
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:56,180
It's good for the country and
the people, isn't it?

284
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,110
You are wise, My Lord.

285
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,750
What's so wise about me?

286
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,790
Di Lin is a smart man.

287
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,750
He knows that by himself,

288
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,579
it's difficult to take on the
Three Central Offices.

289
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,420
So he asked Luo Minghai for help.

290
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,450
He may well know

291
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,800
that you've been waiting for
this day, My Lord.

292
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,079
It's rare for the Ministry of Military and
Legal Affairs and the Ministry of War

293
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,910
to be so united in opinion.

294
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,720
As the saying goes,

295
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:34,600
"things long united must divide,
and things long divided must unite."

296
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,850
What do you want?

297
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
You can't come in!

298
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,100
Lord Ma.

299
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,960
Trespassing into the advisor's residence
late at night.

300
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,640
The Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs
is a bit too brazen, isn't it?

301
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,550
Lord Ma is suspected of

302
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,220
embezzling funds for the renovation
of Wayun Fortress.

303
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,830
Please come with us to assist
with the investigation.

304
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,640
Absurd.

305
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,770
The innocent have nothing to fear.

306
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,970
If you want to investigate me,
show me the evidence first.

307
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,120
Without evidence,

308
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,830
how would we dare to bother
the esteemed Advisor Ma Wei?

309
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,950
Our Ministry always enforces
the law impartially.

310
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,980
If you are innocent,

311
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,640
I will personally escort you back
after the investigation.

312
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,160
What if I refuse to go?

313
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,070
It seems Advisor Ma Wei
doesn't know me very well.

314
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,450
What, you'll kill me right here right now?

315
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,170
As long as I believe someone is
detrimental to Zichuan,

316
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,640
anywhere,

317
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,040
I can take anyone's life.

318
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,210
My Lord,

319
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,720
although Ma Wei has just entered
the Three Central Offices,

320
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,070
the Three Central Offices have always
been united as one.

321
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,440
We are all in this together,

322
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,960
sharing both glory and disgrace.

323
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,960
I know.

324
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,290
And if Di Lin is really going to
investigate thoroughly,

325
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,090
I'm afraid...

326
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,720
Of course we need to save Ma Wei.

327
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,440
He's young and smart.

328
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,480
If we nurture him well,

329
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,240
he'll surely become a pillar
in a few years.

330
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,920
But how should we save him?

331
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,070
To put it bluntly,

332
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:50,590
Di Lin and Luo Minghai are just pawns.

333
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,680
You mean... Chieftain?

334
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,270
My Lord.

335
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,250
Ni Bo from the Three Central Offices
is here.

336
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,090
Show him in.

337
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,010
Yes, My Lord.

338
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,880
Advisor Ni Bo, please.

339
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,640
Ah, Advisor Ni Bo.

340
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,490
Greetings, Lord Chieftain.

341
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,920
You're getting on in years, and it's not
easy for you to move about, Advisor.

342
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,620
Come, please sit down.

343
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,000
Thank you for your understanding,
Lord Chieftain.

344
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,880
[Ni Bo, Member of Three Central Offices]

345
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,680
Please, have a seat.

346
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,700
What's the matter?

347
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,240
Do you see something amiss with my attire?

348
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,920
No, no, that's not it.

349
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,310
I remember the last time
I saw you, My Lord,

350
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,070
it was eight years ago.

351
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,560
Back then, what you loved most every day

352
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,030
was to fiddle with books and paintings.

353
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,360
Lord Yuanxing always chided you for this.

354
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,640
In the blink of an eye, how
things have changed.

355
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,680
Yes, indeed.

356
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,790
When you saw him chiding me,

357
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,790
you always spoke up for me.

358
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,880
Yes, indeed.

359
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,080
I watched you two grow up.

360
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,310
I know your temperaments better
than anyone.

361
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,480
That's for sure.

362
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,560
You are the most respected teacher
to Yuanxing and me.

363
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,270
Although in recent years, due to
health reasons,

364
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,840
you've rarely made public appearances,

365
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,210
I always remember

366
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,500
your teaching.

367
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,060
Advisor Ni Bo, you've been very sensitive
to cold these years.

368
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,220
I'm aware of that.

369
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,490
Come on, add more coal.

370
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,040
Yes.

371
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,930
Back then, Lord Yuanxing and I
chatted a lot.

372
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,950
He said,

373
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,850
if Chieftain is the mouth of the clan,

374
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,490
then the Three Central Offices

375
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,520
are the eyes.

376
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,770
If the people no longer trust these eyes,

377
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,260
then they will no longer believe

378
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,370
in the path the clan shows them.

379
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,110
And eyes

380
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,520
are the most vulnerable part
of the human body.

381
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,720
A cut on the hand

382
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,880
will heal in a few days.

383
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,720
But once the eyes are injured,

384
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,920
it's hard to recover.

385
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,330
So the more vulnerable a part is,

386
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,480
the more it needs protection.

387
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,660
Is it a bit too hot?

388
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,260
It's bearable.

389
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,450
I still remember when you made Yuanxing
and me recite poems.

390
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,660
Yuanxing and I would

391
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,340
recite for a while, and then we'd
sneak out

392
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,800
to play with the servants' children.

393
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,930
Teacher, you'd be very angry
when you saw that,

394
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
and you'd punish us by making us copy

395
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,960
each character 500 times.

396
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,480
Look.

397
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,110
It's this character.

398
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:41,050
You said the character "jing" (quiet) is composed
of "qing" (green) and "zheng" (compete).

399
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,890
"Qing" is the color of newborn things,

400
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:49,510
"zheng" is two hands pulling
in opposite directions, persisting,

401
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,350
and "jing" means remaining undisturbed,

402
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,450
always holding onto the
original intention.

403
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,700
It's hot enough now.

404
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,900
You see, this brazier. If it's not
heating, it gets cold;

405
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,590
but if it's too hot,

406
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,270
breathing becomes difficult.
Too much is as bad as too little.

407
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:18,000
You see, the eyes are fragile,

408
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,680
but if not polished,

409
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,920
they become like pearls covered in dust,
losing sight of the original intention.

410
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:31,200
Teacher, this was the lesson
you taught us.

411
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,230
If you don't mind, Advisor,

412
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,780
I'd like you to have
this piece of calligraphy.

413
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,350
Advisor Ni Bo has returned?

414
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,070
Yes. I heard that Lord Chieftain

415
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,000
bestowed him a calligraphy piece.

416
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,480
What kind of calligraphy?

417
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,280
I have no idea.

418
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,240
But Advisor Ni Bo has shut himself in

419
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,680
and refused all visitors,

420
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,700
including our people.

421
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,030
Everyone is moving forward now.

422
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,510
There are fewer and fewer people

423
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,700
in this world who cherish the old ways.

424
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,570
What should we do then?

425
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,550
Ma Wei has an older brother named Ma Qin.

426
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,330
Do you remember?

427
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,200
I heard he's a self-made man,

428
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,240
decisive and ruthless in his actions,

429
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,270
quite famous in their circles.

430
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,850
I guess

431
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,000
he has arrived in the Imperial Capital.

432
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,970
His coming won't make any difference.

433
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,500
Di Lin's side has never been
one to show mercy.

434
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,270
He's an executioner.

435
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,650
Of course, there's no room for mercy.

436
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,240
However...

437
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,680
Since several restaurants

438
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,200
opened nearby,

439
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
we've had far fewer customers here.

440
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,240
Boss.

441
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,080
Should we lower our prices?

442
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,030
No.

443
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,830
Running a restaurant

444
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,700
is all about attracting willing customers.

445
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,090
[Ma Qin, Member of Three Central Offices]

446
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,190
Look, someone's coming.

447
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,550
Welcome, Sir. Please come in.

448
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,310
What's today's special?

449
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,640
Sir, please take a look.

450
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,640
Seafood fried rice.

451
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,730
Sir, don't get it wrong.

452
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,440
This seafood fried rice

453
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,240
costs 100 gold coins per bowl.

454
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,980
I'll take three bowls.

455
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,680
Sir, this money is far too much.

456
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,180
One of these silk coins is worth
several hundred gold coins.

457
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,730
Keep the change as a tip.

458
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,670
Thank you very much, Sir.

459
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,240
Would you like to dine in or take out?

460
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,310
Dine in.

461
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,130
Certainly, Sir. Please wait a moment.

462
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,910
Your boss lady has a great
eye for business.

463
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,790
This restaurant is located in the
city center,

464
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,190
with heavy foot traffic.

465
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,430
Whether it's local vendors

466
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,060
or tourists from out of town,

467
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,160
everyone must pass through here.

468
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,350
Moreover, the facilities

469
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,480
are unmatched by few others,

470
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,030
which further increases your
competitiveness.

471
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,630
You've misunderstood, Sir.

472
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,160
I'm just a freeloader.

473
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,350
They say the owner of Jintai Hotel

474
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,000
is not only beautiful as a flower,

475
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,930
but also eloquent and persuasive.

476
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Seeing you today,

477
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,190
the rumor turns out to be true.

478
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,750
Aren't you the same, Sir?

479
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,210
You knew I was the owner all along,

480
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,550
yet you pretended not to know
and praised me anyway.

481
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,160
Our seafood fried rice

482
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,170
doesn't even sell one bowl a month.

483
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,550
You ordered three bowls at once

484
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,950
and left such a generous tip.

485
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,170
I'm afraid you didn't come here

486
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,830
just to eat some fried rice, did you?

487
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,020
Boss lady, you're indeed clever.

488
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,770
Well, since you've known,

489
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,680
let's speak frankly.

490
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,060
Indeed, I came here today

491
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,790
to discuss a partnership with you.

492
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,180
What kind of partnership?

493
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,500
Opening restaurants.

494
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,520
The Imperial Capital is divided into five districts:
east, south, west, north, and central.

495
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,960
Jintai Hotel is located in
the central district.

496
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,810
I have chosen prime locations

497
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,600
in the other four districts

498
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,610
to invest in opening your
branch restaurants.

499
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,600
Full investment?

500
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,400
That's right, full investment.

501
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,940
If there's a loss, I'll bear it all alone.

502
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,590
We'll split the profits 20-80.

503
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,640
I get 20, and you get 80?

504
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,150
No, I get 20, and you get 80.

505
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,880
May I ask your name,
generous investor?

506
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,540
I am Ma Qin,

507
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,390
and I have a younger brother named Ma Wei.

508
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,470
Ah, it's you, Mr. Ma Qin. My apologies
for the disrespect.

509
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,190
No worries.

510
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,660
I wonder if you're interested in
this partnership, boss lady?

511
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,740
Not at all.

512
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,530
Times are tough these days,

513
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,230
and the people are struggling to
make ends meet.

514
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,990
For a shady business like ours,

515
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,540
one location is enough.

516
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,280
Please enjoy your meal, Mr. Ma Qin.

517
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,920
Here comes the food!

518
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,000
I just love doing business with
straightforward people.

519
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,270
Come on, we're ready.

520
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,010
Please.

521
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,070
Do you want me to do it, or
you want to do it yourself?

522
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,350
I think... I will!

523
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,640
Freeze! Don't move!

524
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,310
Don't move!

525
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,820
Behave!

526
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,790
Don't move!

527
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,030
You despicable liar!

528
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,210
Who are you?

529
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,720
In the name of the King of Light,
I declare that

530
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,850
from today onwards,

531
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,370
Yuanzhou forbids the enslavement
and trafficking of the Dragon Race.

532
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,640
Anyone caught will be executed
without mercy.

533
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,270
Great!

534
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,470
Don't celebrate too soon.

535
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,720
So what if you're the King of Light?

536
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,110
Lord Lu Di won't let you go.

537
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,830
Thanks to you,

538
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,790
when I see Lu Di,

539
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,120
I'll give him a kick too.

540
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,750
Nice!

541
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,550
Well kicked!

542
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,440
Well kicked! Nice!

543
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,200
Nice!

544
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:33,010
Lord Zhang, you saved our people
from danger.

545
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,110
The elder of our Dragon Race

546
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,910
has come specially to express
our gratitude.

547
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,590
I am Gu En, an elder of the Dragon Race.

548
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,720
Thank you for saving our
Dragon Race people.

549
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,720
The Dragon Race will forever remember

550
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,810
this kindness.

551
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,370
Please, Lord Zhang,

552
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,400
convey our gratitude to the King of Light.

553
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,350
Sure, I will.

554
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,550
This young lady has saved our people
multiple times.

555
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,200
This is a chain that only Dragon Race
elders possess.

556
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,490
It contains the deep blessings of
the Dragon Race.

557
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,340
Today, I present it to you

558
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,470
as a token of our gratitude.

559
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,790
Please accept it, Miss Lin.
No need to be polite.

560
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,840
Elder, you're too kind.

561
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,140
Then I'll graciously accept.

562
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,960
Elder, I actually don't seek
your gratitude.

563
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,590
I just have a tricky problem

564
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,400
that I hope you can help me with.

565
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,280
Oh, right, Uncle Gu'en.

566
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,270
Miss Lin Yu has asked me before,

567
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,250
but unfortunately, my
knowledge is limited,

568
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,640
and I couldn't give her an answer.

569
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,270
I will do my best to help.

570
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,350
My problem is related to this totem.

571
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,370
Guards!

572
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,320
Seize them!

573
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,410
You...

574
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
How can you attack us just like that?

575
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,400
Elder, what's this supposed to mean?

576
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,020
Elder, come on, tell them to stop.

577
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,230
Let's talk this through.

578
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,950
Silence!

579
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:32,880
I'd rather die than let you

580
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,400
get the living dragon horn!

581
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,200
What? Living dragon horn?

582
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,710
You're no different from

583
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,090
the Snake Race and the North Clan people!

584
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,550
The totem on this note is

585
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,350
the mark of a special bloodline
of the Dragon Race.

586
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,960
What these words refer to

587
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,590
is the horn of Dragon Race nobility.

588
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,520
Many years ago, it was said that

589
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,790
taking a living dragon's horn
could cure all diseases.

590
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,030
As a result, for nearly 100 years,

591
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,960
our Dragon Race has been hunted and
killed by Snake Race merchants.

592
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,400
The Dragon Race nobility has been
nearly wiped out.

593
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,239
I...

594
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,030
I didn't know this note

595
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,230
meant this.

596
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,670
If Miss Lin Yu hadn't saved me,

597
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,400
I would have already been dead.

598
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:24,060
If this dragon horn can save her father,

599
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm willing to use my life

600
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,449
to repay her kindness!

601
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,360
Stop!

602
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,070
I don't want your dragon horn.

603
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,190
Not to mention this is a legend
of unknown authenticity,

604
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,320
even if it were true,

605
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,690
the act of exchanging life for life

606
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,330
is absolutely not something we should do.

607
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,239
Elder, look.

608
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,489
It's all a misunderstanding,
just a misunderstanding.

609
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,460
Is that really what you think?

610
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,480
Of course.

611
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,070
There are countless miraculous
remedies in this world.

612
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,840
I believe

613
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,890
there must be one that can cure
my father's illness.

614
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,680
I apologize for this
unintentional offense.

615
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,080
Actually, it was we who acted rashly

616
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,000
without seeking the cause.

617
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,710
Please forgive us, Miss Lin Yu.

618
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,200
It's alright.

619
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,190
Since this note

620
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,930
cannot cure my father's illness,

621
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,090
I'll have to seek medicine elsewhere.

622
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,350
I'll take my leave now.

623
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,110
Zhang Asan.

624
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:01,280
Since there's no medicine here
that can cure my father,

625
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,410
I should go home now.

626
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:03,960
So soon?

627
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,150
Think about it.

628
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,350
Our Yuanzhou is a place of talented
people and beautiful scenery.

629
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,230
How about I ask the King of Light

630
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,450
if he knows any miracle doctors
for you?

631
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,630
That won't be necessary.

632
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,080
Actually, there's another way.

633
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,150
What way?

634
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,770
Well, the method is...

635
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,170
I don't usually tell this method
to just anyone.

636
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:36,000
The method is making a wish
to the Wine God.

637
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,030
What's that?

638
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,320
It's a custom here in Yuanzhou.

639
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,710
You write your wish on a note,

640
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,960
bury it in a place with good feng shui,

641
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,760
and water it with 100 types of wine.

642
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,360
When the Wine God manifests,

643
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,110
what you desire will grow from the soil.

644
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,960
How come I've never heard

645
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,560
of such a custom in Yuanzhou?

646
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,510
Because you haven't been here long.

647
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,590
It's normal that you haven't heard of it.

648
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,670
I swear it really works.

649
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,480
Then where is a place with good feng shui?

650
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,220
The King of Light's residence, of course.

651
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,080
Think about it.

652
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,980
The King of Light is such a great hero.

653
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,550
His residence must be a place
with excellent feng shui.

654
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,800
Leave this matter to me.

655
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,320
-Big!
-Come on. Place your bets.

656
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,230
Big!

657
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,190
It's 11. Small.

658
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,400
Small wins.

659
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,630
Come on, let's have another round.

660
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,710
I'm out.

661
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,230
If we keep going, I won't even
have my underwear left.

662
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,280
I've lost everything.

663
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,550
I can't play anymore. I'm done.

664
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,440
You're a grown-up and still
can't handle losing?

665
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:36,800
Is that so?

666
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,110
Come on then.

667
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,710
Come on! I'll go all out.

668
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,790
I'm done. I can't afford to play anymore.

669
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Stop right there!

670
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,280
I didn't expect you guys to be
having such a good time.

671
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,150
She forced us to do it.

672
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,410
Want to play a round?

673
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,190
My Lord, don't listen to her.
She's too good.

674
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:02,880
Bring it on.

675
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,750
I want to bet on his underwear.

676
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,310
Alright.

677
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,760
Before we start,

678
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,960
I have something important to tell you.

679
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,800
Let's go, hurry.

680
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,230
Let's go.

681
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,760
Let's go.

682
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,360
Come back!

683
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,130
You can't escape your responsibilities.

684
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,520
I wonder if, in your mansion,

685
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,880
there are any historical records
of the various races in Yuanzhou.

686
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,680
Most importantly, the history of
the Dragon Race.

687
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,050
Why is the history of the
Dragon Race so long?

688
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,360
Indeed.

689
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,050
And it's all tangled up with the Elves.

690
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,800
The two races fought for so many years.

691
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,920
It's been quite a tumultuous journey.

692
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,670
If it weren't because something bad

693
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,100
happened to our Dragon Race later,

694
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,170
the Elves

695
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,990
wouldn't have won so easily.

696
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,190
Lai Duo, thank you for your trouble.

697
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,440
There's a bond between you and
Miss Lin Yu.

698
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,960
And I think this matter

699
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,960
might be crucially related

700
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,480
to your Dragon Race.

701
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,030
That's why I called you here.

702
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,590
If I can help Lady Lin Yu,

703
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,320
I would be overjoyed.

704
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,110
But until now,

705
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,070
we haven't found anything similar

706
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,420
to what's described on that note.

707
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:19,070
Right now, I'm only thinking about
one question.

708
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,360
What's that?

709
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,510
Can the dragon horn really cure diseases?

710
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,190
Why don't you ask that elder
of the Dragon Race again?

711
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:26,920
Better not.

712
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,510
Lest he puts a knife

713
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,570
to my throat again.

714
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,550
However, after looking through
so much information,

715
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,550
I haven't found a single case

716
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,630
of someone taking the dragon horn

717
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,960
and actually having their disease cured.

718
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,960
Do you have any successful cases
in your books?

719
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,000
Right.

720
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,840
It seems this rumor came out of nowhere,

721
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,350
but it has caused such a big stir.

722
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,670
Fear of death is human nature.

723
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,730
As long as there's a glimmer of
hope to survive...

724
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,320
Human nature.

725
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,190
As long as there's a glimmer of
hope to survive,

726
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,720
whether it's a rumor or not,

727
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,960
people will try it.

728
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,150
As you said before,

729
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,360
the timing of this rumor's emergence

730
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,840
coincides with the time when the
Dragon Race and the Elves

731
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,880
were having their century-long war.

732
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,000
Think about it, could this be a setup?

733
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:50,230
You suspect this rumor

734
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,490
was deliberately spread by the Elves?

735
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,440
Yes. But it wasn't entirely baseless.

736
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,630
Because when things are a mix of
truth and fiction,

737
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,190
they become most believable.

738
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,230
Could it be that in this world,

739
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,550
there really is a medicine similar
to the dragon horn

740
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,880
that can cure diseases,

741
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,840
the effect of which is comparable to
bringing the dead back to life?

742
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,150
Let's focus on searching
herbal medicine classics

743
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,750
to see if there are any clues.

744
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,190
I...

745
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:44,440
The peak of the mountain,
the horn of the dragon.

746
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,510
Where heaven and earth bleed,
swallows return home.

747
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,090
I have something similar here.

748
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,360
The cave of the mountain,
the source of the water.

749
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,190
Forged by Heaven and Rarth's
breath and blood.

750
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,400
Shaped like a dragon's horn but
not an actual horn.

751
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,920
Eating it has the miraculous effect of
revitalizing one's spirit.

752
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,380
It indeed has similarities with
that rumor.

753
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,520
This is the description of the Xuebo Vine.

754
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,880
Our ancestral homeland

755
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,210
is known for producing this in abundance.

756
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,010
It's something we've eaten
since childhood.

757
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,360
But I've never heard

758
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,280
that it has healing effects.

759
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:29,080
I think we've found it.

760
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,920
My Lord, Advisor Ma Qin is here.

761
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,190
Find an excuse to send him away.

762
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:40,630
Yes.

763
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,630
Is Ma Wei's relationship with
Princess Ning

764
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,160
pretty good?

765
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,670
He often

766
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,250
goes to accompany Princess Ning
for archery.

767
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,150
This arrest is being carried out
in secret.

768
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:11,150
I guess Princess Ning probably
doesn't know about it yet.

769
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,910
Your speech to the people was
so brilliant before.

770
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,920
You should have grown from that

771
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,710
and be able to discern some things.

772
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,680
But under the current circumstances,

773
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,630
you still want to see him?

774
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,320
Yes.

775
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:32,840
But I'm not here because

776
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,040
the one who's detained inside is Ma Wei.

777
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,840
It's because since the charity fundraising
began,

778
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,240
I've been involved in it.

779
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,710
I also bear some responsibility for
that incident in Wayun.

780
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:42,760
I must find out

781
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,150
what exactly happened.

782
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,550
According to the law in Zichuan,

783
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,840
before a criminal is publicly
convicted and punished,

784
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,570
they are considered a suspect.

785
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,880
During this period,

786
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,030
the criminal's relatives and friends

787
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:59,690
can apply for reasonable visitation rights
according to the law.

788
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:07,690
Arrange for Princess Ning to exercise
her visitation rights.

789
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,320
Yes.
