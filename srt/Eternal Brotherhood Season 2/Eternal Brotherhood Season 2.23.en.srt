[Eternal Brotherhood 2]

2
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,830
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,350
Your Highness,

4
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,070
according to the customs
of the North Clan,

5
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,789
before the birth of a royal heir,

6
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,780
one must visit the Holy Wall Altar

7
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,680
to pray for blessings upon
both the North Clan and the royal family,

8
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,840
and pray that the barbarians
from the Eastern Wilderness

9
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,510
do not cross the Holy Wall.

10
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,920
The Divine Emperor has had
no grandchildren before,

11
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,650
so Your Highness's journey
is of great significance.

12
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,250
I implore you to be cautious.

13
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,750
Thank you for the reminder,
Counsellor Black Veil.

14
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,630
The journey will be bumpy.

15
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,630
General-in-Chief,

16
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,310
you must not let my daughter

17
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,110
suffer even the slightest harm.

18
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,690
I, Yun Qianxue, will not fail in my duty

19
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,270
to protect the Princess.

20
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,340
I should've

21
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,750
gone with you on this pilgrimage.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,050
But unfortunately,
state affairs are pressing.

23
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,940
I know you dote on me,

24
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,579
but I am the daughter
of the Divine Emperor of Sairong.

25
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:40,320
How can I always remain
sheltered under your wing?

26
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,090
Rest assured,
I will take good care of myself.

27
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,079
Good.

28
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,220
Take good care of my daughter.

29
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,770
Yes, Your Majesty.

30
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,560
Father kept reminding you,

31
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,170
but we both know this trip
was never meant to go as planned.

32
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,170
Your Highness, your delivery is imminent.

33
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,150
If you want to stay out of sight
of everyone in Sairong City,

34
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,030
praying at the Holy Wall
is the only opportunity.

35
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,150
But when we return,

36
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,020
Father will surely not let you off easily.

37
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,280
Everything is for
Your Highness's reputation and safety.

38
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,430
Your Highness,
you don't need to worry about it anymore.

39
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,310
Let's depart.

40
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,079
My Lord, the Governor of Liuyang District

41
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,280
didn't attend the banquet.

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,500
It doesn't necessarily mean
he's against us.

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,910
Perhaps he's just out of the loop.

44
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,320
That's why we're paying
a personal visit this time

45
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,120
to discuss the future plans
for Yuanzhou together.

46
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,579
Though Lu Di was defeated,

47
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,400
the North Clan's strength in Yuanzhou now

48
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,520
cannot be underestimated.

49
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,240
Many districts are still afraid of
the North Clan.

50
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,120
Liuyang District is still
sitting on the fence now.

51
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,320
We need to find a way to solve this issue.

52
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,390
It's not as serious as you think.

53
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,470
In fact, most districts in Yuanzhou

54
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,680
still want to break free
from the North Clan's control.

55
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,470
This time,

56
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,560
we'll treat it as a friendly visit.

57
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,019
Just be careful and cautious
in our actions.

58
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,190
Governor,

59
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,120
Jialai District

60
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,320
and he are now under your control.

61
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,050
I will not disappoint
the King of Light's trust.

62
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,900
Ladies and gentlemen,

63
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,340
once we arrive in Liuyang,

64
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,890
you all set up camp nearby.

65
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,090
I'll take a few people
to scout the situation first.

66
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,220
Understood!

67
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,050
[Holy Wall Altar]

68
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,980
Legend has it that the Holy Wall was built

69
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,070
over several generations by
North Clan leaders a thousand years ago.

70
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,250
How much blood and life

71
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,740
they sacrificed for this

72
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,480
is unknown.

73
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,520
But the vicissitudes of history

74
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,830
are all carved on these stone walls.

75
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,480
How the former North Clan people

76
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,680
managed to create

77
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,790
such a magnificent structure

78
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,080
is truly admirable.

79
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,830
That's why it's called a wonder.

80
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,320
Heaven will bless Your Highness

81
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,360
and protect our North Clan.

82
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,480
However...

83
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,950
It's about time.

84
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,690
You mean...

85
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,600
It's about time.

86
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,830
I'll help you inside right away.

87
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,430
No.

88
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,390
You are not of the royal bloodline
and cannot enter.

89
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,070
The method of praying for blessings

90
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,000
is passed down orally
only within our royal lineage.

91
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,700
I absolutely cannot bring you
into the cave.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,130
But I was planning to

93
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,630
arrange the accident
after the blessing ceremony.

94
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,720
Now, I can only...

95
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
It's too late.

96
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,510
Now, all I can do is stay calm,

97
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,400
dismiss everyone, and enter the cave.

98
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,160
You stay outside the cave and protect me.

99
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,550
Lord Yun, you must follow my instructions.

100
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,480
The blessing ceremony is about to begin.

101
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:44,560
Respectfully seeing off Your Highness.

102
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,500
The flower of the mountain forest

103
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,510
is sheltered by the lush canopy,

104
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,930
while the lotus in the water

105
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,430
is guarded by drifting plankton
and scattered gravel.

106
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,270
I, Ka Dan, have arrived safely.

107
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,090
Thank you all for your efforts.

108
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,390
As I go to pray for blessings,

109
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:22,000
I will surely pray for
the longevity and peace of the North Clan.

110
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,550
Your Highness...

111
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,860
Your Highness!

112
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,250
Guards, escort the Princess
back to the palace!

113
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,030
Divine Emperor above,

114
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,600
I, Yun Qianxue, failed to
protect the Princess properly,

115
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,310
causing the royal grandson
to be born at the Holy Wall Altar

116
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,240
and resulting in
the Princess's premature labor.

117
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,110
I deserve death for this crime.

118
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,960
Rise.

119
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,250
The accompanying personnel
have already given me a detailed account.

120
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,840
Who could have
prevented a premature birth?

121
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,280
Perhaps this is simply the will of heaven.

122
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,020
Regardless, my crime is unforgivable.

123
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,400
You are my daughter's husband,

124
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,550
and now you're
the father of the royal grandson.

125
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,630
Do you expect me to kill you?

126
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,870
Stand up!

127
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,840
There are more important matters
to attend to now.

128
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,550
Someone has betrayed the North Clan.

129
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,020
Read out Ling Buxu's letter.

130
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,680
Under the siege of rebels in Yuanzhou,

131
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Lu Di suffered defeat after defeat,

132
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,600
deliberately concealing
the state of the war

133
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,480
and resulting in the loss
of over 20 districts in Yuanzhou.

134
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,540
I request to dismiss Lu Di
and send support to Yuanzhou.

135
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,690
As of now, Yuanzhou

136
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,170
is no longer under our control.

137
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,830
This is shocking and hard to accept.

138
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,980
Even dying a thousand times

139
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,550
wouldn't be enough to
atone for Lu Di's sins.

140
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,240
What's even more ridiculous is that

141
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,480
Ling Buxu sent several companies
of messengers,

142
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,610
all of whom were assassinated by Lu Di.

143
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,130
This one was a bit luckier

144
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,850
and made it to Sairong City.

145
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Father,

146
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,240
I suggest dispatching
law enforcement officers right away

147
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,150
to Yuanzhou to execute Lu Di.

148
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,770
General-in-Chief, what's your opinion?

149
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,550
Prince Ka Lan once advised me

150
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,750
that executing traitors
is crucial for establishing authority.

151
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,790
Yes, Father.

152
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,950
How to deal with the rebellion in Yuanzhou

153
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
is the key point.

154
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,290
If Your Majesty allows,

155
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,270
I am willing to lead my troops

156
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,910
to Yuanzhou to quell the rebellion.

157
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,720
With just a command from Your Majesty,

158
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,390
Lu Di's head will fall

159
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,360
like it's nothing.

160
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,410
Who do you two think is the most suitable

161
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,230
to support Yuanzhou?

162
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,960
Governor Luo Si of Jiana.

163
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,000
Lord Luo Si is a renowned general
from our clan,

164
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,480
with extensive battlefield experience.

165
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,510
I believe sending him

166
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,200
will surely defeat the rebels
in one stroke.

167
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:40,110
Very well, it's decided then.

168
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,840
Divine Emperor, our North Clan
is blessed by heaven.

169
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,070
Yuanzhou will not be lost easily.

170
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,120
Princess Ka Dan has offered prayers
for the blessings of the North Clan.

171
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,360
Heaven will favor Sairong.

172
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,370
I've been worried about
state affairs lately

173
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,080
and almost forgot the main event.

174
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,160
Princess Ka Dan has given birth to
a royal grandson.

175
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,020
It's a day of national celebration.

176
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,750
He's still sleeping?

177
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,640
Look at the new little robe
I made for him.

178
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,800
Isn't it beautiful?

179
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,770
It's beautiful.

180
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,790
I heard Lu Di lost Yuanzhou.

181
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,720
I volunteered to support Yuanzhou.

182
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,650
His Majesty didn't approve, instead...

183
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,790
He sent Luo Si to Yuanzhou.

184
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,970
Your Highness indeed understands
the Divine Emperor.

185
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,340
Luo Si has always supported Ka Dun.

186
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,560
It seems he wants to use
one force against another.

187
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,000
The Divine Emperor

188
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,600
has never liked Luo Si's attachment
to Prince Ka Dun.

189
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,610
Moreover,

190
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,390
the Data Tribe led by Luo Si

191
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,050
has already posed a threat
to our Sairong Tribe.

192
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,670
Weakening their strength
is the best strategy.

193
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,730
The power to rule

194
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,640
comes from both respect and fear.

195
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,320
This incident will disgrace
the Sairong Tribe

196
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,600
in the eyes of the entire North Clan.

197
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,440
Luo Si will also look down on
our Sairong Tribe even more

198
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,370
and might even wage war against us.

199
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,370
Defeat the Sairong Tribe
and then command the world.

200
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The Sairong Tribe

201
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,500
may appear to rule the North Clan,

202
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,480
but we are also the ones

203
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,140
everyone seeks to overthrow.

204
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
The fear of being surpassed

205
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,510
by other tribes

206
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,000
lingers like a ghost,

207
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,600
haunting Father's mind without end.

208
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,550
And the ghost

209
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,380
has never been this close.

210
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,700
The King of Light, you have traveled
thousands of miles to come here,

211
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,630
gracing Liuyang with your presence.

212
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,099
[An Ge, Governor of Liuyang]

213
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,310
Today, we must have a hearty drink.

214
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,869
I didn't expect that
on this land of Yuanzhou,

215
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,599
there would be such a paradise.

216
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,910
I once heard a saying:

217
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,000
"Raise the sticks and strike the drum,
ease the rhythm and sing in peace."

218
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,240
The part about singing in peace

219
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,720
must be referring to you.

220
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
We Elves,

221
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,110
value joy and freedom.

222
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,400
Liuyang's land is fertile,

223
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,680
so there are many engaged in farming.

224
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,110
The people are simple and honest.

225
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,960
Over the years in Yuanzhou,
we have always been non-competitive.

226
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,550
Haven't you been disturbed
by the North Clan?

227
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,240
If they come,
just let them take what they want.

228
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,510
If given enough,

229
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,110
trouble won't arise.

230
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,830
Each Yuanzhou district has its own way

231
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,360
of surviving to this day.

232
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,560
It's not worth mentioning.

233
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,130
The last time Jialai hosted a banquet,

234
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,240
though I did not attend, I heard about it.

235
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,480
It seems you are determined

236
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,850
to unify Yuanzhou.

237
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,880
Yuanzhou has been separated for too long,

238
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,550
with each district shutting its doors
and relying on itself.

239
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,110
Therefore, unifying Yuanzhou

240
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,070
to prevent invasion by the North Clan

241
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,070
is exactly why I have come.

242
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,750
So, what do you plan to do?

243
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,000
First, we must implement
a unified currency

244
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,000
across all of Yuanzhou.

245
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,030
This move has already gained support

246
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,290
from most districts in Yuanzhou.

247
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,030
A unified currency?

248
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,510
For you, this move

249
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,000
is all benefit and no harm.

250
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,170
The King of Light, how about this?

251
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,400
Let's have a drink first,

252
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,640
and then continue our conversation,
shall we?

253
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,510
Come on.

254
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,360
Wait.

255
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,290
Let me finish my last sentence first.

256
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,020
Then I'll drink with you.

257
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,180
Liuyang District is prosperous,

258
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,290
and Governor An Ge is hospitable.

259
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,240
Here,

260
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,680
I send my blessings to them

261
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,020
on behalf of others from Yuanzhou.

262
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,590
Cheers!

263
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,990
I am not good with alcohol.

264
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,370
I'm known as a total lightweight.

265
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,160
Do you have

266
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,640
a place where I can rest?

267
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,720
Our banquet has just begun.

268
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,370
Let's do it this way.

269
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,440
Come on.

270
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,350
Let's raise a toast
to the friendship between Liuyang

271
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,750
and the King of Light!

272
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,090
The King of Light.

273
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
The King of Light.

274
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Come out, My Lord.

275
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,680
The King of Light, even a genius like you

276
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,070
has your dumb moments, huh?

277
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,960
You didn't expect to
fall into my hands today, did you?

278
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,830
Lord Lu Di, you've now captured
the King of Light alive.

279
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,160
Reclaiming the other districts

280
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,890
is surely just a matter of time.

281
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,430
You made a contribution.

282
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,160
I won't treat you unfairly.

283
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,590
My Lord, the Divine Emperor already knows

284
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,640
about what happened to us in Yuanzhou.

285
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,270
And he has sent Luo Si to come
and hold us accountable.

286
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,470
If we want to survive,

287
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,830
our only option is to
capture the King of Light.

288
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,890
My Lord, you did it.

289
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,350
Some say you were born with an ugly face,

290
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,720
so you wear a mask

291
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,640
to avoid frightening others.

292
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,040
Others say you're actually good-looking,

293
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,850
but you wear a mask because you're afraid
no one would take you seriously.

294
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,310
Opinions vary,

295
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,200
but no one knows
what you actually look like

296
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,350
under that mask.

297
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,720
Today, I'm going to find out

298
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,920
what's beneath that mask of yours.

299
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,920
Zichuan Xiu!

300
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,000
He is Zichuan Xiu!

301
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,030
Stay away from him!

302
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,790
He once killed Lei Hong
in front of the Divine Emperor.

303
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,110
He has extraordinary skills.

304
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,270
Come back, it's dangerous!

305
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,000
It's been a while, Lord Lu Di.

306
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,070
Zichuan Xiu, you're actually
the King of Light?

307
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,310
No.

308
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,450
I mean, we're not strangers.

309
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,800
Drop the formalities, will you?

310
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,130
You can just call me Xiu.

311
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,160
I never thought the one
pulling my strings all along

312
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,830
would be you. You bastard.

313
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,330
Today, I'll kill you

314
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,070
and offer your head to the Divine Emperor.

315
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,830
Wait.

316
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,160
Could you guys

317
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,350
help me untie the rope up there first?

318
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,880
It's really troublesome for me
to do it alone.

319
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,030
Nonsense!

320
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,880
Zichuan Xiu, you're insulting me.

321
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,410
If I don't kill you today,

322
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,110
then I'm not Lu Di.

323
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,030
Wait again.

324
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,070
What now?

325
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,920
If I have to untie it myself,

326
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,070
that's just too much trouble.

327
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,110
I can tell for sure

328
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,310
you're not gonna help me untie this.

329
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,400
Here, tie yourself up.

330
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,000
Kill him!

331
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,290
I told you he was formidable, didn't I?

332
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,260
Chief.

333
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,030
Chief.

334
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,920
The city gates have been opened.

335
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,950
Baichuan and Luo Jie, together with

336
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,590
the men of the Xiu Battalion,
have also taken control of Liuyang.

337
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,280
Good. Leave him here

338
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,040
and take the other two away.

339
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,070
Alright.

340
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:27,300
Let's go.

341
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,160
Move.

342
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,010
What are you going to do?

343
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,240
What are you going to do to me?

344
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,070
What are you planning to do to me?

345
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,550
What exactly do you want?

346
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,440
Can't you just kill me directly?

347
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,980
You're really getting under my skin.

348
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,240
I can't beat you, and I can't run.

349
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:11,110
Even a cat would've given up
chasing a mouse by now.

350
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,220
I study tactics every day

351
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,440
and go up against you,

352
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,960
but I still can't win.

353
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,090
I'm really frustrated, you know?

354
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,640
My life's gotten so bleak because of you.

355
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,680
I'm begging you, please let me go.

356
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,400
Don't worry.

357
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,050
This time, I won't let you off.

358
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,880
Are you going to kill me then?

359
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,270
Kill you? I couldn't bear to do that.

360
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,270
Are you a pervert?

361
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,560
You're the pervert.

362
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,710
Even if I release you now,
you can't go back.

363
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,750
Oh, Lu Di,

364
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,510
I'm afraid this news
can't be kept under wraps anymore.

365
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,070
The Divine Emperor of Sairong
has already sent Luo Si to Yuanzhou.

366
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,480
Perhaps it's to punish you.

367
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,480
I've never won against you, not even once.

368
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,450
How can I even face the North Clan again?

369
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Even the best generals
can't win every single battle.

370
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,940
Actually, you're quite good
at commanding troops

371
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,250
and have an indomitable spirit.

372
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,370
Giving up now

373
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,000
is really a shame.

374
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,590
You could have become

375
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,070
a renowned general.

376
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,350
Why perish here?

377
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,400
Now,

378
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,920
I actually have a choice for you.

379
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,120
Do you want to hear it?

380
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,720
What choice?

381
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,880
Join the Yuanzhou Alliance Army.

382
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,070
How could I be like Lei Hong?

383
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,030
Lei Hong is a coward.
How can you compare yourself to him?

384
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,030
I'm not even as good as him.

385
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,360
He's just barely scraping by.
Can you really compare to him?

386
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,380
I disdain to be associated
with such people.

387
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,700
Exactly.

388
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,970
Lei Hong joined the North Clan

389
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,780
for his own survival.

390
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,680
But you?

391
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,320
You're doing it to save countless lives.

392
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,110
It's not the same.

393
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,510
Me?

394
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,450
That's right.

395
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,290
Think about it.
Yuanzhou has been at war for years.

396
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,630
If this continues,

397
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,660
you still can't defeat me,

398
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,590
but the flames of war

399
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,050
will continue endlessly.

400
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,240
In the long run, Yuanzhou's cities

401
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,160
may not be lost,

402
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,220
but what about you?

403
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,200
You could run out of supplies

404
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,830
and end up with nowhere to go.

405
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,020
Think about it.

406
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,810
Isn't it not worth it?

407
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,170
If you join the Yuanzhou Alliance Army,

408
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,830
not only will you have a place to stay,

409
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,810
but you can also settle your men.

410
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,590
From now on, we can
protect Yuanzhou together.

411
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,920
Isn't this similar to

412
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,340
what you thought before?

413
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,050
Can the various races in Yuanzhou
accept me?

414
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,110
To be honest,

415
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,240
you've always been a sparring partner
for the Alliance Army.

416
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,000
I personally admire you.

417
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,890
You're humiliating me again.

418
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:19,530
I'm not.

419
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,270
You are.

420
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,110
I said I'm not.

421
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,920
You definitely are.

422
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,670
I said—

423
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:27,310
When I say I'm not, I'm not.

424
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,960
You're a grown man.

425
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,790
Can't you be less sensitive?

426
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,790
The Yuanzhou Alliance Army

427
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,390
is indeed not a regular army.

428
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,740
Your tactics and strategies

429
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,410
are indeed slightly inferior to mine.

430
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,590
But you're brave in commanding troops
and rigorous in your fighting style.

431
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,320
You're a formidable opponent.

432
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,250
The Yuanzhou Alliance Army

433
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,400
has always been united.

434
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:57,590
So... as long as our goals align,

435
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,240
we can work together.

436
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,920
Do you understand my good intentions?

437
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,810
Why are you pointing at me?

438
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,410
Why am I pointing at you?

439
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,590
Why would I point at you?

440
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,160
If I weren't in urgent need
of people, I...

441
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,880
You can leave if you want.

442
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,110
I won't stop you. Come back.

443
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,790
Lu Di,

444
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,890
I know how important your pride is to you.

445
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,130
Here's the deal.
Two flags are placed before you.

446
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,640
One is the flag of the North Clan,

447
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,220
and the other is the flag
of the King of Light.

448
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,650
Whichever side you choose to stand with,

449
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,560
keep that flag.

450
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,790
Stay in the military camp
during this time.

451
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,480
You can move freely within the camp.

452
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,230
I'm not afraid of you running away.

453
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,030
Take this opportunity
to think it over carefully.

454
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,400
My Lord, according to
confidential reports from the front line,

455
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,720
the King of Light has already reclaimed

456
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,510
the 23 districts of Yuanzhou

457
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,800
in less than a year.

458
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,070
Moreover, I've heard that
the King of Light

459
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,830
is not only unparalleled in battle

460
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,830
but also quite capable of governing.

461
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,070
He has even managed to unify the currency

462
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,870
of all 23 districts in Yuanzhou.

463
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,790
This matter is of great importance.

464
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,750
Everyone, what are your thoughts
on this matter?

465
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,310
I believe that given
the King of Light's current momentum,

466
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,170
we must never make an enemy of him.

467
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,420
It would be wise to send envoys

468
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,270
to show the Zichuan family's intent
to make peace.

469
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,550
This would allow him to garrison Yuanzhou
and defend against the North Clan.

470
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,950
The situation is urgent.

471
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,160
We must act before the other clans do.

472
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,440
So, everyone, who do you think
is best suited to go?

473
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,550
My Lord, I suggest sending Si Yilin.

474
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,730
He has been to battle twice

475
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,790
and is quite familiar with Yuanzhou.

476
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,930
Si Yilin's noble status

477
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,020
shows how seriously
we Zichuan take this matter.

478
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,980
Si Yilin, make preparations to set out

479
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,320
for Yuanzhou at once.

480
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,240
Yes, My Lord.

481
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,960
Big Brother,

482
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,350
why recommend me

483
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,340
when so many people
are familiar with Yuanzhou?

484
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,880
Take this.

485
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,440
Wound healing medicine?
I'm not going to war.

486
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,000
Do I need...

487
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,960
Just take it.

488
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,720
You might need it.

489
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,680
There are 23 districts in Yuanzhou.

490
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,270
With these 23 districts,

491
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,920
our clan is just one step away

492
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,350
from breaching the Zichuan heartland,

493
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:24,400
claiming Liufeng, subduing the Lin family,

494
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,100
and dominating
the entire Xichuan Continent.

495
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,430
For these 23 districts,

496
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,240
I've schemed for half my life.

497
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,790
Ka Dan was trapped in Zichuan.

498
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,790
Too many of our warriors

499
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,750
have fallen.

500
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,550
And yet, in less than a year, Lu Di

501
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,750
handed Yuanzhou over without a fight!

502
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,590
Your Majesty,

503
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,890
Prince Ka Dun is still kneeling
in the hall, begging for forgiveness.

504
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,370
Looks like he's about to faint.

505
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,830
Send him back.

506
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,970
Let him reflect on
his actions in seclusion.

507
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:11,960
From now on, he is not allowed
to enter the palace unless summoned.

508
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

509
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,020
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

510
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,640
I'll take care of Yuanzhou.

511
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,670
With the rise of the King of Light
in Yuanzhou,

512
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,670
the situation in the North Clan
has taken a sharp turn.

513
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,130
It's not just the North Clan.

514
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,490
Yuanzhou's rapid unification now

515
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,030
poses a real challenge

516
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,090
to the Zichuan and Liufeng families.

517
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:37,330
The whole Xichuan Continent
is seeing a shift in power.

518
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,030
Ka Dan, you're overthinking it.

519
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,590
Zichuan is nothing
but a bunch of defeated soldiers.

520
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,030
Lord Yun, Second Brother,

521
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,880
you don't realize
how powerful the Zichuan family really is.

522
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,590
In the last battle at Yuanzhou,

523
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,680
they did suffer heavy losses.

524
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,200
But on their western border,

525
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,610
the frontline forces

526
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,810
still number nearly 100 regiments.

527
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,640
I've also observed some of

528
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,150
the Zichuan family's top generals.

529
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,260
To be frank,

530
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,770
compared to ours,

531
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,680
they understand better what war is

532
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,080
and what strategy means.

533
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,880
On this point, I agree with the Princess.

534
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:14,830
Also,

535
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,550
the Zichuan family has a strong ability
to mobilize strategic resources.

536
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,680
But the Liufeng family in the west
is still keeping them in check.

537
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,010
Liufeng Xishan's life is coming to an end.

538
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,270
Once he dies, there will surely
be internal strife in the Liufeng family.

539
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,400
When that happens,

540
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,790
with no more threats from the west,

541
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,400
the Zichuan family will surely
rise to power once again.

542
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,440
At that point,

543
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,080
the Zichuan family
will be our real threat.

544
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,300
In the current battle of Yuanzhou,

545
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,010
there are also traces
of the Zichuan family's involvement.

546
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,679
The more skilled people are,
the more impolite they become.

547
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,679
Is knocking just not a thing for you?

548
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,290
Do you think you can protect him?

549
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,000
Wasn't I your target?

550
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,270
Changing targets midway

551
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,920
is an insult to your opponent.

552
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,400
You!

553
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,880
It's you.

554
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,280
You're not going to kill me?

555
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,110
It seems you know nothing
about your own bloodline.

556
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,440
I don't have to kill you.

557
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
One day,

558
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,360
the Sacred Land will give you the answer.

559
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,410
Are you alright?

560
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,070
Your eyes turned red just now.

561
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,920
His eyes turned red just now.

562
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,120
You must be mistaken.

563
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,010
Come back here.

564
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,580
Don't you know your own eyes can turn red?

565
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,720
Do you expect me to look in a mirror
while fighting?

566
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,400
Zichuan Xiu, who on earth are you?

567
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,230
I am the King of Light.

568
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,920
You're definitely more than
just the King of Light.

569
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,320
Does it matter who I am?

570
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,750
Doesn't it matter?

571
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,070
Does it matter?

572
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,930
You managed to survive
Black Veil's attack.

573
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:01,600
And you transform
during fights just like him.

574
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,350
None of that matters.

575
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,800
Where is the Sacred Land
he mentioned earlier?

576
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,880
The Sacred Land,
also called the Holy Ground,

577
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,870
is the most mysterious place
in the entire North Clan.

578
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,470
Just as the Counsellor said,

579
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,600
you have a connection to the Sacred Land.

580
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,300
No wonder.

581
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,350
I finally don't feel ashamed about
losing to you anymore.

582
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:28,710
What do you mean?

583
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,030
Go treat your wounds.

584
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,200
I'm fine.

585
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,790
Transform for me again.

586
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:35,710
Like that...

587
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,440
Transform my foot! Let's go.

588
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,450
Recently,

589
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,700
Master's pulse has stabilized.

590
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,980
Thanks to the medicine
Your Highness brought back.

591
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,490
As long as he takes good care of himself,

592
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,080
I'm sure the Master will recover soon.

593
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,430
Glad to hear that.

594
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,050
It's great that the medicine
I brought back is working.

595
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,120
But, Father...

596
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,140
Zichuan must have already learned

597
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,740
about your serious illness.

598
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,680
I need to go and guard Lan City.

599
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,230
Now that your health
has improved significantly,

600
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,750
I must depart immediately.

601
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,660
Shuang, I'm sorry for the hardship
you must endure.

602
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,630
I've heard that Yuanzhou
now has a King of Light.

603
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,520
In just one year,

604
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,070
he has led Yuanzhou to rise.

605
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,500
His strength is not to be underestimated.

606
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,170
The Xichuan Continent
is not what it used to be.

607
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,720
Canxing is incompetent.

608
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,590
Though he seized power from Yang Minghua,

609
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,960
he lacks the ability
to make Zichuan powerful again.

610
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,190
Zichuan controls the largest territory

611
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,040
and the richest resources.

612
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,940
Yet his clan can only watch
as their century-old legacy

613
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,770
gradually

614
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,530
slips away from their noble name.

615
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,760
Now, the key question is

616
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
who will ultimately seize Zichuan.

617
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,690
Is there no hope
for Zichuan to rise again?

618
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,910
Absolutely impossible.

619
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,340
The power of the Divine Emperor of Sairong

620
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,200
surpasses all our expectations.

621
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,870
It is a pity that among
the next generation of Sairong heirs,

622
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,960
none carry the true presence of a ruler.

623
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,030
The Lin family has always
kept to themselves

624
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,690
and won't interfere in
continental conquests.

625
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,480
Moreover, we've been on good terms
with the Lin family for generations.

626
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,760
So, Shuang,

627
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,820
the rise and future
of the Xichuan Continent

628
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,920
lies with you and the King of Light.

629
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,660
Including yesterday,

630
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,420
you've saved me several times.

631
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,560
I've made up my mind.

632
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,850
I accept your offer.

633
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,230
I, Lu Di, pledged my loyalty to you,
the King of Light,

634
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:01,360
swearing to follow you
and defend Yuanzhou with my life.

635
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,070
Good, very good.

636
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:15,070
These are letters written to you
by representatives of various races.

637
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,920
So many?

638
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,930
This letter is from
the Snake Race delegation.

639
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,730
If we recruit Lu Di,

640
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,660
they'll withdraw their beauty envoys.

641
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,000
What?

642
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,560
If we recruit Lu Di,

643
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,420
they'll just pull their troops back
and go mining.

644
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,850
This is from the Dragon Race delegation.

645
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,000
My Lord, recruiting him

646
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,090
would only ignite anger
throughout Yuanzhou.

647
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,690
It's not worth it,
and it's not like your style.

648
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,900
Actually, whether it's the Zichuan family,

649
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,610
the Snake Race, the Dragon Race,
or even the North Clan,

650
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,570
why can't we set aside our prejudices

651
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,540
and live in harmony?

652
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,760
Besides, there's something more urgent

653
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,040
on my mind right now.

654
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,400
Luo Si of the Data Tribe
is leading a large army this way.

655
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,030
You're thinking about how to deal with it?

656
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,840
Yes.

657
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,330
Recapturing Payi City is our top priority.

658
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,450
I know Payi City well.

659
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,320
It's easy to defend
but difficult to attack.

660
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,970
Once Luo Si occupies it

661
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,930
as a stronghold,

662
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,190
it will be our greatest disaster.
