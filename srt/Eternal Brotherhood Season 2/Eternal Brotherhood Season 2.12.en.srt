[Eternal Brotherhood 2]

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,729
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,280
Elder Budan.

4
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,970
I didn't help win this war
for all of us...

5
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,810
just to become some so-called
King of Light.

6
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,880
Sir,

7
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,560
you saved the sacred temple

8
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,640
at its most critical moment.

9
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,350
On behalf of all the people of Yuanzhou,

10
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,360
I offer you our deepest gratitude.

11
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,370
If you have any needs in the future,

12
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,560
all of us in Yuanzhou

13
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,740
will go through fire and water

14
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,400
to repay your great kindness.

15
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,329
Elder, you give me too much credit.

16
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,510
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,250
Resisting the North Clan's invasion

18
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,050
was our duty from the beginning.

19
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,370
Now that the North Clan has retreated,

20
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,760
they have also witnessed

21
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,410
the strength of our people in Yuanzhou.

22
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,090
So they won't invade

23
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,240
the sacred temple again anytime soon.

24
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
I'll be going now.

25
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,000
Everything has just begun.

26
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,560
As you said,

27
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:50,120
we have armies, weapons,

28
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,090
and the support of the people.

29
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,910
What we lack is a commander.

30
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,160
Like what we witnessed today...

31
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,430
a commander like you.

32
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,670
But you are the leader of
the Yuanzhou people.

33
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,600
They respect and believe in you.

34
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,490
You can be their commander.

35
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,400
I'm old.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,680
My body can't lead them into battle,

37
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,470
nor can I lead them

38
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,590
to resist the brutal North Clan.

39
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,400
Then you can find a suitable officer

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,120
from among the Yuanzhou forces.

41
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,000
We don't lack heroes who can slay enemies

42
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,470
or brave generals who can
lead charges into battle.

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
What we lack

44
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,760
is a brave and decisive commander

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,600
who has received formal military training

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,840
and can calmly assess the situation
with a strong will.

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,870
Lord Zichuan Xiu,

48
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,190
I hope you will help us.

49
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,950
I will gather all the Yuanzhou soldiers

50
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,910
and unite them into an allied force

51
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,350
under your full command.

52
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,640
You'll lead Yuanzhou in resisting
the North Clan together.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,280
Freedom has long been out of reach

54
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,829
for the people of Yuanzhou.

55
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,670
The sacred temple's divine prophecy

56
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,100
foretold that after years of suffering,

57
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,780
a King of Light would appear

58
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,880
to dispel the darkness for us.

59
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,470
That day, when I was desperately pleading

60
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,850
with the spirits of fallen heroes
in the sacred temple,

61
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,450
you walked through the door.

62
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,720
You are the prophesied King of Light.

63
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,470
Only you can lead Yuanzhou
to reclaim freedom.

64
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,480
Elder, I'm very grateful for your trust.

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,240
But I'm not from Yuanzhou.

66
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,500
It wouldn't be appropriate for me
to command the Alliance Army.

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,030
Moreover, I'm wanted by the North Clan.

68
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,240
They're dead set on killing me.

69
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,630
Once they learn I've become
your commander,

70
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,560
they'll stop at nothing to kill me.

71
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,650
By then,

72
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,060
that would actually harm
the Yuanzhou people.

73
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,740
I've already considered all of
these things you mentioned.

74
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,790
Your authority has my full support.

75
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,240
No one will dare to question it.

76
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,390
I will bestow upon you the sacred relics
long preserved in the temple.

77
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,590
They will resolve your doubts.

78
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,380
We will spare no effort...

79
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,420
to help you become the ruler of Yuanzhou.

80
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,659
Let me take a look!

81
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,280
Don't push!

82
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,610
-Calm down!
-Let me see!

83
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,650
Don't push!

84
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,030
What is this thing?

85
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,490
My Lord, well...

86
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,800
My Lord, you're going to become
the King of Light

87
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,730
just for this box of sacred relics?

88
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,920
Nonsense.

89
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,120
I'm doing this to protect the peace of
the people of Yuanzhou.

90
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,870
Once they're strong enough
to defend themselves,

91
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,870
I will step down from this position.

92
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,710
As for this gift,

93
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,340
now that I've accepted it...

94
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,890
it wouldn't be proper to return it.

95
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,280
This box must be full of treasures.

96
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,640
You're all so vulgar.

97
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,570
They're the sacred relics given to
our Chief by Elder Budan.

98
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,720
The symbol of the King of Light.

99
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,530
Move aside.

100
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,030
Look at this box.

101
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,190
Chief, how about you keep what's inside,

102
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,800
and I take the box?

103
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,070
Shame on you.

104
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,840
Have I ever mistreated you before?

105
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,060
Look at you all,

106
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,920
acting like you've never seen
something fancy.

107
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,250
Isn't it just an old box?

108
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,270
Exactly.

109
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,430
With our Lord Xiu's grace and character,

110
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,190
how could he be interested
in this old box?

111
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,720
Come on, take it away!

112
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,430
Let go! Let go!

113
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,750
This was given to me by Elder Budan.

114
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,360
How could I disrespect him?

115
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,750
Guys! Guys!

116
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,120
Chief!

117
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,470
Just open it, and let us have a look!

118
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,690
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

119
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,750
Just a peek.

120
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,470
Watch carefully.

121
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,430
What...

122
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,200
Isn't this...

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,640
What...

124
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,510
What is this?

125
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,720
It's all for show.

126
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,520
And they called them sacred relics?

127
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,800
That elder's so stingy.

128
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,930
He just gave us junk?

129
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,470
It's too late for regrets now.

130
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,590
Lord Xiu is doing this for

131
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,510
the stability of the people of Yuanzhou!

132
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,720
Dressing a bit shabbily

133
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,430
can perfectly demonstrate Lord Xiu's...
noble character!

134
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,490
-That makes sense!
-That makes sense!

135
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,830
The repairs at Wayun are progressing
steadily.

136
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,320
Princess Ning is full of drive this time.

137
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,669
Wayun Fortress

138
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,909
has always been weighing on my mind.

139
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,840
I've heard that young Ma Wei has
contributed a lot.

140
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,600
Yes.

141
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,590
The advisors were originally taking
a wait-and-see attitude.

142
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,770
Advisor He was the first to speak
disrespectfully.

143
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,890
This is the first time Princess Ning

144
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,250
has faced such malicious insults,

145
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,140
yet she managed to restrain herself.

146
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,910
This is truly commendable.

147
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,270
Only the incompetent are quick to anger.

148
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,970
Enduring insults to achieve goals first,

149
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,940
and then gradually trimming away
obstacles.

150
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,000
That is the way of a ruler.

151
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,680
Ning has really changed this time?

152
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,530
Each of those advisors

153
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,210
is more cunning than the others.

154
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,190
Should we

155
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,050
have the Ministry of War step in
and give them a little "reminder"?

156
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:20,730
That might help

157
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,560
Princess Ning gather funds more smoothly.

158
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,020
This pine tree

159
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,600
is neatly trimmed, looking all beautiful,

160
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,480
but don't you think it looks a bit rigid?

161
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,200
Too much trimming isn't good.

162
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,230
Yes.

163
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,330
How did Ning deal with that Advisor He?

164
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Princess Ning only arrested a few
servants from his household

165
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,260
on charges of injuring attendants
from her residence.

166
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,190
However, according to the repair
blueprints,

167
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,450
the damaged east wall

168
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,810
must be extended several li farther east.

169
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,000
The land that needs to be requisitioned

170
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
happens to be Advisor He's family's
forestry estate.

171
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,880
According to our laws, when land is
needed for national use,

172
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,480
merchant-owned land and properties

173
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,840
can be acquired at the minimum
legal price.

174
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,720
So, no matter how unwilling Advisor He is,

175
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,580
he must swallow this bitter pill.

176
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,640
Over the past few years,

177
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,080
his family has expanded their influence
dramatically.

178
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,120
They have oppressed the common people
countless times.

179
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,510
This is a perfect opportunity
to rein them in.

180
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,960
I'm just worried that Advisor He might
spread rumors,

181
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,520
and Princess Ning will suffer grievances.

182
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,600
She will be the future ruler of Zichuan.

183
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,920
She must endure all the world's
grievances with a smile.

184
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,790
Having that Advisor He around

185
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,520
might actually be a good thing.

186
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,840
Because the Three Central Offices

187
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,970
will inevitably split into factions.

188
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,120
When the time comes,

189
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,240
it will be crystal clear

190
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,640
who disrespects the clan...

191
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,250
and harbors rebellious thoughts.

192
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,850
That girl is really something.

193
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,240
What's even more infuriating

194
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,070
is that she even invited me
to some banquet.

195
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,840
Is she trying to deplete
my entire fortune?

196
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,230
Princess Ning still considers
your reputation.

197
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,610
After you spoke so disrespectfully,

198
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,970
didn't she refrain from directly
punishing you?

199
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,900
What? She even wants to arrest
and behead me?

200
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,440
Let her come!

201
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,840
Her father, her uncle—

202
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,840
which of them doesn't treat my family
with great respect?

203
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,170
She hasn't even become the Chieftain yet.

204
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:36,830
Fellow advisors,

205
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,430
[Wang Ge, Member of Three Central Offices]

206
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,770
now she's requisitioning land from me.

207
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,350
Don't you think she might

208
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,080
arbitrarily seize your family's assets
as well?

209
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,840
Many of you originally had

210
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,770
fiefs and properties in Yuanzhou.

211
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,770
But after the peace talks, they were
all lost to the North Clan.

212
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,690
The losses were indeed severe.

213
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
And the clan?

214
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,200
They didn't give you so much as a coin
in compensation.

215
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,410
Now,

216
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,540
for that city wall,

217
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,000
they stretch out their hands
for more money.

218
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,210
What?

219
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,240
Do they take us as the clan's bank?

220
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:22,310
Advisor Wang Ge, what do you say?

221
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,130
What is there for me to say?

222
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,210
All land under heaven belongs to
the sovereign.

223
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,320
The clan has always had the right to
requisition land for military purposes.

224
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,670
Moreover, this banquet

225
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,400
is entirely voluntary for
all of us advisors.

226
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,520
Whether it's a boon or a trap
remains to be seen.

227
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,390
Lord Wang Ge,

228
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
your holdings are located
near the Imperial Capital.

229
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,890
If land requisition really happens
in the future,

230
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,400
it won't affect you.

231
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,240
I heard that right after Advisor Ma

232
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,040
sent porcelain to the Princess,

233
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,750
you also eagerly

234
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,550
sent over quite a few valuables.

235
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,840
You'd better be careful.

236
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,520
Don't be an old fox all your life

237
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,030
only to be outsmarted by a little brat.

238
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:10,840
You...

239
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,760
Advisors, please calm down.

240
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,590
Have some tea to calm your mind.

241
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,020
What we donate to this banquet

242
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,750
is secondary.

243
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,330
More importantly,

244
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,120
Princess Ning will also donate many of
the clan's treasures.

245
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,380
She has even prepared an honorary medal

246
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,950
issued in the clan's name

247
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,740
as a reward.

248
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,720
To put it bluntly,

249
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,150
this is just another way

250
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,910
to empty our pockets.

251
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,830
All these years,

252
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,510
the clan has been secretly suppressing

253
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,030
the rights and interests of
the Three Central Offices.

254
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,390
If we have that medal to rely on,

255
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,320
things will become far easier

256
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,270
when handling matters
in various districts.

257
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,910
It'll also be quite a good stimulus
for civilian businesses.

258
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,510
The Lord Chieftain is advanced in age.

259
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,300
Since he has now pushed Princess Ning
to the forefront,

260
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,430
it shows his intention to support her.

261
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Princess Ning will only have more power
in the future.

262
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,490
If we give her some face now,

263
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,670
there will surely be a time
when she returns the favor.

264
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,910
If we truly don't give an inch,

265
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,270
I'm afraid she might take things
to the extreme.

266
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,200
If it really blows up,

267
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,750
advisors, how do you think

268
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,480
the Lord Chieftain will address it?

269
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,560
Ma Wei.

270
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,000
You've only been in the Three Central Offices
for a few years,

271
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,460
and yet you dare disturb the situation

272
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,270
and bewitch people here!

273
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,480
I wouldn't dare.

274
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,750
As fellow members of
the Three Central Offices,

275
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,910
how could I not know

276
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,790
the principle that we rise
and fall together?

277
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,000
It's just that sometimes, standing firm
on every inch

278
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,240
won't protect one's own interests.

279
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,360
Now, I see it clearly.

280
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,630
Now you just want to use

281
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,420
that young girl's status

282
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,150
to rise to power!

283
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,010
Listen up, you're too green!

284
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,630
I don't care how you use Zichuan Ning,

285
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,910
but if your schemes involve me...

286
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,040
you're making a big mistake!

287
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:35,970
Advisor He.

288
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,210
Advisor Ma.

289
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,970
Do you truly mean what you've said?

290
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,920
I am junior to all of you.

291
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,110
And I've always held you all
in high regard.

292
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,040
How could I dare to tell you if what I
knew wasn't true?

293
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,080
With my humble status
and shallow experience,

294
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,920
how could I have the ability
to stir up trouble?

295
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,250
I'm merely a messenger for Princess Ning.

296
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,150
And Her Highness's intentions

297
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,470
are the Lord Chieftain's intentions.

298
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,080
As we all know,

299
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,700
Chief Advisor Xiao is getting old

300
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,950
and gradually withdrawing from
official duties.

301
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,900
Electing a new Chief Advisor
will surely be

302
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,960
a matter for the next couple of years.

303
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,350
Advisor Ma, could you give me
the inside scoop?

304
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,670
To get that medal,

305
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,430
how much money and how many treasures
must I prepare,

306
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,090
and how many items should I
bid on successfully?

307
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,750
All the advisors are donating money
and goods.

308
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
How could I possibly accept gifts now?

309
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,890
You've donated quite a bit before.

310
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,760
Princess Ning is grateful

311
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,900
and remembers your kindness.

312
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,300
Her Highness is truly generous.

313
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,130
What does Her Highness need me to do?
Please speak frankly.

314
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,460
This charity banquet tonight operates
on a bidding system.

315
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,960
To complete the repairs of Wayun Fortress,

316
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,089
there's still a shortfall of at least
50,000 gold coins.

317
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,770
Princess Ning doesn't want the event
to be cold and awkward.

318
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,510
Do you understand, Advisor?

319
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,710
I'm afraid no one will bid against me,

320
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,990
and I'll be the one embarrassed instead.

321
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,480
Someone is already determined to
get that medal.

322
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,680
Even if things go wrong,

323
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,990
I certainly won't let you foot the bill.

324
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,720
In that case, since Her Highness
trusts me,

325
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,970
I'll... cooperate fully.

326
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,730
Advisor Wang Ge, you're the first
to generously offer help.

327
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,930
Both Her Highness and I
are deeply grateful.

328
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,400
For the wall repairs later, the demand

329
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,440
for lumber and stone will be substantial.

330
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,700
I'll recommend you and my family
to the higher-ups

331
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,240
to jointly supply the materials

332
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,230
to repay your assistance today.

333
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,430
Advisor Ma, there's no need to be
so courteous.

334
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,630
You're the youngest advisor,

335
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,030
and now you have Princess Ning's trust.

336
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,920
Her Highness will inherit the throne
sooner or later.

337
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,680
I can see where the greatest benefits

338
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,200
lie.

339
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,350
It's just that Advisor He is so stubborn,
I'm afraid...

340
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,080
Please rest assured, Advisor.

341
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,480
What you fear

342
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,480
is also what Her Highness is
concerned about.

343
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,350
I won't let such things happen.

344
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,620
General Si Yilin is also attending
the banquet?

345
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,240
This is Advisor Wang Ge.

346
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,890
Greetings, Your Highness.

347
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,820
Advisor Wang Ge.

348
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,670
This is Advisor Fang.

349
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,970
-Greetings, Your Highness.
-Advisor Fang.

350
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,950
And this is Advisor Liu.

351
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,210
Greetings, Your Highness.

352
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,740
Advisor Ma.

353
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,000
Di Lin.

354
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,350
Princess Ning was worried about
a poor turnout

355
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,400
and called us over to liven things up.

356
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,600
It seems her worries were unnecessary.

357
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,730
You, who lead troops at a loss,

358
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,270
give all your salary to your subordinates.

359
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,880
What did you donate this time?

360
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,890
Something about horses.

361
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,750
Horse phallus?

362
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,110
What are you thinking?
It's made of leather.

363
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,790
Is it edible?

364
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,870
It's for use, not for eating.

365
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,480
That whip I got when I won
the equestrian competition

366
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,000
at the military academy in Yuanzhou.

367
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,930
The one that Lord Yuanxing gave me.

368
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,850
A riding crop?

369
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,530
You're being too generous.

370
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,340
Donating such a meaningful item
just like that.

371
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,550
But look at this crowd.

372
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,790
They might not appreciate its true value.

373
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,830
On my way here,

374
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,440
I saw the carriages transporting
these items.

375
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,490
I was thinking,

376
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,040
Ma Wei is really something.

377
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,200
He managed to gather all these people here

378
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,460
and got them willing to buy these things.

379
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,000
For these advisors, these items

380
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,360
are merely playthings.

381
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,680
Although General Si Yilin's whip
may not be worth much money,

382
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,340
it holds great significance.

383
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,900
In terms of sincerity,

384
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,870
no one is more generous than you,
General Si Yilin.

385
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,770
However, Ma Wei is no simple man.

386
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,690
If wealth is the arrow

387
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,270
and power is the bow,

388
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,860
then in the past, Ma Wei had arrows
but no bow.

389
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,680
But now, look at him.

390
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,560
He has an arrow nocked and ready.

391
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,830
Thank you, Advisor Liu,

392
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,540
for successfully bidding 5,000 gold coins

393
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,740
to acquire Lord Di Lin's donated sword.

394
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,200
Advisor Liu, you've bid generously
multiple times tonight.

395
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,070
The clan will surely remember
your contributions.

396
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,830
Thank you, Your Highness.

397
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,000
These people

398
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
aren't really here to buy things,

399
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,400
nor are they truly donating
out of goodwill.

400
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,460
What they're after

401
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,440
is nothing but the honorary medal
to be awarded later.

402
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,640
That's why they're trying so hard
to please Princess Ning.

403
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,440
That's right.

404
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,880
Those medals may be useless to
us onlookers,

405
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,750
indeed.

406
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,080
But for them, they're symbols of status.

407
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,350
Advisor Liu has not only demonstrated

408
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,340
his wisdom and talent in various matters,

409
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,160
but he has also greatly assisted
with tonight's repair efforts.

410
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,590
I hereby award this honorary medal
to Advisor Liu.

411
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,390
I hope Advisor Liu will continue to
serve the clan.

412
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,790
Thank you, Your Highness.

413
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,000
Furthermore, I hope everyone can

414
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,240
recommend someone to be in charge

415
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,350
of using the donated funds

416
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,000
for the various matters of repairing
Wayun Fortress.

417
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,960
We believe

418
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,400
Advisor Ma is young and capable,
with meticulous thinking,

419
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,720
and has put much thought
into the repair matters.

420
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,510
Why not let him take full responsibility?

421
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,750
Lord Wang Ge speaks truly.

422
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,680
Advisor Ma Wei.

423
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,740
Are you willing to oversee the overhaul?

424
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,820
What Your Highness entrusts me,

425
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,220
I'll certainly do my utmost to accomplish.

426
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:57,990
Cheers.

427
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,530
Cheers.

428
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,880
The funds that Your Highness has raised
this time

429
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,920
are enough to give the clan

430
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,790
an impregnable Wayun city wall.

431
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,820
Your Highness trusts me so much

432
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,220
to entrust me with overseeing the repairs.

433
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,880
I will see it through
with full dedication.

434
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,070
Thanks to your candid advice earlier,

435
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,400
this thing can be achieved successfully.

436
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,070
It's just that today, these advisors

437
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,990
were so enthusiastic in their bidding.

438
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,320
I wonder how you managed to persuade them.

439
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,100
It's the nature of merchants.

440
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,230
Once the opponent is interested,

441
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,520
they would definitely compete
by raising their bids.

442
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,790
I gave a South Sea pearl
the size of a fist

443
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,690
to Advisor Wang Ge,

444
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,650
asking him to be sure to bid.

445
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,160
The South Sea pearl is worth a fortune.

446
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,830
How could I ever

447
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,050
repay such a favor?

448
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,070
Things that can be bought with money
are ultimately just worldly possessions.

449
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,600
There's nothing to regret.

450
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,910
If Your Highness doesn't want to
owe me anything,

451
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,700
the moon is bright and clear tonight,

452
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,560
so may I invite Your Highness to
enjoy the moon and have a drink with me?

453
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,610
Tonight...

454
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,450
Your Highness.

455
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,570
I need to speak with you.

456
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Your Highness...

457
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,640
Lord Di Lin, did you enjoy
yourself tonight?

458
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
I had a great time.

459
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,920
I met so many wealthy people
from the Imperial Capital

460
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,070
and also witnessed

461
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,590
your Three Central Offices'
butterfly-like social skills.

462
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,310
I really liked that sword

463
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,510
you donated earlier.

464
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,820
If Advisor Liu hadn't told me beforehand

465
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,880
not to bid against you,

466
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,340
I'd have offered an even higher price
for it.

467
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,070
This one is even better. Do you want it?

468
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,480
If Lord Di Lin is willing to part with it,

469
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,700
I'm willing to pay 8,000 gold coins.
However...

470
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,390
Deal.

471
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,940
I forgot to tell you

472
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,350
that this knife was personally forged

473
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,790
by Yang Minghua for me.

474
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,160
But it's okay.

475
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,510
It's just a knife.

476
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,290
I don't mind parting with it.

477
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,920
I hope you like it.

478
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,810
8,000 gold coins.

479
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,370
Aren't you two going a bit too far?

480
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,920
It feels good, though.

481
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,640
Fortunately, your impulsive actions

482
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,180
didn't affect Princess Ning's
charity event.

483
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,200
Otherwise, I wouldn't have allowed it.

484
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,590
Her Highness's charity banquet

485
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,790
was truly brilliant.

486
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,580
Not only did it make
the Three Central Offices bleed,

487
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,310
but it also left them unable to
cry out in pain.

488
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,680
Right now, the happiest man must be
Ma Wei.

489
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,350
This move of his was truly clever.

490
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,790
Not only can he profit from it,

491
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,310
but he can also gain private benefits
for his family.

492
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,370
More importantly,

493
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,090
he has managed to tug at Her Highness's
heartstrings.

494
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,920
But winning Her Highness's heart

495
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,520
won't satisfy his ambition.

496
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,880
We all know that Princess Ning

497
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,540
is the future heir to the clan.

498
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,440
Ma Wei's actions are aimed at future
power struggles,

499
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,500
laying the groundwork for his plans.

500
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,730
Where is Princess Ning?

501
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,530
Mr. Ma, you offered great help today

502
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,890
and worked tirelessly.

503
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,520
I've taken note of it in my heart.

504
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,420
However, aside from gratitude...

505
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,470
I cannot offer you anything more.

506
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,340
Do you understand what I mean?

507
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,590
I'm but a devoted soul speaking to
another devoted soul.

508
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,270
I've never expected anything in return.

509
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,140
I only wish to lessen Your Highness's
worries.

510
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,540
Why do people say that wine
can dispel sorrow?

511
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,690
Perhaps it's because people don't want to
forget,

512
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,540
so they rely on alcohol.

513
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,280
Advisor Ma is wrong.

514
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,330
Drinking doesn't relieve sorrow.

515
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,240
It only clouds the mind.

516
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,650
So it's best to drink in moderation.

517
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,520
Your Highness.

518
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,230
It's cold at night. Drinking is bad
for your health.

519
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,230
Let me escort you back to the palace.

520
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,180
Her Highness has been busy
for so many days.

521
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
Tonight, she's finally accomplished
her goal.

522
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,980
Lord Li Qing, why spoil the mood?

523
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,640
My duty is to protect Her Highness.

524
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,790
If Lord Ma feels that I'm
spoiling the mood,

525
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,450
I ask for your understanding.

526
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,810
Your Highness.

527
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,920
Advisor Ma and Princess Ning
are drinking here.

528
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,520
What is there to worry about?

529
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,750
Lord Li, you really don't know
how to enjoy life.

530
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,390
No wonder your engagement fell through.

531
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,000
Love and mutual affection

532
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,310
make a happy marriage.

533
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,070
Madam Qing has simply

534
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,700
not found her destined match yet.

535
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,900
How can there be talk that her engagement
"fell through"?

536
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,110
Your Highness is not yet engaged,

537
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,440
so I assume you don't care about
such matters.

538
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,590
Breaking off an engagement may seem small,
but reputation is a big deal.

539
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,550
The adopted daughter of the esteemed
Lord Chieftain

540
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,720
has been reduced to an abandoned woman.

541
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,070
The Zichuan family has lost all of
its dignity.

542
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,070
It has also betrayed

543
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,100
Lord Chieftain's good intentions.

544
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:06,820
You...

545
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,290
General Li is indeed good at martial arts,

546
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,830
yet you're not romantic enough.

547
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,890
If you were to be more like Advisor Ma
and Princess Ning—

548
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,930
appreciating the moon more
and drinking more wine—

549
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,880
I think you wouldn't have
ended up like this.

550
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,980
Who's spouting nonsense here?

551
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,920
Lord Si Yilin.

552
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,880
Did I ever say that Lord Li Qing and I
broke off our engagement?

553
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,860
You didn't?

554
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,680
Listen up,

555
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,400
if I hear anyone else

556
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,860
disparaging

557
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,920
Lord Li Qing's reputation...

558
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,030
don't blame me for being merciless.

559
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,510
Your Highness,

560
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,350
Lord Li Qing and I will escort you back
to your residence together.

561
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,860
Lord Si Yilin.

562
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,750
What you said earlier...

563
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,210
were they out of urgency to defend me,

564
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,060
or do you truly mean them?

565
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,440
My feelings for you

566
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,570
have never changed.

567
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,230
But I still want to know your thoughts.

568
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,910
That year, when you won
the equestrian championship,

569
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,950
I stood beside Lord Yuanxing.

570
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,440
I was mesmerized.

571
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,030
At that time, Lord Yuanxing jokingly said,

572
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,440
"He might be your future husband."

573
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,670
Before the auction tonight,

574
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,740
I secretly bought this riding crop
from Princess Ning.

575
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,920
Actually, I know

576
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,510
that our marriage

577
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,520
is what Lord Chieftain wishes for,

578
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,290
what Zichuan hopes for,

579
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,800
and even what I hope for.

580
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,270
But it's not what you hope for.

581
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,320
The Lord Chieftain has asked me
many times before

582
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,600
how I view this engagement.

583
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,490
I said if you're unwilling,

584
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,970
then I'm unwilling too.

585
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,540
You're right.

586
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,160
This is not what I hope for.

587
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,600
I hope the person I spend my life with
isn't you.

588
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,920
But it's not just this engagement.

589
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,440
Everything I have now

590
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,880
is not what I hope for.

591
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,290
Because of me, Zichuan lost Yuanzhou.

592
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,000
Because of me, so many of our men died.

593
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,600
Because of me, my beloved...

594
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,900
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said
all this to you.

595
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,960
But regardless...

596
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,680
I will marry you.

597
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,510
I'll become the person that everyone
expects me to be.

598
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,880
My Lord. My Lord.

599
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,460
Ma'am, she...

600
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,340
Xiujia.

601
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,130
As long as you're well,
nothing else matters.

602
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,530
But in the future, we...

603
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,660
In the future, we...

604
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,660
will still be us.

605
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,840
Xiujia.

606
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,430
Meeting you

607
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,230
is the luckiest thing in my life.

608
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,860
To be able to marry you

609
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,880
and spend the rest of my life with you

610
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,740
is enough for me in this lifetime.

611
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,490
Whether we have children or not,

612
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,140
I will love you for a lifetime.

613
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,150
Trust me.

614
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,320
What did you call me here for this time?

615
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,200
Do you have another treasure to give me?

616
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,510
I knew it.

617
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,960
That robe and mask you gave me last time

618
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
were just a greeting gift, right?

619
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,070
We're so close now already.

620
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,370
Are you still hiding something

621
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,460
even more amazing?

622
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,760
I heard

623
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,550
there is a secret scripture in this temple

624
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,940
that can predict the future.

625
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,770
Is that what you're giving me this time?

626
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,040
Come on, don't keep me in suspense.

627
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,540
Give it to me.

628
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,180
Take off your clothes.

629
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,090
Take off my clothes?

630
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,610
Lord Zichuan Xiu.

631
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,440
Get into the pool.

632
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,110
You even have a hobby of inviting people
to bathe?

633
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,510
There's no need to worry.

634
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,000
This is just to help heal your injuries.

635
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,930
I can tell

636
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,710
that you used to be
a skilled martial artist,

637
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,770
but now you're severely weakened.

638
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,900
Don't underestimate the sacred water
in this pool.

639
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,960
It can help you replenish your energy

640
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,710
and reignite your vitality.

641
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,330
If the water's that miraculous,

642
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,930
why don't you soak in it more often?

643
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,920
Only the prophesied king

644
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,810
is worthy of bathing in the sacred water.

645
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,600
King of Light,

646
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,600
you're not seriously thinking of

647
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,020
fighting enemies while injured, are you?

648
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,230
Elder?

649
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,180
Elder Budan?

650
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:22,450
Di Lin?

651
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,070
Yilin?

652
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,370
Stop fighting!

653
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:34,930
Yilin!

654
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,110
Di Lin.

655
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,200
Di Lin.

656
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,750
Di Lin, it's me, Xiu.

657
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,130
Di Lin, it's me, Xiu!

658
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,470
Ning?

659
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,310
Xiu.

660
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,430
Xiu! Take care of yourself.

661
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,480
The clan is counting on you.

662
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,590
Elder.

663
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:41,970
What did you see?

664
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,440
I just...

665
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,840
seemed to fall asleep.

666
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,830
I even had a dream.

667
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,560
I dreamed of my two brothers.

668
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,870
And also...

669
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,440
They looked the same as before,

670
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,770
yet somehow they seemed
completely changed.

671
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,200
Saying some strange things

672
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,000
that were just as mysterious as before.

673
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,510
What's all this?

674
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,100
You will understand eventually.

675
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:24,110
Didn't you say that the divine power
of the sacred temple

676
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,600
could foresee the future?

677
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,470
Why haven't I seen the future?

678
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,980
Will I... become rich in the future
or not?

679
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,380
You are the prophesied King of Light.

680
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,590
I'm afraid... you've already seen
the future.

681
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,240
But you can't see it clearly yet.

682
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,120
It's okay.

683
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,310
It's only a matter of time.

684
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,760
Am I...

685
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,290
am I really the King of Light?

686
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,460
You are the prophesied King of Light.

687
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,360
You will bring light to the people
of Yuanzhou.

688
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,590
You will lead them

689
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,030
to reclaim their freedom
and escape the darkness.

690
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,300
Now,

691
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,680
I have ordered all local troops
in Yuanzhou,

692
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,440
as well as the spontaneously formed
civilian garrisons,

693
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,440
to unite and form
the Yuanzhou Alliance Army.

694
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,140
They are gathering from all corners

695
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,840
of the land to the temple.

696
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,560
They are the most elite forces
in Yuanzhou.

697
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,750
You will lead them,

698
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,440
unite them,

699
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,480
and inspire them.

700
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,280
I hope you will shoulder

701
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,110
the responsibility of being
the King of Light

702
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:48,030
and lead Yuanzhou to freedom once more.

703
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,990
King of Light...

704
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,730
Dark clouds from the east
obscure the blue sky.

705
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,230
A young tiger roars along the bank
of the Gray River.

706
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,030
The king who drives away darkness.

707
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,300
Light that shines upon all under heaven.

708
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,550
Our king is about to arrive.

709
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,960
A thousand-year-old mighty tribe

710
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,230
breaks free from its shackles...

711
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:34,150
and watches as dawn's light
tears through the darkness.
