[Eternal Brotherhood 2]

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,840
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,120
This is... a map? You're going to
help me escape?

4
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,590
This is a map of the Xichuan Continent,

5
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,870
including Yuanzhou.

6
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,920
It includes three sections: economic,

7
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,150
cultural, and political.

8
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,680
These historical records document

9
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,150
the allegiances of various regions
in Yuanzhou

10
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,280
across different periods in history.

11
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,080
If Xiu is in

12
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,190
the North Clan's camp,

13
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,850
then he should be around here.

14
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
This one

15
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,190
is a collection of poems from Yuanzhou's
sacred temple.

16
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,000
Though it seems obscure at first glance,

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,870
it provides an excellent supplement

18
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,400
to Yuanzhou's history.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,660
These... are your assignments for today.

20
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,510
When did I ever agree to let you
be my teacher?

21
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,150
Tomorrow, I'll come to ask you

22
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,950
some questions about Yuanzhou.

23
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,370
We've previously introduced Yuanzhou.

24
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,370
Today, we'll be talking about

25
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,080
a special family, the Liufeng family,

26
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,880
that is both an enemy and a friend

27
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,490
to our Zichuan family.

28
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,620
The Liufeng family resides in
the northwest,

29
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,820
adjacent to Zichuan.

30
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,440
Their Baiyue Army is not
to be underestimated.

31
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,120
All of this is thanks to

32
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,180
their distinguished female general,
Liufeng Shuang.

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,510
Liufeng Shuang...

34
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,110
Let's take a break, Li Qing.

35
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,140
Let's chat for a bit.

36
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,560
Um... the one you just mentioned,

37
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,470
Liufeng Shuang. Is she pretty?

38
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,040
With such outstanding achievements,
she must be quite old, right?

39
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,550
She's the same age as you.

40
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,280
The same age?

41
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,730
There are many small clans to the west
of the Liufeng family.

42
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,130
Conflicts are constant.

43
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,710
It's also because of this

44
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,910
that the Liufeng family

45
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,400
has struggled to achieve real development
in recent years.

46
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,480
But ever since Liufeng Shuang
took charge of the border,

47
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,750
she's resolved the problems
that had plagued her family

48
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,410
for decades in just two years.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,660
She's a once-in-a-century military genius
of the Liufeng family,

50
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,720
the cream of the younger generation.

51
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,480
Liufeng Shuang... She's the same age
as me?

52
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,720
Then... do I also have a chance

53
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,630
to become someone like her?

54
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,270
Li Qing, you've come at
just the right time.

55
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,200
I have so many questions to ask you.

56
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,870
Go ahead, what questions?

57
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,430
Well, I was reading a book earlier,
and it said

58
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,870
that the North Clan and our Zichuan
have been at war for years

59
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,680
because they want to lead their people
to migrate westward

60
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,920
to get away from a place... called
the Eastern Wilderness?

61
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,200
Why do they want to get away from
the Eastern Wilderness?

62
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,160
When we mentioned the North Clan before,

63
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,490
we talked about this Eastern Wilderness.

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,720
It's a desolate land that has been frozen
for thousands of years,

65
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,390
where wild beasts frequently appear,

66
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,650
making it very unsuitable for survival.

67
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,830
The North Clan's land is adjacent to
the Eastern Wilderness,

68
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,070
so migrating westward

69
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,400
is very urgent for them.

70
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,240
Look, it's written right here.

71
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,830
Your Highness, these are
all your favorites.

72
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,390
But ever since you returned from Zichuan,

73
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,850
you haven't had any at all.

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,600
I really... don't have much of an appetite lately.

75
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,950
These are all the snacks

76
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,750
that General Yun Qianxue sent over
a couple of days ago.

77
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,830
Please, just try a little.

78
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,390
General Yun? Has he been coming by
often lately?

79
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,160
The general often sends things over

80
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,960
but never requests an audience.

81
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,120
Just tell him I've been
feeling unwell recently.

82
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,220
When I'm feeling a bit better,

83
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,750
I'll thank him properly.

84
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,880
Yes, Your Highness.

85
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,450
Take them all away.

86
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,240
Yes, right there.

87
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,430
Nice.

88
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,240
Could you press a bit harder?

89
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,070
Softer, softer.

90
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,140
Yes. That's the spot.

91
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,030
Nice.

92
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,390
Switch to the other leg.

93
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,390
Li Nong has been in there all morning,
hasn't he?

94
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,950
Hasn't even taken a break.

95
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,430
Our Chief can't see.

96
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,920
But why is he having problems
all over his body?

97
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,040
Your ointment... feels cool and soothing.

98
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,120
It's really good.

99
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,750
This is an ancestral secret formula
of our Zuoyi Clan.

100
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,480
With this ointment, you should feel
much better.

101
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,600
Really? Is My Lord going to recover fully?

102
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,410
De Lun, I won't recover that quickly,
right?

103
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,310
Indeed, it won't take effect that quickly.

104
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,190
Don't stop.

105
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,540
We still need to see how well
it works, right?

106
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,390
Nothing we can do. It's really a pity.

107
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,060
Li Nong.

108
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,890
Let's call it a day.

109
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,280
-Thank you.
-Okay.

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,600
Oh, right!

111
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,120
Remember to call Ze to attend
to me tonight.

112
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,720
See you tomorrow morning.

113
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes, My Lord.

114
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,740
My Lord, you've worked hard.

115
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,870
Not at all. Go on now.

116
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,280
Let's go.

117
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,480
De Lun, don't tell them

118
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,560
I can actually see now.

119
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,680
Why?

120
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,510
Too much pressure.

121
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,720
A chance like this doesn't come often.

122
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,120
I have to cherish it.

123
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,400
I really wish I could live like this every day.

124
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,920
Oh, right, De Lun.

125
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,030
How did that thing I asked you

126
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,000
to do last time go?

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,460
According to the key points
you wrote for me,

128
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,000
everything has been placed accurately—

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,750
both obvious and concealed.

130
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,880
You...

131
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,420
Master Zuo Jiaming?

132
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,910
Master Zuo Jiaming's martial arts manual?

133
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,390
My Lord. Did you find any manuals?

134
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,440
What manuals?

135
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,030
Master Zuo Jiaming's manuals.

136
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,560
The names are kind of weird.

137
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
I don't know if they're real or fake.

138
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,030
I think

139
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,600
we should

140
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,320
collect all of these manuals

141
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
that are disrupting morale.

142
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,270
Indeed.

143
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,380
This thing is obviously fake.

144
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,200
I think all these manuals are real.

145
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,870
Chuan, Master Zuo Jiaming

146
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,320
is a legendary figure.

147
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,100
No one's even sure he existed.

148
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,610
Of course, he existed.

149
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,240
Master Zuo Jiaming was absolutely real

150
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,210
and... incredibly mysterious.

151
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,840
Chuan, you've really met
Master Zuo Jiaming?

152
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,910
Sort of... seen him.

153
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,390
Sort of, sort of.

154
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,840
Chuan. Don't take me for
an uneducated fool.

155
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,870
Master Zuo Jiaming's martial arts

156
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,670
are ranked first in the
entire Xichuan Continent.

157
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,990
And that's how he named his manuals?

158
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,270
You don't get it.

159
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,390
Master Zuo Jiaming had a great sense
of humor,

160
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,080
so

161
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,120
his martial arts manuals reflect that.

162
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,630
In fact, he used this

163
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,510
very simple and easy-to-understand way

164
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,840
to get you interested.

165
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,660
The contents are very profound.

166
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,490
Indeed, that makes sense.

167
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,950
But it still seems fake.

168
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,340
I...

169
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,630
It's because it has been passed down
for so long

170
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,960
that it appears ancient and worn!

171
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,600
So, this is real then?

172
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,320
Who cares?

173
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,920
Practicing it won't hurt.

174
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,410
And what if it turns out to be real?

175
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,270
Exactly. Let's go.

176
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,740
I won't practice that!

177
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,260
Give it a try, eh?

178
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,710
What the hell is Zichuan Xiu up to?

179
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,390
Should we practice it or not?

180
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,080
No.

181
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,150
Who in their right mind would practice
that stuff?

182
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,120
Exactly.

183
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,060
-What a fool.
-What a fool.

184
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,300
What are you doing?

185
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,670
Eye rehabilitation.

186
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,040
De Lun taught me that.

187
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,200
What do you want?

188
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,320
Do your master's martial arts manuals
really work?

189
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,600
Of course, they do.

190
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,670
What they lack most now is
real combat experience.

191
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,510
Baichuan, don't mess with

192
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,630
the things on my desk.

193
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,900
Those are all top military intelligence!

194
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,160
This is also top military intelligence?

195
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,450
This one, I confiscated it
during the dorm inspection.

196
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,750
The content of this book

197
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,480
is downright vulgar and dirty.

198
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:05,940
It'd...

199
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,720
It'd definitely corrupt the physical
and mental health of our men.

200
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,120
I had to confiscate it.

201
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,670
How do you know which book I took?

202
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,600
You can see now?

203
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,990
How is that possible?

204
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,630
I can't see.

205
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,150
I remember there were several books
on this table.

206
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,320
Besides the military books,

207
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,520
there's one I confiscated from Luo Jie.

208
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,840
Baichuan!

209
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,030
You should go back quickly.

210
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,490
Well...

211
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,220
I'm feeling a bit unwell.

212
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,960
You're not feeling well?

213
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,140
Lord Xiu, let me help you go lie down
for a bit.

214
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,100
Lie down?

215
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,570
-Come on.
-Lying down is good.

216
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,610
Come on.

217
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,390
Sit.

218
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,000
Your room doesn't have any ventilation
at the front or back.

219
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,030
Don't you find it stuffy?

220
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,600
Stuffy?

221
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,590
What do you mean?

222
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:17,910
My Lord.

223
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,930
Actually, there's something...

224
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,180
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.

225
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,200
Another day is fine.

226
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,500
Right now... right now I want to be alone
with my thoughts.

227
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,980
You've got something on your mind?

228
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,910
Do you want to talk about it with me?

229
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,270
It's nothing, nothing serious.

230
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,150
We can talk about it later.

231
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,910
Xiu.

232
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,240
Why are you blushing?

233
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Baichuan, it's getting late.

234
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,320
I... n-need to go to bed.

235
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,630
You should go too.

236
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,160
Here, take them.

237
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,450
I can see now. That's amazing!

238
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,720
Baichuan, why did you take off
your clothes?

239
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Come on, put them back on. It's cold.

240
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,280
Zichuan Xiu!

241
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,820
Baichuan, listen up,

242
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,720
if you ever dare to act like this again,

243
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,080
I'll report you to the Ministry of War!

244
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,270
Are you going to report me to
Zichuan's Ministry of War

245
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,400
or to the North Clan's Ministry of War?

246
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:30,800
You...

247
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,510
Don't push it too far!

248
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,910
Who's pushing it too far?

249
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,080
Your eyes are clearly fine now.

250
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,210
Why did you lie to us?

251
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,120
I...

252
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,120
I swear

253
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,510
my vision has only come back
these past few days.

254
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,370
Besides, I was severely injured.

255
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,950
My martial arts skills are
basically ruined.

256
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,480
So I need to recuperate quietly.

257
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,000
Recovery takes time.

258
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,740
Moreover,

259
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,550
thanks to your careful care
these past few days,

260
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,550
I've had the energy

261
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,880
to share the secret manuals
that my master left with you all.

262
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,790
You brought me to the Guqi Mountains,

263
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,320
telling me I was your most loyal
subordinate.

264
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,270
You just wanted me to help you
fake evidence

265
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,120
to trick everyone into practicing
martial arts, huh?

266
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,200
H-H-How is it tricking?

267
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,240
The Xiu Battalion's individual
combat ability is way too weak now.

268
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,240
It can only scare off petty thieves,

269
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,840
but if we encounter elite troops,

270
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,200
we probably won't last five minutes.

271
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,510
So, if we want to establish ourselves
in Yuanzhou,

272
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,480
we must improve our own strength.

273
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,730
Just with these few fake manuals?

274
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,360
The martial arts are indeed
what my master left behind.

275
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,560
I can guarantee that.

276
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,200
Explain.

277
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,570
The real techniques are all in my head.

278
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,240
I can only draw them for others.

279
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,960
Look, I've even

280
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,670
tailored different martial arts
for each of you.

281
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,530
Think about it.

282
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,440
Li Nong, though not good at strategy,

283
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,570
has big hands.

284
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,390
And Ze,

285
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,700
though he's timid,

286
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,360
if you give him a knife...

287
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
he immediately becomes different.

288
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,750
And the other soldiers
in the Xiu Battalion,

289
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,410
they are natural-born thugs.

290
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,770
They have rich experience in gang fights.

291
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,440
So the manuals I gave them

292
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,950
focus on improving inner strength
and tactical strategies.

293
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,270
Now tell me, wasn't that incredibly
thoughtful of me?

294
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,430
So, you should be able to forgive me

295
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,080
for this well-intentioned
deception, right?

296
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,720
I can forgive you.

297
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,220
Everyone has been working hard,
taking care of you lately.

298
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,410
Yet, your eyes have been fine
for a while now.

299
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,070
Shouldn't you let everyone blow off
some steam?

300
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,099
-You...
-What?

301
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,940
Why are you being so petty?

302
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,550
Mine was also written by
Master Zuo Jiaming.

303
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,200
Let's swap and read each other's.

304
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,510
Yours must be fake.

305
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,230
With your meager talent,

306
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,079
how could you possibly have a connection
with Master Zuo Jiaming?

307
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,540
How can you talk like that?

308
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,109
Give it to me!

309
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:24,720
Bad news.

310
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,410
You... I...

311
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:25,920
Something's wrong.

312
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,180
What happened, De Lun?

313
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,270
The outpost has reported

314
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,470
that the North Clan's army is attacking
our Bulu Village.

315
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,910
Why do you all look so downcast?

316
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,660
Chief, you can see now?

317
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,050
It's all thanks to Master Zuo Jiaming's
divine martial arts.

318
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,180
I'll explain the details to you later.

319
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,680
What's important is that our friends
in Bulu Village

320
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,920
took us in when our Xiu Battalion was

321
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,520
in its most difficult times.

322
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,680
Now, Bulu Village is in trouble.

323
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,160
We can't just sit idly by and do nothing!

324
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,080
Now, let's take up our weapons

325
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,350
and go wipe them out completely!

326
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,160
Well...

327
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,340
Chief, well...

328
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,640
Our relationship with the Orcs

329
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,000
is indeed quite good.

330
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,790
But if we really go to battle,

331
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,680
we might be completely wiped out.

332
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,000
Everyone, I know you've all

333
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,830
been diligently practicing
your martial arts recently.

334
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,680
Now is the perfect opportunity
to earn honor and merit.

335
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,640
Are you going to let this chance slip by?

336
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,920
Luo Jie.

337
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,550
Yes, sir!

338
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
Go out and open the village gate.

339
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,030
I'll count to 10.

340
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,000
If anyone still dares to hide here
and not go out to face the enemy,

341
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,480
I'll be the first to cut him down.

342
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,200
Yes, sir!

343
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,700
Chief?

344
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,200
Chief. Are you serious?

345
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,750
What do you think?

346
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,400
I'm going right now.

347
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,460
His sight returned, but he's
lost his mind.

348
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,030
Five!

349
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,880
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

350
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,310
Guys,

351
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,960
charge with me!

352
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,160
We all know the level of our friends
in the Xiu Battalion.

353
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,790
Today, we're mainly
training their courage.

354
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,590
In a moment, just make a show of it,
then quickly retreat.

355
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,270
Don't hurt our allies, okay?

356
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,220
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

357
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,710
Okay. Do well, and we'll have
a nice meal tonight.

358
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,910
-Alright.
-Alright.

359
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,420
Guys, you can't blame me for this.

360
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,610
The Chief has said

361
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,240
that if we don't fight, we'll be killed
without mercy.

362
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,340
What else could we do?

363
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,730
So,

364
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,910
once we get going, we can't back down!

365
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,400
Forward!

366
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,510
Guys... let's go!

367
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,680
Kill them!

368
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,550
How is it?

369
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,480
This move is really effective.

370
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,200
Everyone, stop! Stop fighting! It's us!

371
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,000
Today is really our lucky day.

372
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,810
To think that I

373
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,070
would run into weaklings
like the Xiu Battalion.

374
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,860
Men, today is the day we make our mark!

375
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,960
Nothing special! Kill them!

376
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,260
When did Ze become so powerful?

377
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,550
What are you all standing there for?
Attack!

378
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,380
Guys, follow me!

379
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,010
Is this all you've got?

380
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,330
Are those also actors you hired?

381
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,070
Of course not.

382
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,990
Those are real soldiers from
the North Clan.

383
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,860
Our Xiu Battalion has truly
gotten stronger.

384
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,910
I, Zichuan Xiu,

385
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,450
am indeed the best teacher in the world.

386
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,520
-Cheers!
-Brothers and sisters!

387
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,660
Cheers!

388
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,200
Today is a day of great significance

389
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,400
for our Xiu Battalion.

390
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,030
Our Xiu Battalion has completely shed

391
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,160
the title of "The Cowards of Zichuan!"

392
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,550
Today is the day we achieved victory

393
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,480
for the first time with our own
real strength!

394
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,570
Today marks a new beginning
for our Xiu Battalion.

395
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,260
So from this moment on,

396
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,440
our Xiu Battalion stands tall!

397
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,750
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

398
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,790
Guys, you're really amazing!

399
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,720
Come on!

400
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,290
-Let's drink!
-Come on!

401
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,000
Okay!

402
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,680
Xiu.

403
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,550
Today, your crew

404
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,890
really gave me a scare.

405
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,700
If we had actually fought for real,

406
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,960
I'm not even sure I could have taken them.

407
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,640
-Hey...
-I've had my eye on that one for a while!

408
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,880
This is mine!

409
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,590
Mine!

410
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,510
De Lun, individual fighting ability
isn't enough.

411
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,310
The individual strength
of the Xiu Battalion

412
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,510
has indeed improved.

413
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,400
But for the entire army,

414
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,350
the real problem hasn't been solved yet.

415
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,110
No money means no quality equipment.

416
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,790
It also means that we can't afford horses
or supplies.

417
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,000
Your Xiu Battalion is famous for
taking advantage of situations.

418
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,110
How come you're short on money now?

419
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,720
De Lun here told me

420
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,530
he's out of money

421
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,150
and wants to borrow
from our Xiu Battalion.

422
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,790
No, that's not it.

423
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,070
No, no.

424
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,920
No, listen to me.

425
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,330
Everyone, eat and drink
to your heart's content!

426
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,480
Listen to me.

427
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,640
Ever since I left
the Wealth Building Hall,

428
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,830
it has basically been abandoned.

429
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,950
Now, we have to rely on you for meals.

430
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:55,190
If you're short on money, you can...
come to me.

431
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
How about it, Xiu?

432
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,830
De Lun,

433
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,100
what shady side business have you
been running?

434
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,360
Look at all this treasure. You must
take me along next time.

435
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,000
Speaking of shady business,

436
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,570
that's also because of you.

437
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,790
Because of me?

438
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,590
Back then, our Zuoyi Clan

439
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,590
opened a branch

440
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,350
under the Wealth Building Hall, right?

441
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,720
The villages surrounding us

442
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
are rich in minerals,

443
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,680
and they've made bank

444
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,310
by following the hall's caravans.

445
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,640
But as you know, our Zuoyi Clan

446
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,510
has very low living expenses.

447
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,170
So we found a place

448
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,410
to stash the money.

449
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,510
De Lun,

450
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,640
I won't be polite with you.

451
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,750
I won't be polite with you either.

452
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,660
What do you mean?

453
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,350
One percent interest rate, no time limit.

454
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,850
De Lun, you've gone bad.

455
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,660
Even brothers should keep clear accounts.

456
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,180
That's what you taught me.

457
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,630
Well? Is it enough?

458
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,130
Enough, more than enough.

459
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,720
Where did you swindle this from again?

460
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,260
Please mind your words.

461
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,110
This is all thanks to

462
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,110
my good personal credit

463
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,640
and extensive network of friends.

464
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,970
So, it's borrowed then.

465
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,400
What did you put up as collateral
for so much money?

466
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,240
These days, it's good enough that someone
is willing to lend money.

467
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,480
What exactly did you use as collateral?

468
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,830
What do I even have to put up?

469
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,240
I have nothing.

470
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,960
All I can offer as collateral

471
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,440
is my passion and my future.

472
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,120
How much is the interest?

473
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:56,720
One percent.

474
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,400
How much?

475
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,030
This rate is actually very fair

476
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,200
in Yuanzhou.

477
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,790
Besides, with this money...

478
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,310
our Xiu Battalion

479
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,200
can get back on track.

480
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,720
So what's your first step?

481
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,810
The first step, of course, is to...

482
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,960
treat our brothers to a big feast.

483
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,480
Well, we already drove back

484
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,240
a North Clan unit days ago.

485
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,650
Why are we still out here on patrol?

486
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,350
Have you forgotten our chief's reputation
among the North Clan?

487
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,350
Plenty of people are just waiting to
see his head roll.

488
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,030
So sad. We've followed the wrong man.

489
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,200
What's wrong?

490
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,590
Smell it. A strong smell of blood.

491
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,450
And it's thick.

492
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,320
It's coming from over there.

493
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,610
These are North Clan soldiers.

494
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,440
Dig a pit and bury them all.

495
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,270
So gross.

496
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,280
The blood is still fresh.

497
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,200
Whoever the killers are, they definitely
haven't gone far.

498
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,680
They must have heard our footsteps

499
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,790
and fled in a hurry.

500
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,540
And judging from the blood trail,

501
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,200
some of them must be wounded.

502
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,880
The trail winds into the woods.

503
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,810
Their footsteps seem frantic too.

504
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,210
Let's go inside and take a look.

505
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,000
Keep an eye on our surroundings.

506
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,570
Stop right there! We'll shoot if you come
any closer!

507
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,370
They seem to be rebels from Yuanzhou.

508
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,480
We mean no harm! We just want to talk!

509
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,240
You killed those North Clan soldiers

510
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,440
outside, didn't you?

511
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,270
Yes.

512
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,250
Any injuries on your side?

513
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,270
A few of our brothers have been wounded.

514
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,340
Come on out.

515
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,280
Let's go.

516
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,770
It's medicine and food.

517
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,920
Quick, treat our brothers' wounds.

518
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,030
Hurry up.

519
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,880
Thank you.

520
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,410
No need to thank us.

521
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,640
By the way, who are you?

522
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,000
My name is Hu An,

523
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,550
Captain of the Fifth Company

524
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,750
in Lei Hong's army of the Zichuan family.

525
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,200
The Fifth Company...

526
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,720
We used to be.

527
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,830
Back then, the Fifth Company

528
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,640
followed Lei Hong in betraying Zichuan

529
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,440
and later joined the North Clan.

530
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,510
Yes. When Lei Hong defected,

531
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,450
he killed anyone loyal to the clan

532
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,810
who refused to turn.

533
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,160
So those of us who are still alive...
are all traitors.

534
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,670
What about those dead North Clan soldiers?

535
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,070
Those tribal leaders of the North Clan

536
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,130
have always looked down on us rebels.

537
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,480
After Lei Hong died,

538
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,430
they became even more brutal
towards us, so...

539
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,600
So what do you plan to do next?

540
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,170
Have you thought about returning
to Zichuan?

541
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,870
We have the blood of our own people
on our hands.

542
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,390
The clan would never forgive us.

543
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,280
We'll take it one step at a time.

544
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,680
If the North Clan ever catches up
to us someday,

545
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,080
we'll fight to the death.

546
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,110
Thank you for the medicine.

547
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,310
Do you have any extra food and medicine?

548
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,900
I can pay you in gold coins.

549
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,920
We have some in the village.

550
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,830
There's plenty of food and medicine.

551
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,480
Since you don't know

552
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,750
where to go next,

553
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,750
you can come with us.

554
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,680
I think

555
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,000
they're traitors.

556
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,310
We'd better not get involved with them.

557
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,280
What about us?

558
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
We're different. We're innocent.

559
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,970
They're real traitors.

560
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,640
They're probably having an
even harder time.

561
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,450
Who are you people, really?

562
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,400
Don't worry.

563
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,140
We're on the same path.

564
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,240
We're rebels too. We're from
the Xiu Battalion.

565
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,680
The Xiu Battalion? Then, who is
Zichuan Xiu to you?

566
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,510
That's right. Zichuan Xiu is our chief.

567
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,070
Guys,

568
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,170
they are Zichuan Xiu's soldiers.

569
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,910
-Zichuan Xiu?
-Zichuan Xiu?

570
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,840
Let's pay our respects to
the hero battalion!

571
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,570
What are you doing?

572
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,000
His deeds have spread
throughout our regiment.

573
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,350
We all admire him greatly.

574
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,550
When Lei Hong defected, we had no choice.

575
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,640
To survive, we had no choice
but to compromise.

576
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,680
But he was different.

577
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,140
He did what we wanted to do
but didn't dare to.

578
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,030
We all know that he's the real hero.

579
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,920
-Yes, he's the real hero!
-Yes, he's the real hero!

580
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,980
-A true hero!
-Yes!

581
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,320
Right!

582
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,930
Chief, you've finally done something

583
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,680
that makes us proud.

584
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,730
I'm very pleased.

585
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
You're cheating!

586
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,620
My Lord.

587
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,350
Wait a moment. Just give me a second.

588
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,710
My Lord!

589
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,910
Let's pause for a moment.

590
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,630
What's the matter?

591
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,760
This is our Lord Xiu.

592
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,900
This is De Lun, the leader
of the Zuoyi Clan.

593
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,570
You're Hu An, right?

594
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,890
That's me, indeed.

595
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,270
Come on. Sit down. Let's sit and talk.

596
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,730
-Sit.
-Thank you, My Lord.

597
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,070
Actually, there's something I've been
wanting to ask you.

598
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,670
A whole company is now down
to just a few people.

599
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,720
Is the casualty rate really that high?

600
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,640
My Lord, Lu Di's army

601
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,970
is ranked by hierarchy.

602
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,880
The North Clan troops get
the best treatment

603
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,210
and the best equipment.

604
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,310
Next are the various clans from Yuanzhou.

605
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,790
And we're the lowest of all.

606
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,510
Wherever the casualties are high
and it's dangerous,

607
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,880
that's where they send us.

608
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,280
Back when we were in Payi,

609
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,410
you were also in the first wave
of the assault.

610
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,480
Yes. At that time, the North Clan's
supervisory unit

611
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,610
was right behind us.

612
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,160
Even when our men were wounded,
we weren't allowed to retreat.

613
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,760
Some were trampled to death.

614
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,790
They deliberately

615
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,590
used our corpses to pave the way.

616
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,070
After Lei Hong died, we all fled.

617
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,760
But some men were hunted down
by supervisory units,

618
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,590
then hanged from trees and burned alive.

619
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,980
Later, we decided to strike first.

620
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,179
We set traps

621
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,719
and killed them all.

622
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,550
Do you know about the North Clan's layout
in Yuanzhou?

623
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,760
My Lord, our status in the North Clan
is very low,

624
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,320
so we don't have access to
important intelligence.

625
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,670
But I've heard a rumor

626
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,630
that after the siege of Payi,

627
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,840
although the North Clan gained control
of Yuanzhou,

628
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,670
the prolonged siege and attacks

629
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,710
left their troops and equipment
extremely depleted.

630
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,239
The closest forces to us are
Lu Di's troops.

631
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,590
My Lord, after you killed Lei Hong,

632
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,400
Lu Di became the
Grand General of Pingyuan.

633
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,840
And I'm the Grand Marshal of Yuanzhou!

634
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,880
Is the North Clan out of generals?

635
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,360
The Grand General of Pingyuan

636
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,530
should at least be someone of
Yun Qianxue's caliber.

637
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,260
Recently, the Divine Emperor of Sairong
issued an order

638
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,460
that whoever kills the most people
will take on this role.

639
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:13,560
After hearing this, Lu Di went to Moon Bay

640
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,350
and killed tens of thousands of civilians
to boost his tally.

641
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,110
He immediately surpassed
the other generals.

642
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,910
Tens of thousands of civilians?

643
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:20,880
Yes.

644
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,270
At that time, that beast's order was,

645
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:27,070
"Keep the land, not the people."

646
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,030
Bastard!

647
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,860
De Lun, where are you going?

648
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,280
To gather everyone for a meeting
to rescue the civilians!

649
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,030
Don't rush yet. Wait.

650
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,960
Baichuan, you may go now.

651
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,480
Yes.

652
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,610
De Lun, I know you're anxious.

653
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,840
Don't worry. If you want to
save civilians,

654
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,840
my Xiu Battalion is at your service.

655
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:59,320
Xiu, thank you.

656
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,100
However, our Zuoyi Clan is not

657
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,710
the only race residing in Moon Bay.

658
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,920
There are also many Elves.

659
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,310
And quite a few people from other races.

660
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,150
I need to go back to the village
to discuss with those races

661
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,590
how to save them.

662
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,840
Then I'll go with you.

663
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,550
Xiu.

664
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,350
You shouldn't get involved
in Yuanzhou's affairs.

665
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,510
The various clans in Yuanzhou

666
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,670
have always been prejudiced against
you people from Zichuan.

667
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,400
Bulu Village has enough space.

668
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,960
You're... staying here now.

669
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,820
No one has said anything about it.

670
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,510
But if you get involved in affairs
between Yuanzhou people,

671
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,190
everyone might have objections.

672
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:45,030
How about this? I'll just listen
and not speak, okay?

673
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,230
Alright. Let's go.

674
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:48,930
Let's go.

675
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,330
Lu Di, that bastard.

676
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:57,110
Uncle De Lun, stop joking around.

677
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,550
Saving people? Everyone knows
we Snake Race people

678
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,710
are the worst fighters.

679
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,960
If we go, it's no different from suicide.

680
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,710
You're being too modest.

681
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
You may not be good at fighting,

682
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,480
but you've always been the fastest
at running away.

683
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,010
You could go and draw
the enemy's fire, right?

684
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,130
Well, you Gnomes are so good
at digging holes,

685
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,630
so why don't you go play the hero?

686
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,440
What did you just say?

687
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,000
Alright, alright!

688
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,860
Say that again!

689
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,670
We're all Yuanzhou people, right?

690
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,360
Let's go together.

691
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,760
That way, we can look out
for each other, right?

692
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,840
If you ask me, to rescue people,

693
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,880
a battle between the two sides
is inevitable.

694
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,840
Among all the races, the Dragon Race

695
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,880
has the strongest physique

696
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,280
and the best martial arts.

697
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,480
They even helped build

698
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,550
the houses in Moon Bay back then.

699
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,750
So they're most familiar with Moon Bay.

700
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,000
Most of the captives from Moon Bay

701
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,960
are Elves.

702
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,710
A hundred years ago, the Elves

703
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,710
seized our Dragon Race's land in Moon Bay

704
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,710
and drove us away.

705
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,400
Now, you want us to go save them?

706
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,280
No way! Let's go!

707
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,290
Let's go!

708
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:50,890
Let's go!

709
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,150
Uncle De Lun,

710
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,760
Moon Bay now belongs to the North Clan.

711
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,110
We should know when to back down.

712
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,510
Being able to guard Bulu Village

713
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,770
and protect this sacred temple well
is already quite good.

714
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,400
Even if none of your clans

715
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,000
are willing to help,

716
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,480
I, De Lun, will lead my Zuoyi Clan

717
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,550
to Moon Bay on this mission!

718
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,280
Let's go!

719
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,590
That's right. Let's go!

720
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,660
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

721
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,300
Let's go.

722
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,050
Go, go.

723
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
De Lun.

724
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,600
You Yuanzhou people

725
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,710
are not skilled with weapons and warfare,

726
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,110
but each race has its own
unique strengths.

727
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,360
If we could organize

728
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,610
and train them well,

729
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,030
with all the Yuanzhou races united
and working together properly,

730
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,920
they would actually have great potential
for combat.

731
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,020
Although there are many of us in Yuanzhou,

732
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,620
their hearts are not united.

733
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,880
I could go on for days and nights about

734
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,280
the old grudges between the races
over food and land.

735
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,410
They can't stand each other and look down
on one another.

736
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,030
If only there were a leader

737
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,170
to unite everyone, how wonderful
that would be.

738
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,440
I understand.

739
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,920
De Lun.

740
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,150
Don't worry.

741
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,960
My Xiu Battalion and I

742
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,850
will go with you to Moon Bay.

743
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,070
Your wounds haven't fully healed yet.

744
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,370
And you've also seen their...

745
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,030
their attitudes.

746
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,590
I'm afraid they won't appreciate
your kindness.

747
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,360
There are many in this world
who don't appreciate

748
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,280
my kindness or understand my intentions.

749
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,760
Besides, I've never

750
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,630
acted based on others' opinions.

751
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,320
After hearing your discussion just now,

752
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,360
I think we need at least

753
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,420
the help of one person from Yuanzhou.

754
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,630
You want to learn martial arts?

755
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,150
If you come with me to Moon Bay
to rescue people,

756
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,920
I'll have someone teach you.

757
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,360
I won't go rescue the Elves,

758
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:38,080
and I certainly won't learn martial arts
from someone from Zichuan!

759
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,740
If the North Clan besieges
the sacred temple...

760
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:48,350
and attacks Bulu Village, will you still
stand aside and do nothing?

761
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,510
With your current skills,

762
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,920
I'm afraid that when the time comes,

763
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,730
you won't even be able to save
your own people.

764
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,080
Actually, what I want is very simple.

765
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,360
You just need to draw for me

766
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,960
the layout of the Moon Bay prison.

767
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,410
We'll handle the fighting,

768
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,840
and you'll only be responsible for
rescuing people.

769
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,800
I guarantee your safety.

770
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,320
The North Clan always drinks to celebrate
after killing.

771
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,780
We'll set out at midnight,

772
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,150
and when the guards are drunk
and fast asleep,

773
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,010
we'll sneak in through the river.

774
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,510
The back wall is where the prison stones
are the loosest.

775
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,960
We can get in from there.

776
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,880
Why did you bring them back tied up?

777
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,980
Did you go to rescue people or to rob?

778
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,440
Don't mention it. Keep up!

779
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,880
I don't need your Dragon Race people
to save me,

780
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,010
and certainly not you Zichuan people!

781
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,070
Listen,

782
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,500
I only agreed to help
under certain conditions.

783
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,150
You think I wanted to save you?

784
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,550
If you don't want to live,

785
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,070
you can go back and die there right now!

786
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,030
You think I'm afraid of death?

787
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,030
If you've got the guts, let's fight
one-on-one!

788
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,110
What are you doing?

789
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,440
Come here!

790
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
Don't interfere.

791
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,150
See? If we hadn't tied them up
and brought them back,

792
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,430
we'd all be dead in Moon Bay by morning.

793
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,490
Say that again, I dare you!

794
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:36,730
Bring it on!

795
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,690
Stop fighting!

796
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,760
Stop it! Stop!

797
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,440
Not bad.

798
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,510
I didn't expect that, although you
haven't mastered the Shadowless Palm,

799
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,910
you've somehow picked up
the Shadowless Kick all on your own.

800
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:56,800
See that?

801
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,510
His temper is even worse than yours.

802
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:03,070
I heard you're not afraid of death.

803
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,910
Then I suppose you're not afraid of
hunger either.

804
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:08,710
What a pity.

805
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,400
I've prepared roasted wild chicken

806
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,750
and roasted wild rabbits in the kitchen.

807
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:15,480
There are also freshly steamed
white flour buns.

808
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,350
Can't even talk about them.

809
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,710
Just talking about it makes me hungry.

810
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,680
Let's go eat the buns.

811
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,030
Why bring them back if you know
they're trouble?

812
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,920
We should have just given them some money

813
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,850
and food on the road and let them go.

814
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,840
Now, if we don't handle this well

815
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,960
and end up exposing
Bulu Village's location,

816
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,020
we're all done for.

817
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,030
Besides, you've also seen

818
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,580
their attitude toward us.

819
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,000
Don't expect them to have a conscience
and thank you.

820
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,670
With their current skills,

821
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,340
letting them go

822
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,960
would be sending them
to their deaths anyway.

823
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,070
What?

824
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,960
I'm thinking,

825
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,960
if we hadn't handed Yuanzhou over
to the North Clan,

826
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,840
what would it be like now?

827
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,590
Then, I guess
the Divine Emperor of Sairong

828
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,710
would have already reached
the Lin Family Hills.

829
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,280
The unification of the world would be
just around the corner for him.

830
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,740
By then, you'd all be piled up
in a mass grave.

831
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,710
Di Lin and Luo Minghai in one pile,

832
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,000
and you and Princess Ning in another.

833
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,060
That would be pretty good too.
At least better than now.

834
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:45,380
The mess that Lei Hong created

835
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,030
can never be blamed on you.

836
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,190
Now, Moon Bay is a field of corpses.

837
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:56,340
Perhaps by that time, Yuanzhou

838
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,070
would also become a wasteland.

839
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,390
I don't care at all.

840
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:02,070
I don't feel guilty at all!

841
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:15,360
If you want them to stay,
just say so, okay?

842
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,360
I'll go take them to find land

843
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,420
and build houses right now, alright?

844
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,460
Of course, we should let them stay.

845
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,110
But there's no need to build houses.
