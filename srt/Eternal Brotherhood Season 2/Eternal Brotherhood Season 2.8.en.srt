00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,500
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,120
Food's here. Eat to your heart's content.

4
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,840
There's plenty. Dig in.

5
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,570
Is it enough?

6
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,600
At this rate of eating,

7
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,280
we'll be bankrupt in three days.

8
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,400
Well, they just came from
the War Prisoner Camp.

9
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,789
It's normal for them to be hungry.

10
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,310
Qiluo, why are you eating so much too?

11
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
After all my efforts,

12
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,800
I deserve to eat my fill, don't I?

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,470
Besides,

14
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,610
Lord Xiu still hasn't followed up

15
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,060
on what he promised me.

16
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,960
Eat up.

17
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,280
Eat.

18
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,620
Eat up, brothers.

19
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,680
Had enough to eat?

20
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,150
Kill us if you want;
chop us up if you must.

21
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,430
We've eaten our last meal.

22
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,520
We're not afraid of your swords or axes.

23
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,120
That's right.

24
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,200
Girls, you've eaten so much.

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,240
If we kill you now,

26
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,680
wouldn't we be at a loss?

27
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,470
Didn't he tell you
what he plans to do with them?

28
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
If all else fails,

29
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,150
we could ask them to
give us massages and foot rubs.

30
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

31
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,160
Lord Xiu has ordered,

32
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,280
now that we're in Yuanzhou,

33
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,080
we're considered half Yuanzhou people.

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,470
All races in Yuanzhou
are our brothers and sisters.

35
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,750
Great danger is coming.

36
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,550
It's hard to survive
without martial arts skills.

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,630
Martial arts?

38
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,650
Lord Baichuan knows how to talk sense.

39
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,240
That stinking little brat

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,060
wants us to teach them
martial arts and archery?

41
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,190
You don't like it?

42
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,400
What are martial arts and archery?

43
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,400
We can make money
and fill our stomachs just by farming.

44
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,030
Who needs martial arts, right?

45
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,310
That's right.

46
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,310
You don't even know
what martial arts and archery are.

47
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,030
No wonder the Elves were so helpless

48
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,240
against the North Clan.

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,710
What are you saying?

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,260
Weren't you supposed to teach me?

51
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,960
Why do they get to learn too?

52
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,000
I couldn't care less about

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,840
your Zichuan martial arts.

54
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,030
Besides, everyone knows

55
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,870
we Elves don't get along
with the Dragon Race.

56
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,270
How can we practice martial arts together?

57
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,840
I think it's better if we

58
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,080
have a fight instead.

59
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,910
Come on then!

60
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,770
What now?

61
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,190
How's that, huh?

62
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,950
Come on, you!

63
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,529
Those who practice martial arts with us

64
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,070
will get free meals and accommodation.

65
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,529
You'll get meat every day.

66
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,560
Meat?

67
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,630
We'll get meat?

68
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,870
What do you think?

69
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,270
I'm in!

70
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,600
You just said you didn't want to learn.

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,430
Why are you rushing now?

72
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,240
It's none of your business.
Get out of the way!

73
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,510
Didn't you promise to teach me?

74
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,800
Why should they get the advantage?

75
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,190
Move aside!

76
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:35,830
If that's the case,

77
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,270
I'll bring my Dragon Race brothers too.

78
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,120
Alright.

79
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,510
Brothers, let's go!

80
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,390
Don't fight over it.

81
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't push. One at a time.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,830
There's enough for everyone.

83
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,240
One at a time.

84
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,870
Give me one!

85
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,530
There's enough for everyone.

86
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,830
Plant your feet firmly and lean forward.

87
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,230
Lower your left arm
and pull it to your chin.

88
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,630
Your wrist strength is insufficient,
so you'll have to work on your aim.

89
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,920
There are plenty of pheasants
in this forest for you to practice on.

90
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,180
Is there anything you don't understand?

91
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,160
Come on, then!

92
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,320
Who's afraid of you?

93
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,870
I told you to shoot pheasants,
not each other.

94
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,040
If I don't shoot him dead,

95
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,360
he'll steal my prey.

96
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,930
If I don't shoot her dead,

97
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,070
she'll scare away my pheasants.

98
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,680
We're a team now.

99
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,510
I can understand if you don't
trust people from Zichuan,

100
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,750
but you're all from Yuanzhou.

101
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,550
Can't you trust your own people?

102
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,930
Within half an hour,

103
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,159
three pheasants per person.

104
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,620
Those who can't shoot any
won't have dinner.

105
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,360
Why did you bump into me?

106
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,000
You call that bumping into you?

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is what bumping into you looks like.

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,800
You bumped me!

109
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,870
You hit our chief!

110
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,360
You dare bump into me?

111
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,360
You dare hit our chief?

112
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,620
So what if I bumped you?

113
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,740
I'll beat you to death!

114
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,510
Take that! And that!

115
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,020
The Xiu Battalion got thirteen pheasants
and ten bees.

116
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,620
A total of eight people
met the standard today.

117
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,490
Come on.

118
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,560
Where's the prey? Not even one?

119
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,720
-They were attacking us.
-They were attacking us.

120
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,390
The Xiu Battalion has made great progress

121
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,120
in today's shooting training.

122
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,680
But the Dragon Race and the Elves
scored zero.

123
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,000
You two teams are responsible
for carrying the prey back.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,720
The Xiu Battalion will have meat tonight.

125
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,310
Let's go!

126
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,460
The Dragon Race and the Elves
will all go hungry.

127
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,000
Starting tomorrow,

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,530
I'll shoot whoever
doesn't train seriously.

129
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,090
Come on, focus and give it your all.

130
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,270
Chief, is she really going to
let us starve?

131
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,980
Didn't they promise that if we learned
martial arts, we wouldn't go hungry?

132
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,390
I'm starving, Chief.

133
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,640
Didn't they say we have to
give it our all?

134
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,040
Come on!

135
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,310
You're cheating!

136
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,120
You're the one cheating!

137
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,240
Well, I...

138
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,000
I quit!

139
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,080
What's going on with you two?
Get down here.

140
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,450
What's wrong with you two?

141
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,680
No matter how much I try to persuade you,
it's no use.

142
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,830
I just remembered,

143
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,250
I've got other work to do.

144
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,280
I'll go first.

145
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,800
You two, reflect on your actions.

146
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,950
Stop right there!

147
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,090
Stop!

148
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,720
What kind of soldiers are you leading,
Zichuan Xiu?

149
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,860
Two subordinates—
one reckless, the other a coward.

150
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,090
The Xiu Battalion is nothing
but a gang of bandits and scoundrels.

151
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,240
And now you want me to help

152
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
this hopeless lot?

153
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,500
What do you take me for?

154
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,920
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

155
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,950
Is it funny?

156
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,960
So you're angry at
the people from Yuanzhou.

157
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,350
You know too,

158
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,960
they don't have
any martial arts foundation.

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,430
Don't be angry.

160
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,720
Don't be angry. Life is just a play.

161
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,270
I finally understand
what it means to be unable to lead.

162
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,549
Why have the tribes of Yuanzhou
always been enslaved?

163
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,200
It's because they simply
don't want to improve themselves.

164
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,870
And they're even less capable of uniting.

165
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,790
I'm done teaching.

166
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,030
Hey, no need to go that far.

167
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,290
Gu Xi and the others
are making a fuss at the gate.

168
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,390
They even dare to say they're quitting?

169
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:54,990
Baichuan.

170
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,270
Calm down. Leave it to me.

171
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,600
Move aside!

172
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,080
Don't stop me!

173
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,510
Stop arguing!

174
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,200
Don't be impulsive!

175
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,600
Let us go!

176
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,000
Stop arguing!

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,150
Move aside!

178
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,860
I'm talking to you.
Listen to me for a moment.

179
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,270
If you don't want to learn,

180
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,670
just tell them properly.

181
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,000
If you walk away now

182
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
and die out there,

183
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,910
won't everything we worked for be wasted?

184
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,790
Don't stop me!

185
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,870
You can't tolerate us Elves.

186
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,530
It's not like I just found out today.
Move aside!

187
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,670
Move aside!

188
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,270
Luo Jie.

189
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,440
Let go!

190
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,870
But I...

191
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,600
But what?

192
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,240
Haven't you been holding her hand
long enough?

193
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,330
Can you keep someone
who's determined to leave?

194
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,550
What's wrong? Can't get used to it here?

195
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,850
Can't get used to it.

196
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,680
I've heard that

197
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,600
the North Clan makes you Elves
transport ore

198
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,960
for 20 hours without rest,

199
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,080
whipping and insulting you
at the slightest provocation.

200
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Today's martial arts practice
only lasted six hours.

201
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,950
I see.

202
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,290
It's Baichuan.
Baichuan has mistreated you.

203
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,790
You Zichuan people are
just like the North Clan.

204
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,240
You all just want to enslave us.

205
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,840
You have your own agenda too.

206
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,960
Why force us to learn martial arts?

207
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,910
It's just because you want us
to fight for you

208
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,200
and risk our lives for you.

209
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,360
Yes, that's right.

210
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,600
Listen to me. Xiu is really a good person.

211
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,790
Long ago, our village

212
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,160
was all protected by him.

213
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,670
Now he's teaching you martial arts.

214
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,470
Isn't this all for your own good?

215
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,230
The world is so chaotic, and you still...

216
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,760
De Lun, forget it.

217
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,190
You'd rather be caught
and forced into hard labor,

218
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,690
rather be slaughtered by the North Clan,

219
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,510
than learn martial arts?

220
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,600
Yes.

221
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,480
You don't want to learn either?

222
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,970
Weren't you eager to learn before?

223
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,480
I did want to learn before,

224
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,480
but I didn't expect archery

225
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,210
to be more tiring than farming.

226
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,060
I'm not learning anymore.

227
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,440
We, the people of Yuanzhou,
only wish for land to farm

228
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,630
and food on the table.

229
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,890
We've never liked fighting and killing.

230
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,030
Yuanzhou has been at war for many years.

231
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,670
Only when Lord Ge Yingxing was here

232
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,440
did we have a few years of peace.

233
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,550
We don't trust anyone else.

234
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,200
Right, we don't trust anyone else.

235
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,730
We don't trust anyone else.

236
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,440
Since you all think this way,

237
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,120
alright, follow me to a place.

238
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,030
These

239
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,890
are the few remaining
empty houses in Bulu Village.

240
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,240
As you can see, they're a bit run-down.

241
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,630
If you're willing,

242
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
you can make these houses your home.

243
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,600
Once the houses are repaired,

244
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,720
you can even farm the land.

245
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,870
We can live here.

246
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,080
The layout is quite nice.

247
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,360
This house is not bad. It's pretty good.

248
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,960
And you,

249
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,560
you and your brothers,

250
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,390
can take care of renovating the houses.

251
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,000
I remember there are

252
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,260
some market route maps
left in the warehouse

253
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,750
by the Wealth Building Hall.

254
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,000
If you're interested,

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
I can give them to you as well.

256
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,210
This isn't slavery;

257
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,950
it's about truly making them your own.

258
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,040
Yes, the Elves

259
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,610
are skilled at buying
and harvesting crops.

260
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,270
The Dragon Race can assist with
construction and transportation.

261
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,600
With this kind of division,

262
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,330
they shouldn't fight about
who does what, right?

263
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,390
Really?

264
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,550
Of course.

265
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,320
I promised you before

266
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,530
that I would teach you martial arts.

267
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,150
But since you're not willing to learn,

268
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,420
I'll have to give you these

269
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,360
skills for making money and settling down

270
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,720
as a way of repaying you.

271
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,670
Are you willing?

272
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,550
Yes, we are willing.

273
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,810
We're willing. We're more than willing.

274
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,000
Thank you, Lord Zichuan Xiu.

275
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,600
I wasn't good at wording that just now.

276
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,260
Please don't take it to heart.

277
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,030
Right.

278
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,270
I'm not bragging,

279
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,660
but before the war started,

280
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,260
I was the most famous porter
in all of Yuanzhou.

281
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,420
The houses we build

282
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,600
will definitely be
the most beautiful in Yuanzhou.

283
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,320
We Elves also know how to grow cotton.

284
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,790
When the autumn harvest comes,
we can use it to make clothes

285
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,080
and sell them in other villages.

286
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,000
We'll definitely make some money.

287
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,080
Then I want one too.

288
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,810
What do you want it for?

289
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,660
I'll trade you a house for it.

290
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,560
Alright, Ming Yu.

291
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,820
And yours.

292
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,780
The warehouse key.

293
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,360
Look!

294
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,440
Let me take a look.

295
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,200
Let's go.

296
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,630
Look, everyone.

297
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,120
It's really nice.

298
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,910
I told you so.

299
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,260
They only know how to build houses.

300
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,670
You can't make a silk purse
out of a sow's ear.

301
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,120
At a time like this,

302
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,060
what kind of emotional needs
could they possibly have?

303
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,300
Solving their basic needs
for food and shelter

304
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,630
is their most crucial issue now. Let's go.

305
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,080
Ge Dahan, Ya Gemi.

306
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,470
Prince Ka Lan.

307
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,440
It's been a while.

308
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,390
Indeed.

309
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
It's been a while.

310
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,030
Too much trouble to ask you
to pick us up, Prince Ka Lan.

311
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,320
This time, it's both Father's birthday
and the Rite of the Taboo God.

312
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,670
The leaders of various fiefs
live far apart,

313
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,270
and gatherings like this are rare.

314
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,670
That's why Father instructed me
to welcome you personally

315
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,150
and convey his regards.

316
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,000
The Ge'ang and Yakun Tribes

317
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,600
have never been particularly inclined
toward farming or animal husbandry,

318
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,150
yet today's offerings
are impressively complete.

319
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,150
You've clearly put in great effort.

320
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,150
General Yun has been in the city
for a long time.

321
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,410
Even your knowledge has become shallow.

322
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,160
If such meager offerings

323
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,820
are considered thoughtful,

324
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,420
wouldn't Lu Di and Luo Si
feel disheartened?

325
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,220
Luo Si offered tiger heads, wolf pelts,

326
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,580
rhinoceros horns, and many other items,

327
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,310
no fewer than a hundred pieces.

328
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,870
Exquisite hearts, peacock galls, and more
were included as well.

329
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,570
We offer fierce beasts
at the Rite of the Taboo God

330
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,130
to express gratitude
for heaven's blessings

331
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,800
and to restrain the strong,

332
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,320
giving the weak a chance to recover.

333
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,030
If we were to slaughter indiscriminately,

334
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,150
wouldn't that go against
the very purpose of the sacrifice?

335
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,030
So according to what you're saying,

336
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,030
my brother was born with
poor martial skills

337
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,600
because he's too merciful?

338
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,050
The rules set by our ancestors state that

339
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,600
whoever brings back the most prey
during the Rite of the Taboo God

340
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,930
will receive the Divine Emperor's favor.

341
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,030
If every prince and leader

342
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,720
were like my brother,

343
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,530
why don't we just turn
the Rite of the Taboo God

344
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,140
into a day for releasing animals instead?

345
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,800
Brother, you seem so sure of yourself.

346
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,510
I suppose you're planning
to take first place

347
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,650
in this hunt.

348
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,970
Have you decided
what you'll ask Father for?

349
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,930
Go ahead and guess.

350
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,210
Whether I want troops,
power, or territory.

351
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,500
These will all be mine sooner or later.

352
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,670
What's the point?

353
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,560
If you want me to say,

354
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,210
I will ask Father

355
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,160
to grant me your beloved General Yun

356
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,460
so he can serve me at meals
and never leave my side, day or night.

357
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,670
Wouldn't that be delightful?

358
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,790
Except for Duke Menghan
who regrettably stayed home,

359
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,180
all other tribal leaders

360
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,750
have arrived with sacrificial
and birthday gifts,

361
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,050
and are staying at the guesthouse.

362
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,270
Dukes Luo Si and Lu Di

363
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,670
have offered excessively generous gifts.

364
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,200
Prince Ka Dun is hosting them

365
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,750
at his own mansion.

366
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,790
Lu Di has just taken over Yuanzhou

367
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,690
and has always been fond of grandeur,
so we needn't worry about him.

368
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,160
But Luo Si is so dedicated,

369
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,500
and Ka Dun is quite attentive as well.

370
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,400
The gifts offered by Duke Luo Si
leading the Data Tribe

371
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,369
are tens of times more than
those of other tribes.

372
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,400
They were delivered on carpets
all the way to Sairong City,

373
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,150
creating quite a spectacle.

374
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,000
The subjects' enthusiasm for the Rite
of the Taboo God left by our ancestors

375
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,200
is so strong.

376
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,370
They must all be eagerly anticipating

377
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,840
the results of this hunt.

378
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,070
Your Majesty,
before the Rite of the Taboo God,

379
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,330
one must cleanse oneself, burn incense,
and worship through the long night.

380
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,670
Though the ceremony is complicated,

381
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,820
it's crucial to the fate of the nation.

382
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,800
Holy Shaman, you need not worry.

383
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,710
His Majesty is just caught up
in a game of chess.

384
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,000
Please leave the deity statue here
for now.

385
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,850
I know a thing or two
about the worship rituals.

386
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,030
After this game is finished,

387
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,810
I will perform the rituals
for Your Majesty.

388
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,440
I know Your Majesty has never
believed in spirits and gods.

389
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,840
This Rite of the Taboo God
is just a pretext

390
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,690
for you to discipline the tribal leaders
and stabilize the court.

391
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,840
Especially as it coincides with
the birthday ceremony.

392
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,240
In the history of the North Clan,

393
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,240
there's never been a Divine Emperor
who lived past 50.

394
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,240
I'm afraid the tribal leaders
and the two princes

395
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,480
might be harboring some concerns.

396
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,120
They naturally want to take my position.

397
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,930
As princes,

398
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,420
it's only natural to have such ambition.

399
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,350
But the North Clan's mission
is just too tough.

400
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,790
They can't bear it.

401
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,290
The current celebrations and conflicts

402
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,030
only happen because they don't know
where the real dangers lie.

403
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,030
Princess, this flower is not native
to our North Clan.

404
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,510
None of the plants you last grew

405
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,090
in the back garden survived.

406
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,890
Do you still want to keep trying?

407
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,070
I know, but I can't give up.

408
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,990
I keep thinking that
hard work will pay off.

409
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,270
What if there's a turning point?

410
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,260
Your Highness, Duke Luo Si is here
to pay his respects.

411
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,830
Show him in.

412
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,600
Yes.

413
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,750
Duke Luo Si, why didn't you

414
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,410
inform us before your visit?

415
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,610
I could have made some preparations.

416
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,050
Your Highness has finally left Zichuan.

417
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,780
You must've been through a lot.

418
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,760
As the leader of the Data Tribe,

419
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,480
now that I'm here in Sairong City,

420
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,340
it's only right that I come to
pay my respects and see how you're doing.

421
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,320
Princess, are you looking for a flower

422
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,860
to present to His Majesty
as a birthday gift?

423
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,660
I'm just growing them for fun.

424
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,100
Duke Luo Si, there's no need
to take it so seriously.

425
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,240
Honestly, no flower could ever match

426
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,570
the Princess's beauty.

427
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,930
Your Highness has been tormented
by the Zichuan people for years,

428
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,990
yet your face hasn't become haggard.

429
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,690
Instead, it has gained a bit of

430
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,580
alluring charm.

431
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,330
This flower is rare in the North Clan.

432
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,920
Since Your Highness likes it,

433
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,000
I'll send someone to gather some

434
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,600
living flowers in full bloom
to present to you.

435
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,600
That won't be necessary.

436
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,640
If you want to send flowers
to Sairong City,

437
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,030
it would surely be a waste
of labor and money.

438
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,430
Besides, they would wilt
in just a few days.

439
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,100
I'd like to plant them myself.

440
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,160
Fine.

441
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,690
Your Highness,
the imperial palace is small,

442
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,070
but Data Tribe's territory is vast.

443
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,810
Since you love planting flowers,
and I love admiring them,

444
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,490
why don't you come back
to the Data Tribe with me?

445
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,630
If such disrespectful words

446
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,960
reach Father's ears,

447
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,480
a well-meant ritual and birthday feast

448
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,010
might end up inviting
more trouble than joy.

449
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,240
Please leave.

450
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,540
Your Highness, are you using
the Divine Emperor to pressure me?

451
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,910
Duke Luo Si, you must not
be disrespectful to the Princess.

452
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,470
You have disrupted the Princess

453
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,530
and spoken to her with undue rudeness.

454
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,480
Duke Luo Si, have you lost your mind?

455
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,470
Apologize to Her Highness at once!

456
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,350
The Princess is indeed of noble birth,

457
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,610
but my status is not beneath hers either.

458
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,060
I am courting her openly and honestly.

459
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,800
What crime is there in that?

460
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,070
Princess, you needn't worry about
the Divine Emperor.

461
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,060
No matter how reluctant
the Divine Emperor may be,

462
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,280
once his daughter comes of age,

463
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,140
she'll have to marry eventually.

464
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,030
I've just been turned down
by Your Highness, after all.

465
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,200
So in this hunt,

466
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,060
I will certainly do my utmost
to win first place,

467
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,680
so I can gloriously

468
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,590
marry you.

469
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,510
I heard that Your Highness

470
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,200
was looking for some Forget-me-not seeds,

471
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,240
so I sent someone
to find some and bring them here.

472
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,120
I didn't expect Luo Si

473
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,290
to openly flirt with you so shamelessly.

474
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,070
Your Highness, please rest assured.

475
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,920
I will certainly report this truthfully
to the Divine Emperor

476
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,920
and ensure that this situation
does not happen again.

477
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,910
That won't be necessary.

478
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,510
If Luo Si truly wins the hunt

479
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,530
and proposes marriage,

480
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,790
how could Father refuse?

481
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,940
We must cut off his thoughts
at the source.

482
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,160
The outcome of the hunt

483
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,680
concerns military power, fiefs,
and the position of the Crown Prince.

484
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,540
You must want to beat Big Brother,

485
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,150
but in terms of horsemanship
and archery, you're far behind him.

486
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,190
I have a plan.

487
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,790
Send people immediately
to buy in large quantities of

488
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,390
animal carcasses
from the market and hunters,

489
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,290
and transport them
to the temporary palace.

490
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,880
But the hunt is a test
of horsemanship and archery.

491
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,420
Buying game in advance
is no different from cheating.

492
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,640
If Father finds out,
he will surely be furious.

493
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,990
Moreover, such a large operation

494
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,510
can't possibly escape Ka Dun's notice.

495
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,480
That's exactly what we want him to know.

496
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,280
You know Big Brother has always
been competitive.

497
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,310
The more you show your desire to win,

498
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,720
the more he'll fear losing.

499
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,510
If he knows you're buying game,

500
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,440
he will certainly
prepare even more thoroughly

501
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,700
and more excessively.

502
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,310
Once he fears losing,

503
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,200
Lu Di and Luo Si under him

504
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
will naturally devise strategies for him.

505
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,310
But in terms of horsemanship,
archery, and manpower,

506
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,030
I'm no match for Luo Si.

507
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,080
Moreover, this time Lu Di

508
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,880
has brought so many slaves from Yuanzhou.

509
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,990
That's precisely to force them
to reveal their true colors.

510
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,320
Father is well aware of

511
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,820
the rivalry between you.

512
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,750
He just turns a blind eye
to maintain balance.

513
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,970
But if he harms me
just to fight for the throne,

514
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,110
Father will never allow it.

515
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,590
As for Luo Si,

516
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,210
he is the leader of the Data Tribe.

517
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,460
In recent years, the Data Tribe's power
has expanded rapidly.

518
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,680
The more outstanding he is,

519
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,630
the less Father wants him to win.

520
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,950
He will also be more wary of Big Brother.

521
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,070
I have a question.

522
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,720
You've always stayed out

523
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,550
of our rivalry.

524
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,910
Why are you helping me this time?

525
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,400
I'm not entirely doing this to help you.

526
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,400
It's more to help myself.

527
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,860
I already have someone I love.

528
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,200
I will never marry Luo Si.

529
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,880
Your Highness, we just received the news.

530
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,960
Prince Ka Lan is sending people

531
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,310
to nearby hunters and markets

532
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,640
to purchase a large number
of fresh exotic animal carcasses.

533
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,640
They are currently being transported
to the hunting palace warehouse.

534
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,790
Good for him.
He can't beat us in horseback archery,

535
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,440
so he's resorting to these tactics.

536
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,070
What does he think
the Rite of the Taboo God is?

537
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,830
A transaction between merchants?

538
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,760
I'm going to tell Father right now.

539
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,000
Don't be hasty, Your Highness.

540
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,030
Your Highness,
Ka Lan has always been meticulous.

541
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,240
He's probably already arranged

542
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,450
for people to receive the goods
at the hunting palace.

543
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,980
If the Divine Emperor sends people
to search and finds nothing,

544
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,590
won't he suspect you

545
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,310
of plotting against your brother
and trying to seize the throne?

546
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,440
Come on, sit down and calm yourself.

547
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,970
Trying to seize the throne?

548
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,750
Father is over 50,

549
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,640
yet he stubbornly refuses
to name a Crown Prince.

550
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
All the tribal leaders

551
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,370
support me without exception.

552
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,550
Isn't this position rightfully mine?

553
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,350
That's right.

554
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,680
Your Highness,
in the previous battle of Payi,

555
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,290
for the Divine Emperor,

556
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,120
there was only one prize from that battle—

557
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,000
Princess Ka Dan.

558
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,610
What do you mean?

559
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,240
There are two things

560
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,410
still up in the air at this hunt:

561
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,720
who will be the Crown Prince,

562
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,110
and who will marry Princess Ka Dan.

563
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,340
In fact, these two matters

564
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,310
can be seen as one.

565
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,590
Ka Dan is incredibly precious
to the Divine Emperor.

566
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,460
She's the apple of his eye
and also his torment.

567
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,550
So whoever can resolve this issue

568
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,510
will be the Divine Emperor's
most favored heir.

569
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,060
My attempt to assassinate Ka Dan

570
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,430
has always been a thorn in Father's heart.

571
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,270
If you marry Ka Dan,

572
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,700
it will naturally resolve

573
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,510
Father's misgivings about me.

574
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,210
Alright, after the hunt is over,

575
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,080
I will propose to Father

576
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,550
to let you marry Ka Dan.

577
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,680
But Ka Lan intends to compete for it.

578
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,520
How should we win?

579
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,270
I remember
General Lu Di's tribute this time

580
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,530
included many prisoners from Yuanzhou.

581
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,640
So what?

582
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,110
They can't be used as sacrifices.

583
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,070
There are many Yuanzhou prisoners
this time.

584
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,660
Some have been assigned
to the hunting palace

585
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,990
to manage the stables and feed the horses.

586
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,400
There are many deep pits and trenches
under the hunting palace.

587
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,000
If we arrange for the Orcs

588
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,850
to throw the meat
into the connected deep pits and trenches,

589
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,050
won't we have countless prey?

590
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,690
As expected of my dear brother-in-law.

591
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,400
Good. After you marry Ka Dan

592
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,550
and I secure my position as heir,

593
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,640
we two will share the rule
of the North Clan.

594
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,350
-Come on!
-Your Highness...

595
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,710
Today is the Rite of the Taboo God.
All of you have presented your offerings.

596
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,460
No matter how much it is,

597
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,550
you've done your utmost,

598
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,720
showing sincere respect.

599
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,440
I am deeply gratified.

600
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,300
If God is watching,

601
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,550
he will surely reward the North Clan

602
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,370
for our sincerity and reverence.

603
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,310
Long live the Divine Emperor!

604
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,010
Move aside! I must see the Divine Emperor!

605
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,110
Stop him!

606
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,200
I have failed in managing my subordinates.
I am at fault.

607
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,920
Your Majesty,

608
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,600
I beg you to save our people in Yuanzhou.

609
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,200
Lu Di has secretly increased taxes
by dozens of times.

610
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,000
He's amassing wealth like a madman.

611
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,270
If a single household in a village
fails to pay tribute,

612
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,370
he punishes the whole village
with a massacre.

613
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,940
Countless farmers have been
forcibly taken away,

614
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,030
either drafted as soldiers

615
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,480
or sent to the mines.

616
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,920
If injured, they're simply
thrown into mass graves.

617
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,840
In Yuntai alone, tens of thousands
have been slaughtered.

618
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,290
I implore Your Majesty to uphold justice.

619
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,510
Do you have any evidence?

620
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,830
This blood petition

621
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,640
bears the handprints of every tribesman
who came with me.

622
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,520
Among them, 69 people

623
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,270
were killed on the road
by Lu Di taking out his anger.

624
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,030
Your Majesty.

625
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,350
General Lu Di really knows
how to make money.

626
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:55,140
But the taxes collected from Yuanzhou

627
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,490
don't seem to have increased.

628
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,640
Who got the money?

629
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,790
Lu Di!

630
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,830
Are you still not going to
confess the truth?

631
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,440
I...

632
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,550
I was just focused on preparing
a birthday gift for the Divine Emperor.

633
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,000
That's why I ordered my subordinates
to increase taxes moderately.

634
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,350
All the extra taxes collected
were intended as a gift

635
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,600
to be presented to the Divine Emperor.

636
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,530
How dare you!
Are you trying to pin your crimes

637
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,110
on Father?

638
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,920
No, that's not it.

639
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,060
I deserve death for my offense.

640
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,730
What crime have you committed?

641
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,510
Guards, take this slave
of the Dragon Race away

642
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,480
and kill him.

643
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,270
Why?

644
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,330
It was clearly Lu Di who deceived
his superiors and betrayed our lord.

645
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,130
Who is your lord?

646
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,810
You people of Yuanzhou
sought protection from us, the North Clan.

647
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,470
The Divine Emperor was merciful
and allowed you to become slaves.

648
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,590
General Lu Di governs Yuanzhou,

649
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,000
so he is your lord.

650
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,640
Instead of thinking about
sharing his burdens,

651
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,040
you're here complaining about his faults.

652
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,030
Take him away.

653
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,490
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

654
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,550
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

655
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,720
Ka Dan,

656
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:09,970
what's wrong?

657
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,240
Is there something inappropriate?

658
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,160
Since today is
the Rite of the Taboo God...

659
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,490
Her Highness must be worried their deaths

660
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,280
would defile the offerings.

661
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,680
As today marks both
the Rite of the Taboo God

662
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,070
and Father's birthday,

663
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,080
I wish to join the hunt

664
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,680
to pay my respects.

665
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:37,030
Well. General Yun will accompany you

666
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,210
on the hunt.

667
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,340
As for these slaves,

668
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,030
Black Veil, I entrust them to your care.

669
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,900
Remember, don't dirty
the mountains and forests.

670
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,830
Yes.

671
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,430
The true purpose of our sacrifice

672
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,480
is not to beg for protection
from the gods,

673
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,580
but to remind us

674
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,130
that there are no gods in this world,

675
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,090
and no one we can rely on.

676
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,160
We offer these rites

677
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,960
to the ancient rulers of this land.

678
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,240
They are our monuments.

679
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:29,480
My children, my people,

680
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,860
fight and kill.

681
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:38,960
For in this world,
only the strong prevail.

682
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,590
Long live the Divine Emperor!

683
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,020
You've devised a clever scheme,

684
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,890
inciting the Yuanzhou slaves
to lodge complaints.

685
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,720
Why didn't I think of that?

686
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,460
But as you've seen,

687
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,510
Father wouldn't punish his son

688
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,450
over the lives of a few slaves.

689
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,880
This hunt has only just begun.

690
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,639
The outcome is far from decided.

691
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,480
Not to mention Father

692
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,780
always keeps his emotions hidden.

693
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,280
Just because he hasn't punished anyone
doesn't mean he's not angry.

694
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,030
Brother, you're jumping to conclusions
too quickly.

695
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,270
Come on, Brother.

696
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,560
Alright.

697
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,000
I'd like to see

698
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,590
even if you buy out the whole market,

699
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,560
can you really find wolves,
tigers, and leopards?

700
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,960
I'm telling you, without Yun Qianxue,

701
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,100
you couldn't even catch a rabbit.

702
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,500
Your Highness, Lord Yun,

703
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,280
we indeed found deep pits and traps

704
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,990
for catching wild beasts
in the hunting grounds.

705
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,920
Judging from the soil marks,
they were dug recently.

706
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,030
You're right about that.

707
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,490
Now that we have evidence,

708
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,800
those traps and deep pits

709
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,640
must be put to good use.

710
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:32,710
We can't let them dodge responsibility
with excuses.

711
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,840
If any hunters fall into the pits

712
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,770
and get injured,

713
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,120
His Majesty surely won't stand idly by.

714
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,800
I'll go.

715
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,560
Your faction is too obvious.

716
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,550
Father will certainly become suspicious.

717
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,070
He'll suspect that
Second Brother and Big Brother

718
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,000
are scheming against each other to
compete for the Crown Prince's position.

719
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,330
It might actually be counterproductive.

720
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,440
After investigation,

721
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,300
Prince Ka Dun currently
has the most abundant game.

722
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,320
Since you've won first place,

723
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,430
feel free to ask for
any reward you desire.

724
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:14,090
Father, as the eldest prince,

725
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,440
I always prioritize my siblings.
How could I seek gain for myself?

726
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,730
Ka Dan was captured by Zichuan previously.

727
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,710
Now that we siblings have reunited,

728
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,760
and Ka Dan has reached marriageable age,

729
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,000
as her elder brother,

730
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:28,110
I have arranged the best marriage for her.

731
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,820
Your Majesty, I have long been
in love with Princess Ka Dan.

732
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,840
I wish to take the Princess
as my legal wife.

733
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,660
I am willing to mobilize
the whole Data Tribe

734
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,360
to offer a generous dowry
for the Princess.

735
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,960
Mobilizing the whole tribe?

736
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,530
What kind of dowry would that be?

737
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,760
Data Tribe is the second largest
in the North Clan.

738
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,700
We have vast lands
and abundant mineral resources,

739
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,180
along with countless cattle, sheep,
and servants, all of which we can offer.

740
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,630
Where's Ka Dan? Where has she gone?

741
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,740
The Princess and General Yun
haven't returned yet.

742
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,190
They haven't sent any signals either.

743
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,700
We have increased our search efforts

744
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,740
but have only found some
newly dug deep pit traps.

745
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,670
Inside the pits, there are some
flesh-eating Bloodthirsty Crows.

746
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,670
We fear that Your Highness might...

747
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,710
Absurd! The hunting grounds are
exclusively for royal use.

748
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,510
It's closed off to outsiders.
Where could these traps come from?

749
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,840
I have checked the entry and exit records.

750
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,590
Recently, only Prince Ka Dun

751
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,320
has sent slaves from Yuanzhou
in and out of the hunting grounds.

752
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,190
Lu Di, you said you wanted to
use slaves from Yuanzhou

753
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,760
to repair the hunting grounds.

754
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,030
What on earth is going on?

755
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,280
Those rebellious slaves from Yuanzhou
are clearly trying to

756
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,410
frame us on purpose.

757
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,290
Is that how you hunted

758
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,150
those beasts of yours?

759
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,750
What do you think
the Rite of the Taboo God is?

760
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,150
And what do you take my daughter for?

761
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,500
Ka Dan.

762
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,290
I'll go with you.

763
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,330
But Princess, you're too precious.
You can't go.

764
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,710
If we're putting on a show,
let's do it properly.

765
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,570
If we're going to play the victim,

766
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,440
we must strike at

767
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,110
what Father holds most dear.

768
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,480
Besides, I believe you will keep me safe.

769
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,160
-Father.
-Don't worry, Your Majesty.

770
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,330
I found their mounts in the forest.

771
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,710
The Princess and General Yun

772
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,630
indeed accidentally fell into a deep pit

773
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,860
and sustained minor injuries.

774
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,980
I failed to protect the Princess properly.

775
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,830
I humbly ask for your forgiveness,
Your Majesty.

776
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:56,290
The Princess and I
were trapped in a deep pit,

777
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,760
and we were also injured
by Bloodthirsty Crows.

778
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,840
We could only use them as today's prey.

779
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,380
This doesn't seem like a minor injury.

780
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,150
Black Veil, you're skilled in medicine.

781
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,950
Examine the Princess, quickly.

782
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,930
What's wrong, Counsellor?

783
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,430
The Princess isn't injured.

784
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,730
She's pregnant.

785
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,150
The Princess just returned from Zichuan.

786
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,960
Could it be those bastards from Zichuan

787
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,230
deliberately insulting our North...

788
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,280
Nonsense!

789
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,190
Your Majesty, please calm down.

790
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,960
I didn't mean to frame the Princess.

791
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,630
Shut up!

792
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:07,320
How could my daughter
have relations with the enemy?

793
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,880
If that were the case,

794
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,630
it would be the greatest insult
to the North Clan.

795
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,590
I refuse to believe
she would do such a thing.

796
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,440
Ka Dan, tell me.

797
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,110
What happened?

798
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,110
Father, actually I...

799
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:34,590
I...

800
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,780
am guilty of a capital offense.

801
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,360
The child in the Princess's womb is mine.

802
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:46,880
How dare you!

803
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,440
I escorted the Princess
back from Yuanzhou to Sairong City.

804
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,760
Because I've always had feelings
for the Princess,

805
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,280
I lost control and offended her.

806
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,950
Father, actually I...

807
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,210
All the blame lies with me alone.

808
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,220
The Princess is innocent.

809
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,950
The child in her womb is also innocent.

810
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,110
I'm willing to take full responsibility.

811
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,760
Yun, have you gone mad?

812
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,440
What a huge scandal!

813
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,400
You, merely Yun Qianxue,

814
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,530
how can you bear this responsibility?

815
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:26,430
Father, if we don't strip him
of his titles

816
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,460
and have him drawn and quartered...

817
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,370
Guards! Take him away!

818
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,150
Wait.

819
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:41,180
Ka Dan, what do you want to do?

820
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,240
I was the one who fell in love
and made a big mistake.

821
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,870
The child is innocent.

822
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,410
General Yun is also innocent.

823
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,360
Very well.

824
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,400
Yun Qianxue,

825
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,920
are you willing to marry Princess Ka Dan?

826
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,680
-Your Majesty.
-Father.

827
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:24,410
This is what I have been most willing
to do in my entire life.

828
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,710
I want you to swear.

829
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,400
I, Yun Qianxue, swear

830
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,920
to protect Ka Dan for life
and remain loyal to the royal family,

831
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,360
never to betray.

832
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,930
If I fail to fulfill this oath,

833
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,840
may enemy cavalry trample my body,

834
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,400
crush my bones, and scatter my ashes.

835
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,240
Your Majesty,

836
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,070
I can't accept your decision.

837
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,920
The Data Tribe is also displeased.

838
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,320
The rules of the Rite of the Taboo God

839
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,120
state that whoever wins the hunt

840
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,880
has the right to request one favor.

841
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,240
Father, I clearly caught the most prey.

842
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,360
When I was young and out hunting,

843
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,710
I once fell into a trap.

844
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,150
Thanks to a strange woman who saved me,

845
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,920
I am here today.

846
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,150
That strange woman

847
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,830
was your late mother, the Empress.

848
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,840
Today, Yun Qianxue and Ka Dan

849
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,660
caught not just the Bloodthirsty Crows,

850
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,480
but also the heart of a warrior.

851
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,960
Your Majesty, but...

852
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,030
Lord Luo Si,

853
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,730
are you showing disrespect
to the late Divine Empress?

854
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,980
Yun Qianxue, listen carefully.

855
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,110
I entrust my beloved daughter to you.

856
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,250
General Yun,

857
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,050
I love him very much.

858
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,960
I love the father of this child
with all my heart,

859
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,260
and perhaps I always will.

860
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:54,840
I know.

861
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,690
He is a subject of the Zichuan family.

862
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,980
You don't need to tell me who he is.

863
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,610
Now you have already returned
to the North Clan.

864
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:12,820
It will be difficult for you
to meet him again in this life.

865
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,190
But the child in your womb needs a father.

866
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,510
Just now in the hall,

867
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,780
I did not lie to His Majesty.

868
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,030
I'm truly

869
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,100
willing to risk my life

870
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,980
to protect you and the child you carry.

871
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,320
Get some rest now.

872
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,530
Father.

873
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:24,570
You've allied with the tribal leaders
to scheme against your own father,

874
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,500
are overly ambitious for glory,

875
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,500
don't hesitate to harm your own sister,

876
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,670
exploit without limits,
and lack proper discipline.

877
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:36,880
You can't even control
a minor figure like Lu Di.

878
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,760
Father,

879
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:41,890
I just wanted to organize
the Rite of the Taboo God well.

880
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,370
I just wanted to celebrate your birthday.

881
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,200
I didn't...

882
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,070
Didn't what?

883
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:49,360
Do you think I really don't know

884
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:52,600
about Lu Di's exploitation of Yuanzhou?

885
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,030
Do you think I really believe

886
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,590
that a deep pit would turn into a trap?

887
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,290
You're both cowardly and incompetent.

888
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,030
How could I have a son like you?

889
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,870
Your Majesty, please calm down.

890
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,850
Prince Ka Dun surely knows
his mistake now.

891
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,020
I deserve to die.

892
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,010
It's my fault for angering you.

893
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,190
I deserve to die.

894
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:19,560
But Father, please don't harm
your health with anger.

895
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,020
-Don't be angry.
-Go back!

896
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,920
Be a proper prince.

897
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:27,360
Tell Lu Di

898
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:31,800
I'm saving this sword for both of you.

899
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:34,710
Get out!

900
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,070
Yes.

901
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,880
The scepter requires ambition.

902
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,510
Only with ambition
can one protect the scepter.

903
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,550
But I never expected

904
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,030
he would be so foolish.

905
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:14,570
He can't even see Luo Si's greed.

906
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,950
Are you worried that

907
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,360
Ka Dun would do anything
to take the throne?

908
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:25,800
As long as I'm here, he wouldn't dare.

909
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,670
But what about Luo Si?

910
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,760
Luo Si...
