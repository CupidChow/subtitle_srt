[Episode 5]

3
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,710
Those who dare to betray Zichuan

4
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,590
will be shown no mercy.

5
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,870
Catch him, quickly!

6
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,390
Too late.

7
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,700
Come on, General-in-Chief.

8
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,410
Zichuan Xiu!

9
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,630
Princess.

10
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,090
Why did you kill our North Clan soldiers?

11
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,990
Those who dare to betray Zichuan

12
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,410
will be shown no mercy.

13
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,520
Princess!

14
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,780
If you come any closer,

15
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,910
I'll make sure your princess
joins Lei Hong in the grave.

16
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,280
Let her go!

17
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,010
Zichuan Xiu, you won't escape.

18
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,910
Since you're going to kill me anyway,

19
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,840
I might as well take
the North Clan's princess

20
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,280
down with me.

21
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,280
You bastard, let the Princess go!

22
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,800
Zichuan Xiu, what do you want?

23
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,720
If you have any demands,

24
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,190
just state them.

25
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,680
Let me go and prepare a horse.

26
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,820
No one is to stop

27
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,280
or follow me.

28
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Once I feel safe,

29
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,710
I'll release the Princess.

30
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,390
If any of these conditions is violated,

31
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,390
I'll behead her on the spot.

32
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,680
And how do we know

33
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,030
you'll keep your word?

34
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,230
You don't have a choice.

35
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,990
You have to believe me.

36
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,680
Or would you prefer

37
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,720
I kill your precious princess right now?

38
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,540
No!

39
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,480
Good, very good.

40
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,409
From now on,

41
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,670
I'll count to five.

42
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,070
If anyone blocks my way again,

43
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,430
I'll immediately behead her.

44
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,560
One.

45
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,310
Two.

46
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,240
We can't let him escape.

47
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,870
If we do,

48
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,450
the North Clan will be
completely humiliated.

49
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,800
Your Highness, the Princess
is in his hands now.

50
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,160
We must not act rashly.

51
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,800
Three.

52
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,700
Move aside!

53
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,870
Help!

54
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:24,650
Stop!

55
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,159
Lord Zichuan Xiu,

56
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,310
I agree to your terms.

57
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,480
But you must keep your promise

58
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,360
and ensure the Princess's safety.

59
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:53,540
I believe I've treated you well
these past few days.

60
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,110
Please.

61
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,510
But if you dare to break your word

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,600
and lay a finger
on the Princess,

63
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,270
I, Yun Qianxue, will hunt you down

64
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,360
to the ends of the earth

65
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,070
and kill you in the cruelest way

66
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,830
imaginable.

67
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,159
Fine, I promise you.

68
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,480
After twelve hours,

69
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,270
come find me in the forest
outside the city.

70
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,390
All soldiers, hear my command!

71
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,070
Do not stand in the way
of Zichuan Xiu and Her Highness!

72
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,490
Anyone who disobeys will be executed!

73
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,730
Are you alright?

74
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,270
Let's go sit over there for a while.

75
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,410
Come on.

76
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,430
You were stabbed by the General-in-Chief.

77
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,030
If it had struck a vital spot,

78
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,390
just one blow could have been fatal.

79
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,860
Let go... Let go of my hand.

80
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,770
Don't exaggerate. Look at me.

81
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,920
I'm still fine, aren't I?

82
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,130
Quickly, take this pill.

83
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,020
It can help relieve the pain.

84
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,510
Is this forest too dense?

85
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,320
Not even the moonlight can get through.

86
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,040
Are you feeling any better?

87
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,850
Ka Dan, why did you save me?

88
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,470
Who said I saved you?

89
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,230
Weren't you the one who took me hostage?

90
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,200
Back at the banquet, when I made my move,

91
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,120
everyone was running away
in all directions

92
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,030
except you.

93
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,240
You were slowly approaching me.

94
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,250
I caught you without any effort.

95
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,450
And you kept shouting for help,

96
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,200
so Yun Qianxue

97
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,880
couldn't do anything.

98
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,880
I consider you a friend.

99
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,310
Now that our two clans are at war,

100
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,720
"friendship" feels like a luxury
we can't afford.

101
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,750
I used to think the same.

102
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,840
I thought Zichuan and the North Clan were,

103
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,430
just like Father said,

104
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,750
as incompatible as fire and water,

105
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,680
with only one destined to survive.

106
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,380
But after staying in Zichuan for so long,

107
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,470
you, Ning, and Si Yilin

108
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,510
made me believe that
the North Clan and Zichuan

109
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,270
could have a different kind
of relationship.

110
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,530
The Xichuan Continent

111
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,360
might be no more killing.

112
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,240
Such things

113
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,440
are not for you, me, Big Brother,
or Second Brother

114
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,910
to decide.

115
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,820
But I still want to thank you.

116
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,750
Thank you for saving me.

117
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,240
My brothers and I

118
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,100
will also work towards this goal.

119
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,550
Alright, we should continue on our way.

120
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,690
Be careful.

121
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,080
If you can't walk, lean on me.

122
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,560
What kind of hostage are you?

123
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,460
I wanted to ask you too.

124
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,720
Did you really pretend
to defect to our North Clan

125
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,090
just to kill Lei Hong?

126
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,000
Was risking so much really worth it?

127
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,200
You're smart.

128
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,730
How could you do something so foolish?

129
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,040
Lord Ge was deeply kind to me
while he was alive.

130
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,450
But Lei Hong betrayed him

131
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,890
and Zichuan.

132
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,840
If that's foolish,

133
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,720
then I'm proud to be a fool.

134
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,000
Zichuan Xiu came to the camp alone,

135
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,390
killed the Pingjing Duke
and dozens of soldiers,

136
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,030
and abducted my daughter,

137
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,770
who is your sister.

138
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,140
When all this happened,

139
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,200
were neither of you two present?

140
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,550
It was the General-in-Chief who ultimately
gave the order to release them.

141
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,200
The situation was critical at that moment.

142
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,150
The General-in-Chief made this decision

143
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,910
to ensure the Princess's safety

144
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,510
and uphold the greater good.

145
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,630
Father, the General-in-Chief
has already mobilized troops

146
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,910
to search tirelessly
for the Princess's whereabouts.

147
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,970
As for Zichuan Xiu,

148
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,750
even if we find Ka Dan,

149
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,360
he has probably already escaped unscathed.

150
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,570
Catching him again

151
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,020
would be like finding
a needle in a haystack.

152
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,440
Father, I suggest spreading the word

153
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,080
to make the Zichuan family despise him

154
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,440
and then expel him.

155
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,030
The Zichuan family should have already

156
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,870
heard about Zichuan Xiu's betrayal.

157
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,390
Not just betrayal,

158
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,790
I will also grant him
the title of Marquis.

159
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,630
Pass my order:

160
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,120
From today onwards, the whole of Yuanzhou

161
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,720
is to conduct a secret manhunt
for Zichuan Xiu.

162
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,500
Seal off all news
of the assassination attempt.

163
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,960
At the same time,
announce to the Zichuan family

164
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:06,600
that the Divine Emperor has appointed him
Grand Marshal of Yuanzhou.

165
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,870
Father, why do you want to
grant Zichuan Xiu,

166
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,480
that bastard, the title of Marquis?

167
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,550
Father is wise.

168
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,440
I want to sever all his ties

169
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,670
to the Zichuan family.

170
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,390
Based on the interrogation
of all prisoners,

171
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,390
it is confirmed that
Zichuan Xiu has betrayed us.

172
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,630
The evidence is conclusive,
and the facts are clear.

173
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,440
However, given

174
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,120
his past meritorious service to our clan,

175
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,320
I have called this meeting today
to discuss

176
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,120
how we should proceed with his punishment.

177
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,840
My Lord,

178
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,450
there's no doubt about
Zichuan Xiu's betrayal.

179
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
I propose we expel him

180
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,000
from the Zichuan family.

181
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:14,890
My Lord,

182
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,360
all the evidence we have so far

183
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,840
is too one-sided and limited.

184
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,670
We can't rely on just a few testimonies

185
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,200
to uncover the whole truth.

186
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,550
A few testimonies?

187
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Forty-three prisoners
gave identical confessions.

188
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,470
What more proof do you need?

189
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,030
What if they're all lying?

190
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,390
Di Lin,

191
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,600
when facing such a serious matter,

192
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,170
you shouldn't let personal feelings
cloud your judgment.

193
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,000
Are you saying
all the prisoners are lying?

194
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,960
Is that even possible?

195
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,840
Of course it is.

196
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,960
This could be a scheme
of sowing dissension by the North Clan.

197
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,480
They might have found someone

198
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,280
who looks just like Zichuan Xiu,

199
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,900
had them impersonate him,

200
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,240
and used the prisoners to deceive us,

201
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,120
tricking us into killing
one of our best generals ourselves.

202
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,720
I don't think that's likely.

203
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,960
Let alone how the North Clan

204
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,150
could just happen to find someone

205
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,270
who looks so much like Zichuan Xiu.

206
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,540
If their goal

207
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,630
was to make us turn against
our own generals,

208
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,910
then the ones they should have framed

209
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,360
are you and Lord Si Yilin,

210
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,030
not Zichuan Xiu.

211
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,000
A warrior who fought to the death
defending Payi,

212
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,840
or a group of weak-willed prisoners,

213
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,720
who should we believe?

214
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,430
I believe Lord Di Lin is correct.

215
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,150
Back then in Payi City,

216
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,120
Zichuan Xiu fought
alongside the Palace Guards.

217
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,960
Even in that dire situation,
he didn't betray us.

218
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,440
His loyalty is clear.

219
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,400
After the Battle of Payi,

220
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,600
Lord Di Lin, representing the clan,

221
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,600
handed over the control of Yuanzhou
to the North Clan.

222
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,000
Seeing the clan's defeat, Zichuan Xiu

223
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,440
began to consider betrayal.

224
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,470
That's absolutely impossible.

225
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,480
He stayed in Yuanzhou for so long

226
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,000
despite the danger. Why?

227
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,400
Because that land belongs to Zichuan.

228
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,360
His loyalty to the clan has never wavered.

229
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,910
Zichuan Xiu was unwilling
to return from Yuanzhou.

230
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,110
Wasn't it because his ties with the Orcs

231
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,320
had grown too close?

232
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,980
I've heard that in Yuanzhou, Zichuan Xiu

233
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,570
is revered by the Orcs.

234
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,050
They no longer heed their own clans;

235
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,550
they only follow Zichuan Xiu.

236
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,480
Isn't that the truth?

237
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,470
During the Battle of Hengchuan,

238
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,510
Zichuan Xiu was already
showing signs of unrest.

239
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,080
He had revealed intentions
of defecting to the North Clan.

240
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,840
This betrayal was clearly premeditated.

241
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,670
My Lord, I believe judgment on Zichuan Xiu

242
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,340
should be reserved until he returns.

243
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,320
-We can confront him then.
-Enough, Lord Di Lin.

244
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,910
Stop defending him.

245
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,790
I warned you before: Those who commit evil

246
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,870
will one day suffer

247
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,000
a pain that cuts deep and lingers long.

248
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,080
Luo Minghai,

249
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,140
are you trying to take revenge?

250
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,750
Your brother-in-law, Gu Lan, was corrupt.
The evidence was irrefutable.

251
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,570
The final verdict was exactly
what he deserved.

252
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,400
As for Zichuan Xiu, his treason
has been confirmed.

253
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,510
Let me say it again:

254
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,480
Treason must be purged.
Handle it by the book.

255
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,030
Alright.

256
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,069
We all need to understand

257
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:18,210
even if Zichuan Xiu had his reasons,

258
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,210
his disappearance within the North Clan

259
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,310
is enough to cast
serious suspicion on him.

260
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,700
He has tarnished the honor of our clan.

261
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,040
It's hard to say whether he still
holds any loyalty.

262
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,400
Even if he were to return to Zichuan now,

263
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,490
tell me, who would still trust him?

264
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,920
My Lord, I believe this matter
needs further investigation.

265
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,070
I can personally vouch for Zichuan Xiu...

266
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,720
Report!

267
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,070
To the Chieftain and all commanders:

268
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,330
We've just received news from Yuanzhou.

269
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,110
The Divine Emperor of the North Clan
has officially appointed Zichuan Xiu

270
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,430
as the Grand Marshal of Yuanzhou.

271
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,960
They even held a grand banquet
in his honor,

272
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,820
with the whole clan celebrating.

273
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,030
Understood.

274
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,480
Di Lin, do you still want to defend him?

275
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,610
This is the truth of the situation.

276
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,720
Zichuan Xiu is a disgrace
to the Zichuan family.

277
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,310
Now, as the seventh Chieftain

278
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,550
of the Zichuan family,

279
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,860
I hereby strip Zichuan Xiu

280
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,000
of all titles and ranks.

281
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,000
He no longer bears the name Zichuan.

282
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,940
Make this known to everyone:

283
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,400
Lin He and the Xiu Battalion

284
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,030
are traitors to the Zichuan family.

285
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,210
Anyone who sees them
is to kill them on sight!

286
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,420
I've treated your wounds.

287
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,290
You should leave quickly.

288
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,730
The General-in-Chief should be here soon.

289
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,080
I'll go now.

290
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,110
Xiu,

291
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,830
if you see Ning,

292
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,960
give her my regards.

293
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,940
If only I could still see her...

294
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,200
Ka Dan, take care of yourself.

295
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,200
You two, go over there.

296
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,650
Yes.

297
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,350
My Lord.

298
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,760
My Lord, we've found the Princess.

299
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,290
Let's go!

300
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,980
Your Highness.

301
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,030
Your...

302
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,210
Your Highness.

303
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,060
You must have been frightened.

304
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,650
Did that villain harm you?

305
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,700
I'm fine.

306
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,170
Your Highness,

307
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,000
do you remember

308
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,790
which direction he fled?

309
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,510
I think it was

310
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,880
towards the desert in the east.

311
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,070
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

312
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,600
I will definitely find him.

313
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,220
Go!

314
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,880
Yes!

315
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,030
Report.

316
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:43,730
A troop has been stopped
at the city gates by the guards.

317
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,350
[Lin Bing, Deputy Commander
of Yuanzhou Army]

318
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,280
They claim to be the Xiu Battalion.

319
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,800
Is Zichuan Xiu with them?

320
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,200
He hasn't appeared.

321
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,770
The troop was led back by three captains.

322
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,270
The gate guards didn't dare to
intervene further.

323
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,470
So I came to receive your instructions.

324
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,400
Bring those three captains in.

325
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,830
Yes.

326
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,990
We're finally back home.

327
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,190
Lord Lin Bing, Gu Lei.

328
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:11,950
This guy hasn't changed at all.

329
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,680
[Gu Lei]

330
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,400
Where's Zichuan Xiu?

331
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,760
Didn't he come back with you?

332
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,270
My Lord, Lord Xiu was not with our troops.

333
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,790
When we withdrew from Payi,

334
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,760
he said he had some business to attend to

335
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,290
and told us to return first.

336
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,480
I estimated he would

337
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,000
be away for about two or three days,

338
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,800
so we waited for him along the way

339
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,480
and even stayed in
the Duluo Forest for a while.

340
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,280
That's right.

341
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,680
Mainly because we were running low
on food,

342
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,880
and we couldn't afford to wait any longer,

343
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,410
so we returned ahead of him.

344
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,510
So during all this time,

345
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,240
you stayed in the Duluo Forest,

346
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,140
completely unaware of any news outside?

347
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,170
What did he say when he left?

348
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,320
Was there anything unusual
about his attitude?

349
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,520
Did he try to persuade you to go with him?

350
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,730
Actually, I promised him
to keep it a secret.

351
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,720
He said he miscalculated some money
in a deal with a merchant caravan

352
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,850
and needed to go reclaim it.

353
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,960
He was embarrassed
and asked me not to tell you.

354
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
So all that talk about gold mining

355
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,690
was just something you made up?

356
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,460
My Lord, has something happened?

357
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,380
I'll just cut to the chase.

358
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,710
The men from
the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs

359
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,400
have arrived at Wayun Fortress.

360
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,060
They're on their way here now.

361
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,170
They're coming to arrest you.

362
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,070
Your commander, Zichuan Xiu, has defected

363
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,350
to the North Clan.

364
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,790
Lord Chieftain is furious.

365
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,480
He has already issued

366
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,090
a bounty and kill order on Zichuan Xiu

367
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,960
and the Xiu Battalion.

368
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,110
Lord Lin Bing, did I hear that right?

369
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,480
Did you just say Lord Xiu has defected?

370
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,880
That's impossible.

371
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,510
Zichuan Xiu has defected to the enemy.

372
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
This is confirmed and beyond doubt.

373
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,400
Lord Lin Bing,

374
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,750
you know our commander personally.

375
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,030
He may usually seem greedy and lecherous,

376
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,750
but in this case,

377
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,070
I believe

378
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,750
there's definitely a reason
for what he did.

379
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,830
That's right, My Lord.

380
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,960
There must be some misunderstanding.

381
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,050
I want to believe that too,

382
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,830
but the Imperial Capital
has already made its judgment.

383
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,030
Zichuan Xiu would never betray Zichuan.

384
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,440
What if he really has defected?

385
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,240
Then we'll go and bring him back.

386
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,720
Gu Lei, take them away for now.

387
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,440
The officials are about to arrive.

388
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
What are you hesitating for?

389
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,170
I have other matters to attend to.
Take them away!

390
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,070
Yes.

391
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,110
Let's go.

392
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,720
Let go of me!

393
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,680
Ming Yu.

394
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,510
Baichuan,

395
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,050
I hope you're right.

396
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,540
Gu Lei,

397
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,900
where exactly did Lord Lin Bing

398
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,400
order you to take us?

399
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,160
Shouldn't we go to
the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs

400
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,310
to explain the situation first?

401
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,770
Haven't you realized yet?

402
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,590
Lord Lin Bing deliberately
let us off the hook

403
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,450
through Gu Lei.

404
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,310
She still trusts Lord Xiu,

405
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,240
but if you go back now,

406
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,270
there's no way you'll be able
to clear your names.

407
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,680
What should we do then?

408
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,750
Gu Lei, I'm sorry
for getting you involved.

409
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,960
What are you saying?

410
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,930
I've always followed Lord Xiu,

411
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,310
and I believe that whatever he does,

412
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,040
he must have his reasons.

413
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,400
I don't believe Lord Xiu has betrayed us.

414
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,110
Though he's usually

415
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,840
carefree and smooth-talking,

416
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,800
he's definitely not spineless.

417
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,130
I don't want to believe it either,

418
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,350
but now that the clan
has issued an arrest warrant,

419
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,950
we can't just go back
and get ourselves killed.

420
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,880
Whether Lord Xiu truly betrayed us

421
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,410
or was captured by mistake,

422
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,680
the fact that he's now
with the Sairong Army

423
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,830
is undeniable.

424
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Wayun is filled with clan soldiers.

425
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,270
We need to get out of here
as soon as possible.

426
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,590
But where can we go?

427
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,160
Yeah, where can we go?

428
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,480
Do you remember
De Lun's hometown, Bulu Village?

429
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,960
It's no longer under the jurisdiction
of the Zichuan family.

430
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,310
Even if the clan sends out a search party,

431
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,930
they won't be able to
find us there for a while.

432
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,520
Besides,

433
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,440
if Lord Xiu is truly innocent,

434
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,580
he will definitely go there
once he's out of danger.

435
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,270
De Lun will take us in, right?

436
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,890
The four of us might be fine,
but what about the Xiu Battalion?

437
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,280
I'll explain.

438
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,920
Right now, no one knows
what's happening with Lord Xiu.

439
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,830
The Xiu Battalion only has two choices:

440
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,680
First, you all return to Wayun Fortress

441
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,750
and surrender to the Ministry
of Military and Legal Affairs

442
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,480
to face investigation.

443
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,000
Surrender?

444
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,530
Surrender?

445
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,330
Second, the Xiu Battalion
disbands immediately,

446
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,680
and everyone goes their separate ways.

447
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,280
Which option do you choose?

448
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,590
Then let's vote.

449
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,540
Those willing to return to Wayun
and surrender, raise your hands.

450
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,830
Wait, if we go back now,

451
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,270
how will the Ministry of Military
and Legal Affairs treat us?

452
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,400
Will they kill us?

453
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,640
Exactly.

454
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,640
The Chieftain has indeed issued
a kill-on-sight order,

455
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,500
but it's mainly aimed at Lord Xiu.

456
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,070
If you surrender now,

457
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,770
there might still be a chance to survive.

458
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,360
I want to go back to Wayun.

459
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,810
Brothers, no matter what,
we're going to suffer.

460
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,060
Is anyone coming with me?

461
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,430
Me!

462
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,350
Let's go!

463
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,880
Let's go!

464
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,390
Traitors!

465
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,350
Li Nong, let them go.
Everyone has their own path.

466
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,070
Shaozi.

467
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,620
Where are you going? Where?

468
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,840
Maocai has already given his life
for all of us,

469
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,280
but now you're telling me
you want to run away?

470
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,290
Come on, let's go back.

471
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,270
Come back with me!

472
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,700
Lord Xiu's whereabouts are unknown,

473
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,570
and we're still wanted.

474
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,590
Yuanzhou is now North Clan territory.

475
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,000
Brother, I don't want to fight anymore.

476
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,530
I need to go back
and take care of my mother.

477
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,610
Who doesn't have a mother at home?

478
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,030
Shaozi,

479
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,330
you're not the only one.

480
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,000
Does that mean Maocai died in vain?

481
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,680
No.

482
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,430
Did the men of the Xiu Battalion
die in vain too?

483
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,750
You want to leave?

484
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,720
You don't recognize me anymore?

485
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,480
Fine.

486
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,080
Then go back with a clean slate.

487
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,880
Go ahead.

488
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,310
Brother!

489
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,860
Go on.

490
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,460
If that's how it is,

491
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,790
we have no choice
but to take the second path.

492
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,680
The Xiu Battalion is officially disbanded.

493
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
You're free to go wherever you want.

494
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,720
Take care of yourselves.

495
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,640
You can't just do that.

496
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,350
Yeah.

497
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,270
Let's just do it.

498
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,720
There's no point staying here any longer.

499
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,880
Let's go home and farm.

500
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,280
What's there to discuss?

501
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,150
Those who want to leave, leave.
Those who want to stay, stay.

502
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,200
But don't forget,

503
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,590
Zichuan Xiu is still waiting for us.

504
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,240
Lord Xiu has never given up on us.

505
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,660
We need to find him.

506
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,240
Yes, let's find him. Let's find Lord Xiu.

507
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,130
Let's find him.

508
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,430
Let's find Lord Xiu.

509
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,990
Since everyone still wants to find him,

510
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,210
then we'll remain as a group
and not disband.

511
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,550
How about

512
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,700
we go back to being bandits?

513
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,100
I think that's a good idea.

514
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,870
You're not seriously thinking of
becoming a bandit, are you?

515
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,110
We're supposed to be
the legitimate army of the Zichuan family.

516
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,110
Legitimate army?

517
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,200
The Zichuan family
isn't paying us anymore, right?

518
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,110
That's right.

519
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,240
Exactly.

520
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,530
So why not rob the North Clan's caravans?

521
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,510
At least then, we'd be doing it
for justice.

522
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,880
Uphold justice!

523
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,440
How about we call ourselves
the Fierce Tiger Gang?

524
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,160
Where did the Fierce Tiger come from?

525
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,380
We've been brainstorming forever
and still can't settle on a name.

526
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,510
I think the Xiu Battalion sounds good.

527
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,750
What Xiu Battalion?

528
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,500
That sounds too righteous.

529
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,560
It has no intimidation factor at all.

530
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,040
Look, here comes a fat sheep.

531
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,200
A long line of North Clan caravans.

532
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,090
They're carrying the supplies
we desperately need.

533
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,550
Tell the scouts to keep a close eye.

534
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,510
Are they armed,

535
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,310
or are they soldiers?
We need to investigate thoroughly.

536
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,710
Got it.

537
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,310
Our Fierce Tiger Gang is officially
open for business today.

538
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,910
Let's start with a big score.

539
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,650
Brothers, gear up!

540
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,830
Don't be afraid.

541
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,270
We are the Fierce Tiger Gang,

542
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,550
just trying to make a living.

543
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,310
If you keep calm and don't resist,

544
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,110
we won't kill you.

545
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,550
Stop right there.

546
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,040
Are you trying to run?

547
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,830
No,

548
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,640
I was just afraid of blocking your way.

549
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,350
It's a misunderstanding.

550
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,350
Stop pretending!

551
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,320
Your carriage looks pretty nice.
Move aside!

552
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,150
Am I seeing things?

553
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,530
You're not.

554
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,090
Isn't this too much?

555
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,030
Still alive, probably just asleep.

556
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,880
Am I really seeing things?

557
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,740
Isn't this Xiu?

558
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,750
Yes, it is.

559
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,920
Chief!

560
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,510
It's not me!

561
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,690
You've got the wrong person.

562
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,520
It's not me!

563
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,770
Chief, you're awake.

564
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,590
Luo Jie.

565
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,840
Luo Jie.

566
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,630
What a coincidence

567
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:23,420
running into you here.

568
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Coincidence?

569
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,590
We've been desperately searching for you.

570
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,190
I never realized I was

571
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,850
such an excellent commander.

572
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,550
To have all of you

573
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,850
as caring and loyal subordinates,

574
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:41,860
I'm truly touched.

575
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,070
Lord Xiu, have you gone blind?

576
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,710
What do you mean by "going blind"?

577
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,480
I just got a minor injury,

578
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,400
so my vision's a bit blurry right now.

579
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,330
Look, the moon must be over there.

580
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,230
I can see it.

581
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,270
He's

582
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,630
not going to stay blind forever, right?

583
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,880
Don't jinx it.

584
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,820
Once I've eaten and had my fill,

585
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,050
rested for a few days,

586
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,490
and fully recovered,

587
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,490
I'm sure I'll be able to see again.

588
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,760
Let me tell you,

589
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,230
if any of you had taken
that slash from Yun Qianxue,

590
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,640
you would have died.

591
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,640
-Yun Qianxue?
-Look at me.

592
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,800
I'm fine.

593
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,620
Where have you been all this time?

594
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,190
And what's this about
a slash from Yun Qianxue?

595
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,720
What if you really go blind?

596
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,760
I avenged Lord Ge.

597
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,000
Going blind is nothing compared to that.

598
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,440
You killed Lei Hong?

599
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,030
What?

600
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,060
The Zichuan family

601
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,840
doesn't know about my great achievements?

602
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,480
Never mind.

603
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,640
Soon enough,

604
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,320
across the Xichuan Continent,

605
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,780
the legend of me, Zichuan Xiu,
will be known.

606
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,070
A fearless young hero

607
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,630
who single-handedly
infiltrated the North Clan's camp

608
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,320
and charged straight through—

609
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,960
Chop!

610
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,670
He chopped off Lei Hong's head.

611
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,920
What? Haven't you heard anything about it?

612
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:32,260
Looks like the North Clan
has been blocking the news.

613
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,030
Chief...

614
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,500
-The Xiu Battalion is in Wayun now...
-Luo Jie.

615
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,540
Luo Jie, what did you just say?

616
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,610
What's happening in Wayun now?

617
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,800
Speak up!

618
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,320
Didn't I tell you to

619
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,980
wait for me at Wayun Fortress?

620
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,500
Why are you here now?

621
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,670
Chief, the Xiu Battalion...

622
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,860
-Can't go back to Wayun anymore.
-Luo Jie!

623
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,460
Baichuan!

624
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,020
What's the situation?

625
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:05,710
Speak.

626
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,590
Speak up!

627
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,110
Chief, don't be anxious.

628
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,700
Here's the situation:

629
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,780
The Imperial Capital

630
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,840
has spread the news
that you joined the North Clan,

631
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,360
and they've issued an arrest order
for the Xiu Battalion.

632
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,490
But it's not all bad.

633
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,760
Lord Lin Bing,
considering our past relationship,

634
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,540
secretly released all of us.

635
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,510
Though we have nowhere to go now

636
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,880
and can only live as outlaws
for the time being,

637
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,920
I believe

638
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,120
we can return to
the Imperial Capital someday, right?

639
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,230
So,

640
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,480
I'm really a traitor
to the Zichuan family?

641
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,800
You fools,

642
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,450
go back quickly

643
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,000
and explain this to the Ministry
of Military and Legal Affairs.

644
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,330
Why did you come
all the way here to find me?

645
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,840
Go back.

646
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,210
Don't worry about me. Just go!

647
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,190
This has nothing to do with us.

648
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,840
The Xiu Battalion insists on finding you.

649
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,590
A bunch of stubborn fools.

650
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,190
They say they can't sleep
without your orders.

651
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,230
Chief.

652
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,110
Ze.

653
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,550
Lord Xiu, are you alright?

654
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:40,890
Li Nong.

655
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,260
Lord Xiu.

656
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,010
Gu Lei, why are you here too?

657
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,320
Lord Lin Bing asked me
to follow Lord Baichuan

658
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,150
to find you.

659
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,520
It's so good to see you again.

660
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,090
Chief, from now on,

661
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,030
just stick with us.

662
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,120
Yeah, we're good at being bandits.

663
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:09,460
Is the whole Xiu Battalion here?

664
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,760
Lord Xiu, we're all here.

665
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,350
You idiots!

666
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,840
I can't lead you.

667
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,510
Zichuan Xiu, don't be a coward.

668
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,550
Worst case, we'll lead you.

669
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,390
I think that works.

670
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,920
Chief, the Fierce Tiger Gang

671
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,680
just needs a counselor now.

672
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,920
Look at your outfit,

673
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,600
it's exactly how I picture
a cunning counselor.

674
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:52,810
Right?

675
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,410
We're mostly worried that if you die,

676
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,420
who's going to repay us?

677
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,960
So from now on,

678
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,790
we're taking you wherever we go.

679
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,040
But this time, no backing out, alright?

680
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,530
You better treat us well.

681
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,040
Otherwise, if we beat you up later,

682
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,870
you won't even know who did it.

683
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,180
You bunch of bastards.

684
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,340
Lord Xiu, De Lun's Bulu Village
isn't far from here.

685
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,540
If we leave now,

686
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,520
we can get there by tonight.

687
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,480
Alright.

688
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,040
Thank you, everyone.

689
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,650
This is Lord Chieftain's steel seal?

690
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,680
Yes, issued directly
by the Chieftain's Mansion.

691
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,400
To prevent the traitor
Zichuan Xiu from selling clan secrets,

692
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,840
the Chieftain has specially ordered
the Wayun garrison

693
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,440
to conduct a thorough search
throughout Yuanzhou

694
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,400
for Zichuan Xiu's whereabouts,
all while ensuring their own safety.

695
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,660
If captured, execute immediately.
No need to report back.

696
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:54,950
Thank you.

697
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,970
It seems this time Lord Chieftain

698
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,840
has cut off all routes
for Zichuan Xiu to retreat.

699
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,840
Come, drink.

700
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,030
Come, have a drink.

701
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,230
Bottoms up, come on.

702
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,960
Drink up, come on.

703
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,960
Drink slowly;
no one's fighting you for it.

704
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,920
Brothers,

705
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,110
hold on a second.

706
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,150
Come, drink.

707
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,440
We all owe De Lun our thanks today

708
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,950
for his generous hospitality.

709
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,550
[De Lun, Chief of Bulu Village]

710
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,360
Right.

711
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,190
Thank you.

712
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,320
So tomorrow, we, the Xiu Battalion...

713
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,450
Chief, we've now renamed ourselves
the Fierce Tiger Gang.

714
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,000
The Fierce Tiger Gang

715
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,490
will begin a new chapter
starting tomorrow.

716
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,550
Let's have a toast!

717
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,150
Alright, come on!

718
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,280
Cheers!

719
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,550
Come on.

720
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:56,510
The Fierce Tiger Gang will be

721
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:00,590
the fiercest wolf and the mightiest tiger
in all of Yuanzhou.

722
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,110
That's not fierce enough.

723
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,170
Your expression needs to be sharper.

724
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,880
That's right.

725
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,880
-Alright.
-Yeah.

726
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,450
Tomorrow,

727
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,230
I'll go scout
the North Clan's movement routes.

728
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,490
We'll avoid their army

729
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,920
and focus on raiding the supply convoys.

730
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,000
Their equipment and supplies
will be useful too.

731
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,070
Once Yuanzhou is a bit more stable,

732
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,840
our Wealth Building Hall business

733
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,280
can be restarted, right?

734
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,840
Right!

735
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,150
Come on, let's drink!

736
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:27,800
Drink up.

737
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,670
Cheers!

738
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,190
What if we run into

739
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,250
Zichuan's troops?

740
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:36,390
Well...

741
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,360
Then we rob them too.

742
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,440
They've abandoned us anyway.

743
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,740
Enough, stop overthinking it.

744
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,110
That's true.

745
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,360
What if we come face to face

746
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,880
with the Zichuan family's soldiers?

747
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,880
We can't rob them,

748
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,990
nor can we run away.

749
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,060
It's not that serious.

750
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,860
We'll make things clear.

751
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,120
Everyone, eat and drink your fill.

752
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,740
We'll head back to Wayun
early tomorrow morning.
