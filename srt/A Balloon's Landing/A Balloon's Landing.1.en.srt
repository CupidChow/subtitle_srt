1
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,708
In this vast universe,

2
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,666
all mortals' lives

3
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,500
move in parallel lines,

4
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,583
alone and ahead.

5
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,458
When somehow the lines meet,

6
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,375
the moment of encounter,

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,166
even if it is fleeting…

8
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,166
is a miracle.

9
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,833
2020 - LAUNCH OF INK BLUE PART 2 -
THE 10TH BOOK BY GU-TIAN-YU

10
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:17,791
Six years ago,

11
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,208
my first novel, Ink Blue, was published.

12
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,041
The true story behind Ink Blue

13
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,958
was never told to anyone.

14
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,666
The Drifting Island was out in 2010?

15
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,791
Certainly there was no plagiarism.

16
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:39,791
INK BLUE

17
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:40,833
THE DRIFTING ISLAND

18
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,541
I know the keywords are similar.

19
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,166
Tian-Yu?

20
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,083
For sure he has never read this book.

21
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,000
A drifting bottle,

22
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,416
a little boy,

23
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,083
an old mailbox,

24
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,041
and the vanished whale.

25
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,666
I once believed that writing

26
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,333
was my only meaning in life.

27
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,500
In 2003,

28
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,250
Leslie Cheung passed away,

29
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,125
and so did my parents.

30
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,708
They left me an old mailbox,

31
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,125
a souvenir we bought,

32
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,041
from our last family trip to Taiwan.

33
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,000
Whenever I think of them,

34
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,208
I write them letters.

35
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,791
One day,

36
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,250
I actually received a reply from a child.

37
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,291
He wrote that there's a seashore
in Taiwan,

38
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,375
called the Bay of Vanishing Whales.

39
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,208
There used to be plenty of whales there,

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,750
but the heavy hunting of outlanders

41
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,083
drove them away.

42
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,166
An interview with Gu Tian-Yu?

43
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,333
No problem at all.

44
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,041
I will arrange it for you.

45
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,166
Where's Gu Tian-Yu?

46
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,333
MS. LILY, THIS WILL BE MY LAST WORK.
THANK YOU. I'M SORRY.

47
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,250
"Just follow where the whales go,

48
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,083
"you'll find the way to paradise."

49
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,541
THE BAY OF VANISHING WHALES

50
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,666
WRITTEN BY GU TIAN-YU

51
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,208
The last reply from the little boy

52
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,791
was a photo.

53
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,208
On the back of it was written…

54
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,250
"I'm here waiting for you."

55
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,000
I haven't been to Taiwan in a long time.

56
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,416
Taiwan…

57
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,791
is a lot different
from how I remembered it.

58
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,666
No way.

59
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,666
You're awake.

60
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,041
You are lucky to have met me.

61
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,500
I'll get you some water.

62
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,125
Got to pee?

63
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,666
That is the bathroom.

64
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,291
Or…

65
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,416
are you feeling nauseous?

66
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,000
First time going out for fun, huh?

67
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,625
Relax.

68
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:40,666
You changed your clothes yourself.

69
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,791
I am not like those girls.

70
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,625
You got tricked

71
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,958
because you're still new to Taipei.

72
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,583
I have always found them annoying.

73
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,875
So I took this chance
to teach them a lesson.

74
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,625
You don't need to thank me for that.

75
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,541
You work out regularly, right?

76
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,666
You are heavy to carry.

77
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,041
My waist hurts so much.

78
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,583
I expected to be rewarded for helping you…

79
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,750
Don't worry.

80
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,791
- My rates are fair.
- Thank you.

81
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,208
Your accent…

82
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,416
Are you from Hong Kong?

83
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,833
You should have told me earlier.

84
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,708
I take the best care of my friends
from Hong Kong.

85
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,583
I usually charge this much.

86
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,583
I'll give you a discount.

87
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:34,791
Hey!

88
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,708
What's wrong?

89
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,458
You're going to leave without paying me?

90
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,458
No… I am looking for my cellphone.

91
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,125
What's wrong?

92
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,291
Calling the police?

93
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,958
It won't help.

94
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,833
I know them better than you do.

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,166
Can I borrow yours?

96
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,375
I'll ask my friend to come and pay.

97
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,541
Just one phone call can get your friends
to pay for you?

98
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,750
Pretty impressive.

99
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,125
Sit, then you can borrow the phone.

100
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,166
Don't play any games.

101
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,541
The number you've dialed is unavailable.
Please check and dial again.

102
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,125
Is this the friend
who took you to nightclubs?

103
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,375
My old classmate.

104
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,666
Bro, you'd better drop it.

105
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,416
You can't even tell a good guy
from a bad one.

106
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,958
You are lucky to have met me,

107
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,708
Ximen Peter Chan.

108
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,166
As long as you are in Taipei,
I've got your back.

109
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,541
Just call me whenever you need.

110
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,291
Craving for food, looking for fun,

111
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,333
need girls…

112
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,541
I'll have it all prepared for you.

113
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:58,791
I mean it.

114
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,375
I have a car.

115
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,375
Personal driver, limousine service.

116
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,375
I provide…

117
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,333
the complete package.

118
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,666
Can you take me
to the Bay of Vanishing Whales?

119
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,416
What?

120
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,500
Never mind.

121
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,541
The Bay of Vanishing Whales?

122
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,500
The Bay of Vanishing Whales.
I know it very well.

123
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,833
You do? So, can you take me there?

124
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,375
Sure.

125
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,291
Additional 20,000.

126
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,541
Bro, you have asked the right person.

127
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,125
That's a hidden seashore.

128
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,541
Most people don't know about it.

129
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,083
Don't worry, I'll get you there.

130
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,750
Good pay, good service.

131
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,000
Guarantee of a comfortable experience.

132
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,791
A limousine ride is guaranteed.

133
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,291
Our understanding
of a limousine ride is different.

134
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,416
How so?

135
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,000
This ride used to belong to A-Hao.

136
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,458
A-Hao's company is called Limousine.

137
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,666
So this ride is a limousine ride.

138
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,375
A-Xiang, stop!

139
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,333
Are you stalking me?

140
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,416
All right. Let's play.

141
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,083
Stop the scooter.

142
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,125
Stop. Stop.

143
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,333
What are you doing?

144
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,833
This is dangerous. I'll go by myself.

145
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,250
Sure, go by yourself.

146
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,708
Do you know the way?

147
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,166
SWEET SECRET PARADISE MOTEL

148
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,625
This is…

149
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,416
oh, prison theme.

150
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,041
Why are we here?

151
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,416
It is a good place for hiding.

152
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,583
Hiding?

153
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,250
Aren't we going
to the Bay of Vanishing Whales?

154
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,000
Boss,

155
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,750
don't rush it, alright?

156
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:24,958
We'll be there tomorrow.

157
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:34,666
Wait.

158
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,958
Where are you going?

159
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:46,791
I'd suggest you not to.

160
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,416
It's dangerous out there.

161
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,666
Sweaty day.

162
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,458
Want to shower together?

163
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,666
It will save us some time.

164
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,208
No. I shower in the morning.

165
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,958
Do you want to join me?

166
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,625
One day,

167
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,750
I actually received a reply from a child.

168
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:53,333
"There is a seashore in Taiwan,
called the Bay of Vanishing Whales.

169
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,041
"There used to be plenty of whales."

170
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,958
"Just follow where the whales go,

171
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,833
"you'll find the way to paradise."

172
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,791
Whenever I felt like giving up,

173
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,666
I would think of the photo

174
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,750
the little boy last sent me
seven years ago.

175
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,833
He wrote,

176
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,166
"Tian-Yu, don't die.

177
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,791
"I'm here waiting for you."

178
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,791
Hey, little boy.

179
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,625
Have you found your way to paradise yet?

180
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,916
My colleague will wire you the money.

181
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,333
Seriously?

182
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:11,791
It should be soon.

183
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,000
So fast?

184
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,833
Hong Kong style.

185
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,416
Sharp and efficient.

186
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,333
Great, I like it.

187
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,333
So? Where do you want to go
after the Bay of Vanishing Whales?

188
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,750
Don't worry.
I am not trying to charge more.

189
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,916
Take me to the bay first.

190
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,666
Give me a minute.

191
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,125
I'm not lying.

192
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,625
The gang sent people
to New York's Chinatown.

193
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,458
They cast a hex on him
when he was having fun with a call girl.

194
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,625
A Burmese demoness!

195
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,750
Since then the guy has long hair
and puts on red lipstick.

196
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:01,875
How terrifying is that.

197
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:08,625
You know, street hustlers like us,
we have seen it all.

198
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,875
You should spend more time with me.

199
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,083
Get inspiration from interviewing me.

200
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,583
Why have you been moping all day?

201
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,250
We are going to the
Bay of Vanishing Whales now.

202
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,416
The Bay of Vanishing Whales.
Just over there.

203
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,916
Coming right up.

204
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,750
Next station is…

205
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,041
the Bay of Vanishing Whales.

206
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,875
The limousine
preparing to pull into the station!

207
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,666
Here we are.

208
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,166
Is this really
the Bay of Vanishing Whales?

209
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,083
Yep.

210
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,250
What's wrong?

211
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,000
Thanks.

212
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:12,666
Good bye.

213
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,666
Hey!

214
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,708
Fuck.

215
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,500
Are you trying to kill yourself?

216
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,541
Why are you still here?

217
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:25,750
You can't die.

218
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,458
None of your business.

219
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,041
You…

220
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,000
Your colleague is so careless.

221
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,041
She wired me 100,000 Hong Kong Dollars.

222
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,291
Too much money.

223
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,666
How am I supposed to return it if you die.

224
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:37,791
Just keep it.

225
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,583
Wait! Wait!

226
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,750
You… You're… such a dishonest person!

227
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,583
You did not let me know you wanted to die.

228
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,583
If I take so much money,
the police would see me as a suspect.

229
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,166
Stay calm.

230
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,541
Fine… I'll stay put.

231
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,875
What should I do if you haunt me
after killing yourself?

232
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,625
- Just leave!
- Alright.

233
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,541
- Leave!
- Don't move.

234
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,541
What are they doing?

235
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,000
Suicide.

236
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,333
It's a popular spot for suicide.

237
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,375
What should we do then?

238
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,416
Don't worry.

239
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,708
The Suicide Prevention Society is here.

240
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,958
They are professional.

241
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,333
Young man, stay calm.

242
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,708
Rise above challenges,

243
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,583
find the courage within.

244
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,833
Endure through despair.

245
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,000
Hope is your eternal companion.

246
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,000
This crucial moment changes your destiny.

247
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,250
Welcome to Saint Ocean Bay,

248
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,000
the most beautiful bay in life.

249
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,583
We are here for you!

250
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,625
Young man,

251
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,916
love conquers all.

252
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,583
It's a different time now.

253
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,583
I feel you, boys.

254
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,083
Keep going!

255
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,500
We're just fooling around.

256
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:58,916
Saint Ocean Bay?

257
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,916
This is not the Bay of Vanishing Whales?

258
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,375
Here you go.

259
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,375
Thank You.

260
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:13,958
Eat more.

261
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,333
You don't get to enjoy it
once you are dead.

262
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
I don't get it.

263
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,958
You are handsome, talented and rich.

264
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,041
Literally a winner at life.

265
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,333
Why do you want to die?

266
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,583
Did you…

267
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,083
get dumped?

268
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,416
A great writer for real, trapped by love.

269
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Okay, I will give you some words.

270
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,166
As the saying goes,

271
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,375
"There are plenty more fish in the sea.

272
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,583
"Or other creatures would do."

273
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,583
You need to meet more people.

274
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,833
What is your ideal type?

275
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,708
I can introduce you.

276
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:57,875
Damn, you scared me.

277
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,250
What exactly do you want?

278
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,541
Is it money?

279
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,708
What's wrong with money?

280
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,458
Do you not need it?

281
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,375
It's only because you are rich.

282
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,083
How much more do you want?

283
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,375
I will give you, alright?

284
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:13,750
Stay away from me.

285
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,083
Hey.

286
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,291
Hey, what are you doing?

287
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,541
Hey.

288
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,625
Where are you going?

289
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,416
Why are you mad?

290
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,416
Hey.

291
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,583
Aren't you going to the
Bay of Vanishing Whales?

292
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,458
I'll go by myself.

293
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,166
I admit I took the wrong route,

294
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,166
but I do know where it is.

295
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,791
There used to be plenty of whales there,

296
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,708
but the heavy hunting of outlanders

297
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,166
drove them away.

298
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,541
The villagers still believe that

299
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,125
one day the whales will return.

300
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,541
If we follow the whales,

301
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,750
we can find the way to paradise.

302
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:45,916
Right?

303
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,875
It is a beautiful place.

304
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,291
We won't regret visiting it.

305
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,833
And we might see the whales.

306
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,250
Just one last time, trust me.

307
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:11,958
I swear I am not to lying to you.

308
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,333
I'll get hit by a car if I do.

309
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,541
I am taking you there.

310
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,958
Call me a puppy if I lie again.

311
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:25,666
What?

312
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,041
Tian-Yu,

313
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,708
cheer up.

314
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,208
There is always a way out.

315
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,666
Don't worry.

316
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,333
Cash on delivery this time.

317
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,041
See?

318
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,666
I told you it's a limousine service.

319
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,875
See? I'm keeping my promise.

320
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,833
We're still not on the same page.

321
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,416
We have money.

322
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,166
Why did you rent such an old car?

323
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,750
I'm pretty nostalgic.

324
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,666
Tian-Yu, get your hand back in.

325
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,208
Tian-Yu, what did I just say?

326
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,125
Now.

327
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:20,750
It's finally working.

328
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,125
You look nice in a floral shirt.

329
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,416
Stop it.

330
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,000
Why are you so serious?

331
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,958
Cheer up, live a little.

332
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,416
Smile.

333
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,291
A memorial photo
will be used for a long time.

334
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:33,500
Make sure you have a good one.

335
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,250
Not bad.

336
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,250
Don't keep looking over there.

337
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,875
- Look this way.
- Stop taking photos of me.

338
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,416
You've got a sprain?

339
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,416
All because you did not warm up
before surfing.

340
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,666
I'm fine.

341
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,333
Does this even help?

342
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,166
Of course.

343
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:11,000
Wow, I've never had lobster.

344
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:14,791
I am allergic to it.

345
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:19,958
You sure you don't need to see a doctor?

346
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,583
Our Home grandpa helped me to do this

347
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,041
every time I got injured from fighting
with other kids.

348
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,500
Home grandpa?

349
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:26,958
Spoiled kid.

350
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,125
I guess you've never
fought anyone or gotten hurt.

351
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,916
I never got into a fight.

352
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,875
Really? Never?

353
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,958
That's more miserable than dying.
What brings you to mention death now?

354
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:41,041
Look, let me show you a few moves someday.

355
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,666
Otherwise, you'll be bullied
by demons in hell.

356
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:51,625
I'm going to paradise. No demons there.

357
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,208
What makes you believe that…

358
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:57,875
getting to the Bay of Vanishing Whales
will bring you to paradise?

359
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,250
I can't be sure
if what he told is true or not,

360
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,958
but I will go check it out anyway.

361
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:10,416
He?

362
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:13,125
Who is "he"?

363
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,250
There was…

364
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:21,958
Thank you.

365
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,291
Serving Mr. Zhong's special treat.

366
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,250
Please enjoy.

367
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,375
What's wrong?

368
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,250
The egg's gotten cold.

369
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,250
I'll have them reheat it.

370
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,041
Zhong Yi-Xiang.

371
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,833
Come up.

372
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:57,958
How nice to have hot spring
and lobster here.

373
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,125
Turns out you've hooked
a big fish from Hong Kong.

374
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:08,000
How would you split the profit
from the big fish?

375
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,000
Where did you go?

376
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,166
- Follow me.
- What?

377
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:36,958
Bro.

378
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:38,833
Find him.

379
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:40,875
Over there.

380
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,958
Zhong Yi-Xiang is spewing crap again.

381
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,666
Let's see where he can hide this time.

382
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,166
Go hunt him down.

383
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,125
Okay.

384
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:16,666
What's going on?

385
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,333
- Don't ask.
- Who are those guys?

386
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:20,416
Hey.

387
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,583
Got him.

388
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:22,625
Over there.

389
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,916
Stop.

390
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:37,000
Fuck. They got a car?

391
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,250
Why are they after you?

392
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:10,500
What did you do?

393
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,333
Idiot.

394
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,541
So you think I am the problem?

395
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:18,791
Would you even believe me
if I said I am not?

396
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,833
I shouldn't have believed you
from the start.

397
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:22,916
Fuck it. Go back to Hong Kong then.

398
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,500
Forget about the Bay of Vanishing Whales.

399
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:48,541
Tian-Yu.

400
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:51,083
- Tian-Yu!
- What's wrong?

401
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,541
Can you turn on the light for me first?

402
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,125
Tian-Yu!

403
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,416
Okay.

404
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,333
Okay. Calm down.

405
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,333
Tian-Yu!

406
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:01,625
Hold on.

407
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,083
Turn on the light for me, please!

408
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,583
What's wrong?

409
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,166
You're afraid of the dark?

410
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,750
Shut up.

411
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,041
I'm not.

412
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:38,541
Dry your hair,
so you don't get a headache.

413
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:44,875
- No thanks.
- Sit down, please.

414
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,166
Damn.

415
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,416
What's wrong?

416
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,375
Is there any signal?

417
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:19,458
No signal.

418
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:34,041
Hi! Excuse me.

419
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,125
Where are you going?

420
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,916
Come on.

421
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:30,875
No way.

422
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,750
I was stupid enough to trust you.
Now we are going to trust a dog?

423
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,875
All things in the world are spiritual.

424
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:38,791
Just feel it with your heart.

425
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:41,583
This dog is special, I can tell.

426
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:46,541
See.

427
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:58,250
Damn.

428
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,000
Are you seriously going to have
a banana right now?

429
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:01,416
Why don't you have some guavas?

430
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,708
You Guava dog.

431
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:09,333
Guava, where are you taking us?

432
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,125
How great, Guava!

433
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,250
Tian-Yu.

434
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,000
Come on. Let's have some fun down here.

435
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,791
This is amazing.

436
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,291
Tian-Yu, get in here.

437
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,875
Hurry.

438
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,625
Aren't you going to die soon? Come on.

439
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:52,916
You don't get to enjoy this
once you are dead.

440
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:01,833
Watch out.

441
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:09,750
I didn't mean to…

442
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:11,125
Take my water slash.

443
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,833
Take my water slash.

444
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:15,416
Take my water slash again.

445
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,666
Guava.

446
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,625
Splash him. Splash him.

447
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:27,291
Invincible fire dragon.

448
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,083
Do you know what I'm thinking?

449
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:39,291
What?

450
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:43,166
I am thinking that it would be great
to pee in this cold water.

451
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,875
Did you just pee in it?

452
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,416
No.

453
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:51,958
I was thinking…

454
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,625
what I will be in my next life.

455
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:55,291
Peter Chan. Isn't it?

456
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,416
I want to be a captain

457
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,541
and set sail around the world,
completely unrestrained.

458
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,666
You need to study hard
to become a captain.

459
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:05,791
Then forget it.

460
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:09,250
I will open a surf shop then.

461
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,000
I could get to meet hot girls.

462
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,250
You are a fan of surfing?

463
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:20,541
I met a super cool professional surfer.

464
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:21,833
He said,

465
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:23,250
"Even in the same ocean,

466
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,000
"we never surf the same waves.

467
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:26,416
"Every time you get
knocked down by a wave,

468
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,708
"you can stand up again.

469
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:30,250
"And at that moment,

470
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:31,458
"you are the king of the ocean,

471
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:32,791
"conquering the sea."

472
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:35,958
Something like that.

473
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:37,833
I am not well educated,
not good with words.

474
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:40,958
Then you should do it.

475
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:42,791
I think you should do it.

476
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:44,208
Me?

477
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:46,666
Forget it.

478
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,458
Starting a shop sounds difficult enough.

479
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:49,958
I didn't get much education.

480
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:50,958
I won't make it.

481
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,166
Maybe in my next life.

482
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,708
What if there's no next life?

483
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,041
Then fuck it. Fuck banana. Fuck guava.

484
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:11,916
Anything to grumble about?

485
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,875
Shout it loud.

486
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:14,208
Like what?

487
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:17,208
Fuck you, Brother Bear.

488
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,041
I…

489
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,208
Fuck the media.

490
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:26,916
Fuck the sales numbers.

491
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:30,000
Not like that.

492
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,833
Get up. I will teach you.

493
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:35,666
You're bad at swearing.

494
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,000
Let me teach you how to say hello.

495
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:38,875
My

496
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:41,000
My

497
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,666
brain filled with cement.

498
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:44,416
brain filled with cement.

499
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,583
Loudly.

500
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:46,916
I am

501
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,291
as stubborn as a mule.

502
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:50,291
I am

503
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,250
as stubborn as a mule.

504
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:53,875
Louder.

505
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:55,875
I am

506
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,375
as stubborn as a mule.

507
00:39:58,458 --> 00:39:59,458
I am

508
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,208
as stubborn as a mule.

509
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,666
I am

510
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:05,916
as stubborn as a mule.

511
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,541
Guava, thank you for being with us.

512
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,333
You have to eat well, sleep well,
and grow up strong.

513
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:13,583
Alright?

514
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,750
Tian-Yu, don't you want to pet him?

515
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,625
Guava,

516
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,416
do not trust anyone easily.

517
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,541
Not everyone will treat you as good.

518
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,750
Don't be afraid, no matter what happens

519
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,166
or who you meet in the future.

520
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:29,833
There is always a solution.

521
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,416
Don't miss me too much.

522
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,791
I will go check the train schedule.

523
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:54,083
Your call has been forwarded to voicemail…

524
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:31,791
The toilets are far,
like a few carriages away.

525
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:33,750
You just went?

526
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,625
Yes. Why?

527
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,208
Nothing.

528
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:51,083
I used to go to this Fireworks Festival
every year as a kid.

529
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:53,833
Right time for you to come.

530
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:56,208
Let's go to the Fireworks Festival first,

531
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:58,041
then the Bay of Vanishing Whales?
How's that?

532
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,583
Your call.

533
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:05,750
Don't worry,
I've promised to take you there.

534
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,500
We'll stay here for the night.

535
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,750
Leave your shoes here.

536
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,500
- Just leave them.
- Xiang-Xiang.

537
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:34,750
I missed you so much.

538
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,083
What took you so long?

539
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:39,125
Can you put on more clothes?
We have a guest.

540
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:41,041
- Hi.
- Hi.

541
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,458
Come in first.

542
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:43,375
Come.

543
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:44,916
Let me introduce you.

544
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:48,125
Tian-Yu, Xia-Xia.

545
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:49,375
Hi, nice to meet you.

546
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,666
Your turn.

547
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:54,208
Hi.

548
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:56,250
I am as stubborn as a mule.

549
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,416
Silly.

550
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:01,541
Did I say it wrong?

551
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:03,416
No bookings tonight.

552
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,125
We can drink as much as we want.

553
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,125
Where's the air conditioner remote?
So hot.

554
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:08,208
Why didn't you use it?

555
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:09,916
It's broken.

556
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,375
Didn't I send you some money?

557
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:12,458
Why don't you use that to fix it?

558
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,916
No need. Just wear less clothes.

559
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,208
Tian-Yu,

560
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:17,375
do you want something to drink?

561
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:20,250
- Water, please.
- Oh, okay.

562
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,291
Thanks.

563
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:27,541
Is Xia-Xia your girlfriend?

564
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:32,333
Dumbass, what are you laughing about?

565
00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:33,708
Behave yourself.

566
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:35,875
Tian-Yu is a famous writer from Hong Kong.

567
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:37,083
Hey.

568
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:38,916
Really?

569
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:41,166
That's awesome.

570
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,333
Not really.

571
00:43:42,416 --> 00:43:43,666
Don't you want to be a writer too?

572
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,416
Damn you, idiot, that's not true.

573
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:47,833
It is. I've got proof.

574
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,416
- Don't you say another word.
- Don't push me…

575
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,333
Don't say another word.

576
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:51,625
- You idiot.
- You wrote a lot.

577
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:53,708
She's got a wire loose in her head.

578
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:19,000
This place is like your home?

579
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:21,791
That's right.

580
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,125
It is my home.

581
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,375
You need anything?

582
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:29,041
- I can get it for you.
- I'm alright.

583
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,416
I thought you showered in the morning.

584
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It's weird that you remember.

585
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:36,791
Right.

586
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:39,791
I always remember the little things.

587
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:41,916
And someone just doesn't.

588
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,708
Remember, Fireworks Festival
is this weekend.

589
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:50,083
You two go.

590
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,708
I might not go.

591
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,291
Let's go together.

592
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,375
You two are close.
It would be awkward to join.

593
00:44:58,958 --> 00:44:59,916
She's like my sister.

594
00:45:00,958 --> 00:45:01,875
What?

595
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:04,125
Are you jealous?

596
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:06,208
Who's jealous?

597
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,416
Damn it.

598
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:34,208
I love rice cakes.

599
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:36,166
I have been coming to this stall
since I was a kid.

600
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:38,500
Try it.

601
00:45:38,875 --> 00:45:40,708
You will never forget this taste
in your lifetime.

602
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:47,583
Delicious.

603
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,750
You mentioned that
the Bay of Vanishing Whales is hidden

604
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:58,166
and not well-known.

605
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,458
So how do you know?

606
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,166
How do you know then?

607
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,625
I asked first.

608
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:09,416
I always feel
like you are hiding a lot from me.

609
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,083
You…

610
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:18,750
Do you really have no idea at all?

611
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:21,166
About what?

612
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:25,291
When we were having lobster,

613
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:26,708
you mentioned that there's this guy…

614
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:29,375
Who is he exactly?

615
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,625
He was my pen pal.

616
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:37,166
We lost touch after he moved to Taipei.

617
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,541
And you haven't heard from him since then?

618
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,083
The last reply I got from him was a photo.

619
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:49,666
But it's weird.

620
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,500
He told me not to die.

621
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,166
He also wrote,

622
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,625
"I'm here waiting for you."

623
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:58,250
You said… he sent you a photo.

624
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:01,250
Are you sure that was from him?

625
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,333
Tian-Yu?

626
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:11,083
Are you okay?

627
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:14,791
Tian-Yu?

628
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:16,750
What's wrong?

629
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:20,250
Tian-Yu? Hey, Tian-Yu!

630
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,375
Tian-Yu.

631
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:31,458
You're awake.

632
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:32,666
I will call the doctor.

633
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:35,958
No, I'm fine.

634
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:37,833
How is this fine?

635
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:39,791
The doctor said the allergy
could have killed you.

636
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,166
That's what I'm here for.

637
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:47,083
You idiot.

638
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:48,750
I will call the doctor.

639
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:22,208
What are you doing?

640
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:26,875
Stop it.

641
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:38,291
Hang on tight.

642
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:45,000
Hang on tight.

643
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:04,416
Zombie fist

644
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:11,083
You lost.

645
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:19,291
Left. Left.

646
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:21,791
- Behind you. Strike.
- Strike.

647
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:23,916
Go right, strike.

648
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:37,250
Here, three, two…

649
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,041
Not yet.

650
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,083
Not yet.

651
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:58,958
One, two, three, freeze.

652
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,875
One, two, three, freeze.

653
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:07,458
One, two, three, freeze.

654
00:51:08,916 --> 00:51:10,708
You moved your foot.

655
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,166
You moved your foot.

656
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,666
You lost.

657
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:16,791
Idiot.

658
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:18,000
It's my turn.

659
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,208
Go.

660
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:50,833
You guys are late.

661
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:52,875
Your scooter is too slow.

662
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:55,083
I will get you a limousine someday.

663
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:56,916
Okay, it's a deal.

664
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:00,041
Tian-Yu,

665
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:02,166
I posted your photo on our Instagram.

666
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,666
We got many new followers.

667
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:05,458
Are you stupid?

668
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:06,916
I told you he is a celebrity.

669
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,166
You can't reveal his whereabouts.

670
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,041
He is seriously famous.

671
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:11,041
Someone even called for him

672
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:12,750
after I posted it.

673
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:14,041
Who?

674
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,208
I wrote it down.

675
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:23,166
I think it's your friend from Hong Kong.

676
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:31,041
Ms. Lily,

677
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:35,500
don't worry about the
penalty regarding the contract.

678
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:36,666
I'll cover it.

679
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,583
I want to explain everything

680
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:41,125
with a press conference.

681
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:42,333
Don't worry about that.

682
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:45,083
I negotiated with the publisher in Taiwan.

683
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:47,375
Do you know how supportive your fans are?

684
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:48,375
What?

685
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:51,666
A television channel
wants to adapt Ink Blue into a show

686
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,250
with a cast of A-list actors.

687
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:56,208
Come back soon
and discuss it with the writers.

688
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:59,250
Promotion schedule
for the new book is all slotted in.

689
00:52:59,833 --> 00:53:01,958
Hurry back, got it?

690
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,625
What's up? Can't sleep?

691
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:43,250
Slightly.

692
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:44,166
Well,

693
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:47,125
how about I take you for a ride?

694
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:49,291
- Tomorrow…
- Or maybe…

695
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:52,708
You go first.

696
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,333
You'll go to the festival tomorrow, right?

697
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,416
Yeah.

698
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:04,500
After that, we don't really have to
go to the Bay of Vanishing Whales.

699
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,125
If not there,

700
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:11,666
where would you like to go?

701
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,000
I'll let you know tomorrow.

702
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:22,041
Good night.

703
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:24,125
Good night.

704
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:27,583
Welcome to the 2020
Kenting Summer Fireworks Festival.

705
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:30,625
The long-awaited fireworks show
is about to begin.

706
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:32,083
Are you ready?

707
00:56:32,166 --> 00:56:33,916
Hey, everybody,

708
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,375
let's hold hands

709
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,333
and count down from five.

710
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:38,458
Five.

711
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:39,666
Four.

712
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:40,750
Three.

713
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:41,916
Two.

714
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,458
One.

715
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:32,916
COME VISIT ME IN HONG KONG.
LIMOUSINE SERVICE. LOOKING FORWARD.

716
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:08,750
Being back in Hong Kong,

717
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:13,000
I started imagining the day
when A-Xiang would come visit.

718
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:17,083
I work really hard,

719
00:59:18,416 --> 00:59:20,583
living each day in anticipation.

720
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:24,000
But A-Xiang…

721
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:27,625
never shows up.

722
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:42,375
Ms. Lily.

723
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:46,166
I have some new ideas and want
to rewrite the draft I submitted.

724
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,166
Is that okay?

725
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:15,666
XIA-XIA B&B

726
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:38,250
XIA-XIA B&B, KENTING, A-XIANG

727
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,291
What are you doing?

728
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:47,791
Don't… You idiot.

729
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:54,000
Don't worry,

730
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,500
I've promised to take you there.

731
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:57,291
I swear I am not to lying to you.

732
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,125
I still often think about A-Xiang

733
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,958
and what we went through.

734
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,041
A-Xiang,

735
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,833
like the vanishing whales,

736
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:18,666
would return

737
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:21,708
eventually.

738
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,458
A-Xiang,

739
01:01:28,916 --> 01:01:30,791
you haven't taken me
to the Bay of Vanishing Whales.

740
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:34,916
I'm here waiting for you.

741
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:56,791
- Ms. Chen, right?
- Yes, hello.

742
01:02:56,875 --> 01:02:58,833
Hi, I'm Lily,

743
01:02:58,916 --> 01:02:59,916
this is Tian-Yu.

744
01:03:00,458 --> 01:03:01,375
Hi.

745
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:03,416
Have a seat.

746
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:08,708
- Please take a look.
- Thank you.

747
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:16,291
DECLARATION STATEMENT

748
01:03:25,416 --> 01:03:28,250
Actually, I have a deal
with the owner of your publisher.

749
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:29,916
There shouldn't be any problem.

750
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,833
Thank you.

751
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:13,125
Mr. Gu.

752
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:17,083
I want to ask you something.

753
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:18,250
What is it?

754
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:22,250
Are you Tian-Yu,

755
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:24,541
the one who has been writing
to Jin Run-Fa?

756
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:29,458
How did you know?

757
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:35,375
I read your letters… a long time ago.

758
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:54,791
Hold on a second.

759
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:56,750
I'll call you back. Okay, bye.

760
01:04:58,375 --> 01:04:59,291
Hey, kid,

761
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:03,750
you might get diarrhea if you eat this.

762
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:06,708
Where are your parents?

763
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:11,833
Are you… by yourself?

764
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:21,000
My name is… Yu-Xin. What's your name?

765
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:22,541
Zhong Yi-Xiang.

766
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:23,791
Zhong Yi-Xiang.

767
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:25,833
I was a social worker.

768
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,208
At that time,

769
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:32,083
I suspected A-Xiang's adoptive father
was abusing him.

770
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:34,625
I've visited where A-Xiang lived.

771
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:36,333
He really trusted me.

772
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:42,583
He showed me the letters from his pen pal.

773
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:46,250
I found it very touching and adorable.

774
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:48,666
Hence,

775
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:51,666
I decided to write this story

776
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,541
in a different way.

777
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:56,625
"Little Jin Run-Fa,

778
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:59,875
"I'm not an angel,
just an ordinary person."

779
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,291
Aren't you called Yi-Xiang?

780
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:07,041
Jin Run-Fa was my previous name.

781
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:09,833
Since when did A-Xiang have a pen pal?

782
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:11,500
I remember…

783
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:14,000
it was the year he came to Taipei
from Our Home.

784
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:18,125
Probably… during the summer of 2003.

785
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,875
Jin Run-Fa was still his name,

786
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:25,208
and his pen pal was also called Tian-Yu.

787
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:29,333
He said he moved to Taipei

788
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:31,583
just because of the letters from Tian-Yu.

789
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:33,583
But,

790
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:38,166
I was already in graduate school
when I first received his letter.

791
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:40,916
That was probably…

792
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:42,708
in 2013.

793
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:46,750
Are you really not going?

794
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:52,208
The car has enough room,
so does our hotel room.

795
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:54,833
No. I have to study.

796
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:55,916
You go have fun.

797
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,083
We'll leave the house in your care then.

798
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:58,791
Good luck with your exams.

799
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:20,416
Hi, I'm Jin Run-Fa.

800
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,000
I'm eight years old.

801
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:23,916
I live in Our Home.

802
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:27,500
If you see my parents,
ask them to bless me

803
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:30,500
to win the beach volleyball championship
and conquer the sea.

804
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:31,958
May Buddha bless you.

805
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:39,916
Hi, little Jin Run-Fa,

806
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:43,375
I wish you win the championship.

807
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,125
Sorry, I haven't seen your parents.

808
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,500
Remember not to prank
with someone's mailbox.

809
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:52,791
Otherwise, your parents
will definitely blame you.

810
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:56,833
P.S. A word of advice.

811
01:07:56,958 --> 01:07:59,458
Playing beach volleyball
will not get you to conquer the sea.

812
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:01,541
You must at least learn
how to sail a boat…

813
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,083
or to surf.

814
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:17,708
Our Home grandpa told me

815
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,250
there's a Bay of Vanishing Whales
in Taiwan

816
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:23,333
where there were many whales.

817
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:25,958
If we follow the whales,

818
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:27,500
we can find the way to paradise.

819
01:08:28,833 --> 01:08:32,125
My dream is to go find
my parents in paradise.

820
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,958
What is your dream?

821
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:43,250
"The Bay of Vanishing Whales…

822
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:45,916
"Sounds like a unique place.

823
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,625
"I've never heard of it."

824
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:50,875
The Bay of Vanishing Whales…

825
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:54,583
"I've never seen a whale.

826
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:57,125
"I would like to visit the bay someday.

827
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:59,041
"When I was your age,

828
01:08:59,125 --> 01:09:01,250
"my dream was to become a writer."

829
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,250
Just some rough ideas.

830
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:06,000
I want to tell a story about a little boy

831
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:08,000
who was stranded on an isolated island

832
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:10,500
with no one else on it.

833
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:14,958
One day, he picked up
a drifting bottle on the shore.

834
01:09:15,041 --> 01:09:18,458
The bottle came from
ten years in the future.

835
01:09:20,416 --> 01:09:23,375
"This bottle was sent by his friend.

836
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:25,833
"There is this hole under the sea.

837
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:29,083
"When his friend throws the bottle
into that hole,

838
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:32,416
"the little boy would receive it
on the other side of it."

839
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:36,083
Do you miss your parents?

840
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:38,208
I don't.

841
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:40,166
I've never met them.

842
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,958
Our Home grandpa said if I move to Taipei

843
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:47,125
I would have new parents
and my own room too.

844
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:48,500
Taipei?

845
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:49,666
Of course you should go.

846
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:51,375
I've been to Taipei with my parents

847
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:54,750
when I was a kid.

848
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:58,416
There were great food
and fun places in Taipei.

849
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:02,125
If you want to conquer the sea,

850
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:04,041
first thing to do is to step out
of Hong Kong.

851
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:06,291
Get out to explore the world.

852
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:41,625
"Please write back
when you arrive in Taipei.

853
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:45,166
"I'll definitely keep writing to you.

854
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,625
"Tian-Yu."

855
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:50,000
I was moved reading all the letters.

856
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:53,208
That's why I wrote the book,
The Drifting Island.

857
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:56,500
Later, I came to Hong Kong for work.

858
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:59,250
I lost contact with A-Xiang.

859
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:05,166
After all these years of waiting,

860
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:07,500
he finally met you.

861
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:10,666
He must have been so happy.

862
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:13,375
But as you said,

863
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:15,958
it happened more than ten years ago.

864
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:20,750
I did not… receive any letters
from him at that time.

865
01:11:22,833 --> 01:11:24,083
Could you be mistaken?

866
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,250
I might be vague on certain details,

867
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:32,083
but I remember that you advised him

868
01:11:32,666 --> 01:11:33,833
to learn to sail a boat…

869
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,541
or learn surfing…

870
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:39,833
to conquer the sea.

871
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:43,833
You also told him that

872
01:11:43,916 --> 01:11:45,375
you believed in the story of
the Bay of Vanishing Whales.

873
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,416
And,

874
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,333
in your last letter,

875
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:54,791
you used the lyrics from a song
of Leslie Cheung's. Right?

876
01:11:56,083 --> 01:12:00,000
WITH YOUR PRESENCE,
AUTUMN IS TRULY ENCHANTING.

877
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:04,416
If A-Xiang really is Jin Run-Fa,

878
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,333
then,

879
01:12:06,416 --> 01:12:07,875
why didn't he tell me?

880
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:09,583
He didn't tell you?

881
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:13,750
Unfortunately, it was too late…

882
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:16,250
when I got his voice message.

883
01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:21,000
Can you give me A-Xiang's contact?

884
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:23,000
I still don't quite understand

885
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:24,958
what you just said.

886
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:27,916
Perhaps, I will go and ask him in person.

887
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:47,708
CAR ACCIDENT AT KENTING FIREWORKS FESTIVAL
GANG REVENGE ENDS IN FATAL INJURY

888
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:01,791
ANGEL, PLEASE REPLY IF YOU HEAR ME.

889
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,125
TIAN-YU, DON'T DIE.
I'M HERE WAITING FOR YOU.

890
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:12,166
Are you okay?

891
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,083
Fuck that lame doctor.

892
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:14,583
I told him you should stay
in the hospital for a bit longer.

893
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:18,791
I'm sick.

894
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:23,083
You idiot.

895
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:27,000
What's wrong with you?

896
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:30,708
What?

897
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:38,208
How does your first fight feel?

898
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:40,875
What do you want?

899
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:16,125
Tian-Yu,

900
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:20,208
can you please not die?

901
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:48,041
OUR HOME

902
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:17,250
You can go to his room

903
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:19,708
if you want.

904
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,041
I have not moved a thing.

905
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:39,166
TO LITTLE JIN RUN-FA

906
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:58,041
THE DRIFTING ISLAND BY CHEN YU-XIN

907
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:12,458
OUR HOME IN 2004

908
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:14,916
Now I know

909
01:17:15,666 --> 01:17:18,291
Drifting Island was once
paradise for children.

910
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:21,833
At that time,

911
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:25,041
the little boy wrote a letter every day.

912
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:27,916
He put it in a red bottle

913
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:30,333
and threw it to the sea.

914
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:33,000
One day,

915
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,875
he got a reply from an elder brother.

916
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:39,791
Upon getting his advice,

917
01:17:42,041 --> 01:17:43,625
the little boy decided
to leave the island,

918
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:46,666
and set sail for an adventure.

919
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,500
The island was struck by an earthquake

920
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:55,208
after he left.

921
01:17:57,541 --> 01:17:59,458
All the children were gone.

922
01:18:01,666 --> 01:18:03,333
The red bottle went missing.

923
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:06,708
No more letters
from the elder brother since then.

924
01:18:13,083 --> 01:18:14,000
However,

925
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:18,250
the little boy eventually
returned to the island.

926
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:20,916
He built…

927
01:18:23,208 --> 01:18:24,708
a red sailboat

928
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,666
to search for the elder brother.

929
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:19,250
Tian-Yu, don't die.
I'm here waiting for you.

930
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:30,666
What are you doing?

931
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:36,416
Watch out.

932
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:40,291
FAMOUS WRITER HAS LOST HIS FAME

933
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:43,708
PLAGIARISM…

934
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:53,375
Ms. Chen, it's Zhong Yi-Xiang.

935
01:19:53,708 --> 01:19:56,208
Ms. Chen, it's me again, A-Xiang.

936
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:57,791
Zhong Yi-Xiang.

937
01:19:57,875 --> 01:19:59,166
I know you are busy.

938
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:00,583
Sorry that I keep bothering you.

939
01:20:01,416 --> 01:20:04,250
But I really have
something important to ask you.

940
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:05,958
If you've decided
not to kill yourself in the end,

941
01:20:06,708 --> 01:20:08,541
can I come visit you in Hong Kong?

942
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:31,708
Tian-Yu.

943
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,083
If he hadn't gone to Taipei,

944
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:43,833
his life would have been
completely different.

945
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:47,000
He had an imaginary pen pal
when he was a kid.

946
01:20:47,083 --> 01:20:48,500
Something like…

947
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:50,000
writing him letters,

948
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:52,833
encouraging him to explore the world.

949
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:55,708
He thought everything in Taipei
would be great.

950
01:20:56,625 --> 01:20:58,625
He still believed
and kept searching for the Bay

951
01:20:58,708 --> 01:21:01,375
that Our Home grandpa talked about.

952
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:15,291
When he was eight, his adoptive father
took him to Taipei.

953
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:19,250
Our Home relocated here
after the earthquake.

954
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:22,916
I had not seen him for a long while.

955
01:21:23,666 --> 01:21:24,958
At that time,

956
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:26,666
I envied him for being adopted.

957
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:29,625
I thought he was doing well in Taipei.

958
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:18,083
Boss,

959
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:19,791
that is the guy.

960
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:25,916
There.

961
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,333
The view there is excellent.
Let's go and see it.

962
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,750
Five.

963
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:47,000
Four.

964
01:22:47,083 --> 01:22:48,125
Three.

965
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:49,333
Two.

966
01:22:49,416 --> 01:22:50,833
One.

967
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:35,625
Tian-Yu,

968
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:38,375
can you please not die?

969
01:23:39,291 --> 01:23:40,708
You have come through a thousand years

970
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:43,208
to meet the destined one and returned.

971
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:55,041
After the Fireworks Festival,

972
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:57,250
we don't really have to go
to the Bay of Vanishing Whales.

973
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:58,666
Where would you like to go?

974
01:23:59,791 --> 01:24:00,791
I'll let you know tomorrow.

975
01:25:35,791 --> 01:25:38,625
TO LITTLE JIN RUN-FA, DON'T GO TO TAIPEI.

976
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:55,791
The old mailbox
that my parents bought in Taiwan

977
01:25:58,041 --> 01:25:59,916
turned out to be the one

978
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:02,250
A-Xiang used to send letters to.

979
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:06,500
I started writing letters again

980
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:08,666
to little Jin Run-Fa in the past.

981
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:14,291
I even put the photo
I last received from A-Xiang…

982
01:26:17,083 --> 01:26:19,083
into the mailbox.

983
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:24,416
I believe

984
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:27,625
whatever world is behind the mailbox,

985
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:30,750
wherever it leads,

986
01:26:32,333 --> 01:26:34,750
it will surely guide us to meet again.

987
01:26:40,416 --> 01:26:43,041
JIN RUN-FA

988
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:09,000
THREE YEARS LATER

989
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:16,458
I've written the story of A-Xiang and me,

990
01:27:17,541 --> 01:27:20,750
while also writing many letters
to Jin Run-Fa.

991
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:23,250
I wonder whether you are…

992
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:25,083
A-Xiang,

993
01:27:25,875 --> 01:27:27,125
or Jin Run-Fa now.

994
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,541
THE BAY OF VANISHING WHALES

995
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:30,375
I hope you will receive them.

996
01:27:30,583 --> 01:27:32,375
Still practicing the signature?

997
01:27:33,208 --> 01:27:34,875
None of them looks good.

998
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:38,708
Look at this stroke. It's too big.

999
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,916
I am still waiting for you here.

1000
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:45,833
Now it's my turn,

1001
01:27:46,875 --> 01:27:48,500
taking the red sailboat,

1002
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,291
to search for the missing boy.

1003
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:16,083
- Excuse me, are you Mr. Gu Tian-Yu?
- Yes.

1004
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:18,041
My girlfriend and I are big fans of yours.

1005
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:19,750
Would you please sign this for us?

1006
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:21,000
Sure.

1007
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:29,625
Thank you.

1008
01:28:29,958 --> 01:28:30,875
Thanks.

1009
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:36,416
Look. It's him.

1010
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:44,458
Xia-Xia, you've come to Taipei.

1011
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:47,375
Do you know two each other?

1012
01:28:49,666 --> 01:28:50,625
I don't think so.

1013
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:56,750
Sorry, I…

1014
01:28:56,833 --> 01:28:58,208
I got it wrong. Excuse me.

1015
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:02,958
I forgot to write your names.

1016
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:10,333
You are?

1017
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:11,458
Xiao-Yun.

1018
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:13,416
I'm A-Shan.

1019
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,375
- Thank you.
- Okay, thanks.

A-Xiang,

1023
01:30:51,375 --> 01:30:52,416
I've met Xia-Xia.

1024
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,541
But the world has become…

1025
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:00,291
somewhat different now.

1026
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:04,791
She's now called Xiao-Yun,

1027
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:06,791
and she's doing well.

1028
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:08,458
How about you?

1029
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:10,916
Where are you now?

1030
01:31:12,458 --> 01:31:14,375
Do you have another name as well?

A-Xiang,

1034
01:31:34,958 --> 01:31:36,208
the concert is coming soon.

1035
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:39,416
We'll meet each other soon.

1036
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:41,250
Right?

1037
01:31:46,458 --> 01:31:47,958
I'm here, waiting for you.

1038
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,708
The whale got really close to the shore.

1039
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:08,458
It's over ten meters long.

1040
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:09,750
A whale was spotted

1041
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:11,541
outside the sea of Kenting Wanlitong.

1042

2023 KENTING SUMMER FIREWORKS FESTIVAL

1044
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:44,291
You surfed very well this morning.

1045
01:32:44,375 --> 01:32:46,708
Did I? I thought it was just alright.

1046
01:32:49,666 --> 01:32:51,416
That smells so good. Like irresistible.

1047
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,208
So good. Really, very nice.

1048
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:16,416
Sorry.

1049
01:33:32,416 --> 01:33:33,416
Do you want some?

1050
01:33:35,333 --> 01:33:36,250
No, it's okay.

1051
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:37,208
I'm not hungry.

1052
01:33:37,291 --> 01:33:38,208
I mean it.

1053
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,458
Thanks.

1054
01:33:42,541 --> 01:33:43,791
I love rice cakes.

1055
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:53,333
Have you been there before?

1056
01:33:58,458 --> 01:33:59,458
The Fireworks Festival?

1057
01:33:59,541 --> 01:34:01,208
Of course, I live nearby.

1058
01:34:01,291 --> 01:34:02,416
I used to go every year.

1059
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,041
But it stopped for years.

1060
01:34:04,125 --> 01:34:05,666
This year, it's been resumed.

1061
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:06,916
Are you going this year?

1062
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:09,416
Yes, and you?

1063
01:34:11,833 --> 01:34:12,666
I'm going too.

1066
01:34:21,208 --> 01:34:22,125
Nice to meet you.

1067
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,208
I'm Tian-Yu.

1068
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:58,458
Dearest Weiling,
embark on your journey and soar!

1069
01:35:58,541 --> 01:36:01,041
Thank you for your love. We all love you.
