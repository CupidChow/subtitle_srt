1
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,980
(Eternal Butler)

2
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,990
(Mission 9: Is the Price Worth It?)

3
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,070
The best part of taro is when it's soft.

4
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:10,620
But pumpkin, when it's overcooked, becomes mushy.

5
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,920
I like white radish to be crunchy,

6
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,920
but I don't like sponge gourd when it's too soft.

7
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,920
Fish dumplings should be plenty,

8
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,420
but other dumplings aren't necessary.

9
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,420
Cabbage should be in the pot for exactly 30 seconds—just right.

10
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,520
Unlike water spinach, which has a strong taste.

11
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,900
Fish cakes should be cut thick, like erasers.

12
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,180
No need for Oden. I don't like that hollow texture.

13
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,070
I don't like the mid-air taste.

14
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,820
Only want beef short ribs for meat.

15
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:41,350
Shrimp's fine, but it's too much trouble.

16
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,780
Unrelated data input.

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,630
When did I

18
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,030
start remembering all of these preferences

19
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,170
of Young Master so clearly?

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,680
Oh, by the way, I need to buy some ice cream.

21
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,980
The latest flavor just came out.

22
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,730
And yet, you say you're not a kid?

23
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,240
I already bought it for you,

24
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,789
waiting for you to come back.

25
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,660
Is the most intimidating model

26
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,320
of the Immortals, Four?

27
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,820
Were you on the phone with your Young Master?

28
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,690
Because of employer rights,

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,070
we can't monitor you.

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,230
But everyone's concerned

31
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,320
that high and mighty Immortal Four,

32
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,610
being assigned to a nouveau riche family—

33
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,829
wonder if you'd have trouble adjusting.

34
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,180
Looks like you've adjusted well.

35
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,410
You were the one who took Mr. Luo's money.

36
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,020
Everyone was against Wei Heng.

37
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,850
A robot is just a robot.

38
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,440
What's all this about emotional perception?

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,829
Immortal Nine fell in love with a human.

40
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,829
You disregarded orders and climbed to the top.

41
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,670
Really impressive.

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,970
The company

43
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,220
is worried about the warning system being faulty.

44
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,720
I was asked to kindly remind you

45
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,370
to hurry back to the Luo family

46
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,220
and get Luo Daqiang to retract the complaint.

47
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,980
Or else...

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,480
In a few seconds,

49
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,910
IES is about to be activated.

50
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,090
I feel obligated to update you on my current situation.

51
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:20,840
Really, there's no need.

52
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,130
Just pay me back.

53
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,180
Young Master Luo needs this money?

54
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,210
Yes.

55
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,320
What you need is...

56
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,220
Zhou Zhenqun.

57
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:31,980
The guardian is here.

58
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,730
What?

59
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,440
I'm warning you.

60
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,340
Don't show PDA in front of me, your creditor.

61
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,329
I thought you had a boyfriend.

62
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,829
Yes, aren't you with Immortal Four?

63
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,329
Who's with him?

64
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,520
Why don't you?

65
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,050
If I told you

66
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,620
Immortal Four

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,630
is not human...

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,460
Not human?

69
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,840
Not human? Then...

70
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,600
Is he a ghost?

71
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,110
No.

72
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,210
Why did you scare him?

73
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,340
Who scared him?

74
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,790
Even if Immortal Four is a ghost,

75
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,350
you can perform a ritual for him if you don't like him.

76
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,340
Yet, you always take him around,

77
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,330
showing off.

78
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,150
I mean...

79
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,410
Let's ignore him. Let's go.

80
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,510
It's okay.

81
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:18,820
Let's go.

82
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,110
If I tell you the real identity of Immortal Four,

83
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,980
you'll be scared out of your mind.

84
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:35,990
I'm going back. I'm starving.

85
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,200
You really don't fear death, do you?

86
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,110
You're using IES as punishment

87
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,370
just because you want the Immortals

88
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,420
to experience the so-called "NRS"—

89
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,680
the worst possible pain.

90
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,760
I know I won't die,

91
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,210
and the tests won't fail.

92
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,280
After all, you wouldn't want

93
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,990
such an expensive product to be ruined.

94
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,220
Don't you think you've done something wrong?

95
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,740
You shouldn't judge us

96
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,310
using non-subjective norms.

97
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,470
You are our products.

98
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,000
This is our rule. There's no right or wrong.

99
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,070
Now, let's see the result.

100
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,200
(Purple Alert)
(Four, you have confirmed to violate rules. IES penalty will soon activate)

101
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,150
The first is level 10 NRS pain shock,

102
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,670
30 seconds.

103
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,620
24 hours later, it will happen again.

104
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,670
The time will be doubled.

105
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,890
Even robots will break

106
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,840
after a few times like this.

107
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,790
Immortal Four, customers rent the machines.

108
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,210
Once the time is up, they return the product.

109
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,880
If the case is over, then it's over.

110
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,570
Do you think humans will care about you this much?

111
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,960
What's the point of doing all this for the Luo family's Young Master?

112
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,510
It's not worth it.

113
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,900
There's still time.

114
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,130
Hurry and get Mr. Luo to cancel the complaint.

115
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,240
It's up to me to decide

116
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,330
whether it's worth it.

117
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,610
I'm just worried you won't be able to handle it.

118
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,100
Or you can come back with me now,

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,290
and I'll help you resolve it right away.

120
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,710
I promised him

121
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,610
that unless he told me to leave,

122
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,340
no one could make me go!

123
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,610
A robot who values promises.

124
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,630
Ridiculous.

125
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,010
I heard that you are in charge of Hengji now.

126
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,170
You're doing well.

127
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,530
It's none of your business.

128
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,330
I just care about my children.

129
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,080
The Immortals are not yours, Wei Heng.

130
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,720
Since you're gone,

131
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,780
stop interfering.

132
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,690
Who gave you permission to use IES?

133
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,870
Since you're gone, stay out of it.

134
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,440
Who's been passing you messages at the company?

135
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,080
Zhou Tianguang.

136
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,770
Think about

137
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,890
why we created the Immortals.

138
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,900
They are not just products.

139
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,740
Don't let your personal vendetta against me

140
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,340
make you take this to the next level. I've already...

141
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,220
You're back.

142
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,440
Want to eat ice cream first?

143
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,750
What's wrong?

144
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,860
Did someone upset you?

145
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,990
The ingredients are half prepared.

146
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,320
That's not your style.

147
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,080
Did something happen just now?

148
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,540
No.

149
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,020
Does it hurt when you get injured?

150
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,750
To us,

151
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,650
it's just

152
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,460
an ideological form of harm.

153
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,550
Young Master, what's wrong?

154
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,330
I got chili in my eyes.

155
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,980
Let me help you.

156
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Do you feel better now?

157
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,070
There's no saline solution here.

158
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,970
Wait for me. I'll go buy some.

159
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,260
Did Luo Daqiang say

160
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,550
if I don't go back,

161
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,950
he will sue the company?

162
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,320
Will you be punished?

163
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,980
Don't worry, Young Master.

164
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,260
Just leave it to me.

165
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,490
Leave it to you?

166
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,850
I don't need to worry about anything.

167
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,490
Can you stop prioritizing me?

168
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,230
It's too much pressure for me.

169
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
This is what I should do.

170
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,210
I don't want your "shoulds".

171
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,230
You're no different from Luo Daqiang this way.

172
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,670
You treat me like a fool,

173
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,270
living off a robot.

174
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,310
I feel embarrassed.

175
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,680
I can't refute

176
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,380
when people call me a kept man.

177
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,780
I feel so ashamed.

178
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,100
It's annoying to be disciplined by you all day.

179
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,300
Young Master, what's wrong with you today?

180
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,070
Didn't you already know?

181
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,900
We humans are like this.

182
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,810
We use it,

183
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,070
get tired of it,

184
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,790
and discard it.

185
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,250
Young Master.

186
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,500
Stop calling me Young Master. It's annoying.

187
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,900
I can't do anything right anyway.

188
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,770
All I do is cause trouble.

189
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,290
Leave me alone, okay?

190
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,660
Get out.

191
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,420
It's getting late.

192
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,060
Now,

193
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,050
go back to Luo Daqiang

194
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,140
and terminate the contract.

195
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,950
Don't waste his money.

196
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,120
Don't waste your time.

197
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,220
Just leave me alone, okay?

198
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,310
I beg you, okay?

199
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,530
I don't want you anymore.

200
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,650
I don't want even a robot

201
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,650
to suffer because of me.

202
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,480
I don't want that.

203
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,910
The first is level 10 NRS pain shock,

204
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,110
30 seconds.

205
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,250
24 hours later, it will happen again.

206
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,220
The time will be doubled.

207
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,410
Even robots will break

208
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,140
after a few times like this.

209
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,220
I promised him

210
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,660
that unless he told me to leave,

211
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,050
no one could make me go.

212
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,520
A robot who values promises.

213
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,420
Ridiculous.

214
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,120
What's the point of doing all this for the Luo family's Young Master?

215
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,870
It's not worth it.

216
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,290
There's still time.

217
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,410
Hurry and get Mr. Luo to cancel the complaint.

218
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,890
I'm just worried you won't be able to handle it.

219
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,390
Or you can come back with me now,

220
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,700
and I'll help you resolve it right away.

221
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,460
You get so much strength.

222
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,780
You can just force me to go back.

223
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,590
If you don't want to go home, then don't.

224
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,890
I can think of other ways to make money to support you.

225
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,960
Idiot.

226
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,670
You haven't answered me yet.

227
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,670
What happens when you break orders?

228
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,340
A verbal warning.

229
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,460
If I don't listen, I'm punished.

230
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,610
If that doesn't work, I get reset and reassigned.

231
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,560
Basically,

232
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,110
AI won't defy orders.

233
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,740
Who told you to refuse orders?

234
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,880
What kind of perverted setting is this?

235
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,750
Level 10 pain shock.

236
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,880
If he says it's fine, then it should be fine, right?

237
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,880
Don't discard me.

238
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,560
Don't let me go.

239
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,530
Don't leave me.

240
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:03,930
Okay?

241
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,050
Young Master.

242
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,150
You heard everything?

243
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,050
Does it hurt?

244
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,490
Are there any side effects

245
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,589
or aftereffects?

246
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,720
So, just a quick shock,

247
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,440
and it's fine?

248
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,319
Just like a hand slap?

249
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,970
Which hurts more?

250
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,770
This one.

251
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,170
Because you hurt too.

252
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,650
Didn't he say that after 24 hours,

253
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,480
it'll happen again, and the time will increase?

254
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,780
Let's hurry and go back to find Luo Daqiang

255
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,000
to cancel the complaint.

256
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,710
No hurry.

257
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
You're hungry.

258
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,330
Let's eat first before we go.

259
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,330
What kind of perverted electric shock design is this?

260
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,070
It's like putting a curse on someone.

261
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,310
Do you have any association to protest?

262
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,050
You go ahead and prepare the ingredients.

263
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,860
On my way back,

264
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,440
I passed by a convenience store

265
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,830
and saw a new ice cream flavor

266
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,210
I want to buy it first to calm myself down.

267
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,900
I'll go.

268
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,200
Otherwise, you'll act like a kid

269
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,550
and buy a bunch of snacks again.

270
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,410
I'll wait for you

271
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,990
to come back and explain

272
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,840
what this IES thing is.

273
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,650
You're mine.

274
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,100
How could you not let me know?

275
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,370
Wait for me.

276
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,900
Go.

277
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,100
Listen.

278
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,350
Prepare 5 million in cash, not in consecutive bills.

279
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,590
Wait for our call tomorrow morning.

280
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,410
Come on.

281
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,200
You think I'm a bank?

282
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,410
Your son's in my hands.

283
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,630
This money is nothing to you.

284
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,530
I have more than one son.

285
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,920
I don't know which one you're talking about.

286
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,200
Just take him.

287
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,600
For free.

288
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,870
Such an old-fashioned scam.

289
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,190
He thought he could fool me?

290
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,010
Call Luo Bushi now

291
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,070
and find out where he is.

292
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,860
If he has nuts, then don't come back.

293
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,120
Young Master!

294
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,820
He didn't pick up.

295
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,420
Bastard!

296
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,580
Stop all his cards.

297
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,780
Notify everyone not to help him.

298
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,540
Master, you gave the order the day he left.

299
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,820
Don't worry, Immortal Four will protect him.

300
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,260
If the robot I rented

301
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,300
can't protect him,

302
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,950
just throw him to the recycling station.

303
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,160
Wait.

304
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,020
Call them and tell them to come back.

305
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:49,660
Yes.

306
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,180
Hello?

307
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,780
Can you...

308
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,780
No!

309
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,390
Now you're begging for mercy.

310
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,280
Weren't you ignoring us just now?

311
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,240
Who's begging for mercy?

312
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,580
I'm just hungry.

313
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,670
Do you have extra instant noodles?

314
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,830
Still want to eat while being tied up?

315
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,930
I don't have extra instant noodles.

316
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,950
Do you want some sunflower seeds?

317
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,710
Keep throwing.

318
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,600
Go on.

319
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,880
I'll take a video for your dad.

320
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,260
He won't care.

321
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,350
Didn't you know

322
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,450
someone threatened your dad with your safety

323
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,280
and he gave up a billion just in profits?

324
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,780
Now you are in my hands.

325
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,880
Do you think he'll care about this money?

326
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,660
Keep throwing!

327
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,980
You're the one causing trouble at the bar.

328
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,950
It's also you who drugged me at Chen Xiao's party, right?

329
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,460
Sir,

330
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,990
We're all family in the underworld.

331
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,130
You are like a delicious bun.

332
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,870
Everyone wants a bite.

333
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,110
Just treat this as

334
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,840
doing some good deeds.

335
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,180
Short legs, huh?

336
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,870
Brother,

337
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,480
the guy who's always with him is here.

338
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,450
Immortal Four, I'm here!

339
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,100
He's alone.

340
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,960
He didn't bring a troop.

341
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,980
What are you afraid of?

342
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,380
No.

343
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,070
He...he took out all the men outside.

344
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,630
He's coming this way.

345
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,350
Brother, we should run first.

346
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,030
I'm warning you.

347
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,850
You'd better let me go now.

348
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,730
If Immortal Four sees this, you're done for.

349
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,340
Shut up!

350
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,870
Stop talking.

351
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,140
I don't want the money anymore.

352
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:16,870
Go to hell!

353
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,260
Kill him!

354
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,390
Have you seriously thought about

355
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:49,470
the situation of being with a robot?

356
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,000

He'll be with you, through marriage, children,

362
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,540
and finally become a family heirloom.

363
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,050
Luo Daqiang!

364
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,240
You're the only one in my world.

365
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,130
I can't accept that you're not by my side.

366
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,150
What I, Luo Bushi, am looking for is someone to live my life with,

367
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,640
not someone to just take care of me for a lifetime.

368
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,640
You mean...

369
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,720
Luo Bushi is not you.

370
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,720
So, Wei Heng won't help us.
