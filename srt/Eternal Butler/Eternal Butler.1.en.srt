1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,400
Young Master, you're back.

2
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:07,000
Employer information confirmed.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,900
Mission begins.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,367
I worked so hard to
get you into that school.

5
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:15,333
Why did you have to
insult the vice principal?

6
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,067
Schools like that,

7
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,267
you can just breeze through them.

8
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:20,133
You don't even take college seriously.

9
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:22,000
How do you expect people
to see you in the future?

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,967
You didn't finish more than middle school,

11
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:24,233
and you're doing great.

12
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,700
I'm just following your example.

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,200
Bushi.

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,400
And you dare talk to me like this?

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,733
Why wouldn't I?

16
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,167
I'm your father.

17
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:32,300
Mom left, your son turned bad,

18
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,533
what a stellar job you've done as a father.

19
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:39,900
Sir.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,200
The Ever unit is here.

21
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,900
"Eternal Butler"

22
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,800
(Episode 1: From Now On, He's Your Problem)

23
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's review the law of supply and demand.

24
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,800
What's the key point?

25
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:55,433
Look at that guy.

26
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:56,967
He transferred in yesterday.

27
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,400
I heard he got expelled
from his last school.

28
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,133
(Bushi Lo, 20 years old, 180 cm, 68 kg, O-type,
Leo) Even got kicked out for gang fights.

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,900
(Comes from a wealthy family)

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,100
(Really?)

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,300
(I heard he lives in a mansion)

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,600
What's the point of money?
I heard he's a troublemaker.

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,800
(Who cares? He's hot!)

34
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,400
(Single or taken?)

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,233
So why did we accept him?

36
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,167
We're a prestigious school, after all.

37
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,033
Prestigious schools need money,

38
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:17,200
not talent.

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,833
Students should know their place.

40
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,267
Don't embarrass yourself

41
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:28,300
or the parents who
worked so hard to raise you.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,033
Or maybe just don't embarrass
the broke vice principal.

43
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:40,733
Relax.

44
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,800
I know you took my dad's
money and have to deal with me.

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,133
I won't make things hard for you.

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,233
Thanks for the guidance,
professor. I've learned a lot.

47
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,667
I'll be heading out now.

48
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,167
What's with the attitude?

49
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,300
You're the vice principal,

50
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,833
my son's just a bit more casual.

51
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,667
I've donated so much money,

52
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,833
even upgraded your office.

53
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:08,167
Don't take it personally.

54
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:10,433
Yeah.

55
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:13,267
How about this, I'll
treat you to some tuna.

56
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:15,067
Top-grade stuff.

57
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,833
Alright, alright.

58
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,100
Another call from the lawyer.

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,633
It's about Young Master trashing
that nightclub with his friends.

60
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,367
Seriously?

61
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:25,733
What he really wants
to trash is probably me.

62
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,667
Don't bother me with compensation issues.

63
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,900
That's what we have
lawyers for. So annoying.

64
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:35,067
He used to be a gifted student.

65
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:36,567
Then everything changed after senior year.

66
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,367
Skipping classes, sneaking
out, spending nights at bars.

67
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:40,067
Why?

68
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,733
Who knows? Oh, and
his parents got divorced.

69
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,100
So what?

70
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,600
Divorce is no big deal these days.

71
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,133
Haven't you watched soap operas?

72
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,433
You're not leaving this house.

73
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,733
Once you married in, you belonged to us,

74
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,100
to both me and my son.

75
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,692
Let Mom go, okay?

76
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,200
Be good on your own.

77
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,867
Don't drag me down with you.

78
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:13,167
Having a son like you...

79
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:14,933
I can't even hold my head high.

80
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:18,967
Some people...

81
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:22,167
their existence is just trouble.

82
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:24,200
And if they disappeared,

83
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,833
no one would care.

84
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:33,667
Hello, this is Daqiang.

85
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:36,600
Last time, you mentioned your
company produces those robots.

86
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,600
Send me one.

87
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,300
I need to test it out for you.

88
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,300
Make it like Bruce Lee,

89
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,500
able to "A-da!" you know?

90
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,333
Kung fu style. Yes, yes, exactly.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,900
Principles? What principles?

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,567
Didn't you say last time,
"Money rules the world"?

93
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:53,000
This isn't cutting in line.

94
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,800
This is an urgent request.

95
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,100
As the commander of the Hengren series,

96
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,633
during this reboot,

97
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,267
you shouldn't resist,

98
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:07,933
let alone encourage
others to cause trouble.

99
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:09,633
I believe

100
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:12,300
there's no need to add a
central electric shock system.

101
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,533
The NRS Level-10 Pain Punishment mechanism

102
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:17,333
is unnecessary for the Ever series.

103
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,567
It's just a reminder to prevent mistakes.

104
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,567
But it's disrespectful and
distrustful of the Evers.

105
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:25,333
Respect? Trust?

106
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:26,833
That's hilarious.

107
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:29,567
Ever-9 is a perfect example
of being out of control.

108
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,167
In the future, any unruly behavior,

109
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:33,767
any refusal to obey,

110
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,133
just a quick "zap" will do.

111
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,433
Warning?

112
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:38,900
Right and wrong should
not be decided by humans.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,900
Enough, Unit 4.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,733
Humans don't need to
discuss these things with AI.

115
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,500
You're just products

116
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,033
created to meet our needs.

117
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,233
You're just slightly more
advanced merchandise.

118
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,333
Robot rights?

119
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:53,467
I don't accept that.

120
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,867
Oh, so you want to
advocate for robot rights?

121
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,967
Since you're so opinionated,

122
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,300
I'll give you a chance.

123
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,233
The central electric shock system,

124
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,500
IES (Inner Electric Shock),

125
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,067
will be installed on you.

126
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,700
Let's see if it's truly necessary.

127
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,500
The highest level of security, huh?

128
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,533
I think

129
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:23,700
being a bodyguard and servant

130
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,333
for some nouveau riche
family suits you just fine.

131
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,867
Though it might be a bit
of a waste of your talents.

132
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,267
Young Master, you're back.

133
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:39,833
You're so young,

134
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,100
why the long face all the time?

135
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,100
What have I done to offend you so much?

136
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,000
Murder? Arson? Robbery?

137
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,367
Drug dealing? Kidnapping? Extortion?

138
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:51,633
Having a son like you,

139
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,133
I can't even hold my head up.

140
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,067
Isn't it enough for you

141
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,167
to hold your head up in front of women?

142
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:56,600
Bushi.

143
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,833
And you dare speak to me like this?

144
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:59,133
Why wouldn't I?

145
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:00,500
I'm your father.

146
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,667
Mom left, your son went bad,

147
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,533
you've really outdone yourself as a father.

148
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,600
Sir... Sir... The Ever unit is here.

149
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:18,267
Don't let him get away.

150
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:19,500
Young Master, my apologies.

151
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,900
Throw him in the room.

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,133
Who are you? Let me go.

153
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:23,959
I am the Ever Unit Intelligence Product 4,

154
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:25,033
called Ever-4.

155
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,867
A robot? Daqiang, are you insane?

156
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,033
Hiring a bodyguard and calling him a robot?

157
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:29,333
Do you think I'm a child?

158
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:30,300
Got too much money to burn?

159
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,567
Why not donate it to charity
and earn some karma?

160
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:33,167
If money is so powerful,

161
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:34,400
why couldn't it keep my mom?

162
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,900
And now it can't keep me either, can it?

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,800
How dare you talk back to me.

164
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,333
Sir, no need to trouble
yourself. Leave him to me.

165
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,033
Let me go.

166
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,700
This robot... it's just like a real human.

167
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,100
Just as they claimed.

168
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,267
Technology is truly amazing.

169
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,100
Let me go.

170
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,833
He's ridiculously strong.

171
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,500
Apologies, Young Master.

172
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,200
It got it dirty.

173
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,133
Take it off.

174
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:29,267
A bodyguard is one thing,

175
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,733
but why pretend to be a robot?

176
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,200
Not pretending.

177
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,367
I am a robot.

178
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,100
A robot like this?

179
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,133
I am 100% humanoid bionic.

180
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:47,000
AI technology is highly advanced now.

181
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,867
So no, I'm not the kind of robot

182
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:50,867
you're thinking of.

183
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:53,433
How did Lo Daqiang get you?

184
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,967
From HengJi Intelligence Technology.

185
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,767
The Ever series has nine models.

186
00:08:57,867 --> 00:08:59,067
I'm Model 4.

187
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,733
Lo Daqiang is my employer.

188
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,567
I am currently in the
testing phase, Level 3.

189
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:08,840
Robots can bleed?

190
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:11,967
It simulate

191
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,767
all human functions,

192
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:19,233
including blood vessels, blood
flow, and body temperature.

193
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:23,100
What's the point of this gimmick?

194
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,333
The wound is small.

195
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:33,100
The blood loss is only 10cc.

196
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,833
No need for a bandage.

197
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:36,533
Who's worried?

198
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:37,833
I'm just concerned about breaking you.

199
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,800
Daqiang would make me pay for it.

200
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:42,100
4.

201
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,300
4.

202
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,500
Stay in the room, Young Master.

203
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,567
Go on, go on.

204
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:49,900
After all, he's your real boss.

205
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:10,033
All the people I hired before
were driven away by him.

206
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,133
So this time, I got a robot.

207
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:13,833
I figured at least you wouldn't

208
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:16,833
scare it off or make it quit.

209
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:20,233
I even paid extra to jump
the queue and get you.

210
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,500
You'd better make me feel
like it's worth every penny.

211
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,633
It's still the trial period now,

212
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,067
so if I'm not satisfied,

213
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,400
I'll be filing a complaint.

214
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,467
Your duties are simple.

215
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:32,967
First,

216
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,933
make sure he's home by 10 p.m.

217
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,033
Second,

218
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:38,700
make him read for two hours a day.

219
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,100
An empty brain

220
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,133
won't accomplish anything.

221
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,400
Third,

222
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,833
report back whenever he goes out.

223
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,833
If he stirs up trouble outside,

224
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:51,433
I'll be holding you accountable.

225
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:53,800
Got it?

226
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,233
No issues, right?

227
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,400
With all due respect,

228
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,233
isn't your son already 18?

229
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:04,300
So,

230
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,267
as far as I know,

231
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:07,367
both legally and socially,

232
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,400
your son is entitled

233
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,000
to exercise his free will.

234
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,533
A robot lecturing me on morality?

235
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,000
Just focus on meeting my demands.

236
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,800
It really is a robot.

237
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,067
Looks so realistic.

238
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,967
No one's here.

239
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,667
Young Master.

240
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,567
Darts can be dangerous.

241
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,267
If I were an ordinary human,

242
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,067
I might have gotten hurt.

243
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,900
Daqiang really thinks highly of me,

244
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,067
hiring such a high-end robot

245
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,433
just to manage me.

246
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,100
Well done.

247
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,933
You're just doing your job.

248
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:29,100
I might as well take advantage of it.

249
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,500
So it doesn't matter how I treat you.

250
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:44,733
Pardon me.

251
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:49,267
My employer is Mr. Daqiang.

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,433
If there's a conflict of
opinion between you two,

253
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,100
I will prioritize his directives

254
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:03,267
over anything else.

255
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,333
Nice body.

256
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:14,733
Part of your design.

257
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,100
Everything that's needed

258
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:25,800
is included.

259
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:28,967
But no touching.

260
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:30,767
Or watching.

261
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,367
Being an employer doesn't mean
you can do whatever you want.

262
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:40,867
Oh?

263
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,233
I'm a responsible employer.

264
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,433
Tell me,

265
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:49,600
what's off-limits?

266
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:58,633
My glasses.

267
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't touch my glasses.

268
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,933
Especially don't take them off.

269
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:12,067
What, can't see without them?

270
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,700
What kind of setting is this?

271
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,300
Hilarious.

272
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,067
As I believe you've already clearly heard,

273
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,367
I have specific tasks to follow.

274
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:21,933
Let's move on to the second one.

275
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,300
What do you mean "we"?

276
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,767
What are we, grade-schoolers?

277
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,633
If you want to read, read by yourself.

278
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,400
Good night.

279
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,900
So annoying.

280
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:48,533
Young Master, my apologies.

281
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:52,000
Let me go.

282
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,533
Let me go.

283
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,333
Face-changing like Sichuan Opera.

284
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:08,900
What happens if I "accidentally"

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,400
knock off your glasses?

286
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,800
What?

287
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,233
Let's talk this out.

288
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,700
It's just taking off glasses.

289
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:32,767
Didn't I tell you...

290
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:34,733
Don't.

291
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,900
Do it.

292
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:39,600
I should be saying, "Don't do it."

293
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,133
In my database,

294
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,133
any disobedient entity

295
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:47,967
can be disciplined.

296
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:49,667
Let me go.

297
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,800
Whether it's a kitten, a puppy,

298
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,333
or a little lion.

299
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,433
Even my little Young
Master is no exception.

300
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,800
Let go of me.

301
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,633
It's fine if you don't
understand the rules.

302
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:13,967
I have all the time in the world

303
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:16,967
to slowly

304
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:17,867
train you.

305
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:23,667
What?

306
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,333
I refuse.

307
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,367
No problem.

308
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:48,600
In that case, Young Master,

309
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,100
I'll read it to you, word by word.

310
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:01,467
ECFA, Economic Cooperation.

311
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,733
Framework Agreement,

312
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,667
Free Trade Agreement,

313
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:06,533
The Association of

314
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,133
Southeast Asian...

315
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,633
You can choose to listen obediently,

316
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:17,833
or...

317
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:21,500
Fine, I'll listen.

318
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,633
But can we make a deal?

319
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,333
Put your glasses back on first.

320
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,733
Young Master.

321
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,300
I hope I didn't hurt you.

322
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:04,367
Next time, don't knock off my glasses.

323
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,567
Young Master,

324
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:17,700
let's move to the next page.

325
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:27,900
Anything else I can assist you with?

326
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,600
Let's each take a stab.

327
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,133
If Mom's not dead,

328
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:44,200
let her go, okay?

329
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,733
Live your life properly on your own.

330
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,833
Stop dragging me down.

331
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:49,900
Had a nightmare.

332
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,833
You weren't spying on
me at the door, were you?

333
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:08,000
Always hovering around
gives me a lot of pressure.

334
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,900
Please don't let your presence

335
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,533
interfere with my life.

336
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,200
My previous clients

337
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,000
trusted me completely.

338
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,567
Why do you reject me so much, Young Master?

339
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:23,267
After your work is done, you just leave.

340
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:24,867
Why bother trusting you?

341
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,933
So, you're saying...

342
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,467
you're afraid I'll leave?

343
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:33,767
Stop flattering yourself.

344
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:35,400
If Daqiang isn't satisfied,

345
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,133
he'll return you.

346
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:39,167
Then you'll end up unwanted and sold off.

347
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:41,167
Understand?

348
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,667
These days, we just
have to rely on ourselves.

349
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,600
We...

350
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:48,933
shouldn't interfere with each other.

351
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,367
Interfere?

352
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:00,233
What do you mean?

353
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,933
You'll be thrown away if you aren't needed.

354
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:07,333
The 10 p.m. curfew...

355
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,300
This robot insists on it.

356
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:16,400
My insistence comes from

357
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,000
my employer's instructions.

358
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,833
Service above all, mission accomplished.

359
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:24,100
Go slice a fruit platter for me.

360
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,400
Like the kind they serve in hotels.

361
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:38,267
Too bad... This thing isn't mine.

362
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:40,033
Intead,

363
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,300
it's here to manage me.

364
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:55,500
I thought life was just this mundane.

365
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,767
Well,

366
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:01,967
but then he showed up,

367
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:04,033
And everything

368
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:05,333
started to change.

369
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:11,533
You'll always be my little Young Master.

370
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:19,900
(Next Episode)
Is he difficult to get along with?

371
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,300
His logic is unusual.

372
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,733
I can't accurately judge him.

373
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,833
Is it okay to be touched like that?

374
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:28,200
When dealing with people,
you need to be sincere.

375
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,467
If it's possible,

376
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:32,000
I wanna be in the classroom with you.

377
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:34,433
Before confirming Young
Master's behavior patterns

378
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:35,833
in areas outside my view,

379
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:37,867
I must stay prepared for any needs.

380
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:39,833
These are the "needs," huh?

381
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:41,633
It's rare for you to let
someone manage you like this.

382
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:44,100
Is he the nurturing type,

383
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,933
or more into hands-on restraint?
