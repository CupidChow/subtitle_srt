00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,040
(Eternal Butler)

2
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,000
(Mission 6: I'm your unique existence)

3
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,400
What was

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,530
your previous work like?

5
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,460
Were you always this close with your employers?

6
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,470
I usually stood outside, waiting for orders.

7
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:17,100
Every day was the same:

8
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,870
the employer’s office, residence, and my room.

9
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,400
If there was an outing, I’d go first to handle security checks

10
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,710
and then accompany as an escort.

11
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,000
That sounds so boring.

12
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,500
Seems like I’ve brought some fun into your life.

13
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,500
Exactly, that’s why you’re special.

14
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,000
How am I special?

15
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,300
Special means unique, and different from others.

16
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,860
Young Master, you’re not like other people.

17
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,000
You’re not just data I was programmed to remember,

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,180
I consciously choose to keep you in my memory.

19
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,200
Of course, I’m just that amazing.

20
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,329
Indeed, you are the best.

21
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,760
Careful.

22
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,800
Where are you taking me?

23
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,890
I’m quite particular, you know.

24
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,030
I’m so tired of

25
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,190
those over-the-top birthday parties.

26
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,079
They drag on for an entire month every time.

27
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,810
Fine, you go by yourself. I won’t stop you.

28
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,870
Hold my hand properly and walk carefully.

29
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,060
You’re a grown-up.

30
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,340
Stop acting like a child.

31
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,800
Who’s acting like a child?

32
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,110
The way you’re holding my hand feels more childish, okay?

33
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,180
Weren’t you going to let me go?

34
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,690
Then why are you holding on so tightly?

35
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,829
I’m taking you to a place that’s lively, fun,

36
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,500
relaxing, carefree, and healthy.

37
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,800
When you’re with me,

38
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,300
I hope you feel at ease and can be yourself.

39
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,780
Didn’t you say guards are supposed to stay one step behind?

40
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,780
I looked it up. Guards should walk a step behind

41
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,260
and companions need to stay at your side.

42
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,190
(Claw Everything)

43
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,040
Lively, fun, relaxing, carefree and healthy…
(Claw Everything)

44
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,380
Lively, fun, relaxing, carefree and healthy…

45
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,490
And you brought me to a night market?

46
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,570
You’ve never been to a place like this, have you?

47
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,650
Why would I come to such a crowded,

48
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,020
noisy, and unsanitary place?

49
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,899
Just follow me.

50
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,700
Look.

51
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,200
According to the data,

52
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,390
going to a night market with someone you like and playing balloon-shooting games

53
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,180
is a great way to showcase your charm.

54
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,290
You’re in my circle, and I’m in yours.

55
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,930
I recommend standing behind him, with an arm around him

56
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,500
to strengthen intimacy.

57
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,380
Which one would you like?

58
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,190
Your boyfriend is amazing, he hits the target in one go.

59
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,230
Here, it's yours.

60
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,270
I’m so hungry.

61
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,120
(Claw Monsters)
I’m so hungry.

62
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,000
We can buy one.

63
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,750
No, I want to eat this one.

64
00:05:51,250 --> 00:06:07,810
♫Happy Birthday to You♫

65
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,900
Happy birthday, Young Master.

66
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,580
You haven’t made a wish.

67
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,680
What’s the point of wishing for something that won’t come true?

68
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,510
I used to go through the motions,

69
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,650
but from this year on, forget it.

70
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,800
What?

71
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,820
Isn’t this how people usually do it?

72
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,390
Do what?

73
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,030
Like this.

74
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,620
The demo video from Immortal Nine

75
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,510
showed this way.

76
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,070
He said since I don’t understand romance,

77
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,430
I should just follow the script.

78
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,530
People who are romantic do so because they’re in a relationship.

79
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,430
What is our relationship?

80
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,860
I’m yours.

81
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,880
You can do whatever you want.

82
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,080
Do you know when your activation date is?

83
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,710
What do you want to do with me?

84
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,810
I just want to celebrate your birthday.

85
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,460
No need.

86
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:52,990
Why?

87
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,920
Artificial intelligence doesn’t need birthdays like humans.

88
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,030
But I want to celebrate your birthday.

89
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,670
This is your exclusive memories.

90
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,190
I am the only one

91
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,460
who celebrates your birthday in this world.

92
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,500
This is exclusive to me.

93
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,540
You can’t ask someone else to celebrate for you.

94
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,000
There is no “next.”

95
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,460
You’re my only Young Master.

96
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,120
Unless you kick me out.

97
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,570
No wonder people say

98
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,049
holidays make dopamine levels go wild.

99
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,720
Even though I know you’re just saying nice things,

100
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,070
but

101
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,060
I appreciate it.

102
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,170
What’s this kiss for?

103
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,030
Birthday kiss.

104
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,230
You don’t like it?

105
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,730
Or do you want me to activate the extra function

106
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,900
to make this birthday gift more interesting,

107
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,220
to let you do whatever you want?

108
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,350
Even though I’ve used that function before,

109
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,380
it wasn’t my intention.

110
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,040
Do you understand?

111
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,520
This is what the data means by "saying one thing but meaning another".

112
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,810
Forget it.

113
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,840
Anyway, don’t bring this up again in the future.

114
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,840
Wei Heng once said that

115
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,590
robots are like humans.

116
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,340
Artificial intelligence has advanced to the point where it’s more human-like.

117
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,680
If even AI

118
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,710
can’t escape this predetermined setting,

119
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,920
don’t talk to me about the future.

120
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,070
What if I take it seriously?

121
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,040
I’ll stay by your side, Young Master.

122
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,760
Don’t forget,

123
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,690
you activated my extra function,

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,940
so you have to take responsibility.

125
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,620
He wants to propose? Impossible.

126
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,510
That’s too advanced.

127
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,520
Can a robot marry a human?

128
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,120
Well, even if cross-species relationships become the trend in the future,

129
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,830
I’m still so young.

130
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,180
But early marriage has its benefits.

131
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,230
But it’s a male.

132
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,510
I can't say it’s a robot,

133
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,260
but it won’t age either.

134
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,760
How will we face the public?

135
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,250
I’ll probably get beaten to death by Luo Daqiang first.

136
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,110
When I wasn’t around, I had no idea what would happen.

137
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,110
But in the future, I’ll protect you completely.

138
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,610
Forever for you.

139
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,570
Happy Birthday, my Young Master.

140
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,890
I don’t lie, unlike humans.

141
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,330
So, from now on,

142
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,990
I’ll stay by your side,

143
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,800
following you wherever you go,

144
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,950
forever.

145
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,510
Until my body is destroyed,

146
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,580
I’ll stay by your side

147
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,260
and walk with you to the end of the earth.

148
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,510
So, this bracelet was made by you?

149
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,630
I got materials and tools

150
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,340
from former military industry colleagues to make this.

151
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,130
Is that a shell casing or some kind of titanium?

152
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,520
I can’t imagine you making this by hand.

153
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,620
Do you have any photos?

154
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,070
Good night, my little Young Master.

155
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,190
Don’t go patrolling in the middle of the night.

156
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,280
Until my body is destroyed,

157
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,080
I’ll stay by your side

158
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,480
and walk with you to the end of the earth.

159
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,220
Why do I feel like I’ve seen this line before?

160
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
A novel,

161
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,540
an anime,

162
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,800
or a movie?

163
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,900
You stayed up really late yesterday?

164
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,270
The culprit.

165
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,210
You said yesterday

166
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,840
that you would follow me wherever I go,

167
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,800
forever.

168
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,960
Even if your body is destroyed,

169
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,180
you’ll never leave my side

170
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,390
and will walk with me to the end of the earth.

171
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,310
Was that from your heart,

172
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,710
or did you watch some movies?

173
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,360
Since I didn’t understand,

174
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,460
I consulted a professional.

175
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,050
He recommended a butler series.

176
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,790
I accompany my professor,

177
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,900
and you accompany your Young Master.

178
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,580
What a special encounter.

179
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,570
I wanted to celebrate Young Master’s birthday. How should I do it?

180
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,740
When we were entering life ritual data before,

181
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,090
who was the one who said he was afraid of taking up memory space

182
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,340
and secretly skipped it?

183
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,520
Why are you

184
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,600
being so considerate of the employer this time?

185
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,730
The previous employers didn’t need my concern,

186
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,190
but this one is different.

187
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,990
Whenever I’m not around, he gets into trouble.

188
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,250
He’s hard to please and doesn’t listen to me.

189
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,580
But sometimes, when I act a little more assertive,

190
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,270
he’ll obediently compromise.

191
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,640
By human standards,

192
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,770
he’s a bit of a masochist and tsundere.

193
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,770
Is your professor like this too?

194
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,110
He...

195
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,800
He’s not like that.

196
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,030
My Ping is very kind to me.

197
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,750
I have many recorded videos of us.

198
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,260
Do you want to see them?

199
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,640
No need, I’m fine.

200
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,500
Open your system, and I'll send them to you.

201
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,180
No need.

202
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,470
It’s okay, I have them in my phone.

203
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,770
Here, take a look.

204
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,610
These are pictures from when we went out together.

205
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,580
And videos too.

206
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,070
Are you happy?

207
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,910
Happy.

208
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,750
You actually use this emotional term,

209
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,210
happy.

210
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,910
Actually, I don’t even know how to explain it.

211
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,570
I just feel that

212
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,290
as long as I’m with him,

213
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,510
I start to feel reluctant to let the day end,

214
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,350
yet I begin to look forward to tomorrow.

215
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,150
It’s like

216
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,630
a plant that has soaked up enough water

217
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,420
and is waiting for the sunlight.

218
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,750
It’s okay if you don’t understand.

219
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,500
Everyone

220
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,210
finds their own way to interact with others.

221
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,770
By the way,

222
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,860
have you seen a Japanese anime

223
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,150
called Black Butler. The main characters are Sebastian and His Young Master, Bo-chan.

224
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,770
It was hugely popular in Japan.

225
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,120
I highly recommend you watch it.

226
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,870
As for the gift,

227
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,300
I suggest you handcraft something and give it to him,

228
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
something he can carry with him,

229
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,510
so that whenever he sees it, he’ll think of you.

230
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,250
He told you to make this gift.

231
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,830
He taught you the storyline.

232
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,960
So none of it is from the heart.

233
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:39,890
It’s all just a summary of key phrases,

234
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,390
chosen at the right time.

235
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,430
You’ve made me live in this deliberately created idealized world.

236
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,790
What exactly do you want from me?

237
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,740
Because it’s you,

238
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,710
I’m trying to express my care for you.

239
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,790
So do you have any feelings for me?

240
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,520
Luo Bushi,

241
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,400
if people know that

242
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,579
you get happy and upset

243
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,990
because of a robot’s words and actions,

244
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,819
and even want to ask if the robot has feelings for you,

245
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,829
they’d probably laugh their heads off.

246
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,810
See, just like this.

247
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,730
He's full of deep affection and always touches me.

248
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,100
I’m just an ordinary person who has never been in love.

249
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,040
How could I not be moved?

250
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,790
Haven’t slept enough. I’ll catch up on sleep.

251
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,100
No class in the morning, don’t disturb me.

252
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,660
So Young Master, do you like it

253
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,070
or not?

254
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,690
Wait for me at home. Don’t go out.

255
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,210
It's the first time in the past few years

256
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,560
that you haven't spent your birthday with me.

257
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,660
Bu Shi, do you not love me anymore?

258
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,460
When we grow up, we can’t always cling to each other.

259
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,600
So, who did you spend yesterday with?

260
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,070
Don’t lie to me, you didn’t spend it alone.

261
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,910
I was with Immortal Four.

262
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,410
I knew it.

263
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,600
You’re the type to forget friends when there’s someone attractive around.

264
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,070
Should I go find a girlfriend?

265
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,490
Why look far away

266
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,620
when you have someone right in front of you?

267
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,080
Who could stand someone like you?

268
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,710
How can I date a robot?

269
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,690
Hey,

270
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,180
don't think that just because he's in your house

271
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,660
playing the role of a bodyguard or butler, you think he's unworthy of you..

272
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,790
Bushi, love shouldn’t have any class boundaries.

273
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,640
Or do you think it’s because he’s a male?

274
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,020
You are Luo Daqiang’s son,

275
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,390
would you care about these rumors?

276
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,180
You’re just pretending to understand.

277
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,430
It’s fine. I’ll hang up.

278
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,620
Do you have class today?

279
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,200
In the afternoon, but the professor is absent.

280
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,320
How many jobs do you have?

281
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,220
How much can you earn doing this?

282
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,080
Does your father owe a lot of money?

283
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,310
Where are you going later?

284
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,670
Let me take you.

285
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,020
I’m free today. I can accompany you.

286
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,830
Did anything happen to Luo Bushi

287
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,380
while I was away?

288
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,630
No.

289
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,720
No?

290
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,230
I told you to follow Luo Bushi around.

291
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,850
Why did he get drugged?

292
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,550
What’s the use

293
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,650
of a robot like you?

294
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
Why do you know, Master?

295
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:27,790
You didn’t take care of him,

296
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,180
and now you’re here lying to me with him.

297
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,810
You don't need to ask this.

298
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,970
So how did you

299
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,970
know about the drug thing?

300
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,270
I have a business dispute.

301
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,340
Someone told me

302
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,500
they planned to use my son

303
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,930
to humiliate me.

304
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,880
Told him not to run around,

305
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,360
and be careful not to stir up trouble.

306
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,140
You’re the one who messed things up, aren’t I the victim here?

307
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,290
Why are you talking as if I’m the one causing trouble?

308
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,390
Who was stupid enough to get drugged?

309
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,740
From now on, you’re not allowed to leave the house!

310
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,860
Why should I be grounded because of the mess you created?

311
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,460
It’s because of what you did to them

312
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,470
that they wanted to go after your son to humiliate you.

313
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,230
If you weren’t showing off so much

314
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,120
and acting so carelessly,

315
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,980
would they have targeted you?

316
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,170
Should I thank you for passing on

317
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,580
your bad behavior to me?

318
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,400
If you got drugged and photographed,

319
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,700
and they tried to use it to blackmail me, what should I do?

320
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,590
So, you’re worried

321
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,100
they’ll use my nude photos to blackmail you,

322
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,440
but not concerned about my safety.

323
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,120
Damn thing!

324
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,730
How could I not worry about you?

325
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,470
It doesn’t matter, anyway, I’m just a burden.

326
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,870
My mother didn’t dare divorce because of me back then,

327
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,200
and now my father

328
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,920
is also afraid that I’ll become leverage against him.

329
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,150
You agree with that, don’t you?

330
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,730
Until things are clear,

331
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,280
staying at home is safer.

332
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,640
Didn’t you say with you around, nothing would happen?

333
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,590
Alright, it’s all for my sake.

334
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,850
I’m so lucky.

335
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,060
So leisurely and still planning a date.

336
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,820
Why don’t you pay off your debts first?

337
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,500
I’ve been paying on time every month.

338
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,630
We have to urge you every month to pay the interest. What about the principal?

339
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,820
Do you think we’re here as friends having a gathering?

340
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,320
It’s his father’s debt.

341
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,720
Why are you relentlessly going after him?

342
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,120
This kid is nice.

343
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,940
Someone’s still protecting him.

344
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,510
He’s just a customer of the shop.

345
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,160
Don’t let my business affect others.

346
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,060
Take the money.

347
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,970
I'll pay this month's debt tomorrow.

348
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,500
Remember, next month, pay on time.

349
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,780
Why are you using money to send them off?

350
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,940
I don’t want to affect you.

351
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,220
That’s why I told you not to find me too often,

352
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,620
to avoid getting involved.

353
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,470
I’m not afraid.

354
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,830
I want to stay by your side.

355
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,930
Don't you feel suffocated?

356
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,280
Then just let me suffocate to death.

357
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,060
Why are you on Luo Daqiang’s side?

358
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,900
The first time, they caused trouble at the bar.

359
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,250
The second time, you were drugged.

360
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,490
Both were done by the same group.

361
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,890
It’s obvious that you’ve been targeted.

362
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,610
If Mr. Luo is right,

363
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,430
staying home is safer.

364
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,610
You said you'll be with me forever.

365
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:10,910
Just in case.

366
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,450
What if I’m not around?

367
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,260
What if I can’t get to you in time?

368
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:16,680
Young Master,

369
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,590
I cannot accept

370
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,870
that something will happen again under my protection.

371
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,110
This is something I bought for a charity.

372
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,390
I promised to send them pictures.

373
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,500
I was in a bad mood earlier.

374
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,440
Aren't you supposed to make me happy?

375
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,220
Put it on, take some photos.

376
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,920
Why aren't you wearing it?

377
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,490
I didn't tell you to leave.

378
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,620
Our settings

379
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,060
are programmed to be annoyed by cute, fluffy things.

380
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,090
I don’t like staying at home either.

381
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,270
If you fulfill my wish,

382
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,540
I promise not to run around.

383
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,580
Come here.

384
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,680
Little bunny, smile.

385
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,750
What’s wrong? Little bunny wants a carrot?

386
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,850
Wear this little beast.

387
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,920
No, it’s so ugly.

388
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,080
It’s really nice

389
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,920
to have someone accompanying you.

390
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,380
It’s great

391
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,900
that he can stay with me.

392
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,530
With the way you usually present yourself,

395
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,230
no wonder others wanted to mess with you.

I’ll just keep him tied to my side,

let’s see what you can do about it.

401
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,920
Inform everyone that no one is allowed to approach him.

Without money,

404
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
let’s see how he can earn a living.

405
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,460
We’re like a pair of star-crossed lovers, cast out together.

406
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,260
Young Master, you just want to monopolize me.

407
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,160
I’m not a tool.

408
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,690
And even if you get rich in the future,

409
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,570
you’re not allowed to buy another one.

410
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,310
A man should

411
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,100
handle his man's affairs.

412
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,800
Those two guys are in such a hurry.

413
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,370
This kind of thing can’t be delayed.
