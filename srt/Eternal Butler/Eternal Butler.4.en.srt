1
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,000
(Eternal Butler)

2
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,080
(Mission 4: I'll take responsibility for this)

3
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,560
You're home?

4
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,580
Yes.

5
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,360
What is my son doing?

6
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,960
He's studying.

7
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,780
What's that sound?

8
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,009
The thesis is too hard. He was just venting.

9
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,350
Listen.

10
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,940
Don't pretend to be studying at home.

11
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,490
I'll be back in two days.

12
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,800
Keep an eye on him.

13
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,860
Young Master.

14
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,220
Are you okay?

15
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,410
Here.

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,210
Hold me.

17
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,520
It's so comfortable.

18
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,360
It's hot.

19
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,390
Young Master.

20
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,670
Young Master.

21
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,120
You've gotten smarter.

22
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,640
Using system to communicate will be monitored.

23
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,340
It's safer to call directly.

24
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,740
If someone's been drugged with an aphrodisiac, how do you deal with it?

25
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,760
You?

26
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,430
Then that's fine.

27
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,270
The medicine will be metabolized directly.

28
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,460
It's not me. It's human.

29
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,360
If the dosage is high,

30
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,700
we might have to send him to the hospital.

31
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,850
But if the dosage is low,

32
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,760
it doesn't matter.

33
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,980
Just find an outlet for it.

34
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,770
You just need to...

35
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,500
Don't teach that.

36
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,270
I didn't.

37
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,810
Just help him to find an outlet for it.

38
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,829
Let me tell you, just...

39
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,520
It's inconvenient to tell you now.

40
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,430
I'll send you the information.

41
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,350
Immortal Nine, what information?

42
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:52,960
Well,

43
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,150
research materials.

44
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,850
Research?

45
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,560
I was just curious at first.

46
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,470
Like, in those videos,

47
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,380
are they in pain

48
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,250
or enjoying it?

49
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,500
Can you watch something normal?

50
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,360
Then I started to collect

51
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,830
all kinds of erotic games

52
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,890
to prevent falling into a rut.

53
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,490
Human love

54
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,750
is triggered by excessive secretion

55
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,040
of phenylethylamine,

56
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,310
which acts like a stimulant.

57
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,320
It will stop secreting after three months.

58
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,230
And over three years,

59
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,659
it completely fades.

60
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,770
How about we go home now

61
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,330
and test whether our phenylethylamine has faded?

62
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,350
OK?

63
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,890
OK.

64
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,260
Young Master.

65
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,500
Young Master, open your mouth.

66
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,250
Are you feeling better?

67
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,730
You've been drugged with an aphrodisiac.

68
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,830
Your body temperature rose by 2 degrees in 30 minutes.

69
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,180
Your blood pressure is 160 systolic and 100 diastolic.

70
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,460
You don't want to go to the hospital,

71
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,510
so I'll take care of it.

72
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,210
Immortal Four.

73
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,780
Aren't you going too far?

74
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,920
Cold water stimulates the human body

75
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,409
to trigger the fight-or-flight

76
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,510
and release stress hormones.

77
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,310
It lowers skin temperature quickly,

78
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,040
inducing cold shock response,

79
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,390
which clears the mind.

80
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,250
If I go into real shock?

81
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,680
Don't worry, your blood vessels are fine.

82
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,470
What do you want now?

83
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,980
What do you want me to do?

84
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,200
You can't take advantage of me.

85
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,880
I just want to take off your clothes.

86
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,940
It must be uncomfortable in wet clothes.

87
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,060
Weren't you the one who threw me in?

88
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,090
You kept struggling.

89
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,340
I thought...

90
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,360
Forget it. Help me up.

91
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,510
Soaking in cold water causes your blood vessels to constrict,

92
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,980
helping you quickly regain your senses.

93
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,730
But if even this doesn't work,

94
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,330
we have to find another way.

95
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,190
What is it?

96
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,659
What are you doing?

97
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,810
I'm telling you. I'm strong.

98
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,250
Come on, get up.

99
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,040
You'll catch a cold if you stay here too long.

100
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,360
Are you waiting for me to change your clothes?

101
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,039
You're so fussy.

102
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,120
Get me some ginger soup.

103
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,460
It's freezing.

104
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,860
Didn't we agree not to pat my head?

105
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,740
Why did you even get drugged?

106
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,230
Aren't they your friends?

107
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,660
Who knows?

108
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,910
Because I'm too handsome. They couldn't get me, so they resorted to dirty tricks.

109
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:19,980
Young Master.

110
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,080
You need to learn to protect yourself.

111
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,990
Okay, stop nagging.

112
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,630
Annoy your dad, upset your professors,

113
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,730
hang out at shady places with the wrong crowd,

114
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,340
does any of that actually make you happy?

115
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,640
Seeing them unhappy makes me happy.

116
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,540
Back then, I was too stupid,

117
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,260
always trying to meet their expectations. And what did I get?

118
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,650
A pat on the head, some applause,

119
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,610
and then they'd just walk away.

120
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,100
Might as well piss them off completely.

121
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,380
Young master, why do you hate yourself?

122
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,690
My mom married Luo Daqiang

123
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,050
just because of me.

124
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,700
Later, Luo Daqiang got rich

125
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,930
and started messing around with other women.

126
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,280
My mom couldn't leave this family because of me.

127
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,820
In the end,

128
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,560
while I was asleep,

129
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,410
she cut my hand,

130
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,990
and then, right in front of me, she slit her wrist,

131
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,620
crying and begging me to let her go.

132
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,780
Go. Just go.

133
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,270
I never tied you here anyway.

134
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,230
So you're doing this

135
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,740
to revenge on your father

136
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,300
or resent your mother?

137
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
If I've been a bad boy since I was young.

138
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,620
Young Master.

139
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,760
They can only stay and look after me.

140
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,980
They couldn't mess around

141
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,610
or just leave like they did.

142
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,420
Now,

143
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,610
my dad's worried that I won't get into school,

144
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,380
end up in some police station again,

145
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,200
or get sued by someone.

146
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,320
Isn't that perfect?

147
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,200
No, Young Master.

148
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,490
Humans have free will.

149
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,310
No one's departure

150
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,330
is something another person can decide.

151
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,350
It's the same even if they're related by blood.

152
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,780
So I deserve to be abandoned?

153
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,340
It doesn't matter.

154
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,200
A person like me...

155
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,080
Luo Bushi!

156
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,210
What have I told you before?

157
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,580
Don't say you're not good anymore.

158
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,720
Every human being

159
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,110
is unique in their existence.

160
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,620
Whether you're being unreasonable

161
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,640
or adorable.

162
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,870
you'll always be my young master.

163
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,690
You can do whatever you want if you're unhappy,

164
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,380
but don't be bad to yourself.

165
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,480
Understand?

166
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,110
I've had enough of you, Immortal Four.

167
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,920
Can you stop looking so innocent

168
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,140
and saying all this sentimental nonsense?

169
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,240
Don't think this will work on me forever.

170
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,290
What?

171
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,110
Even bodyguards now

172
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,710
specialize in sweet talk?

173
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,470
When time is up, you'll leave too.

174
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,000
You'll move on to the next employer

175
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,280
and tell them exactly what they want to hear.

176
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,430
Don't think I'm a fool.

177
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,110
All of you are the same.

178
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,450
The drug's effect is still there.

179
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,620
Maybe soak a little longer.

180
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,970
Having money is great, huh?

181
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,730
I can even buy extra services.

182
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,960
Shouldn't your job

183
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,550
include meeting your employer's needs?

184
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,210
Young Master.

185
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,590
The manual clearly states the extra features are unlocked.

186
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,580
Is it that

187
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,390
you haven't turned them on?

188
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:48,990
Young Master.

189
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,910
It's on.

190
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,490
We have the same body structure.

191
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,790
But I have no experience.

192
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,670
Can you handle it?

193
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,630
Young Master.

194
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,280
Calm down.

195
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,050
How am I supposed to calm down?

196
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,590
What drug?

197
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,849
You have to take responsibility for what you did.

198
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,560
What happened? I feel like I've been run over by a truck.

199
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,150
Guess you don't remember

200
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,090
the mess you got yourself into last night.

201
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,290
I remember you did this and that to me,

202
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
then this...

203
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,420
As your chief bodyguard,

204
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,100
I'm pretty familiar with your physical state.

205
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,620
I put you like this, this

206
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,750
and that.

207
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,150
That's perfect.

208
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,640
Hungover and dealing with the drug must be rough, huh?

209
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,390
I've had a hangover before.

210
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,370
I'm not talking about hangovers.

211
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,450
I mean the drug.

212
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,810
You remember who drugged you?

213
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,870
And why?

214
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,390
Didn't you already ask me this yesterday?

215
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,250
If I knew someone was gonna drug me,

216
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,640
would I come here?

217
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,110
It was an accident.

218
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,120
The two people who took you out last night

219
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,060
showed up at the bar before.

220
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,390
Do you remember?

221
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,180
Who's got time to remember passersbys?

222
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,960
If you don't know how to protect yourself,

223
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,030
you need to stay out of trouble.

224
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,260
What if I wasn't there?

225
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,470
Please stop reading.

226
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,050
It's my fault, OK?

227
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,170
I'm the one who takes loss, not you.

228
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,920
What? Afraid of getting points docked?

229
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,800
If we both don't say, who would know?

230
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,410
Bad judgment comes with consequences.

231
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,660
Want me to remind you?

232
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,890
Who was on top, who was on bottom? It doesn't matter.

233
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,030
Just think of it as meeting your employer's needs.

234
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,170
Sorry for treating you like a tool.

235
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,870
Tool?

236
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,880
So you're saying

237
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,710
anyone could've done the job?

238
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,540
Why do you care so much as a robot?

239
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,740
Fine. You think I'm not good enough?

240
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,130
I don't exactly have experience, okay?

241
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,840
Tell me, what do you want me to do?

242
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,890
Forget it. Doesn't even matter to you anyway.

243
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,030
Doesn't matter to me? Doesn't it matter to you either?

244
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,940
Young Master, maybe you forgot,

245
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,140
but I'm the one who should be taking responsibility here.

246
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,260
Young Master.

247
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,000
Be good.

248
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,480
OH MY GOD.

249
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,020
So I was the one who got…

250
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,570
Not him...

251
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,370
(Preview)

252
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,590
Hey, everyone trips up sometimes.

253
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,570
(Preview)

254
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,340
Young Master,
(Preview)

255
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,820
(Preview)

256
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,630
you were at it all night last night.
(Preview)

257
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,200
After all, this is your first time.

258
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,700
It wasn't my first time.

259
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,730
Zhou Zhenqun.

260
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,090
You don't need to be so considerate.

261
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,930
Immortal Four is a loyal puppy.

262
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,930
He treats you so well.

263
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,500
Why don't you just be together?

264
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,850
Return? Don't even think about it!
