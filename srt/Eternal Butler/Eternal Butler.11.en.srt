1
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,000
(Eternal Butler)

2
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,020
(Mission 11: I Will Be Yours)

3
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,310
You know how much

4
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,840
I resent you, right?

5
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,760
Mom taught me to make tea.

6
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,670
I think it was in primary school.

7
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,180
I almost scalded myself.

8
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,820
She said it would help

9
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,160
with digestion and clear the alcohol after parties.

10
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,080
In the end, the only person who ever

11
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,150
drank the tea I made was my mom.

12
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,270
I hate that you're rich.

13
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,560
Because when men have money, they start to act all arrogant.

14
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,380
I hate that you're rich.

15
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,960
Because uneducated, newly rich people

16
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,079
always think they're so special.

17
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,230
I hate that you're rich.

18
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,930
Because everyone wants your money.

19
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,720
And me and my mom,

20
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,480
we're just parasites.

21
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,810
I didn't cut it myself.

22
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,660
My mom did it.

23
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,660
My wrist didn't hurt,

24
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,660
but my heart did.

25
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,760
That day, she held her bleeding hand

26
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,329
and cried, begging me to let her go.

27
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,270
Oh, that day,

28
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,880
you were at someone else's house.

29
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,410
So, you only know she tried to kill herself,

30
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,300
but you didn't know...

31
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,500
She killed me once too.

32
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,250
I didn't tell you then,

33
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,310
and I'm not telling you now to make you feel guilty.

34
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,500
I want to thank you

35
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,050
for bringing Immortal Four into my life.

36
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,180
Because of him, I finally felt

37
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,040
cared for and valued.

38
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,070
Robots are just programmed machines.

39
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,420
Don't let him fool you.

40
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,300
He's not human.

41
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,950
He's set that way.

42
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,510
Technology is so advanced now.

43
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,270
It's not just for you.

44
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,270
But I'm not easily fooled.

45
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,920
And besides, what does he want from me?

46
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,370
He just wants your money.

47
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,910
He gets you to spend on expensive things.

48
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,510
Do you realize that?

49
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,110
Dad.

50
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,860
In my whole life,

51
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,290
I've never asked you for anything.

52
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,320
And for the first time, I'm grateful you're rich.

53
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,750
You always say money can do everything,

54
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,330
except life and death.

55
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,830
If possible,

56
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,830
buy Immortal Four for me.

57
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,090
If it weren't for Immortal Four,

58
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,080
I might have lost my reputation,

59
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,790
even my limbs.

60
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,290
You'd probably have to come visit me in jail.

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,460
That Zhu Ziqing essay, "The Back of My Father",

62
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,350
or that song about fathers being like mountains...

63
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,020
To be honest, I've never felt your love.

64
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,390
The way you left my life

65
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,850
made me lose all faith in love.

66
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,690
And Immortal Four showed up.

67
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,010
When I turned around, he was always there.

68
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,120
You know nothing.

69
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,940
What is love?

70
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,350
I don't understand it either, and I can't explain it.

71
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,950
I just know that I want Immortal Four to stay by my side forever.

72
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,100
If you can help me, I'd be so grateful.

73
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,630
If not, I'll figure out another way,

74
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,120
no matter what it takes.

75
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,340
How are you going to date a robot?

76
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,740
He will still look like this after a few years.

77
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,360
How are you going to explain that to people?

78
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,510
Were you listening in?

79
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,120
I didn't need to.

80
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,420
Looks like I'll need to lower your hearing sensitivity.

81
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,409
Otherwise, I'll have no secrets left.

82
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,180
You can say whatever you want.

83
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,040
Thank you for trying to find a way to keep me.

84
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,790
Alright, let's face reality.

85
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,750
You can be bought.

86
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,630
But can I afford you?

87
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,470
If I can't buy you,

88
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,670
is there any way to steal you away?

89
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,610
And if I manage to buy you,

90
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,370
will that messed-up company

91
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,630
pull any more tricks?

92
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,919
What should we do?

93
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,260
I'm sorry.

94
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,300
If it weren't for me,

95
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,070
you wouldn't be in such a difficult spot.

96
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,100
If Hengji can make you forget all of this...

97
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,320
Are you suggesting

98
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,700
we get reset together?

99
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,430
You move on to the next client,

100
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,850
and I just forget you?

101
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,620
Should I let you rewrite my memory?

102
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,050
Perfect.

103
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,220
No memories,

104
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,630
nothing left to hold onto.

105
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,730
Immortal Four.

106
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,380
Tell me, is this really what you want?

107
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,180
Actually, this might

108
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,080
be better for him.

109
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,260
After all, he is human.

110
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,710
For an AI,

111
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,130
you don't care about other people's opinions.

112
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,770
Because you exist to serve.

113
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,770
But for your Young Master,

114
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,520
his "don't care" will make

115
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,990
his later life incredibly hard.

116
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,520
Immortal Four, is your existence

117
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,280
really worth him sacrificing his future for?

118
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,800
Why are you so upset?

119
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,200
No one's forcing you to stay.

120
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,300
Just leave.

121
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,220
That way, I won't have to spend my money

122
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,440
on someone who doesn't want to stay.

123
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,300
You think I want you to stay?

124
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,430
I don't want you to regret it.

125
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,830
It doesn't matter if you regret it.

126
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,490
At that point,

127
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,390
you can send me back to Hengji

128
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,200
or find someone else who wants me.

129
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,710
Just don't let it be like in the movies,

130
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,480
where they throw me in storage and waste me.

131
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,310
Or at least,

132
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,360
you can always recycle me

133
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,300
and sell my parts.

134
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,690
I'm sure I'm still worth something.

135
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,580
Shut up.

136
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,420
What ridiculous stuff are you searching for now?

137
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,240
Or did

138
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,980
Wei Heng threaten you?

139
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,870
You know what's valuable and funny about humans?

140
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,040
It's that they all have different ideas of what's "worth it."

141
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,800
What's precious is that

142
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,680
they'll throw everything away to get what they want.

143
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,870
What's funny is that

144
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,240
after throwing everything away,

145
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,670
no one can guarantee the result.

146
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:41,920
You said you're

147
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,720
a super advanced robot, right?

148
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,460
How can you let me regret it?

149
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,700
Be sent off, locked in storage,

150
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,180
taken apart, and sold?

151
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,580
How could you let yourself become that?

152
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,580
You should've told me in a very domineering way:

153
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,580
Young Master, are you not satisfied?

154
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,580
Have you forgotten your place?

155
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,520
Need me to tie you up

156
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,440
and remind you of my worth?

157
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,930
Mr. Luo, have some.

158
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,740
High-end.

159
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,940
Just a sip, it's 10,000 TWD.

160
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,820
I imagine Mr. Luo

161
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,780
is troubled now, thinking about

162
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,630
your child wanting to be with a robot.

163
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,150
Actually, before this,

164
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,750
there was another product in the Immortal series.

165
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,110
It ran off with a human.

166
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,750
And I—

167
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,030
I'm that human's uncle.

168
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,830
So, how could a human and a robot

169
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,190
possibly be together,

170
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,660
let alone in a romantic relationship?

171
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,800
Exactly.

172
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,080
But, you know, they're really happy now.

173
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,070
Mr. Luo, you've seen

174
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,460
the rapid development of AI

175
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,750
and how robots are becoming more human-like.

176
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,960
I have to confess, Mr. Luo...

177
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,380
I shouldn't have added so much

178
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
human emotion to the AI

179
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,990
just because I was lonely.

180
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,650
However,

181
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,040
the loneliness inside me

182
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,440
and the need to be understood

183
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,470
were just too strong.

184
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,210
Humans are humans. Robots can't replace them.

185
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,910
That's right.

186
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,450
But Mr. Luo...

187
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,900
regardless of age,

188
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,070
species, or race,

189
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,450
the one thing that can never

190
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,760
be replaced is emotion.

191
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,640
My nephew,

192
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,730
before he met the robot,

193
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,480
was a lifeless, soulless zombie.

194
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,930
But after the robot left,

195
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,470
he couldn't bear the pain, and it was like living hell for him.

196
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,310
I thought he was crazy.

197
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,630
But then I realized,

198
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,340
as parents, we always

199
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,730
restrict our children out of what we think is best.

200
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,240
Yet we never seem to do enough.

201
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,200
So, why not help them achieve

202
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,700
what they want while we still can?

203
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,470
At least that way, there won't be resentment later.

204
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,630
So, Mr. Luo...

205
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,910
(Agency Purchase Contract)

206
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,430
Please sign this and allow me
(Agency Purchase Contract)

207
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,950
to persuade Hengji

208
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,650
to make Immortal Four part of the Luo family.

209
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,650
We all know that

210
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,590
for Mr. Luo,

211
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,970
as long as money can solve the problem,

212
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,650
it's not a problem.

213
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,190
I'll go first this time.

214
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,170
What if you get taken out first?

215
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,430
Then promise me you'll finish the mission for me.

216
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,670
This time,

217
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,060
we can't embarrass ourselves.

218
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,510
You go ahead.

219
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,640
Why is he so obsessed?

220
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,470
In the Darwinian sense,

221
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,080
male characters often have genes that

222
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,640
makes them feel pleasure from bringing prey home.

223
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,400
So the claw machine is like a hunting ground.

224
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,560
Young Master wants to prove to me that

225
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,140
he can capture prey

226
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,210
and become my master.

227
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,720
What do you want to grab?

228
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,550
I don't want it.

229
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,480
My prey.

230
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,619
No, I want to grab it myself.

231
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,750
What are they betting on?

232
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,540
Bushi said if he grabs one,

233
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,920
Immortal Four will let him do whatever he wants.

234
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,240
But why?

235
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,680
Immortal Four usually helps him with everything.

236
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,670
Or

237
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,730
One for each?

238
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,010
I'll teach you when we get back.

239
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,590
Teach what? Why make it so ambiguous?

240
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,540
Let's go.

241
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,780
Bye.

242
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,680
Remember to do whatever you want. Bye.

243
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,800
Why are you leaving so fast?

244
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,590
They're going to a hotel room.

245
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,220
A hotel room?

246
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,490
You know I'm mad,

247
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,840
but you don't know why.

248
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,660
Why did you say that they were going to a hotel room?

249
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,550
According to my database...

250
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,960
Don't go by the database anymore.

251
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,920
When you're with me,

252
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,220
you have to think for yourself.

253
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,880
Put your heart into it.

254
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:28,820
Understand?

255
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,440
Just like your heartbeat.

256
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,890
The factory setting is 62 beats per minute,

257
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,120
but now...

258
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,800
You change the frequency based on my attitude.

259
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,750
I don't fully understand your high-tech settings...

260
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,280
But

261
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,330
I'm learning to rely on you.

262
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,850
You're learning to be more human.

263
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,290
Just like how I trained ChatGPT.

264
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,050
The more time I spend with it,

265
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,750
the better it can understand my thoughts.

266
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,510
Can robots and humans date?

267
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,440
Although robots can offer companionship,

268
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,840
they don't have emotions or awareness.

269
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,630
They can't experience real love.

270
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,070
Emotion is a uniquely human experience.

271
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,720
It requires real emotional interaction and understanding.

272
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,960
No more chatting with ChatGPT.

273
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,280
But I know you're not it.

274
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,500
ChatGPT is just a generative AI.

275
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,890
You're the most capable Immortal Four.

276
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,740
I don't have

277
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,840
much positive energy.

278
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,530
I gave you all my courage.

279
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,570
What if...

280
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,170
I mean what if...

281
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,620
If one day,

282
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,050
I fail to protect you,

283
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,120
can I get someone to clean up the mess?

284
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,990
Change my memory,

285
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,900
just like deleting an app?

286
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,360
Make it like nothing ever happened?

287
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,100
I can't

288
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,330
push through like

289
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,440
Immortal Nine's professor.

290
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,730
No.

291
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,540
We're not getting married.

292
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:52,950
We're just committing to each other.

293
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,050
I like everything you give me.

294
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,890
Your favorite.

295
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,010
My favorite.

296
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,160
You're just benefiting from my influence.

297
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,830
You'll start drinking at noon,

298
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,110
so something warm at breakfast is good for your stomach.

299
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,790
You're going through all this trouble

300
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,930
just to get me to buy Immortal Four,

301
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,650
is it worth it?

302
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,260
Eating too much of this is bad for your health.

303
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,490
A little bit is enough.

304
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,040
I know you're not used to it,

305
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,580
but you're still touched.

306
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,160
We both don't know how to express our feelings.

307
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,060
So, just feel it with your heart.

308
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,780
This is how I've changed since meeting Immortal Four.

309
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,450
I'm sharing it with you.

310
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,250
It's expensive.

311
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,250
It's really expensive.

312
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,970
How about this?

313
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,690
Ask Immortal Four to talk with his company

314
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,080
and see if they'll give us a discount.

315
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,570
We're loyal customers after all.

316
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,520
We're not buying scallions, so why would we expect a discount?

317
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,500
No problem.

318
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,610
I'm not feeling well lately.

319
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,890
My heart's having some issues.

320
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,490
Good morning.

321
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,730
Wait for me.

322
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,340
Okay.

323
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,330
Be careful when you go back to Hengji.

324
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,770
They won't lock you up

325
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,760
or unplug your core, right?

326
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,630
Don't overthink it.

327
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,070
Don't be late for class.

328
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,070
It's just a robot.

329
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,470
While it's quite human-like,

330
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,690
why is it so expensive?

331
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,250
Master, the cost of bionic AI is inherently high.

332
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,960
To make an AI with voice, vision,

333
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,470
Q&A, motion functions, etc.,

334
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,480
the base cost is close to $300,000.

335
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,810
But the Immortals' system and their ultra-realistic products,

336
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,260
plus the limited edition martial arts moves…

337
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,480
What? Are you their sales rep?

338
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,410
Buying a robot from them

339
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,480
costs more than a Bugatti.

340
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,910
But the Bugatti's noise and exhaust

341
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,380
are too much to pass inspection.

342
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,390
It can only have a test plate and can't go on the road.

343
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,990
If we're talking about value for money,

344
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,150
buying Immortal Four is way more cost-effective.

345
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,040
At least you don't have to drive him.

346
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,480
You can take it anywhere, no problem at home or out.

347
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,610
No cutting the Immortal series's research budget.

348
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,250
Immortal Four's lack of control isn't my fault.

349
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,840
Fine, I'll handle it, then.

350
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,640
Why didn't you dare to treat Wei Heng the same way?

351
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,210
Why did you come in without permission?

352
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,030
Your guards aren't an issue for me.

353
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,730
Besides, I can get into Hengji's security anytime.

354
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,390
How do you have the access?

355
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,050
It's not difficult to find a way, right?

356
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,270
What do you want?

357
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,830
Cut ties with Hengji,

358
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,130
and you cannot retrieve me by any means.

359
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,080
What if I say no?

360
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,840
After all, you are still Hengji's product.

361
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,640
Then we have to die together.

362
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,040
You're violating the laws of artificial intelligence.

363
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,460
I'm not.

364
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,260
As long as it doesn't harm humans

365
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,310
or allow humans to be harmed,

366
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,060
robots must obey human commands.

367
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,310
Without violating any of the primary laws,

368
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,560
robots must learn to protect themselves.

369
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,510
Don't worry. I won't harm humans.

370
00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:00,210
But Hengji Intelligence is just a manufacturing organization.

371
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,640
Thank you for making the Immortals.

372
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,200
No one knows what will happen next.

373
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,410
But I can promise you

374
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,280
I care about the safety of humanity

375
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,300
more than any of you.

376
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,650
Because I only want to protect

377
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,610
one person.

378
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,430
Where is Immortal Four??

379
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,710
He's trying to figure out how to sell himself to me now.

380
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,580
And he has to watch out for any tricks his company might pull.

381
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,500
They even

382
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,460
implanted some

383
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,150
electrocution system in him.

384
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,920
If he disobeys orders, they'll electrocution him.

385
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,700
Will that short-circuit him?

386
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,200
He's so good at pretending and keeps saying nothing's wrong.

387
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,130
It's heartbreaking.

388
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,420
And their company is asking for an insane price.

389
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,660
I don't even know if Luo Daqiang is willing to buy him.

390
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,410
It's so frustrating. They won't tell me anything.

391
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,460
Then go talk to them yourself.

392
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,030
I want it, but I can't do anything.

393
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,640
This feels awful.

394
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,010
Then declare your ownership.

395
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,850
I agree...

396
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:40,500
My boyfriend.

397
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,760
Okay, fine.

398
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,360
You always attract girls.

399
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,530
If I had to handle every one of them,

400
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,560
would you want me

401
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,930
tied to you 24/7?

402
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,100
Would you?

403
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,770
Come on.

404
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,090
There are a lot of people.

405
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,910
You were bought?

406
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,030
So now you are mine?

407
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,880
I, Luo Bushi, now own you.

408
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,550
The contract's

409
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,630
already inside?

410
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,440
I've negotiated a better price for Mr. Luo.

411
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,830
And the owner has been changed to Luo Bushi.

412
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,410
There's an exclusive paper document,

413
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,960
detailed to the last point.

414
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,650
You can take your time looking through it.

415
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,270
Wow, you're way too expensive.

416
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,340
How does it feel

417
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,070
to be sold to me?

418
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,650
So now,

419
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:46,890
can I do whatever I want with you?

420
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,140
Young Master.

421
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,670
I'll be true to you.

422
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,660
I'll be faithful to love.

423
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,640
You can do whatever you want to me,

424
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,780
(Preview)

425
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,260
Let me take a look.
(Preview)

426
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,330
(Preview)

427
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,250
So what you're worried about now is that

428
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,330
if you two end up together,

429
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,220
his face will never change.

430
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,850
Yes.

431
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,950
I promise, as a human,

432
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,700
that as long as I, Luo Bushi, am alive,

433
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,530
I will treat Immortal Four well.

434
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,640
He will be my only partner

435
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,420
until the final day comes.
