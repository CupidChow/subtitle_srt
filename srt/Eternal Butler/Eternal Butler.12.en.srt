1
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,850
(Eternal Butler)

2
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,030
(Mission 12: Happiness is good. Do you think so?)

3
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,420
Immortal Four!

4
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,310
Immortal Four.

5
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:45,950
Immortal Four.

6
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,410
Immortal Four.

7
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,840
Immortal Four.

8
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,760
Immortal Four.

9
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,890
Hengji Notice.

10
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,650
Immortal Four was found to have serious flaws,

11
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,410
so it was forcibly recalled and has already been destroyed.

12
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,890
What's wrong?

13
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,610
Did you dream about your mom, or are you feeling unwell?

14
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,700
Come on, let's sit there. Come here.

15
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,470
Where did you go early this morning?

16
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,650
You picked out breakfast yesterday,

17
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,150
so I just queued up to buy it.

18
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,900
I dreamed that you were broken,

19
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,400
got recalled and destroyed.

20
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,850
I was so scared.

21
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,960
It's okay. I'm here. I'm fine.

22
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,350
Don't cry.

23
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,420
Honestly, I'm afraid that electric shock system

24
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,160
might bring damage to you.

25
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,700
I can't lie to you

26
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,050
and say everything will be fine.

27
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,130
It's like, in this world,

28
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,130
every second, about 5 people are born.

29
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,750
Every day, 3,200 people

30
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,980
get into car accidents.

31
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,260
In the first half of the year,
480,000 people committed suicide,

32
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:24,380
3.63 million were diagnosed with cancer,

33
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,790
and the pandemic wiped out millions.

34
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,200
I'm not human

35
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,540
and I can't control the future.

36
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,700
I don't know whether tomorrow

37
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,200
or an accident will come first.

38
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,690
So, all we can do is

39
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,690
to live in the moment and cherish it.

40
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,420
You're really good at talking.

41
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,670
You should be a salesman

42
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,690
or an intelligence agent in the future.

43
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,790
I'm sure you can fool a lot of people.

44
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,370
Don't be anxious.

45
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,510
I promise...

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,510
I'll never leave you alone

47
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,450
to face the world.

48
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,510
I'll protect you from any harm.

49
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,510
If you feel sad,

50
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,240
I'll stay by your side.

51
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,830
From now on, it's you and me.

52
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,510
Even if one day, you...

53
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,060
Don't jinx us.

54
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,060
I'm telling you,

55
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,590
we will be fine together.

56
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,370
Besides,

57
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,370
I spent a lot of money buying you.

58
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,690
But there's still a problem,

59
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,810
and we have to fix it.

60
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,850
Hello, are you free tonight?

61
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,750
Do you want to grab dinner together?

62
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,930
What are you doing?

63
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,480
Zhou Zhenqun.

64
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,050
Don't tell me you're doing "exercise" this early in the morning.

65
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,930
So diligent!

66
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,140
What are you doing? Wait a sec.

67
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,600
See you at school later.

68
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,150
It's so early.

69
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,750
Alright, I'll sleep a little more.

70
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,720
This Lin Jiaqian is so manipulative.

71
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,080
He said he was afraid of falling behind in school,

72
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,720
so he kept clinging to Zhou Zhenqun.

73
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,560
But as it turned out, his grades

74
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,180
were so good that the school begged him to come back,

75
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,150
and he even kept his scholarship eligibility.

76
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,290
He didn't let Zhou Zhenqun out at night,

77
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,460
and forced him to "exercise" early in the morning.

78
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,380
Zhenqun is weak.

79
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,440
I hate that...

80
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,020
Young Master.

81
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,080
Exercising more is good for your health.

82
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,410
You should exercise more.

83
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,300
What? I haven't finished my breakfast.

84
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,970
I'll feed you.

85
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,440
Why are you dragging me upstairs?

86
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,270
The professor's taking roll today. I'll be late!

87
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:51,790
Thank you.

88
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,270
Here you are.

89
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,100
Thank you.

90
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,050
You're treating us to a meal,

91
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,210
but you don't even have a proper cup.

92
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,140
Aren't you saving up to take care of Immortal Four?

93
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,130
Tell me, how much is that champagne?

94
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,290
I brought it from home.

95
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,370
In order to take care of me,

96
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,770
Young Master's been studying financial management lately.

97
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,270
Thank you.

98
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,300
Who's jealous? If I feed you, it'll just be a waste.

99
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,810
So he can eat?

100
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,680
I'm right here so you can just ask me.

101
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,670
Luo Bushi said it last time.

102
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,420
Immortal Four is like a human.

103
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,560
But I've never seen him eat.

104
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,360
So, what can he eat?

105
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,720
So what do you want to discuss with us?

106
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,140
According to the agreement,

107
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,710
Immortal Four's identity as an AI

108
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,920
cannot be made public,

109
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,710
or there's a risk of him being recycled.

110
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,420
Don't worry.

111
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,390
Let me ask you.

112
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,490
He'll always be with me

113
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,800
looking like this.

114
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,870
Doesn't that seem strange?

115
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,800
What should I say

116
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,870
if someone asks?

117
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,620
Just say

118
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,410
he's got a good skincare routine.

119
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,180
Yes, he's got a good skincare routine.

120
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,030
Zhenqun...

121
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,590
So what you're worried about is,

122
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,740
if you two stay together in the future,

123
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,550
his appearance won't change, right?

124
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,800
Yeah, what do we do?

125
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,530
Well,

126
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,540
can't robots get a plastic surgery?

127
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,350
Artificial biomimetic cells don't age,

128
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,340
unless there's a plastic surgery.

129
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
It's not just the cost is expensive.

130
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,280
When I negotiated the contract with Hengji,

131
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,170
I signed the agreement, so we're settled now.

132
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,710
Don't think too much. Just move.

133
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,460
You can live here and there.

134
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,130
When someone notices something's off,

135
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,990
just move again.

136
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,010
Let me tell you.

137
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,670
I knew there was a wanted criminal,

138
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,960
who's been doing this for over 20 years,

139
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,650
and no one ever found out who he was.

140
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,990
Am I a wanted criminal?

141
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,310
I'm just making an example.

142
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,310
Zhou Zhenqun, come on!

143
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,510
Your brain's finally working.

144
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,080
Right?

145
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,660
Is that okay?

146
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,340
Alright.

147
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,130
Cheers.

148
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,890
Cheers. Here.

149
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,360
Cheers.

150
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,030
I love you.

151
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,500
Why are you sweet-talking early in the morning?

152
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,100
Tell me, did you do something bad?

153
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,020
The therapist said

154
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,620
many conflicts in marriage happen

155
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,470
because their needs aren't being met.

156
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,200
It's like they're both speaking different languages,

157
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,960
expressing themselves

158
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,880
in ways the other person isn't used to.

159
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,380
So we need to use affirming words,

160
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,880
thoughtful actions,

161
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,880
and...

162
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,480
nice gifts.

163
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,700
And...

164
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,340
physical touch.

165
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,620
Why don't you

166
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,060
be a therapist in the future?

167
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,660
You don't need to search for these information.

168
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,910
Having you by my side

169
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,720
is enough for me.

170
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,430
Thay made you pores

171
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,830
but you have no facial hair,

172
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,330
so you don't have to shave every day.

173
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,220
I envy that.

174
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,510
Help me out.

175
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,270
Be careful. I'm not like you.

176
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,780
Don't worry, Young Master.

177
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,110
I'm more familiar with knives and guns than spatulas.

178
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,340
And you are mine.

179
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,170
How could I hurt you?

180
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,050
What's wrong?

181
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,140
I don't need it. Don't waste it.

182
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,990
I know that you're born pretty.

183
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,710
But now I need to take good care of myself,

184
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,940
so that I won't look old next to you.

185
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,490
Cute.

186
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,290
What kind of kink is this?

187
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,560
Wearing a face mask and touching me.

188
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,740
You've gained weight.

189
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,130
But it's because I'm taking good care of you.

190
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,450
I like it.

191
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,180
Why do you two like taking photos here?

192
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,520
This is a kind of memory.

193
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,290
Yeah.

194
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,350
When we're old, we can look back at it.

195
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,570
Look how young we were.

196
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,170
I'm recording not just this moment,

197
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,750
but every second, every frame.

198
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,410
So you can record video in real-time?

199
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,760
Is your storage that big?

200
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,860
So... when we were having a good time,

201
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,960
you also recorded that?

202
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,710
Do you want to watch it?

203
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,200
If you want...

204
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,050
Let's go.

205
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,260
You're in a good mood today.

206
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,380
And you're here to pray.

207
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,910
Today's your production day.

208
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:19,780
I told you

209
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,770
I'd be the only one to celebrate it with you.

210
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,619
But it seems like you don't need anything.

211
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,410
As long as you're with me, I'm all good.

212
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,810
I knew you'd say that.

213
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,730
It might be too late to ask now,

214
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,950
but I hope

215
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,570
you won't regret

216
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,940
the decision to be with me.

217
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,110
You can't regret!

218
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,350
I'm not the easiest person to get along with.

219
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,450
I feel insecure because I lack love

220
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,950
and often throw tantrums for no reason.

221
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,640
Most importantly,

222
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,610
I'm super possessive.

223
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,650
I don't want to let you go,

224
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,210
and I don't want to be alone anymore.

225
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,980
I know you robots

226
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,820
don't believe in gods or ghosts.

227
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,460
But I heard this temple

228
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,600
is really effective for romance.

229
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,770
People say faith is like love,

230
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,150
it has no boundaries.

231
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,780
I promise, as a human,

232
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,170
that as long as I, Luo Bushi, am alive,

233
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,190
I will treat Immortal Four well.

234
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,720
He will be my only partner

235
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,320
until the final day comes.

236
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,200
Will you?

237
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,710
You're still young,

238
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,100
you don't need to make these promises.

239
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,420
And even if I'm not your one and only,

240
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,280
until the day I break down,

241
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,030
I will never leave you.

242
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,480
We don't know who will break down first.

243
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,740
Anyway,

244
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,890
I was lucky enough to meet you in this lifetime.

245
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,010
Even if you don't want to,

246
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,090
you'll have to stay by my side.

247
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,170
I won't let you go.

248
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,800
I hope I can live longer and be healthier.

249
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,490
Immortal Four can't break down,
and he can't become a bad guy.

250
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,100
Until the day I leave,

251
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,460
a lightning strike should come down

252
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,030
and burn his memory,

253
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,500
so he won't be abel to remember me.

254
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,290
I will remember you

255
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,420
until the day I break down.

256
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,050
I'll keep you deeply in my memory,

257
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,500
and take good care of you.

258
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,830
So, you need to live a long, long life,

259
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,740
so I'll have

260
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,830
plenty of you to miss.

261
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,090
You're greedy.

262
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,700
You better be nice to me,

263
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,500
or if I see someone else and change my mind one day,

264
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,160
I'll see how you deal with it.

265
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,050
I'll still keep looking out for you.

266
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,000
Is this the right answer?

267
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,810
If you dare to change your mind, I'll tie you to the bed,

268
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,810
and you'll only be able to see me for the rest of your life.

269
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,640
If one can live until 75,

270
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,840
and draws one square per month,

271
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,290
then in those 900 squares,

272
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,750
how many will no longer

273
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,020
be pure black because of that special person?

274
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,270
(Five years later)

275
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,880
He bought a robot,

276
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,340
and now he had to travel with him too?

277
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,760
What's that saying again?

278
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,810
Throw the helve after the hatchet.

279
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,200
Master, will you miss Young Master?

280
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,200
What are you talking about?

281
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,200
I actually feel more comfortable

282
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,700
when he's not around with me.

283
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,460
(Five more years later)

284
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,470
Dad, there will be a thing come to the door later.
(Five more years later)

285
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,810
Dad, there will be a thing come to the door later.

286
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,050
Don't call him a "thing."

287
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,450
You're so picky.

288
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,330
Go pcik him up later.

289
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,160
Anyway, your kid is all grown up now.

290
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,910
I'll give you a little one to look after,

291
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,210
so you won't be messing around outside.

292
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,630
A kid...

293
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,820
will come?

294
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,800
Master, Bushi adopted a child.

295
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,070
We were keeping him around,

296
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,620
but now that it's time for school,

297
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,950
we want him to go back.

298
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,970
Because Bushi got a job,

299
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,720
we need to go to Japan for a while.

300
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,330
-Please take care of him for us.
-Why does he look like them?

301
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,990
Grandpa, open the door.

302
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,210
Wow, he's so cute.

303
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,170
I heard it's custom-made.

304
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,470
Do you like it?

305
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,510
But custom-made is quite expensive.

306
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,220
Should we just adopt one?

307
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,010
You sound casual. It's not like adopting a puppy.

308
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,510
There's still a lot to think about.

309
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,410
It's not casual.

310
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,010
I gave Luo Bushi the adpotion files.

311
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,090
I thought about it for a long time.

312
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,010
And I think our financial ability is okay,

313
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,860
so we're able to give the kid a complete home.

314
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,570
We've got this.

315
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,150
We don't have the qualification.

316
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,010
Why?

317
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,060
We're married indeed.

318
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,830
But what's the point of just making money?

319
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,480
You might as well just marry your job.

320
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,430
If I don't make money, how can I buy things you like?

321
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,030
I wonder what he'll think

322
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:27,990
when he sees Luo Heng.

323
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,130
At least he can take care of Master for us.

324
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,240
He'll have no trouble taking care of him, way easier than you.

325
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,850
He's so fierce.

326
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,540
No one will take care of him when he gets old.

327
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,420
Luo Heng has gotten his body ready for the 7th stage of his life.

328
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,420
All he needs to do is pretend to live abroad for two months a year,

329
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,320
then switch up his look when he's back.

330
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,270
It should work.

331
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,270
Why would you want to custom-make child?

332
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,740
I'm genuinely worried about

333
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,100
what you'll do on your own

334
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,540
if I'm not around.

335
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,830
I don't want to be a ghost,

336
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,470
wacthing you being miserable in mid-air.

337
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,000
If you can't deal with it and look for someone else,

338
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,040
I won't let you get away with it.

339
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,750
I didn't know you were so manipulative.

340
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,710
In this lifetime, you're mine.

341
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,710
If I'm not around,

342
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,710
you can travel around with Luo Heng,

343
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,210
and see the world for me.

344
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,750
If you are broken,

345
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,210
have Luo Heng place you next to me.

346
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,480
It's just a formality.

347
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,290
You have no soul.

348
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,860
And I don't know how the world will change.

349
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,510
When you're drunk, you're so sentimental.

350
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,790
Just sentimental,

351
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,060
not sexy?

352
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,880
No matter how old you are,

353
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,390
you'll always be my precious Young Master.

354
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,150
My empty squares started filling up

355
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,650
with the colors I want because of you.

356
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,650
Your love gives me strength,

357
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,340
and that's why I know

358
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,520
how to face everything with courage.

359
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,540
As long as you're still breathing,

360
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,270
I will be by your side,

361
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,550
watching the summer flowers and autumn leaves with you.

362
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,540
I can be your partner,

363
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,000
your little brother,

364
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,810
or even your child.

365
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,260
It doesn't matter how others see me.

366
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,860
What matters is

367
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,190
I can always be by your side.
