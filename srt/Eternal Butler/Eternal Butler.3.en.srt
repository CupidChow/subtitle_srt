1
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,950
(Eternal Butler)

2
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,010
(Mission 3: When Necessary, You're Mine)

3
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,420
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,180
You...

5
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,280
You're the one being chased just now.

6
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,250
Are these all yours?

7
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,979
You're in debt?

8
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,990
I didn't mean that. I just…

9
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,860
You're hurt?

10
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,860
It's not your fault.

11
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,940
I wasn't watching.

12
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,680
Don't move.

13
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,280
Still as stubborn as ever.

14
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,360
Stick this on. Remember to ice it when you get home.

15
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,690
Why are you looking at me like that?

16
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,630
That place is dangerous.

17
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,680
It's dangerous inside, and the area around it is too.

18
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,580
You shouldn't linger there.

19
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,480
Sorry for troubling you.

20
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,640
The person you serve

21
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,050
just likes wasting time

22
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,200
indulging in hedonistic places.

23
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,500
I warn you. Don't get addicted to meddling.

24
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,600
We agreed it'd just be for show.

25
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,950
Careful, or I'll file a complaint.

26
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,720
Based on my observations,

27
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,300
your behavior shows excessive suppression,

28
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,230
leading you to rebel stubbornly

29
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,150
as a form of resistance.

30
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,270
But deep down, you're kind-hearted—

31
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,880
a sharp tongue, but a soft heart.

32
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,550
A typical good kid pretending to be bad.

33
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,970
Stop making assumptions.

34
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,880
Who's pretending?

35
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,010
Your rules are chaotic

36
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,590
and disorganized,

37
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,790
but I've noticed you have a latent masochistic tendency.

38
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,420
If I speak nicely, you won't listen,

39
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,530
so every time I have to…

40
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,460
I do not!

41
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,760
Don't keep taking off your glasses.

42
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,540
You were the one who accidentally took them off.

43
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,690
If you behave, you don't need to worry.

44
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,279
Or do you prefer

45
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,740
this kind of reward?

46
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,640
Who wants that?

47
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,540
I'm going to take a shower.

48
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,130
Young Master is so adorable.

49
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,640
Why did he spat my head?

50
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm

51
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,550
not a kid.

52
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,480
What kind of robot gets so handsy?

53
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,930
I bet he never dared act this way

54
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,180
when he was working

55
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,300
as a bodyguard before.

56
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,280
You're not a kid.

57
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,090
Didn't Young Master used to…

58
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,960
Let's just leave those immature

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,070
black marks in the past.

60
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,210
Also,

61
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,080
what's with the head pats and forehead kisses?

62
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,580
You're not my mom.

63
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,880
So your mom used to do that?

64
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,490
Do what?

65
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,870
This.

66
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,490
Excuse me.

67
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,120
I really like you.

68
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,780
I liked you at first sight.

69
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,800
Your looks, your walk,

70
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,490
the way you answer questions—all of it.

71
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,820
For you, I even

72
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,620
gave up wearing contact lenses.

73
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,240
Immortal Four.

74
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,970
Would you consider dating me?

75
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,650
First come, first served.

76
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,740
It's not that you're bad; you're just too late.

77
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,460
So, you like to be patted like this?

78
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,830
I don't get it.

79
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,250
Why give flowers to a man?

80
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,060
According to the data,

81
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,100
giving flowers to a man

82
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,280
promotes warmth and emotion

83
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,480
and can strengthen bonds.

84
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,410
Lisianthus, hydrangeas, roses, and tulip

85
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,430
are very attractive to men.

86
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,380
They can also convey friendship, gratitude,

87
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,670
or even affection.

88
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,840
Your database is impressive.

89
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,840
I thought you were just good at manual labor.

90
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,190
In Hengji's Immortal series,

91
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,350
I'm the leader.

92
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,070
Though my main function is protection,

93
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,500
my specialty is strategy.

94
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,470
Fine.

95
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,540
You just want to show off how amazing you are, right?

96
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,470
Then tell me.

97
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,740
What's the meaning of this bouquet?

98
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,740
I'm the Gray Knight in the hurricane,

99
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,590
and I belong only to you.

100
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,510
You've promised me my purpose,

101
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,600
and I'll guard your future.

102
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,270
Your whims will be indulged by me,

103
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,680
and my principles

104
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,460
will yield to you.

105
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,900
I've never had this before.

106
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,660
Neither have I.

107
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,020
Such soft, decorative things.

108
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,610
It's a first for me too.

109
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,170
Before, it was always weapons.

110
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,620
So, that speech just now was…

111
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,200
The card from the florist had a QR code.

112
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,590
Did I misplace my emotions?

113
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,720
It's all stuff you like.

114
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,080
What, scanning my QR code again?

115
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,310
I want candied fruit.

116
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,460
Candied fruit?

117
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,120
To play with or to eat?

118
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,150
Wow.

119
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,370
Amazing! How'd you make it?

120
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,680
Three parts sugar, one part water.

121
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,440
Microwave at 500 watts for eight minutes.

122
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,910
Dip the fruit, then chill in ice water.

123
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,540
Delicious.

124
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,130
The sugar content's high,

125
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,340
but if you like it,

126
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,300
I can make it for you occasionally.

127
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,470
If you keep messing with me, don't blame me for…

128
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,400
Take it off.

129
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,270
What? You're not listening to me?

130
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,440
Wow, you really are fit under those clothes.

131
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,420
Do you like it?

132
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,390
Who likes it?

133
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,180
I've got it too.

134
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,190
Damn it, this robot!

135
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,560
Spin around.

136
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,040
Why did you buy me clothes?

137
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,940
Who bought them for you?

138
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,260
I just got sick of seeing you

139
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,230
in the same outfit every day.

140
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,580
All black, all the time—so annoying.

141
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,110
This is the first time I've ever bought clothes for someone,

142
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,470
and you didn't even say thank you.

143
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,610
Instead, you acted all ungrateful.

144
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,020
If you like dressing in black so much,

145
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:03,790
go attract some flies!

146
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,180
Flies?

147
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,210
Flies are attracted to warm, light-reflecting colors.

148
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,020
Do you think I'm being unreasonable?

149
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,990
This is what I should do.

150
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,790
You should?

151
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,860
So, anyone would do?

152
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,660
Even someone like me?

153
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,230
Luo Bushi.

154
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,930
What?

155
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,440
It's rude to call someone by their full name.

156
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,350
Luo Bushi.

157
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,950
What?

158
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,510
Stop saying you're not good.

159
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,660
Every human's existence

160
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,390
has its own unique meaning.

161
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,960
Unlike us—

162
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,790
we're just made to meet users' needs.

163
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,340
So...

164
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,670
Dear, you have to cherish yourself.

165
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,760
Your emotions, your principles—

166
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,010
they're so hard to pin down.

167
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,090
My principle is...

168
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,730
don't get so close to me.

169
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,150
Why?

170
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,850
I feel like you're more

171
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,720
obedient this way.

172
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,850
Who told you that?

173
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:54,940
Go away.

174
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,490
That's all for today.

175
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,320
Don't talk to me.

176
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,160
Oh, and—

177
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,680
don't call me "baby,"

178
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,730
and don't call me “dear.”

179
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,980
Good night, Young Master.

180
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,420
Next time, don't eat so much candy.

181
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,770
If you eat candy before bed and don't brush your teeth, you'll get cavities.

182
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,090
So,

183
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,540
this is what it feels like to be pampered.

184
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,780
I was late last time;

185
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,100
this time you're even later.

186
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,830
This outfit kind of suits Luo Bushi's taste.

187
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,390
It does feel a bit youthful.

188
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,130
Youthful?

189
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,040
Why didn't you

190
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,010
buy one for me too?

191
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,250
My clothes are all in your closet anyway.

192
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,140
Do I still need to buy you one?

193
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,340
True.

194
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,650
Let's go.

195
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,660
Hurry up.

196
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,430
Don't tell me you can't drink.

197
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,700
Hurry up and drink!

198
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,720
Luo Bushi.

199
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,860
20 years old.

200
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,750
Today, I'm going to make sure you feel at home.

201
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,180
You're so excited that I'm 20?

202
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,700
People might think we're sworn brothers.

203
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,490
Wait a moment.

204
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,360
I'll introduce you to some friends.

205
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,930
What's wrong?

206
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,330
Since you don't like this kind of place,

207
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,270
nor do you like...

208
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,340
You won't understand.

209
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,950
Besides, who says I don't like it?

210
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,730
It's so lively, and they're celebrating my birthday early.

211
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,810
Don't be so serious.

212
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,110
Just relax.

213
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,500
Have a drink.

214
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,180
Your design allows you to, right?

215
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,330
Drinking alcohol for us is just a situational need.

216
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,060
There's no difference in the experience.

217
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,550
At most we can analyze the composition.

218
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,460
So you've tried it before?

219
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,820
Let's say I've tried it.

220
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,640
Last time?

221
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,890
This is what I call "just in case."

222
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,570
The drink earlier had a high alcohol content.

223
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,990
Didn't I tell you to stay away from me?

224
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,480
Luo Bushi, help me!

225
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,859
Come here.

226
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,430
Luo Bushi, do you dare?

227
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,109
Go for it!

228
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
I'm not afraid.

229
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,460
Luo Bushi!

230
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,359
Luo Bushi, hurry up!

231
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,099
Hurry up!

232
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,930
Hurry up.

233
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,869
Okay.

234
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,720
Go on.

235
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,530
Hurry up.

236
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,480
Drink quickly. Come on.

237
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,210
Here.

238
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,490
Do you always talk this little?

239
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,550
3 and 7, to the living room.

240
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,470
Luo Bushi.

241
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,490
Are you and Zhou Zhenqun the punishment couple today?

242
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,330
Who's carrying who?

243
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,340
It's obviously not me.

244
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,300
Carry him!

245
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,620
I'm not that heavy.

246
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,790
How much did you eat?

247
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,790
Walk faster!

248
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,040
Zhou Zhenqun, hold on tighter!

249
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,710
So funny.

250
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,760
So funny.

251
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,230
Doesn't matter if it's black or colorful; you attract flies either way.

252
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,770
Flies?

253
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,670
Where are the flies?

254
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,730
So, do you like guys?

255
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,920
Or are you open to both?

256
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,930
Your man is quite the charmer.

257
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,930
Pay attention to me.

258
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,890
It hurts.

259
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,310
What are you doing?

260
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,690
Can't I even touch you?

261
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,790
You don't have the right.

262
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,840
Who does?

263
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,390
You do.

264
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,480
She's so close to you.

265
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,820
Aren't you going to explain to her?

266
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,060
I'm Luo Bushi's man.

267
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,320
You chose him over me?

268
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,510
Are you blind?

269
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,400
You might want to look in a mirror.

270
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,670
But honestly, Chen Xiao is the one who's blind as the organizer.

271
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,530
How could he let someone like you crash the party?

272
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,410
You two also seem very cozy in your games.

273
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,780
I won't interrupt your fun.

274
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,140
I'll wait for you outside.

275
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,760
Your man has quite the temper.

276
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,700
What "my man"?

277
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,520
He's my property, okay?

278
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,770
Property?

279
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,070
I'm his property.

280
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,570
It's a subjective sense of belonging and possession.

281
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,810
He's my client.

282
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,370
That's an objective and substantive relationship.

283
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,400
Based on past experience,

284
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,210
I didn't actually need to stay inside.

285
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,850
But why didn't I want to leave?

286
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,180
Is it part of my "standby mode" setting?

287
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,160
Or is it because of the emotions I've been putting into this?

288
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,070
It's quieter here without anyone around.

289
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,540
Who picked the music today? It's so noisy.

290
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,920
Don't be mad anymore.

291
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,430
He's just too handsome.

292
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,020
He's a little taller and has a better build.

293
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,990
How is that handsome?

294
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,780
Don't be jealous.

295
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,830
Where did your dad even find him?

296
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,330
Sometimes he smiles,

297
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,120
but his eyes can get so cold.

298
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,750
It's enough to give you chills.

299
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,140
Cold, huh?

300
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,840
Because he's not human.

301
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,060
Just because he got hit on

302
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,690
doesn't mean he's flirting back.

303
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,800
You don't have to deny him as a human.

304
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,510
No, he's literally not human.

305
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,730
He's AI.

306
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,550
What AI?

307
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,990
How you use Immortal Four is none of my business,

308
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,270
but I signed a confidentiality agreement.

309
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,630
I can't let anyone know he's a robot,

310
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,520
or he'll be recalled and reassigned.

311
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,500
He's an "I" type.

312
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,360
Who is he?

313
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,190
I've told you before, haven't I?

314
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,920
Bodyguard, servant, errand boy—

315
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,230
call it whatever you want.

316
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,240
I think you two...

317
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,530
What?

318
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,180
Are hiding something.

319
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,560
Hide your head.

320
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,090
How did you know we were here?

321
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,160
Chen Xiao saw you come in.

322
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,200
He didn't want to seem like a bad host,

323
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,770
so he rushed over with drinks.

324
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,490
Anything else you need?

325
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,670
Well, Chen Xiao

326
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,290
really knows how to kiss up.

327
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,130
So considerate.

328
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,700
Unlike someone at home,

329
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,200
who's always at odds with me.

330
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,830
Why are you drinking so fast?

331
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,890
But I guess it doesn't matter.

332
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,970
If you get drunk, someone will carry you home.

333
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,180
You don't even know—last time he carried you,

334
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,610
it was effortless.

335
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,320
You two have such a harmonious master-servant relationship,

336
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,440
just like us.

337
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,570
More than friends but less than lovers.

338
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:37,930
(How much longer?)
(Get ready in ten minutes)

339
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:38,450
Here.
(How much longer?)
(Get ready in ten minutes)

340
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,340
(How much longer?)
(Get ready in ten minutes)

341
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,950
Who's "more than friends" with you?

342
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,090
That's not fair to say.

343
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,560
I even thought of you as—

344
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,810
I even...

345
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,890
Still playing hard to get?

346
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,580
Once the drug kicks in, you'll have to behave.

347
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,590
These days, men are prettier than women.

348
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,320
Let's go, let's go.

349
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,290
Young Master!

350
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,850
Young Master!

351
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,500
Young Master, are you feeling unwell?

352
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,090
Let's go to the hospital.

353
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,670
No, not the hospital.

354
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,740
Alright, then let's go home.

355
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,010
Why are you lying here?

356
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,090
Drunk, of course.

357
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,930
Zhou Zhenqun!

358
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,010
Snap out of it.

359
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,020
Are you hurt anywhere?

360
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,490
Stop touching me.

361
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,590
I think I might've been drugged.

362
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,390
Let me give you a ride.

363
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,190
Are you sure?

364
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,360
Let's go.

365
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,250
Young Master.

366
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,640
Young Master.

367
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,630
Young Master.

368
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,250
In the moments

369
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,230
we need someone the most,

370
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,320
who will show up for us?

371
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,310
What should we do if someone's been given an aphrodisiac?

372
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,830
(Preview)
What should we do if someone's been given an aphrodisiac?

373
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,400
(Preview)

Not me. A person.

If the dosage is high,

378
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,880
they might need to go to the hospital.

379
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,320
But if it's low,

380
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,570
they just need to... release it.

381
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,280

00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,040
include meeting the client's needs?

383
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,940

386
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,480
Go, all of you, just go!

387
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,880
It's not like I'm keeping you here.
