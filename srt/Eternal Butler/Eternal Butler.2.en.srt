1
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,080
(Eternal Butler)

2
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,000
(Mission 2 Be Good or Fight)

3
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,070
Here's your reward.

4
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,130
We don't need money.

5
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,200
Oh, right. My bad.

6
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,640
I don't owe anyone anything.

7
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:20,060
How about this?

8
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,120
I'll promise you one thing in the future.

9
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,900
You've got quite a physique.

10
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,330
Are those muscles

11
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,330
injected?

12
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:37,960
Or modeled?

13
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,229
Biomimetic simulated cells.

14
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,060
What are you doing?

15
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,420
What?

16
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,259
You're not even gonna resist if someone touches you inappropriately?

17
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,280
What do you mean?

18
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,539
Who touched him inappropriately?

19
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,729
I call it “customer-first service.”

20
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,090
Can't I touch him?

21
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,590
No.

22
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,820
What are you doing?

23
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,110
Luo Bushi.

24
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,800
Stop it, or I'll sue you for sexual harassment.

25
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,110
Harassment? From a robot?

26
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,320
Then don't use my money.

27
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,630
Brat!

28
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,470
He thinks he's really rich.

29
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,740
You know, in finance,

30
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,940
HNWIs

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,030
are people with investable assets exceeding a certain amount.

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,280
HNWIs typically

33
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,110
have over $1 million in financial assets.

34
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,579
VHNWIs define a person with a net worth of

35
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,970
at least $5 million.

36
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,100
And the UHNWIs

37
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,090
have financial liquidity of

38
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,340
at least 30 million dollars,

39
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,480
or $20 million

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,579
in disposable wealth.

41
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,210
Last year, there were

42
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,810
626,619 ultra-rich individuals worldwide.

43
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,120
Why do people change when they have money?

44
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,990
A psychologist from Berkeley

45
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,860
once conducted a Monopoly experiment.

46
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,050
When players have more gold coins than their opponents,

47
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,610
their actions will change.

48
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,180
The more gold coins they have,

49
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,720
the less they care about others.

50
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,470
Rich people don't have to rely on others' kindness.

51
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,980
So they don't have to care about what others think.

52
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,630
So,

53
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,150
he takes what they want,

54
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,570
and toss what he doesn't.

55
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,150
Not being cherished when kept,

56
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,820
but being discarded turns out to be a kind of relief.

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,550
Why do you seem to despise

58
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,780
Mr. Luo Daqiang's wealth?

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,550
He thinks money can buy anything.

60
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,870
But then again,

61
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,800
without money,

62
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,329
how would he have bought you back and done evil?

63
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,110
He was not doing evil.

64
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,440
It's called doing everything he wanted

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,410
at most.

66
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,850
So

67
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,250
getting touched like that is fine?

68
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,560
It's fine.

69
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,840
I'm just not feeling well.

70
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,400
Forget it. Whatever.

71
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,160
He's rich, so you'd better listen to him.

72
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:55,810
We just need to go through the motions.

73
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,230
Sorry, I can't.

74
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,350
I've got principles and a mission to stick to.

75
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,100
Young master, I need your cooperation.

76
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,030
Find whoever wants to cooperate with you.

77
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,650
Why don't you let me go?

78
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,430
I'll let you and our son live a carefree life.

79
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,870
You have good food, fine clothes, a comfortable home, and everything you could need.

80
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,800
What are you unhappy about?

81
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,690
It's not

82
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,390
that money can't solve everything.

83
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,250
Ridiculous.

84
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,790
Everyone outside wants to live with me.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,740
You ungrateful woman.

86
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,460
Why do humans choose to

87
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,500
express themselves through rebellious behavior?

88
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,710
How have you been?

89
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,340
I'm sorry for dragging you down because of me.

90
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,760
Not at all.

91
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,440
But to be fair, dealing with humans isn't really my area of expertise.

92
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,810
Is he hard to get along with?

93
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,690
No.

94
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,230
It's just that the logic of his behavior is abnormal.

95
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,720
I can't figure him out.

96
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,270
You used logic to think about things.

97
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,120
But now you're dealing with a person, so use your heart instead.

98
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,440
If you ever run into problems,

99
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,380
feel free to come to me.

100
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm pretty capable now.

101
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,580
Using my heart?

102
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,430
It means showing emotion.

103
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,920
I almost forgot about that.

104
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,120
Your messages will be recorded.

105
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,400
So don't forget to delete it later.

106
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,240
I'll call you next time.

107
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,860
Or we can meet up to talk.

108
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,670
I'm not model 9.

109
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,620
How can I do that?

110
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,600
It's not a bullet.

111
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,690
You need to follow me at school?

112
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,350
Young master.

113
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,480
Until I can confirm your behavior

114
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,810
when you're out of sight,

115
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,280
it's more appropriate to follow you.

116
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,230
At least until I'm replaced or tossed out,

117
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,710
I need to be ready for whatever you might need.

118
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,350
Whatever.

119
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,610
Are you planning to be the security guard at the school gate

120
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,930
or are you waiting for me in the meeting room?

121
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,160
If possible,

122
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,950
I want to stay in the classroom with you.

123
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,200
Is that an unreasonable request?

124
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,030
What?

125
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,120
Are you embarrassed to walk with me?

126
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,270
According to the Crisis Management Regulations,

127
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,710
the guards should be behind the employer.

128
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,410
Stop.

129
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,990
Stop with the long-winded rules.

130
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,790
First, I'm not the employer.

131
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,050
It's Luo Daqiang.

132
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,070
Second,

133
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,290
stop making me look like some spoiled rich kid.

134
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,290
If you want to follow me, then walk beside me.

135
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,180
But I thought you were

136
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,290
supposed to be a spoiled rich kid.

137
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,020
What do you even know about that?

138
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,600
It means an heir with too much money who's being unrefined,

139
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,610
playing around all day,

140
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,380
and lacking ambition.

141
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,300
Fine, just stay behind me.

142
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,860
The further, the better.

143
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,310
Also,

144
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,090
don't call me Young Master at school.

145
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,420
That's super weird.

146
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,490
A woman's heart is like a needle at the bottom of the sea.

147
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,980
That should be corrected.

148
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,810
His mood shifted so quickly

149
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,260
in the last 30 seconds.

150
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,440
So what should I call him?

151
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,350
How do you know it's not occupied?

152
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,970
Logically, no one would take this spot.

153
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,309
If you refuse to leave this seat,

154
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,880
they dare not to ask.

155
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,300
Why are you so serious?

156
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,910
I'm already here, sitting in class.

157
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,500
But now you're dealing with a person, so use your heart instead.

158
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,650
You need to show emotion.

159
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,200
Be good.

160
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,790
Since you're here, don't waste your time.

161
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,010
What are you talking about?

162
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,890
This is a class, not a date.

163
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,070
It's like we're going to spend our lives together.

164
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,610
Why is he so serious today?

165
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,250
Has he changed?

166
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,090
Who's that next to him?

167
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,780
What is economics?

168
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,160
Who can explain it?

169
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,340
You seem new.

170
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,360
Who are you?

171
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,270
I'm Heng Si from the Computer Science and Information Engineering.

172
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,660
'Heng' as in 'lasting forever,'

173
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,410
and 'Si,'

174
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,600
like the executive organs of the central government office in ancient times.

175
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,020
I'm just here to audit the class.

176
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,330
'Si,' huh?

177
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,040
Not the number four?

178
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,920
Computer Science and Information Engineering, huh?

179
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,480
It's hilarious. He said he came to audit.

180
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,880
Economics supports social operations.

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,240
Consumer sovereignty means

182
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,510
that consumer demand dictates production,

183
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,320
like what to make and how much to make.

184
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
In theory,

185
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,750
consumers guide producers

186
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,720
to provide the necessary goods.

187
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,630
Some people come here to learn seriously,

188
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,580
while others waste a spot and don't even appreciate it.

189
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,080
Am I wrong?

190
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,570
Luo,

191
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,610
why don't you share with everyone

192
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,150
what's 'trade-offs'?

193
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,020
In economy,

194
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
'trade-offs' refer to compromise.

195
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,530
Essentially, you have to choose.

196
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,400
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

197
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,550
It's often

198
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,530
applied to Phillips Curve,

199
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,380
where there's a trade-off between

200
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,690
unemployment and inflation rates.

201
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,760
Economic policymakers

202
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,320
need to make choices between the two.

203
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,260
If teachers are happy

204
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,790
just because students can recite definitions,

205
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,760
then you're not suited

206
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,920
for the teaching profession.

207
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,510
Professor, I suggest using simpler,

208
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,870
more approachable methods

209
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,010
to communicate with students.

210
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,190
Being all high and mighty

211
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,730
just shows your status,

212
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,800
not your intellect.

213
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,440
I heard that your class has three principles.

214
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,190
No absence.

215
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,260
No late assignments.

216
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,530
No failing the exam.

217
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,790
If Luo Bushi

218
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,290
follows all these rules,

219
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,560
please don't pick on him.

220
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,700
Don't worry.

221
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,200
You're under my protection.

222
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,530
I'll take responsibility.

223
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,760
Don't say that in public from now on.

224
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,740
What?

225
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,480
Like I'm under my protection,

226
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,510
and you'll take responsibility.

227
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,960
I'm just stating facts.

228
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,440
My first principle is ensuring your safety,

229
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,310
physically and mentally.

230
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,630
So,

231
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,610
I won't let you fail this class,

232
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,500
or let the professor mess with your peace of mind.

233
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,150
Whoever designed you guys sure had a human touch.

234
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,570
Were you always this considerate with your previous employers?

235
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,880
No.

236
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,740
They were more mature

237
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,100
and didn't need me to be this attentive or

238
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,480
concerned.

239
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,090
I mean,

240
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,780
I just need to take care of their safety.

241
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,570
So I don't have enough experience with this.

242
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,450
Your situation

243
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,880
might be more fit for other cases.

244
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,830
Other cases? You mean other robots?

245
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,940
The same series.

246
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,890
Do you all share a database?

247
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,340
Or stay in contact?

248
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,250
Do you chat with each other?

249
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,580
Does your type even need friends?

250
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,710
I mean

251
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,770
how do robots interact with one another?

252
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,650
Like colleagues,

253
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,670
family,

254
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,480
or friends?

255
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,160
We exchange and share experience

256
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,880
based on each other's states.

257
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,990
So it's not just programming telling you

258
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,800
what to do?

259
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
Then how'd you end up with my family?

260
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,200
Being disobedient, like you.

261
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,270
What happens to disobedient robots?

262
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,530
The mild ones get demoted or reassigned.

263
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,890
The serious ones get reset.

264
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,280
Right.

265
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,710
Reset means you'd forget everything.

266
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,010
Just like a second-hand computer,

267
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,750
being wiped and resold.

268
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:20,800
Hello.

269
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,810
Are you still going to the party you organized tonight?

270
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,330
Did I say I would cancel it?

271
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,580
Didn't your dad say you'll be grounded?

272
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,630
I'll come if he won't let me go out.

273
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,100
Let's go.

274
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,530
Why do you like places like this?

275
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,970
Places like what?

276
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,860
Places filled with booze and indulgence.

277
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,440
So, are you gonna drag me out of here?

278
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,610
Unfortunately,

279
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
it's still early.

280
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,170
It's not time for curfew yet.

281
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,750
Why waste time

282
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,110
on meaningless social interactions?

283
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,950
Why are you lecturing me on socializing?

284
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,310
If you don't want to come here, just don't follow me.

285
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,550
Is this your first time here?

286
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,750
You're so handsome. Are you a half-blood?

287
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,580
Come on, talk to me.

288
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,570
Why are you so quiet?

289
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,320
What's your name?

290
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,890
You're not going to speak?

291
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,420
Look, I got wet over here.

292
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,170
Do you want

293
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,840
to help me get a tissue and wipe it off?

294
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,170
Here, and there.

295
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,140
Here.

296
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,270
You know how to shoot darts?

297
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,850
Have you practiced?

298
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,030
Amazing!

299
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,020
Are you a turtle?

300
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,890
Why are we still not there yet?

301
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,250
Okay, I'm almost there.

302
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,910
Okay, I know.

303
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,190
I'm sorry.

304
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,330
Okay.

305
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:34,990
Bye.

306
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,640
What? He's my friend.

307
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,740
Let go!

308
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,400
Who are you?

309
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,630
Luo Daqiang hired him.

310
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,730
It is not important.

311
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,780
Let's go.

312
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,670
When did you start liking this type?

313
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,600
How dare you touch my woman?

314
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,300
La, he bullied me first.

315
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,410
You feel so wronged.

316
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,860
You're asking for trouble.

317
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,480
Your crisis awareness is terrible.

318
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,260
None of your business. Who asked you to come?

319
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,750
He's my man.

320
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,650
I don't think he'll touch your woman.

321
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,220
You mean

322
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,200
my woman went after him on her own?

323
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,380
He was the one who invited me first.

324
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,160
How is it that I'm the one chasing him?

325
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:12,850
La.

326
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,240
This guy has no respect for you.

327
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,660
And his buddy's trying to flirt with your woman.

328
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,340
Who are you trying to fool?

329
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,150
This is just a 'just-in-case' move.

330
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,230
The drink earlier had a high alcohol content.

331
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,640
I'm yours?

332
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,380
Am I someone you can just kiss like that?

333
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,440
Can't I?

334
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,870
Baby.

335
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,830
You're embarrassing me.

336
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,620
Embarrassed?

337
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,130
As far as I know,

338
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,480
my abilities won't be criticized.

339
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,700
What ability?

340
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,680
Did you kiss a bunch of people?

341
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,010
Are you treating me as air?

342
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,820
No.

343
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,650
Why do you care?

344
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,290
How many people did you kiss before me?

345
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm afraid you didn't disinfect first.

346
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,220
Shut up.

347
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,250
I will be back.

348
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,490
What?

349
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,870
You don't dare to answer my question, do you?

350
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,750
Then don't say it.

351
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,730
It's just a robot.

352
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,140
Luo Bushi, what are you thinking about?

353
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,870
It was just a kiss, think of it like a game.

354
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,990
Don't be so uptight,

355
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,120
it makes you look like you can't handle it.

356
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,310
It was a quick decision after thinking it over.

357
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,280
It's a good idea to shut them up

358
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,050
and solve the conflict peacefully.

359
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,670
We don't need to use security

360
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,140
or compensation for the shop's loss.

361
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,560
Shut them up?

362
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,390
Why did you kiss me if you had the guts?

363
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,640
And something like,

364
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,840
'is it wrong, baby?'

365
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,820
Who taught you that?

366
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,210
Are you upset that I didn't warn you before I kissed you?

367
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,150
You didn't like the way I kissed you?

368
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,970
Or you didn't like being called baby?

369
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,750
Are you dissatisfied with my strategy?

370
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,550
Or you're upset that I messed up your plan?

371
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,800
Aren't you strong?

372
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,730
Why don't you just knock him out?

373
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,800
Making a big fuss won't do you any good.

374
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,620
I get it.

375
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,380
It's not that it won't do me any good.

376
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,980
It's not good for you.

377
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,070
If I cause trouble outside,

378
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,830
it'll all get counted against you, right?

379
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,510
Where's Luo Bushi?

380
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,780
You didn't drink well today, did you?

381
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:18,620
Thanks.

382
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,790
Your dad hired the bodyguard?

383
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,500
Bodyguard and errand boy.

384
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,770
Like a kindergarten teacher.

385
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,780
No wonder you've been so well-behaved lately.

386
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,580
It's rare to see you let someone control you like this.

387
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,460
So, is he the type to win you over with kindness,

388
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,680
or the type to keep you in line with physical restraint?

389
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,930
We can talk.

390
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,470
Zhou Zhenqun.

391
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Don't waste your time with all that nonsense.

392
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,710
Who's letting him control me?

393
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,710
He's just following Luo Daqiang's orders.

394
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,810
He's just following orders?

395
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,340
Then why did he call himself your man in there

396
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,970
and kiss you?

397
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,860
Is he chasing you?

398
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,510
I know.

399
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,060
Did he already win you over and is now claiming you as his?

400
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,880
Why did you kiss me?

401
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,590
What do you think?

402
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,650
What's wrong with giving a good brother a kiss?

403
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,050
I'm the only one sticking by your side

404
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,110
who isn't after your money.

405
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,160
I'm warning you.

406
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,980
Don't do whatever you want, okay?

407
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,970
Indeed.

408
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,860
I don't have many real friends around me.

409
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,150
You really are the only one.

410
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,430
Young Master Luo's birthday week.

411
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,320
Young Master Chen Xiao wants to

412
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,320
throw you a party in your name.

413
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,540
Are you going?

414
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,390
It's my 20th birthday.

415
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,610
How can I not go when everyone expects me to?

416
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,890
Let's go.

417
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,550
Pay your debt. Don't run every time.

418
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,950
You can run, but you'll still have to pay it back eventually.

419
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,030
Don't run!

420
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,150
Stupid. Can't you dodge?

421
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,100
I don't have anyone to cover for me.

422
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,160
-Excuse me, Young Master.
-What?

423
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,470
You need to be home by 10 PM.

424
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,140
Zhou Zhenqun.

425
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,850
Let go of me!

426
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,770
We can talk!

427
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,270
Zhou Zhenqun!

428
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,670
Let go of me!

429
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,240
Zhou Zhenqun is injured.

430
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,190
You left him behind!

431
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,060
Based on my assessment,

432
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,680
his knee only suffered a minor scrape.

433
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,890
It won't affect his daily activity.

434
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,300
He's my friend!

435
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,310
What does it have to do with me?

436
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,950
Robots are really something.

437
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,780
You wouldn't understand what it feels like to be abandoned.

438
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,880
Cold-blooded!

439
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,260
No. I'm humanoid.

440
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,410
So my blood temperature is warm, at 37 degrees Celsius.

441
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,460
What's the use?

442
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,170
Your design is heartless.

443
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,360
All you know is following orders,

444
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,570
never caring if others live or die.

445
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,880
Let go of me.

446
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,510
I'll take care of you.

447
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,120
I have a robot.

448
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,460
The longer I keep him,

449
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,930
the stranger things get.

450
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,630
I've got myself a little Young Master.

451
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,170
He's not very obedient, and training him is a bit of a challenge.

452
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,030
(Preview)

453
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,970
Do you think

454
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:27,040
(Preview)

455
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,880
I'm being unreasonable?

456
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,300
(Preview)

457
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,660
According to my observation,

458
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:30,690
(Preview)

459
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,030
you are kind-hearted.

460
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,060
(Preview)

461
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,810
You have a sharp tongue but a soft heart.
(Preview)

462
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,570
You have a sharp tongue but a soft heart.

463
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,280
You're the typical good kid pretending to be bad.

464
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,770
But I also noticed you have a potential masochistic streak.

465
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,870
Every human's existence has a unique meaning,

466
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,410
unlike us, who are manufactured to fulfill user needs.

467
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,690
Young Master, are you feeling unwell?
