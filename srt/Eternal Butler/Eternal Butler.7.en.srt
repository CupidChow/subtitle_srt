1
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,010
(Eternal Butler)

2
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,090
(Mission 7: Wherever You Go, I'll Follow)

3
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,640
So, Master, you know who is behind this.

4
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,140
We're going to

5
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,300
this trap banquet to see for ourselves

6
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,920
who wants to mess with my son.

7
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,670
You actually care a lot about Young Master.

8
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,170
But why do you always make him sad?

9
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,270
Does his sadness make me happy?

10
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,940
I'm his father

11
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,520
Why should I humble myself before him?

12
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:29,700
It's not about humbling yourself—

13
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,840
just put in a little effort, and show some affection.

14
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,780
He's actually easy to please.

15
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,930
You're so strange.

16
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,350
A robot teaching me

17
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,000
how to deal with my son?

18
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,340
Aren't you going too far?

19
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,090
Do I need to pay someone to lecture me now?

20
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:47,759
Go!

21
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,830
I'm heading out with Mr. Luo.

22
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,090
Stay home and behave.

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,770
Go. Master is bigger than Young Master.

24
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,720
He's the employer and I'm just an accessory.

25
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,330
Is it fair to leave me at home

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,490
while taking you out?

27
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,720
Does he take you along

28
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,550
to show off how handsome his bodyguard is?

29
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,740
Young Master, you want to monopolize me?

30
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,660
Go.

31
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,570
Mr. Luo has locked in

32
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,860
on someone who might harm you,

33
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,540
so it's safer with me around.

34
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,820
Well, he has a lot of enemies.

35
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,180
You're a robot. He's an old man.

36
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,640
Don't toss him around like last time.

37
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,280
Don't worry, Young Master.

38
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,950
Who's worried?

39
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,150
I just don't want him coming back to file a complaint.

40
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,060
Replacing a robot would be such a hassle.

41
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,810
You guys are weird.

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,210
Why are you asking me for money?

43
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,430
Blame your boyfriend.

44
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,800
He's not my boyfriend.

45
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,880
Not yet.

46
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,290
You're doing much better than he is.

47
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,040
If you won't pay his debts, then we'll have to

48
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,540
take away your allowance, just to teach you a lesson.

49
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,040
What are you doing?

50
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,030
Give it to me.

51
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,230
2,000? That's it?

52
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,560
Luo Bushi.

53
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,670
I'm being blocked by some debt collectors.

54
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,850
Debt collectors?

55
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,450
When did you owe money?

56
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,020
Not me, it's Lin Jiaqian,

57
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,800
the guy who saved me last...

58
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,350
If you want us not to harm your friend,

59
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,990
cough up the money.

60
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,829
I'll send you the location later.

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,470
I told you to be more discerning with people.

62
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,020
That Lin Jiaqian is clearly a fraud.

63
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,090
Don't say that about him.

64
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,450
The debt is his dad's.

65
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,950
Some low-rent punks.

66
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,900
We are standing right here!

67
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,530
Civilized people resolve things civilly.

68
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,700
Tell me, how much does his father owe?

69
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,390
The principal is 300,000 yuan.

70
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,730
The monthly interest is 120,000.

71
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:46,909
What?

72
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,270
That's 1.02 million with interest!

73
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,409
-What?
-What?

74
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,230
Alright, then tell your friend Zhou Zhenqun

75
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,810
to stay away from him.

76
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,460
Otherwise, the next time,

77
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,640
the stick won't spare you either.

78
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,280
Are you threatening me?

79
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,630
I'll keep him by my side,

80
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,750
and we'll see what you can do.

81
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,090
Lin Jiaqian is working so hard for his dad.

82
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,040
And?

83
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,830
I was wondering… Could I borrow some money from you?

84
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,010
What? Are you out of your mind?

85
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,220
Are you sure he's okay with you helping him like this?

86
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,720
I don't know.

87
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,250
I just don't want to see him

88
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,570
bow and scrape for a debt

89
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,470
that's not even his, hiding and running all the time.

90
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,090
Fine. I'll help you.

91
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,409
Really? Thank you.

92
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,010
(IOU)

93
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,930
Judging by your look,

94
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,900
there's no way you'll leave

95
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,770
that Jia guy.

96
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,970
I'm afraid you'll be implicated.

97
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,290
He's not a fraud.

98
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,360
Lin Jiaqian

99
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,430
is lucky to have met you.

100
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,930
But what if he doesn't repay you?

101
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,920
You are just friends,

102
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,190
yet you're taking on almost a million in debt for him.

103
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,180
Is it worth it?

104
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,990
I trust him.

105
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,160
Are you guys together?

106
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,420
I'm working on it.

107
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,590
Working on it?

108
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,440
You'd better make sure he doesn't think

109
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,710
you're using money to buy him.

110
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,350
But honestly,

111
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,310
your unconditional trust in someone—

112
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,550
that's a kind of happiness too.

113
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,650
Maybe foolish people do have their blessings.

114
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,240
Good luck reaching your goal. I'm off.

115
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,680
Thanks.

116
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,500
How did you discipline him?

117
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,750
Didn't I say no going out?

118
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,640
For his safety,

119
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,050
I even agreed to certain conditions,

120
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,180
and yet—what happened?

121
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,370
He still ignored it

122
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,620
and went out!

123
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,410
Young Master, you are back.

124
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,340
Why did you even come back?

125
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,100
Didn't I tell you not to go out?

126
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,240
Why didn't you answer your phone?

127
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,930
Where did you go? Are you okay?

128
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,880
I'm fine. My phone ran out of battery.

129
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,670
Zhou Zhenqun suddenly needed money.

130
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,910
What happened?

131
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,470
Zhou Zhenqun again?

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,770
Just now, the bank called and said

133
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,940
you withdrew a million from your account.

134
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,650
I thought something happened to you.

135
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,970
Did he scam you into investing or buying something?

136
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,010
Do you think I'm you?

137
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,210
Tell me—where did the money go?

138
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,090
I spent it, okay?

139
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,760
It's just a million.

140
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,830
Just one million?

141
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,690
With how you carry yourself,

142
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,750
no wonder people want to mess with you.

143
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,460
I assume you're the one they're after.

144
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,940
You think you're so great just because you have a bit of money?

145
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,340
Money may not mean much,

146
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,320
but try saying that

147
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,480
after you leave this house. Go on, get out of here!

148
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,840
Master is worried about you, and so am I.

149
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,110
Young Master.

150
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,250
No one is allowed to follow him.

151
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,940
Without the Luo family, he's nothing!

152
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,300
Li.

153
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,260
Yes.

154
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,290
Inform everyone: no helping him, no offering him a place to stay.

155
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,710
Let's see how he manages without money.

156
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,260
Should I ask Immortal Four to follow him?

157
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,620
No need!

158
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,039
He'll come back once he's out of options.

159
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,600
Master, what works on him isn't forceful demands—

160
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,710
it's understanding.

161
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,510
He's not like me.

162
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,220
A kid isn't a robot.

163
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,000
He told you not to follow, and you actually didn't?

164
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,110
Weren't you the one saying you'd

165
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,330
stay by my side no matter what?

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,820
And

167
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,770
where are you

168
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,860
when I need you most?

169
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,060
Being alone isn't

170
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,170
such a big deal.

171
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,950
Babe, I want that one!

172
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,400
No problem. Leave it to me.

173
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,450
Come on!

174
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,010
Good thing your boyfriend didn't come today.

175
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,480
He's not my boyfriend.

176
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,430
Don't be shy about it. We are open to it now.

177
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,590
He treats you so well.

178
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:52,830
(Young Master refuses to see me)
(Young Master wants to see me)
(Young Master wants me to be with him)
(Young Master wants me to take him home)

179
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,870
If you don't want people grabbing it, don't put it out there.

180
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,040
What's the point of something you can see but can't catch?

181
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,230
Just like that robot—

182
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,600
how could he side with Luo Daqiang?

183
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,610
Heartless!

184
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,620
Just another tool you can buy with money.

185
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:11,990
That's fine.

186
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,390
I'll save up and buy one myself someday.

187
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,360
I'm not a tool. I can think.

188
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,530
And even if you have the money in the future,

189
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,260
I won't let you buy another one.

190
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,610
Didn't Luo Daqiang forbid you from following me?

191
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,110
How could I leave you out here alone?

192
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,460
So, Young Master,

193
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,410
because of you, I broke the rules.

194
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,640
You'd better take responsibility.

195
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,080
What happens if you break the rules?

196
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,040
It's 10 PM. Time to go home and study.

197
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,380
I'm running away from home.

198
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,970
Am I supposed to study on the side of the road?

199
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,070
I'll keep you company.

200
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,890
That old man is ruthless.

201
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,780
He even told everyone not to lend me money.

202
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,050
Does he really think he can force me back like this?

203
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,980
Young Master, don't you have any cash left?

204
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,230
What did you spend all your money on?

205
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,000
Why don't you call Zhou Zhenqun?

206
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,830
He'll definitely help you—

207
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,860
or at least let you stay at his place.

208
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,610
There are so many mosquitoes out here. You won't sleep well.

209
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,150
You don't need to sleep,

210
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,290
so make yourself useful and chase them away for me.

211
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,440
So, you went to the bank earlier

212
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,060
to lend money to Zhou Zhenqun?

213
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,530
But he doesn't seem like someone who'd be short on cash.

214
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,230
Or...

215
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,570
Was it his family? A friend?

216
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,130
Sharp guess.

217
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,840
It wasn't Zhou Zhenqun's debt—

218
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,660
it's that guy from the café he works at.

219
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,020
I know. Lin Jiaqian.

220
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,020
Height: 182 cm, weight: 73.2 kg.

221
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,520
Why do you know his stats so well?

222
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,020
Thinking of defecting?

223
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,870
I remember

224
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,940
everyone around you.

225
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,830
Anyway, it wasn't Lin Jiaqian's debt either.

226
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,410
It was his dad's.

227
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,370
It's just a million—

228
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,360
why blow it out of proportion?

229
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,730
I settled it to keep Zhou Zhenqun

230
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,090
out of trouble.

231
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,210
And I let Zhou Zhenqun take back the IOU.

232
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,200
Then why didn't you

233
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,480
tell Mr. Luo?

234
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,380
That way, he wouldn't be so angry.

235
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,950
Once,

236
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,300
Luo Daqiang yelled at Zhou Zhenqun,

237
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,480
accusing him of approaching me for money.

238
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,160
Zhou Zhenqun stormed off

239
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,130
and said we should cut ties.

240
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,370
I won't give Luo Daqiang

241
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,270
any more reasons to misunderstand Zhou Zhenqun.

242
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,270
He must be so touched—

243
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,050
after all, you're out here broke because of him.

244
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,500
You've only got 256 left.

245
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,850
Lin Jiaqian should be the one touched—

246
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,960
he's got a fool carrying

247
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,280
all this weight for him.

248
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,160
I envy him.

249
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,790
You don't have to.

250
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,160
You have me.

251
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,100
That's true.

252
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,150
You're braving the elements with me here.

253
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,430
Sleepy?

254
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,900
You haven't answered me yet.

255
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,680
What happens when you break orders?

256
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,580
A verbal warning.

257
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,760
If I don't listen, I'm punished.

258
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,760
If that doesn't work, I get reset and reassigned.

259
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,860
Basically,

260
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,470
AI won't defy orders.

261
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,920
That sounds a lot like

262
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,310
how bad students get disciplined—

263
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,180
scolded by the teacher,

264
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,690
given corporal punishment, then transferred.

265
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,660
I didn't feel much about it when I was a good student.

266
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,650
But once I started acting out,

267
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,760
I got to experience all kinds of things.

(Immortal series No. Four has received a complaint. Please contact your employer immediately for correction)

Did you get scolded when you went home yesterday?

270
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,430
Sorry for waking you up so early.

271
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,540
I didn't sleep all night.

272
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,160
I wanted to ask: if Lin Jiaqian finds out

273
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,290
I paid his debt,

274
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,540
how should I explain it so he won't get mad?

275
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,359
He always gets upset

276
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,359
when we talk about things like this.

277
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,319
We should've taken it slower yesterday.

278
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,760
What if he asks where the money came from?

279
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,980
Should I tell him I borrowed it from you?

280
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,590
Hey, are you listening?

281
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,570
I am.

282
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,240
Who are you?

283
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,640
The only one by his side is me—Immortal Four.

284
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,740
Great, I've been talking so much for nothing.

285
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,190
Let him answer the phone himself!

286
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,330
It's your problem to deal with your man.

287
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,380
Don't worry, Young Master.

288
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,130
No drooling last night.

289
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,550
Just two instances of talking in your sleep,

290
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,140
three of teeth grinding,

291
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,560
and four body twitches.

292
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,600
You slept well and didn't get

293
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,230
bitten by mosquitoes.

294
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,190
Just to be clear, I'm not going back.

295
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,990
Do you think Luo Daqiang will really file a complaint

296
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,240
against you and get you punished?

297
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,030
Don't worry.

298
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,350
I said, no one was allowed to follow him.

299
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,470
Give Luo Bushi a warning—

300
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,030
let's see what he can do on his own!

301
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,420
If you dare step out the door,

302
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,450
I'll report you to Hengji.

303
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,380
I risked a lot to come with you.

304
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,510
Be good.

305
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,950
Good morning.

306
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,090
Take care of him for me.

307
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,840
No wandering off. Don't make me worry.

308
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,220
What do you

309
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,870
want to eat later?

(Employer complaint regarding Immortal series No. Four are not yet canceled.

312
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,260
Your dad was really harsh, kicking you out.

313
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,940
Did you actually sleep in the park last night?

314
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,720
Consider it a life experience.

315
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,100
But Immortal Four—

316
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,330
he has no money at all?

317
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,850
Do you end up spending on him instead?

318
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,140
And yet you teased me about

319
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,290
being tricked by Lin Jiaqian.

320
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,330
You and Immortal Four...

321
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,830
I can take care of you both for a few days.

322
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,170
Come sleep at my place tonight.

323
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,220
No need.

324
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,360
This is between me and my dad.

325
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,360
I don't want to drag you into it.

326
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,190
Your dad just has a bad temper and sharp words.

327
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,780
Not like Lin Jiaqian's dad,

328
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,520
who owes people money.

329
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,320
Zhou Zhenqun.

330
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:14,970
The debt is on me.

331
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,120
Why did you pay off my debt?

332
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,440
Why are you so mad?

333
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,710
I paid it off for you—

334
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,120
what's the problem? Is it your pride?

335
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,580
What right do you have to interfere?

336
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,210
The right that comes with having money.

337
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,380
When people came to Zhou Zhenqun for payment,

338
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,580
I was there. Where were you?

339
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,090
Oh, right, working a job.

340
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,500
Come on.

341
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,150
I told him to stay away from me.

342
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,770
He's stupid and he cares about you.

343
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,260
Otherwise, I'd rather donate the money

344
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,170
than lend it to you.

345
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,490
Is pride really that important?

346
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,160
At least now you won't have debt piling up with interest crushing you.

347
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,630
This class you're supposed to check in—

348
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,280
hurry up.

349
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,280
I'll meet you after I'm done.

350
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,780
Go. Don't make Immortal Four worry.

351
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,500
Go.

352
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,030
I know I overstepped,

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,590
Besides, I hate seeing you struggle so much.

A million may

359
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,350
be easy for you,

360
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,440
but for me,

361
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,070
it's unattainable no matter how hard I try.

362
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,360
If I really can't make it, I could ask others for help,

363
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,660
but I just don't want you

364
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,570
to see me in such a sorry state.

365
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,150
I almost had to drop out of school

366
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,110
once to scrape together money.

367
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,680
Luo Bushi helped me pay my tuition.

368
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,680
At the time, I felt utterly humiliated,

369
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,760
but he said, "If money can solve it,

370
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,860
don't worry about it.

371
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,790
Your future is

372
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,510
the most important thing."

373
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,920
Luckily, it was Luo Bushi I met that day.

374
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,350
You don't know this,

375
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,890
but he's so rich that money's all he has left.

376
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,310
Just think of it as

377
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,400
him doing a good deed.

378
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,010
Now that the debt's cleared,

379
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,800
you don't have to keep hiding

380
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,240
or running away.

381
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,930
At least you can get back to studying.

382
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:22,970
You can earn money slowly

383
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,050
and pay it back gradually.

384
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,360
I don't think pride matters that much.

385
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,520
Just think—

386
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,780
your creditor is now Luo Bushi.

387
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,230
The benefits?

388
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,020
One, he won't pressure you.

389
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,140
Two, no interest.

390
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,370
Three, you get a cute debt collector.

391
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,720
You're really stupid.

392
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,360
What if I don't pay it back and run away?

393
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,380
I believe you won't.

394
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,630
When I was a kid,

395
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,690
I was falsely accused of stealing by my classmates.

396
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,330
Someone stood up for me

397
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,310
and said he believed me.

398
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,310
He even said he wanted to be my friend.

399
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,590
But shortly after,

400
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,600
he transferred schools.

401
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,330
But I've been waiting for him.

402
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,060
This is me.

403
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,850
That's you.

404
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,640
No wonder you always seemed familiar.

405
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,930
You recognized me long ago, didn't you?

406
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,940
Why didn't you tell me?

407
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,870
No.

408
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,580
When I met you,

409
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,580
I was already busy dodging debt collectors.

410
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,460
How could I tell that?

411
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,070
Besides, you seemed to be doing well.

412
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,600
There's nothing good about it.

413
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,330
Did you see Luo Bushi looking down on me because I was poor?

414
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,260
No, right?

415
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,280
So now,

416
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,840
you are my creditor.

417
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,450
I'll pledge myself to you.

418
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,090
Don't worry—

419
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:14,750
I won't run.

420
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,650
Because I want to be more than just friends with you.

421
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,200
Let's give it a try then.

422
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,630
Manual labor doesn't earn much.

423
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,800
I'll have to think of something else.

424
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,890
(International entertainment company hiring across Taiwan. High hourly wages up to 1,000 TWD)
(Part-time jobs, side hustles, career shifts)

425
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,610
Why are your clothes so dirty?

426
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,180
I worked to earn money.

427
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,400
I have no ID

428
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,340
and only worked six hours today.

429
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,590
Give me more time next time.

430
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,680
I can definitely earn more.

431
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,070
Feels like we're a pair of

432
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,560
star-crossed lovers kicked out of our homes.

433
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,340
I'm studying hard; you're working hard.

434
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,980
Why star-crossed lovers?

435
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,710
I'm moving cargo on land, not water.

436
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,120
Let's go.

437
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,210
After dinner, shopping,

438
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,710
and buying snacks,

439
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,540
we don't have enough money for a hotel tonight.

440
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,730
I'm sorry.

441
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,960
But I can't have you sleeping in the park again.

442
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:00,820
Let's go.

443
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,010
These four suites are fine for me—

444
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,460
Young Master, which one do you like?

445
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,870
Those two guys are in such a rush.

446
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,300
This can't wait.

447
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,650
It'll be too late. As long as there's

448
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,370
a bed and a bathroom, anywhere is fine.

449
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,370
No matter the place,

450
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,370
as long as you're there.

451
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,350
Wherever Young Master goes,

452
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,070
that's where I'll be.

453
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,240
Human aesthetics are so mysterious.

462

Young Master, you want to see it?

463
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,500
You got proposed?

464
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,750
I should have gotten down on one knee.

465
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,250
When did I become your boyfriend?

466
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,120
I can be your boyfriend. Anytime.

467
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,430
You're one of a kind.

468
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,110
You're mine.

469
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,460
