1
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
"Eternal Butler"

2
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,000
(Episode 5: Who Did What to Whom?)

3
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:25,100
It's fine, Lo Bushi.

4
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,933
Just think of it

5
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:31,367
as using a precise tool, right?

6
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,000
It's not like you lost a piece of yourself.

7
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:50,433
Everyone makes mistakes, right?

8
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,900
A first time like this...

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,333
Doesn't really count, does it?

10
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:00,700
Nope.

11
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,200
So, after unlocking the additional function,

12
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,433
how did you handle things?

13
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:11,167
Ever since it was activated,

14
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:12,900
my master has been so much gentler with me.

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,533
He even said to me,

16
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:15,900
"You're mine."

17
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,267
I was just trying to understand

18
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:21,367
the difference between using and being used.

19
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:23,833
You should ask Unit 2 about that.

20
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:26,367
After all, that's its primary function.

21
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:30,100
I'm not asking about technique.

22
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,767
Not about technique?

23
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:33,433
Then, like I said before,

24
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,467
it's all about emotion.

25
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,200
Give plenty of love and care,

26
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,000
and your master will understand eventually.

27
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:43,967
Young Master, are you feeling better?

28
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,000
Awake.

29
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,300
You were up so late last night.

30
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,300
Do you want to sleep more,

31
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,533
or eat something?

32
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:28,267
Oh, it's you. What a coincidence.

33
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:30,233
I don't remember much about last night, but...

34
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,200
Thanks for lending me your bed.

35
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,033
Last night, you borrowed more than just my bed.

36
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,100
The effects of the drug kicked in,

37
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:47,400
and you also borrowed my hand.

38
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,800
My hand?

39
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,133
Lie down.

40
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:57,600
Zhou Zhenqun.

41
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,667
What are you doing? Lie down.

42
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,000
Zhou Zhenqun.

43
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:08,900
Lie down.

44
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,733
Calm down.

45
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,333
Alright.

46
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,767
But how did you end up being drugged?

47
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,367
I have no idea.

48
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,767
It must've been something in that drink last night.

49
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:40,000
Good thing I was the one who found you.

50
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,767
What if it had been someone else?

51
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,033
If you can't protect yourself,
don't go to places like that.

52
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,900
Be more careful.

53
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,033
But I was lucky.

54
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:56,600
I'm glad it was you.

55
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,367
You kindly brought me back,

56
00:04:58,467 --> 00:04:59,667
lent me your bed,

57
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,267
and didn't take advantage of me.

58
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:04,667
But look at me.

59
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,700
Chased around by debt collectors.

60
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:09,433
Aren't you scared?

61
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,033
Not scared.

62
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,967
Or are you like this with everyone?

63
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,667
Only with you.

64
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,900
So, he really doesn't remember.

65
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,600
Maybe it's better this way.

66
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:33,567
Are you alright?

67
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,933
Sitting on this will be more comfortable.

68
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:23,467
It's too bland. Pass me the chili sauce.

69
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:26,100
You were up all night yesterday.

70
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,033
Chili will irritate your stomach.

71
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:30,467
I don't want you to regret it.

72
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:36,867
It was supposed to be red bean rice,

73
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:38,267
but considering your hangover,

74
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:40,067
I made red bean soup instead.

75
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,400
After all, your first time...

76
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:47,267
It wasn't my first time.

77
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,700
Still not satisfied.

78
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,667
Let's not talk about last night anymore, okay?

79
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,800
I've never used that function before.

80
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,500
It's like you humans getting a driver's license.

81
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,033
Like,

82
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,800
a novice on the road.

83
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:11,467
I didn't skip anything

84
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:13,200
that would make it comfortable for you.

85
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,733
Even though you were drugged,

86
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:17,500
your sensory reactions were heightened.

87
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,833
But I was careful,

88
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:24,100
knowing the drug amplified your physiological responses.

89
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,933
I didn't want to hurt you.

90
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:31,367
Let's leave it at that.

91
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,567
Should we go to the hospital?

92
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,867
In case the drug's effects linger, or last night...

93
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:40,800
No.

94
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,533
If this gets out, where would I put my face?

95
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:46,233
And if Lo Da-qiang finds out, he'll lecture me again.

96
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,733
Then stop trying to prove your existence this way.

97
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,533
It's not worth it.

98
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:56,267
If you want excitement,

99
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll keep you company.

100
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,300
Keep me company?

101
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,533
For this year, or for a lifetime?

102
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:03,867
Who do you think you are?

103
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,967
I have plenty of friends. Why would I need you?

104
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,567
You're just a tool.

105
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:12,233
A perfectly programmed tool
tailored to an employer's needs.

106
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't throw philosophy at me.

107
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:21,367
Artificial intelligence isn't a tool.

108
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,400
No one has ever forced me to do anything.

109
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,967
Can you refuse an employer's needs?

110
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,567
Can you defy the company's arrangements?

111
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:32,100
How long can you be responsible?

112
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,133
Stop pretending you don't need help

113
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:36,600
by provoking me.

114
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,767
I'll figure something out.

115
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:40,033
Just wait.

116
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:51,167
You know what, Young Master?

117
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:52,533
You're such a masochist.

118
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,733
Seems like being forceful suits you better.

119
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:03,000
From now on,

120
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,400
no more parties for you.

121
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,367
Your birthday,

122
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,533
I'll handle it.

123
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:14,067
What have you been watching?

124
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,400
A masochist, really?

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,733
Why should I listen to you?

126
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,333
Force it, then.

127
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,467
Let me ask you something.

128
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,833
Does the person who created you ever contact you?

129
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:47,633
Sometimes I think my mom was really ruthless.

130
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:50,933
When she left, she cut all ties.

131
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:53,600
She's probably thrilled now.

132
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't have enough data

133
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,733
to analyze your mom's thoughts.

134
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,600
No need to analyze.

135
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,633
It's just the fate of being abandoned.

136
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,033
Not necessarily.

137
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:07,433
Our creator, Wei Heng, once said,

138
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,633
humans may abandon or be abandoned

139
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,900
for various reasons,

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,767
but don't resent it.

141
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:15,600
Instead, choose to face it all.

142
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,300
Hello?

143
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,433
Something came up here.

144
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:30,800
I won't make it back for your birthday.

145
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,567
Have you ever made it to my birthday?

146
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,333
Aren't you always
celebrating with the twins who share my birthday,

147
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:38,433
enjoying family time with them?

148
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:39,833
Lo Bushi,

149
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,800
watch your attitude.

150
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,667
They're your siblings too.

151
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:44,900
Enough.

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,367
Stop dragging unrelated people

153
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:48,000
into my life.

154
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,000
Sir,

155
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,167
Young Master has me with him. No need to rush back.

156
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:52,867
Better if you don't come back.

157
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:53,867
I enjoy being alone.

158
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:55,433
No one to control me.

159
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,167
Young Master,

160
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,067
you need to realize they didn't abandon you.

161
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,767
They abandoned themselves.

162
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:17,700
Do not...

163
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,200
open that.

164
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,833
Before you came, no one could enter my room.

165
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,467
It's full of dirty clothes.

166
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,667
I just throw them in there after wearing them.

167
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:32,633
The housekeeper only
comes in when I'm not around to clean up.

168
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:34,500
After you showed up,

169
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,100
I forgot about the stuff in there.

170
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,867
Does that mean

171
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,467
I'm special to you?

172
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,767
I'm here now.

173
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:04,900
That's against the rules.

174
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:10,967
How can he be so gentle?

175
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:41,300
Is it possible that nothing happened,

176
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,333
and we just slept under the same blanket?

177
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,167
Last night,

178
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:58,733
first it was like this,

179
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:09,167
and then like this.

180
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,000
Young Master,

181
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,900
if you want to remember, I can help.

182
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,400
And if the effects of the drug haven't worn off,

183
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,333
I can assist again.

184
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,400
After all, you've said before

185
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,967
my duties

186
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:33,233
include meeting the employer's needs.

187
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,867
No need to go that far.

188
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,667
Let's keep some boundaries between master and servant.

189
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:19,300
I've been navigating nightlife for years,

190
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,000
but this time, I hit a wall.

191
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:22,933
Zhou Zhenqun,

192
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,467
did you upset someone?

193
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:26,233
Me?

194
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,800
Doesn't it look like this was all aimed at you?

195
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,767
Luckily, Ever 4 was there last night.

196
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:33,300
Otherwise, our reputations would've been ruined.

197
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:39,567
Why is he standing so far away?

198
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:40,900
Must be because you partied too hard last night.

199
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
He's probably fuming right now.

200
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,633
That guy looks familiar.

201
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:53,300
His name's Lin Jia-qian.

202
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,233
This is where he works.

203
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,900
Thank goodness he saved me last night.

204
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,900
He's a good person, didn't take advantage of me.

205
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But I think

206
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,567
I might've taken advantage of him.

207
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,933
Even you could take advantage of someone?

208
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,267
How could I?

209
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,667
You got taken advantage of by him?

210
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,233
No way.

211
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,800
Of course, he's the one who got taken advantage of by me.

212
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:20,633
Ever 4 is basically the perfect loyal dog.

213
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:21,900
He's so good to you.

214
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,167
Why don't you just be together?

215
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:25,800
Why is he "on the top"?

216
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,800
Isn't it good to have someone care for you?

217
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,433
One day, when the time's up, he'll leave.

218
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:40,033
There's no future for us being together.

219
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,567
If there's no future,

220
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:43,233
is there any point in starting?

221
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:52,667
Lo Bushi,

222
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,100
don't let your parents

223
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,433
make you feel like you deserve unhappiness.

224
00:15:58,533 --> 00:15:59,933
Sorry.

225
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:02,967
Let me gather my stuff.

226
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,433
It's time to head home.

227
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,567
Let's go.

228
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:12,133
Wait for me to clean up.

229
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:23,500
Following me like this,
aren't you afraid of being deceived?

230
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,200
I'm plain and boring.

231
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,767
Who would bother deceiving me?

232
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,633
Someone might, without you even knowing,

233
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,600
cares about you, though.

234
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,067
That's the first time anyone's said that.

235
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,233
Here, take this.

236
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:48,600
Zhou Zhenqun is very close to you.

237
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,033
He's been the only one from childhood to now.

238
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:56,800
So, does he like you, or do you like him?

239
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,500
Being together doesn't mean you like someone.

240
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,400
Does being with No. 9

241
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,067
mean you like them?

242
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,833
Like you said,

243
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:07,600
you were reassigned by the company.

244
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,167
No. 9 was the only one who dared to reach out.

245
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:11,767
Everyone else was afraid of punishment.

246
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:15,000
Zhenqun stuck with me, even though people said

247
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,233
he was only hanging around

248
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,467
to gain connections.

249
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:21,933
I'm grateful he never left.

250
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:23,533
He's always been there.

251
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,233
I always see you with Lo Bushi.

252
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,400
We grew up

253
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,900
together.

254
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,767
Whenever I was bullied,

255
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:40,300
he was always in front of me.

256
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
We made a promise.

257
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,000
To work hard together in the future,

258
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,233
but most importantly, to be happy together.

259
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,633
So, we ended up drugged together,

260
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,733
dragged away together,

261
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,300
but luckily, nothing worse happened to us.

262
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:56,467
You really need to be more careful.

263
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,233
Give me your phone.

264
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,867
My phone?

265
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,667
Here's my number.

266
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,967
Call me if you ever need anything.

267
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,533
Get in the car.

268
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:18,700
So if I call you, you'll show up for sure?

269
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,533
Last time you were still being chased.

270
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:23,567
You could've warned me.

271
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,300
Sorry about that.

272
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,533
Let's go.

273
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,233
Doing anything improper in the car could be risky.

274
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,533
If you're feeling tempted, we'll be home soon.

275
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:20,333
Who's tempted?

276
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:22,933
If it weren't for your weird "glasses sadist" setting,

277
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:25,067
how could you have such control over me?

278
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:28,267
My glasses are my valve switch.

279
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,633
If forcibly removed,

280
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:32,100
the sadistic personality setting is triggered.

281
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,767
But if removed voluntarily,

282
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:36,633
I can still maintain control.

283
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:40,800
What kind of crazy setting is that?

284
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,200
So, is this okay now?

285
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,500
Every Heng series model

286
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,000
has a trigger key.

287
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,833
My forced shutdown system

288
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,500
is linked to my eyes.

289
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,033
You're telling me your weakness is your eyes?

290
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:16,300
Aren't you afraid I'll exploit it next time?

291
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:24,333
I laid my weakness before you

292
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,700
because I trust you.

293
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:31,000
And I hope you can trust me too.

294
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,167
What are you doing?

295
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:39,000
Throw it away. No need for it.

296
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,767
My principles

297
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:49,600
bend because of you.

298
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,567
You're so special to me.

299
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:58,000
Why, my Young Master?

300
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,967
Principles are meant to be broken.

301
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:16,533
The one who easily breaks my principles

302
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:19,333
is you, with your unintentional words and actions.

303
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:21,500
Can robots defy orders?

304
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,667
Generally, no.

305
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:23,700
What happens if they do?

306
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,967
Punishment.

307
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:27,467
Which model in the series is the most obedient?

308
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:28,567
Model 5.

309
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:31,267
It's a secretary model, so it strictly follows commands.

310
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:32,567
Which one is the most romantic?

311
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,833
Model 9.

312
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,800
That's the one you're closest with, right?

313
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:40,967
Which one is the most handsome?

314
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:45,467
Generally, Model 2.

315
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:47,500
What's its specialty?

316
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,700
Multifunctional sensory enhancement tools.

317
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,733
What does "multifunctional" mean?

318
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:59,433
Young Master, it's time for bed.

319
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,367
You sound like you're managing a grade schooler.

320
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:03,900
Fine, one last question.

321
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,467
Which one is the smartest?

322
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,467
It can only be me.

323
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,033
Bold claim.

324
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:12,800
Do you actually have a customer service line?

325
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,733
Can I exchange products?

326
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,200
Young Master.

327
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:22,567
Do you really think I'm not good enough?

328
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:24,833
Not really.

329
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:25,800
You're pretty satisfactory.

330
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,500
But I haven't compared you with others.
How would I know?

331
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,200
You scared me.

332
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,100
Why'd you suddenly freeze up?

333
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,633
That's terrifying.

334
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,800
You want to exchange me?

335
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,500
Am I really not doing a good job?

336
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,900
You're the best robot, Ever 4.

337
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,667
I'm still waiting for you to celebrate my birthday.

338
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:21,233
Don't even dream about it.

339
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,800
I'll make sure you can't leave me.

340
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:50,533
(Next Episode)
I'm not afraid.

341
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,433
I want to stay by your side.

342
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:55,500
The moment I'm gone, he gets into trouble.

343
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:57,167
And he's so hard to please,

344
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:58,267
plus, he never listens.

345
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:00,567
He's just a tsundere masochist.

346
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,733
Is your professor like this too?

347
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,067
I'm yours.

348
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:05,933
Do whatever you want with me.

349
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,500
Should I just find a girlfriend?

350
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,733
Ever 4 makes a perfect boyfriend.

351
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,133
My Young Master has only me.

352
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:17,767
Unless you drive me away.
