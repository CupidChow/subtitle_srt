1
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,010
(Eternal Butler)

2
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,110
(Mission 10: I won't let anything happen to you)

3
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,660
Stop nagging.

4
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,940
I don't want the money anymore.

5
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,310
Go to hell!

6
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,820
Kill him!

7
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,960
Die!

8
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,500
Big Brother.

9
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,470
Let's go.

10
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,600
Big Brother, let's go.

11
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,410
Fine, let's go!

12
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,570
Did they do anything to you?

13
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,420
The watermelon knife left a big cut,

14
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,910
and there was a lot of bleeding.

15
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,410
Don't be scared, I'm here.

16
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,740
Back then,

17
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,410
my mom almost died like this.

18
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,910
I let you go just

19
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,160
to want you to be okay.

20
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,160
It doesn't matter who you're with.

21
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,880
I don't want you to go through this because of me.

22
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,710
I'll always be by your side.

23
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,790
How did you know I was here?

24
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,480
So, there's a tracker inside.

25
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,870
I told you, I would not leave you.

26
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,079
I didn't know

27
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,360
that it's so quiet right now.

28
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,360
It feels like the end of the world.

29
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,860
Just the two of us.

30
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,850
To me, you are my world.

31
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,310
Did you get electrocuted?

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,060
That's not something you'd say.

33
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,110
When you were taken,

34
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,170
What I felt was more painful than an electric shock.

35
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,360
I even started hating myself.

36
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,070
Why didn't I protect you?

37
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,340
I knew you'd find me.

38
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,590
They didn't do anything to me.

39
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,840
They just wouldn't let me have instant noodles, so I'm starving.

40
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,590
I didn't get to eat hotpot or ice cream either.

41
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,590
And now I'm all dirty.

42
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,700
Tonight,

43
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,950
you'll take good care of me.

44
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,610
I don't get what all these emotions are.

45
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,950
I just know,

46
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,840
I can't accept you not being by my side.

47
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,380
By the way, Young Master,

48
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,830
I haven't asked you about today yet.

49
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,080
You kicked me out of the house today,

50
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,170
what's that about?

51
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,830
I care about you,

52
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,080
and I don't want you to suffer because of me.

53
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,580
So, you just decided on your own?

54
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,470
Is this what humans call

55
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,540
abandonment?

56
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm tired and hungry.

57
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,520
Let's go home first,

58
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,520
take a shower, have a meal, and then talk.

59
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,360
Let's go.

60
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,100
Luo Bushi said

61
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,140
today is his and Immortal Four‘s

62
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,580
trial period anniversary.

63
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,550
Can you stop mentioning Luo Bushi all the time?

64
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,550
I mean,

65
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,830
the only mutual friend we have

66
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,520
is Luo Bushi.

67
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,970
I've always been someone

68
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,230
who's alone.

69
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,120
I don't have any friends.

70
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,510
Alone?

71
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,690
So, have you ever had

72
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,800
a boyfriend or girlfriend?

73
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,470
Only you treat me like a treasure.

74
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,950
Zhou Zhenqun,

75
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,120
I don't care about the past, but the future.

76
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,970
You said they have a trial period, what about us?

77
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,860
Depending on how you perform, we can shorten it.

78
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,180
How do you know you need to test me?

79
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,480
Shouldn't it be me testing you?

80
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,460
Hey, Lin Jiaqian,

81
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,180
I'm testing you, right?

82
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,270
Turn around.

83
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,110
Right?

84
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,659
We'll head back tomorrow

85
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,380
and make Luo Daqiang cancel the complaints in person.

86
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,070
He canceled.

87
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,870
That was quick.

88
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,780
He still has a conscience.

89
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,560
The data shows

90
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,560
that scents can increase two people's affinity

91
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,020
and add some romance.

92
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,250
When the air is filled with scent,

93
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,000
it turns into a catalyst.

94
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,750
Scent and music.

95
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,250
Young Master, don't you think

96
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,750
we lacked a little...

97
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,049
romance before?

98
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,970
A robot

99
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,250
is talking about romance with a grown man?

100
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,830
Isn't that a bit…

101
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,970
Why are you looking at me like that?

102
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,920
I like looking at you like this, Young Master.

103
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,240
Don't you think

104
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,390
we should

105
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,970
do something?

106
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,410
Young Master,

107
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,430
I belong to you.

108
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,960
What about you?

109
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,750
You talk too much.

110
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,460
This time,

111
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,950
let me do it.

112
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,590
I'm warning you.

113
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,140
Don't act like yesterday...

114
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,920
I thought it was something you liked.

115
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,190
At home, just control yourself a little.

116
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,870
So it's okay if we're not at home?

117
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,510
Don't lose your temper with him.

118
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,640
He took good care of you and brought you back.

119
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
So, what reward do you want?

120
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,160
Or does your company have a

121
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,380
reward or merit system?

122
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,630
First, agree not to make a complaint anymore.

123
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,100
You are making deals with me?

124
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,990
Then you can't cause trouble for me anymore.

125
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,060
Good.

126
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,690
Nice.

127
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,290
You're finally learning to take responsibility for your own thing.

128
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,820
He's not a thing.

129
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,370
Then what is he?

130
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,440
Actually, Immortal Four and I...

131
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,740
What about you and Immortal Four?

132
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,800
We...

133
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,040
Master, I've already told Young Master.

134
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,700
I'll make a long stay by his side.

135
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,070
What? Did I hear that right?

136
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,620
You want to make a long stay at our place?

137
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,750
Let me think.

138
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,360
Why not let me tell him?

139
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,680
Young Master, we need a strategy.

140
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,800
Impulse won't get us anywhere.

141
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,840
Doesn't matter.

142
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,880
If he disagrees, I'll leave here.

143
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,650
I'm familiar with this.

144
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,580
I'll sell off the stuff at home,

145
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,860
so he can't control me.

146
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:21,760
But,

147
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,400
what if Hengji Intelligence Technology disagrees?

148
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,570
Who wouldn't agree?

149
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,910
Your family.

150
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,080
Actually, I don't think we need to tell them.

151
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,580
I think things are good

152
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,310
the way they are right now.

153
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,600
But I already told them.

154
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,010
You told them?

155
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,990
So, what was their reaction?

156
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,980
They said it's up to me.

157
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,090
Did you tell them I'm a guy?

158
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,400
Of course, what else?

159
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,980
And I also told them

160
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,480
we were in the same class in elementary school.

161
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,690
Anyway, I've got older siblings.

162
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,010
My parents could never control me.

163
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,510
So, there's no pressure on me.

164
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,070
I'll treat you well.

165
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,160
The one you asked out

166
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,660
is No. 9's boyfriend?

167
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,500
Are you getting used to living with humans?

168
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,060
I'm really used to being around Luo Bushi.

169
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,900
So, what are you going to do from now on?

170
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,620
I think you and Immortal Nine

171
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,930
are so happy.

172
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,390
But that's because my uncle helped.

173
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,460
It's Wei Heng.

174
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,250
Because of him,

175
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,120
Immortal Nine can stay by my side

176
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,060
like a human.

177
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,580
So, you're saying

178
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,280
this only applies to Immortal Nine?

179
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,330
Luo Bushi is not you.

180
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,780
So we won't get Wei Heng's help either?

181
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,250
If you're definitely going to leave,

182
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,550
then you can't let him get used to your presence.

183
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,940
You have to know,

184
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,170
that human memories are complex.

185
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,730
They're hard to erase completely.

186
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,650
It's too late now.

187
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,120
I promised him I wouldn't leave.

188
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,400
What's going on now?

189
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,020
Where Lin Jiaqian is, that's where you are.

190
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,370
Immortal Four follows you all the time.

191
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
Finally coming to fruition.

192
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,080
Congratulations to you both.

193
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,640
Let them take you home.

194
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,410
I can go back myself.

195
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,980
Don't worry.

196
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,250
I'll make sure Luo Bushi gets home safely.

197
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,100
Wait at home for me.

198
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,810
This is a thoughtful service for our creditors,

199
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,390
so you won't get tied up again.

200
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,950
Your friend Immortal Four is kind of cute.

201
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,380
You like him?

202
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,670
He's cute?

203
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,220
Which one's cuter?

204
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,440
Is there someone you like?

205
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,820
You are my only one.

206
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,120
Are you

207
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,810
dating?

208
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,550
I told you,

209
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,070
Immortal Four's not human,

210
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,890
he's a robot.

211
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,300
Seriously?

212
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,480
But...

213
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,000
Hengji will hate me forever.

214
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,730
Do you really want to be with him?

215
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,940
You are

216
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,069
causing trouble for me.

217
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,740
Just two of us.

218
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,490
The other Immortals won't have this problem.

219
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:32,910
Obsessive.

220
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,790
The one who designed you,

221
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,410
he's the stubborn one.

222
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,150
But it's also to blame on Zhou Tianguang.

223
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,470
Normally,

224
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,210
you shouldn't have such disorderly interactions with humans.

225
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,890
No beginning, no problem.

226
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,430
But I'm actually glad

227
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,360
I met him.

228
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,360
It's the biggest joy of my life.

229
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,750
Let me ask you,

230
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,890
did the electric shocks from IES

231
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,480
cause any side effects?

232
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,440
I strongly recommend stopping it.

233
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,030
The high-frequency shocks after electric shock

234
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,150
could damage the core system.

235
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,940
Other Immortals bear more risk than I do.

236
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,660
Alright.

237
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,740
I'll go to Yiping first.

238
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,100
I'll think of a way

239
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,770
for the IES issue.

240
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,270
Don't get in trouble lately.

241
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,060
Master.

242
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,220
Where did you go while leaving Luo Bushi behind?

243
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,070
He's going back to Hengji Intelligence Technology for a routine update.

244
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,860
We are going to study.

245
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,100
Wait a minute.

246
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,880
Luo Bushi, did you cause trouble again?

247
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,580
If it wasn't for you

248
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,890
giving up 100 million in profit for me,

249
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,550
if it wasn't for you

250
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,930
decisively canceling the Immortal's complaints,

251
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,400
do you think I'd be standing here talking to you?

252
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,660
We've both been treating each other

253
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,990
the way we think is right.

254
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,130
But, if we think about it,

255
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,290
we can feel the intention.

256
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,600
Good night.

257
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,370
There's a way we can try.

258
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,720
You can buy out.

259
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,740
The company has a funding gap.

260
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,310
If they can sell problematic products,

261
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,520
this could be a breakthrough.

262
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,020
This incident

263
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,470
highlighted that the Immortal

264
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,840
can't control Immortal Four's independent consciousness.

265
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,950
There are two opinions inside the company now.

266
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,450
One, stop operation,

267
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,050
Two, dispose of it.

268
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,780
How can they dispose of it?

269
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,310
Why are you getting so excited?

270
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,100
Immortal Four is just artificial intelligence.

271
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,590
No matter how real it seems,

272
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,090
it can't be like a human.

273
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,600
Have you seriously thought about

274
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,370
what it would be like to be with a robot?

275
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,080
You'll

276
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
have a competent butler and bodyguard

277
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,590
accompanying you through as you marry, have kids,

278
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,600
grow old, and die

279
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,890
and eventually becomes a family heirloom.

280
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,420
I want to be with him for a lifetime.

281
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,810
He's not just a companion toy.

282
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,380
Like Immortal Nine.

283
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,490
What are you talking about?

284
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,370
None of you ever let me relax.

285
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,610
Which drama

286
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,010
or movie taught you this?

287
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,850
Immortal Four,

288
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,590
don't contact Immortal Nine for now.

289
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,230
It's bad for you to be targeted.

290
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,650
Besides, he shouldn't use his situation

291
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,830
to affect other models, got it?

292
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,540
As for you, Young Master,

293
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,240
I was just suggesting

294
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,700
a more likely possibility.

295
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,060
At least, he won't be recycled or reset

296
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,810
and sent to someone else. Got it?

297
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,840
Don't think things are that simple.

298
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,550
But, it's not that complicated either.

299
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,210
After all, in this world,

300
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,320
except for life and death,

301
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,500
there's nothing money can't solve.

302
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,840
So he says I can buy you?

303
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,310
But

304
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,430
it might cost a lot of money.

305
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,550
Why are you so expensive?

306
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,060
This is all your fault.

307
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,540
Saying you won't leave and you'll stay by my side,

308
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,080
but you don't even have any power.

309
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:50,900
Young Master,

310
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:53,980
I'm sorry.

311
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,010
You're a robot anyway.

312
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,280
But fortunately, you don't have experience.

313
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,710
Just ask Mr. Wei for help.

314
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,760
As for the rest, leave it to me.

315
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,520
This time, you listen to me.

316
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,310
As long as I can stay by Young Master's side,

317
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,050
I'm fine with anything.

318
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,460
So,

319
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,970
you only want to be a bystander in my life?

320
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,610
You'll attend my graduation,

321
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,020
be my driver when I date,

322
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,630
my best man at my wedding,

323
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,310
and help look after my kids when my wife gives birth.

324
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:58,510
By the way,

325
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,400
if I ever get divorced in the future…

326
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,080
So,

327
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,930
don't just stand by my side.

328
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,990
What I am looking for

329
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,470
is someone to spend my life with,

330
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,370
not someone to just take care of me.

331
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,970
It's not just me wanting to keep you,

332
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,430
and it's not just you wanting to stay.

333
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,350
So let's figure it out together.

334
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,710
I don't want you just to stay with me.

335
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,510
Master,

336
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,460
does the reward you mentioned last time still count?

337
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,280
Yes.

338
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,820
I want to stay by Young Master's side.

339
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,510
Aren't you already by his side?

340
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,770
Not as a bodyguard or attendant,

341
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,030
but as a lover.

342
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,700
A lover?

343
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,400
A lover?

344
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,420
So, you and him, you two...

345
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,410
You're not a man.

346
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,720
You're a robot.

347
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,490
Right, that's how it is.

348
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,350
He's really getting the most out of it.

349
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,270
It's fine, just treat you as a sex toy.

350
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,450
You're just a bit bigger,

351
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,810
and complete in function.

352
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,740
I can accept that. After all,

353
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,780
look at what era we're in, right?

354
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,530
It's him using you, right?

355
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,950
Look at his physique;

356
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,390
he should be using you.

357
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,460
I'll follow Young Master's wishes with everything.

358
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,390
Why aren't you leaving?

359
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,490
About your stay,

360
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,910
I'll discuss with your company.

361
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,650
I hope

362
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,170
that you weren't just contacting Hengji Intelligence Technology

363
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,510
to discuss an early return or exchange.

364
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,130
I have many strengths.

365
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,960
Housekeeping, traveling companion, tutor.

366
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,600
I can ensure safety

367
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,900
and do housework.

368
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,670
But the most important thing is,

369
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,890
with me here,

370
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,170
I'll protect Luo Bushi thoroughly.

371
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,460
You think you're meeting his parents, don't you?

372
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,080
You want me to hand Luo Bushi over to you?

373
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,070
Not a chance!

374
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,390
I think you're a pretty weird robot.

375
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,920
You interfered with me,

376
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,070
and now you're getting involved with my son!

377
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,120
Tell me,

378
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,980
are you plotting something?

379
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,410
Luo Daqiang!

380
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,190
What?

381
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,420
He's mine. I won't let you bully him.

382
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,010
I took care of you, and you took care of him.

383
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,480
When did you ever protect me?

384
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,190
Because he's always protecting me

385
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,470
while you always push me away to face things alone.

386
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,870
I don't need you to take care of him. I'll do it.

387
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,590
I'll definitely

388
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,450
treat him more important than myself.

389
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,590
A robot and a human.

395
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,400
let alone in a romantic relationship?

396
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,900
Exactly.

397
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,030
What the hell do you know?

398
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,360
Dad's not feeling well lately.

399
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,850
My heart's having some issues.

400
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,630
I care about the safety of humanity

401
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,130
more than any of you.

402
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,520
You can do whatever you want to me,

403
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,880
Because I only want to protect

404
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,580
one person.
