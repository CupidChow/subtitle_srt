00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
"Eternal Butler"

2
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,000
(Episode 8: You're One of a Kind)

3
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,733
Human aesthetics,

4
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,000
sometimes, are really intriguing.

5
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:22,800
This place, whether occupied or not,

6
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,533
is just for resting.

7
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:26,800
That's why I told you to switch rooms.

8
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:38,600
You worked all day.

9
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,067
Wash up before you get in bed.

10
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,467
He can't see this stuff.

11
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:00,967
No telling what he'd think.

12
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,000
(TENGA Bobble) (Realistic feel, high
elasticity)(Intricate design, varied stimulation)

13
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,933
(Vacuum suction, authentic grip)
(Compact size, discreet for travel)

14
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:47,767
Cheap knockoff.

15
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,900
Not needed.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,767
Not while I'm here.

17
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,833
Motels always have random stuff like this.

18
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,833
Not like I was planning to use it.

19
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:00,000
Just dry off and put on some clothes.

20
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:04,233
I have an auto-dry function.

21
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,167
Young Master, you wanna see?

22
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,400
Whatever you have, I have too. Big deal.

23
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,533
So you're just gonna
let Lo Bushi off the hook?

24
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,533
The client already said
so. Not much I can do.

25
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:48,833
But he's a cash cow.

26
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:52,433
And a handsome one at that.

27
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,167
Yeah,

28
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,267
you practically threw yourself at him.

29
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:01,333
What, changed your taste?

30
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:02,167
No way.

31
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:04,633
That kid's nothing compared to you.

32
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:07,867
Right?

33
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,900
Weren't you busy with something?

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,333
Lin borrowed 30,

35
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:13,667
turned it into a debt
of 102 and it got paid off.

36
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,233
Not my problem.

37
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,767
But rumor has it...

38
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,800
Lo Bushi was the one

39
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,200
who covered it.

40
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:28,300
Lo Bushi really went all in, huh?

41
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,167
Bit of a misstep.

42
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:43,400
Didn't think borrowing money

43
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,067
would end up like this.

44
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:49,867
Sorry. I wasn't capable enough...

45
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:51,667
to give you a good life.

46
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,833
Let it be a lesson.

47
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:58,433
From now on, we save up.

48
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,000
No more relying on Lo Daqiang.

49
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,233
Can't you guys hack into a bank

50
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,800
or make an ATM

51
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,233
spit out cash?

52
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,267
Or maybe...

53
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,333
rig the lottery numbers?

54
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:21,067
Illegal activities are off-limits.

55
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,967
That's in the prohibition rules.

56
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,367
It's already 2 AM.

57
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:29,900
You have an 8 AM class tomorrow.

58
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:34,633
Ugh, such a buzzkill.

59
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,500
First time we're sharing a bed.

60
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:43,767
I mean... while we're both awake.

61
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:57,300
This is nice.

62
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,433
If you have a nightmare,

63
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:01,800
I'll be right here to comfort you.

64
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:05,300
Why are you so good to me?

65
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,667
Because service comes first.

66
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,533
What do you think?

67
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,167
Wonder what it'd be like if
you were serving someone else.

68
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,967
If that person was obedient...

69
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:20,767
and sweet...

70
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:21,900
Shut up. Goodnight.

71
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:33,133
But you're one of a kind.

72
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,967
You're mine.

73
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,400
(Yellow Alert)

74
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,372
(Unit 4, you have been
confirmed in violation of employer

75
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:54,100
directives. Correct your
behavior within 72 hours)

76
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,033
Thanks, my new creditor.

77
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,767
If you wanna thank
someone, thank Zhou Zhenqun,

78
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,533
handsome, kind-hearted, generous.

79
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:18,233
I'm only doing this for him.

80
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,967
You and I? No ties whatsoever.

81
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:24,767
Just so you know,

82
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:29,067
no one has a stronger
bond with Zhenqun than I do.

83
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,567
So…

84
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:31,900
So…

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,867
So, the four of us...

86
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,700
just enough for a mahjong game.

87
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,700
Cheers.

88
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:51,200
Here, I'll peel a shrimp for you.

89
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,867
Zhou Zhenqun…

90
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,000
Since when did you get so pampered?

91
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,167
Can't even peel your own shrimp?

92
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:07,100
Pretty sure you're the pampered one.

93
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,600
You think you can finish all that?

94
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,033
Since when do you use a fork and knife?

95
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,000
And did I ever ask you
to peel shrimp for me?

96
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:20,567
Honestly, you and Ever 4 make a great pair.

97
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,233
Ever 4 and Lo Bushi, right?

98
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,467
Yeah, perfect match.

99
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,333
All talk, huh? Zhou Zhenqun,

100
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:32,167
you got something to say?

101
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:33,767
So, this "Zhen"

102
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:35,400
and this "Jia"…

103
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,767
What's the deal?

104
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:40,600
You're my good friend.

105
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,867
Of course, I had to tell you the good news.

106
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:44,200
We're

107
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:47,067
giving dating a shot.

108
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:50,133
Dating's dating. What's
with the "trying" part?

109
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:51,733
Lin Jiaqian…

110
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:56,300
Are you serious about him or not?

111
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,633
Of course I am.

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,733
Cheers.

113
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,067
Cheers.

114
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,967
Alright, that's enough.

115
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,667
Gotta admit, he's really
good at peeling shrimp.

116
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,833
I can't eat anymore.

117
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,067
Why the long face?

118
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,067
It's nothing.

119
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:21,233
Nothing?

120
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,667
Just… kinda jealous.

121
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,600
Jealous? Why?

122
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,300
You wouldn't get it.

123
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,867
Watching other people in love
makes you wanna have it too.

124
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,967
But whatever. Not like I have someone.

125
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,300
Self-recommendation.

126
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,433
What?

127
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:43,700
It's not like you're
enlisting in the army.

128
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,233
Ever 4, 185 cm, 72 kg,

129
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,267
three years of service.

130
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,900
Current status is S-rank
and specialty is protection.

131
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,900
Now serving

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,633
as household assistant and attendant.

133
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,133
I believe I can also excel

134
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,600
in the role of your lover.

135
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,867
I will adhere to your principles,

136
00:09:57,967 --> 00:09:59,400
align with your preferences.

137
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:06,033
Sir, do you own a company?

138
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:08,000
You're selling yourself so hard,

139
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,367
looking for a sponsor?

140
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,233
You've got the looks, too.

141
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,300
Want to join our company?

142
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,900
Festival bonuses, high commission rates.

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,100
Need quick cash?

144
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,600
We even offer six-month
interest-free loans.

145
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,300
Way better than freelancing.

146
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,033
Why not ask me?

147
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,567
You go there all the time.

148
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:45,967
Why would I pay?

149
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:48,200
People just come to me on their own.

150
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,333
Maybe I should work there too.

151
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:54,533
Not happening.

152
00:10:59,600 --> 00:10:59,900
Lo Bushi,

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Not happening.

154
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,033
We'll only be having meals together.

155
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:02,833
No way.

156
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:07,067
What? I can't do anything now?

157
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,833
You can't just fool around and walk away.

158
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:11,200
You promised me you'd turn over a new leaf.

159
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:16,267
You two aren't just friends, are you?

160
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:16,933
We're…

161
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:19,033
He's my boyfriend.

162
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:20,500
Keep an eye on him for me.

163
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,867
Don't let him run off and mess around.

164
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,333
No escaping me now.

165
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:36,100
Since when was I your boyfriend?

166
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,467
I could be.

167
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,067
Just say the word.

168
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:57,133
Leaving me on read is annoying.

169
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:59,533
Where'd you pick up that bad habit?

170
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,000
It affected you.

171
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,167
You've definitely been in touch with No. 9.

172
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:04,500
Don't let us distract you.

173
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,800
Focus on work.

174
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,667
Not like you did anything wrong,

175
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:09,967
but the company's activating IES.

176
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:11,433
Heard it's painful.

177
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:12,833
Won't break you,

178
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,333
but why suffer for no reason?

179
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:16,733
Humans are a bug in the system.

180
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,133
Nothing good comes from
getting involved with them.

181
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:20,367
You, No. 9, all the same.

182
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:23,400
No. 7, don't believe
everything the company says.

183
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,367
If you're that worried,

184
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:30,100
why not come back and
look after him yourself?

185
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,700
Someone else needs me more.

186
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,467
Hand over the tracker.

187
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:35,100
Why?

188
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,700
I had the lab make this in secret.

189
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,600
If they find out, I'm screwed.

190
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,733
No mistakes, right?

191
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,533
You said it was for your Young Master.

192
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:52,000
I picked a trendy and romantic one.

193
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:02,833
You just got proposed to.

194
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,733
I probably should've
gotten down on one knee.

195
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,367
You must be the Young Master.

196
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:14,167
I'll be off then.

197
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:16,767
Let's hang out again sometime.

198
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,533
Bye.

199
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,800
That was No. 7.

200
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,600
The company gives these to employers,

201
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,500
like an imperial jade
signet in ancient times.

202
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,467
You'll get yours after three months.

203
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:31,600
Here, let me put it on for you.

204
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:46,433
Do you even know

205
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,133
what wearing a ring means?

206
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,900
If I'm ever not by your side,

207
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,367
this will help me find you.

208
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,500
Two days at a love hotel,

209
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,767
now everywhere feels fresh and clean.

210
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:17,733
You eat first. I'm heading out.

211
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:18,967
I'll be back in three hours.

212
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:23,833
What have you been so busy with lately?

213
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,900
Earning money to support you.

214
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,800
Be careful. Don't run off.

215
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,833
Got it.

216
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,800
Stop treating me like a kid.

217
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:45,900
I told you, you are my kid.

218
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,833
Off I go then.

219
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,500
No matter the time of day,

220
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,200
every outing is exactly three hours.

221
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,000
What kind of job is this?

222
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:14,633
He doesn't even have an ID.

223
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:40,533
Miss Lisa, you have 30 minutes left.

224
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:42,100
What do you want to do?

225
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,467
You're making me nervous.

226
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,133
What can I even do in 30 minutes?

227
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:51,933
The theater was so dark,
and you wouldn't even let me kiss you.

228
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:55,033
Told you to book a room, but you refused.

229
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,733
You asked for a sweet, wholesome date.

230
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,967
A boyfriend…

231
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:06,233
can still do a little something.

232
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,400
Let's keep walking.

233
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:26,767
Is the pharmacy even open this late?

234
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:50,700
My legs are so sore… let's sit for a bit.

235
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,133
We only have three minutes left.

236
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,567
I know, okay?

237
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,467
Never seen anyone this strict about time.

238
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:02,267
Fine, I'll pay extra.

239
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,300
Sorry, not possible.

240
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:11,667
Wow, you'res cold… but I love it.

241
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,200
How about

242
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,100
we don't let the company know,

243
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,767
and just meet privately?

244
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:29,567
You look like Ever 4.

245
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,433
He looks just like him.

246
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:45,767
Don't tell me he's part
of the Ever series too.

247
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:48,000
You have other employers besides me?

248
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,133
Who the hell are you?

249
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:52,467
He's mine tonight.

250
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,233
Running off to be a host behind my back?

251
00:17:57,358 --> 00:17:58,975
Oh gosh.

252
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:03,200
So you're a host…

253
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,733
just to support this pretty boy?

254
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,067
I'm not...

255
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:14,733
Oh, you're not?

256
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,833
Then how about this?

257
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:22,667
I'll pay for you, and
you keep paying for him.

258
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:24,967
Money's not an issue for me.

259
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,167
Besides,

260
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,633
he's kinda cute too.

261
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,600
Listen up, he's mine.

262
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,767
I take care of him.

263
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,900
Where are you going?

264
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,300
I'm filing a complaint.

265
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,000
Unbelievable.

266
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:52,333
He's kinda hot, though.

267
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:53,900
Maybe I'll book him instead.

268
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,467
Technically,

269
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:02,333
I'm not a host or a gigolo.

270
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:03,224
It's just...

271
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:06,733
Just a side gig.

272
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,000
Flexible hours,

273
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,900
no ID required, cash in hand.

274
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:17,467
So we went from parks to love hotels

275
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,300
because you were selling labor.

276
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,133
Then from love hotels to motels

277
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:23,300
because you upgraded to an escort?

278
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Or is there more?

279
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,467
You're not using any
extra functions to make money, are you?

280
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,567
No. Just companionship.

281
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,300
Different settings, same service.

282
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,600
So you're spending days

283
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,833
with others

284
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:39,033
the same way you do with me for days?

285
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,800
And what's with this shirt?

286
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,933
Is it a uniform?

287
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:47,100
How many people

288
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,300
have touched you like this?

289
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,167
Tell me then.

290
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:56,333
When they touch me, I feel nothing.

291
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:59,500
But when you do, I can't ignore it.

292
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,233
Let's go home.

293
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,867
I don't want an AI

294
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,267
escorting to support me.

295
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:13,533
I won't do it anymore.

296
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:16,600
If you don't want to go home, we won't.

297
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,567
I'll find another way to take care of you.

298
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:26,033
So… we're going back to a motel?

299
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:26,967
No need.

300
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,700
I did some promo shots for a motel.

301
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,167
Got a 70% discount.

302
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,767
The price is about the
same as a love hotel.

303
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,633
Young Master, no need to get emotional.

304
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,067
My stomach hurts.

305
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,667
Young Master.

306
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,467
Are you feeling unwell?

307
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:06,733
I went out to buy medicine.

308
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,067
Medicine?

309
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,433
Young Master,

310
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:11,300
I'm taking you to the hospital. Let's go.

311
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,067
If you're not feeling well, just say so.

312
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,900
Next time,

313
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,933
eat slower.

314
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:32,033
And don't lie down right after eating.

315
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:33,100
Got it?

316
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,767
Bad habits.

317
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,833
He fell asleep.

318
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:49,567
Still upset?

319
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:56,900
If you keep acting
like this, I'd be worried.

320
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:06,867
When I was a kid, I
had acute gastroenteritis.

321
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,633
Right in the middle of the night.

322
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:10,800
My mom carried me home.

323
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,367
She cried the whole way.

324
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,367
Because that was the
night my dad, Lo Daqiang,

325
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:21,233
got caught with his mistress and their kid.

326
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,500
Back then, I just wanted to grow up fast

327
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,900
so I could take my mom
away from that house.

328
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:32,800
I didn't know she didn't want me anymore.

329
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,633
Sing me a song.

330
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,500
You can sing and dance for others,

331
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,267
but you won't sing for me?

332
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,933
Young Master…

333
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:46,533
You were really cute last night.

334
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:49,400
Young Master,

335
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,900
are you still not feeling well?

336
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,533
Rub my stomach.

337
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,733
What's wrong? Still hurts?

338
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,500
As a man, you should know,

339
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,167
in the morning,

340
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,167
groping is not alright.

341
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,900
Today's our trial period anniversary.

342
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,433
Gotta mark the occasion.

343
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:09,933
I wanna have hotpot for dinner.

344
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:12,133
I gotta make up for last
night's food poisoning.

345
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:13,433
No need to walk me to school.

346
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:14,400
My classmate's picking me up.

347
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,000
(Red Alert)

348
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,670
(No. 4, return to employer
immediately to withdraw

349
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:39,200
complaint. IES punishment
countdown activated)

350
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,667
I just wanted…

351
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:42,633
to give you a life without worries.

352
00:25:49,967 --> 00:26:53,033
(Next Episode)
Ever 4 isn't human,

353
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:54,233
he's a ghost.

354
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,933
Hurry back to the Lo family.

355
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:57,867
If not,

356
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:00,067
IES is about to activate.

357
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,800
Who gave you permission to use IES?

358
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,200
(Purple Alert) (No. 4 confirmed in
violation. IES punishment imminent)

359
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:07,933
Your son is in my hands.

360
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,567
Can you just leave me alone?

361
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,000
Just go to hell.
