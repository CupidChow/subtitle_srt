Let's do it.

191
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,860
Give me my purse.

192
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,670
You okay?

193
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,220
Whoa.

194
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,740
We have our winner.

195
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Next, just enjoy!

196
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,690
See?

197
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,030
What was that?

198
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,540
Taking your boy home, huh?

199
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,190
That made you end up with nothing.

200
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,450
Yeah, I don't want any.

201
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,390
I'm taking him home.

202
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,560
Look. He's so drunk.

203
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,340
- Right.
- You did that.

204
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,600
Good luck, bro.

205
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,360
See you.

206
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,260
- Nuea...
- What, Temp?

207
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,170
- Nuea!
- What is it, Temp?

208
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,580
Let's go home.

209
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,250
- Come on, I'm having fun.
- You're wasted.

210
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,550
Come on.

211
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,050
Toy, keep an eye on Temp.

212
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,020
He's totally drunk.

213
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,210
You're talking about me?

214
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,190
I'm a heavyweight, bro.

215
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,030
I can smell the booze from here.

216
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,000
Keep an eye on him.

217
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,569
Masuk, we're leaving.

218
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,220
- See you.
- See you.

219
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,819
Come on, Nuea.

220
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,520
You don't have to follow me.

221
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,520
Ow!

222
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,510
Tutor Sun,

223
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,110
I wanna go to bed.

224
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,390
I'm so sleepy.

225
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,830
- Let's go.
- Tutor Sun...

226
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,890
I wanna go home and sleep.

227
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,760
Take me home.

228
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,410
How are you getting home?

229
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,560
What about you?

230
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,630
I'll find my own way.

231
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,750
But before I leave,

232
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,920
I wanna give you something.

233
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,790
Here. This is for you.

234
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,530
For me?

235
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,800
Take it.

236
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,770
I like you.

237
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,790
I mean,

238
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,450
I liked what you said.

239
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,310
So...

240
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,870
I'm going home.

241
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,710
Temp,

242
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,080
if you liked what I said,

243
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,940
let me take you home.

244
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,780
You didn't come when I asked.

245
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,710
Wanted all the spotlight, huh?

246
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,970
That's not what I wanted.

247
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,250
All I wanted was your eyes on me.

248
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,750
Aren't you sad...

249
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,850
that you didn't get any flowers?

250
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,860
Who said I didn't get any?

251
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,970
I've got the prettiest one,

252
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,920
and it's one of a kind.

253
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,790
He's right here before me.

254
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,150
That's cringe.

255
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,150
Bleh!

256
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,720
Go ahead and puke.

257
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,450
I don't mind.

258
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,660
Just don't fall
for anyone else's cringe pickup lines.

259
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,110
I won't.

260
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,650
That'll ruin the moment.

261
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,590
Oh...

262
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,310
Nuea, are you throwing up?

263
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,780
Hold it in!

264
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,630
Are you serious?

265
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,790
It's a joke.

266
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,310
You're getting worse, huh?

267
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,200
You always fall for it.

268
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,820
Alright, let's get inside.

269
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,110
[Hey, Temp!

270
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,360
Has your type changed
to that kind of boy?

271
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,280
I saw you give him a flower at the bar]

272
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,410
[Hey, leave my future boyfriend alone!

273
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,030
With someone like this,
I've got zero competition]

274
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,480
[I bet he's praying
and chanting right now]

275
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,760
I got this flower from him.

276
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,520
This is the first flower

277
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,630
I've ever received from someone else.

278
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,900
But I don't know...

279
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,810
if he's the one I've been searching for.

280
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,650
What should I do?

281
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,750
Gosh, these boots...

282
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,870
are so hard to take off.

283
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,780
I know you're in a relationship,

284
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,230
and I have no intention of stopping you.

285
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,610
I just want you to consider something.

286
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,170
If he were an investment,

287
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,590
do you see profit in the future?

288
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,180
Or...

289
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,470
the more you invest,

290
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,110
the more you lose?

291
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,920
Thank you...

292
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,840
for investing in me
even if I'm worth nothing.

293
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,540
Good night.

294
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,200
Don't worry, okay?

295
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,670
We just have to switch roles for now

296
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,310
until Third comes back.

297
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,600
Jeez...

298
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,180
Alright, my baby?

299
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,340
Gosh! What the heck is going on?

300
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,450
I'm sick of this.

301
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,790
I wanna be me.

302
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,280
I'm also sick of this.

303
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,360
I'm in my body!

304
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,700
Nuea!

305
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,470
- We've switched back!
- We did it!

306
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,040
If that soap caused us to switch bodies
so we could understand each other better,

307
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,490
then I want to thank it.

308
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,100
Because it showed me that...

309
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,460
you really are everything to me.

310
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,380
We might switch bodies again tomorrow,

311
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,270
or maybe not.

312
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,950
But as long as I wake up
next to you every day,

313
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,800
that's more than enough for me.
