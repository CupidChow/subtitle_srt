Nuea,

158
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,680
a proper handshake etiquette
for business

159
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,080
is to grab the hand

160
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,560
and shake it 3 times.

161
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,080

162
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,400

177
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,440
For as long as I've known him,

178
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,840
all he's ever craved is to be loved.

179
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,320
Madam always works,

180
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,960
so they barely have time to talk.

181
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,760
That's why when you guys got together,

182
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,050
he falls madly in love with you.

183
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,200
Do you even care about me anymore?

184
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,960

since all you do now is work

186
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,080
and side hustles!

187
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,240
Nobody loves me.

188
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,960
Madam never paid attention
to me at home.

189
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,200
Guess you'll just be one more on the list.

190
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,000
Toy!

191
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,360
- Toy!
- Are you alright?

192
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,560
- Third...
- What's going on?!

193
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,440
Hey!

194
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,240
Let's get you up first.

195
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,360
Stand up.

196
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,760
Gosh.

197
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Are you okay?

198
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,030
You don't look great at all.

199
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,080
It's gonna be fine, bro.

200
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,800
Damn,

201
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,080
he looked just like Monday did
back then.

202
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,680
Why are all our friends
so stupid with love?

203
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,640
I don't think anyone's
ever been smart with that.

204
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,240
Don't tell me

205
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,640
we were smart about ours.

206
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,000
No more crying.

207
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,320
It's gonna be fine.

208
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,840
- It is.
- It's just gonna take time.

209
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,120
We'll be right by your side.

210
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,080
Yeah,

211
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,960
you still have us, man.

212
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,040
It'll be fine.

213
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,960
- Hey, Third?
- Yes?

214
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,200
Are you gonna help Sun and Nuea?

215
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,240
They look just as messed up.

216
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,520
Of course, bro.

217
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,040
Here.

218
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,560
The enchanted soap from China.

219
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,440
I'll need to perform
the ritual tomorrow, though.

220
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,600
- Yeah?
- Yep, we need the full moon

221
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,880
for it to work.

222
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,200
As for you...

223
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,920
Here.

224
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,800
No peeking!

225
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,680
Only I can do that.

226
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Number seven.

227
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,680
Third's back.

228
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,380
Tomorrow, he'll be performing
the ritual for us.

229
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
Everything will soon be back to normal.

230
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,640
It's strange

231
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,920
how you wake up
in your loved one's body,

232
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,520
but the feeling inside
is still fully yours.

233
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,300
I've been trying to understand you...

234
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,960
to be patient...

235
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,600
and not to complain.

236
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
But, after being in your body,

237
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
I realize you don't have it easy at all.

238
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,840
This is exhausting.

239
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,580
I never thought that

240
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,280
being you is so hard.

241
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,960
From Madam,

242
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,080
Miss Namkang,

243
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,930
and the perfect life,

244
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,080
you need to be Nuea
that the world expects to see,

245
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,560
not your true self.

246
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
I don't know how things will end,

247
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,340
but I want you to know
how much I love you.

248
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,040
Though you're not perfect...

249
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,680
Though you're worried about that...

250
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,790
those have never been my concerns.

251
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,040
I've always been looking at you
from the outside.

252
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,320
I thought you were spoiled

253
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,640
and always seeking love.

254
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,760
But after switching to your body,

255
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,040
I started to understand everything.

256
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,880
It's lonely,

257
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,240
really lonely.

258
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,120
In the world
where nobody understands you,

259
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,480
we understand each other.

260
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,560
From this day forth,

261
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,000
I'll never let go of you ever again.

262
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,040
It's hard

263
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,600
being someone you're not.

264
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,040
But I appreciate the fact

265
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,960
that it makes us
understand each other better.

266
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,200
Are you here for a fortune reading?

267
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,280
Please make a wish
before drawing a fortune stick.

268
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,880
Since its prophecy paper is in Chinese,

269
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,200
I'll be translating it for you.

270
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,400
After you're done,
stretch your hand through the curtains.

271
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,960
Uh...

272
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,160
Your hand is stained by ink.

273
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,360
I can't read the lines at all.

274
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,800
Oh, I just wrote my partner a letter.

275
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
That's probably why.

276
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Could you please wipe it off?

277
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,160
So he's taken...

278
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Thanks.

279
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,760
What do you want to ask me today?

280
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
So...

281
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,120
My partner's mad at me.

282
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,960
I wanna know
how I could make up with them

283
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,600
since I'm scared
I'd lose them forever.

284
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,000
From what I can see,

285
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,960
your soulmate line is still present,

286
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,640
so I don't think you'll break up.

287
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,920
Maybe your partner's just...

288
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,520
not feeling the certainty

289
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,400
or the commitment from you.

290
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,120
You might have to prove yourself
to them a little.

291
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,520
Uh...

292
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
Can I look at the prophecy paper?

293
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,880
"Prophecy number seven,

294
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,440
you'll find your true love."

295
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Number seven.

296
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,600
That's not accurate at all.

297
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,040
"You'll find your true love."

298
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,080
And...

299
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,200
How do I make that happen?

300
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,520
Just tell them

301
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,240
your true feelings.

302
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,520
Can I do that now?

303
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,200
Temp!

304
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,400
Toy,

305
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,280
I like you.

306
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,960
I've never laid my eyes
on anyone else.

307
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,600
I really like you, Toy.

308
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,840
Will you be my boyfriend?

309
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,160
If I were a girl,

310
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,200
this would feel like asking a boy
to be my lover.

311
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,000
If he didn't accept my love,

312
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,240
I would be so humiliated.

313
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,380
But...

314
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,920
I'm a pretty dumb boy.

315
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,200
Temp,

316
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,560
what are we gonna do
with our art toy business?

317
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,000
It's been going downhill for months.

318
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,800
Temp,

319
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,160
what are you gonna do now?

320
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,360
Will you go on,

321
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
or are you done?

322
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,960
I think...

323
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
I'm done.

324
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,120
It's in the name.

325
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,840
That one's just a toy for me.

326
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,760
Toy,

327
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,480
you're not dumb at all.

328
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,640
You're even in my head all the time.

329
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,920
Tell me;

330
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,160
what did you do to me?

331
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Well, then...

332
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,720
I will.

333
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
Temp!

334
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,320
Isn't that too fast?!

335
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,560
Not at all.

336
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,200
I've been wanting to do that for ages.

337
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,640
You're silly.

338
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,240
Are you guys ready?

339
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
Sun, hold this.

340
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,840
You too, Nuea.

341
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,639
"The soap of yin and yang...

342
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,159
Return the flesh

343
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,300
to the swains in distress

344
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,880
and mark the curse lifted."

345
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,400
Do you think
we could really switch back?

346
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,600
Though we don't have control
over our bodies,

347
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,600
we still do over our hearts.

348
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,960
I think that's more important
than switching back.

349
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,320
I'm sorry, Uncie.

350
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,280
I am, too.
