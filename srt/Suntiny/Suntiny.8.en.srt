if a partner...

187
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,880
didn't make love to you as often,

188
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,560
does it mean
they were falling out of love?

189
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,760
Ah...

190
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,040
You're mad at Sun

191
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,400
because he doesn't do it?

192
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Mm,

193
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,410
yep.

194
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,360
It's not that I'm mad.

195
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,510
It just makes me wonder...

196
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,360
if he loved me less.

197
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Nuea, I can't help you on this

198
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,280
since I've never been in a relationship.

199
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,040
But...

200
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,880
if you thought so,

201
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,400
why don't you try asking him?

202
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,160
At least...

203
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,290
it's better than assuming it.

204
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,760
Nuea, let's go home.

205
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,560
Sun is probably worried sick.

206
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,240
Nah!

207
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,080
I'm still having a blast, Temp.

208
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,960
Nuea, it's time to go home.

209
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
I've been worried about you.

210
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,490
I'm not leaving

211
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,960
since you don't love me anymore.

212
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,240
You literally took me to this party.

213
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,920
You're mad at Sun for not doing it.

214
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,280
It's not that I'm mad.

215
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,880
It just makes me wonder...
if he loved me less.

216
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,340
Uncie, you don't love me anymore!

217
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,760
Nuea!

218
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,880
Nuea!

219
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,840
Nuea, you can't dance like this!

220
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,480
I am a tutor.

221
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,440
If someone recorded this
and my students saw it,

222
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,540
I'd be screwed!

223
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,930
You'd go viral!

224
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,120
Nuea, cut it!

225
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,760
What were they on about?

226
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,770
I'm right here, and I heard nothing.

227
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,540
- I can't even believe my ears.
- Huh?

228
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,720
But it's like...

229
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,040
Sun has switched with Nuea,

230
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,330
and Nuea has become Sun.

231
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,190
- What?!
- You wanna dance along?

232
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,040
Why didn't you tell me where you were?

233
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,160
I searched high and low for you!

234
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,880
You didn't even pick up your phone!

235
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,320
Since when do you care?

236
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,960
I thought you didn't love me

237
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,080
since all you do now is work

238
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,320
and side hustles!

239
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,440
Do you even care about me anymore?

240
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,390
What makes you think that?

241
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,000
Of course, I still love you.

242
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,720
I'm just having a little too much
on my plate

243
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,200
with studying, tutoring, and everything.

244
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,750
Not "a little."

245
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,080
Do you still feel the same, Uncie?

246
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,160
Answer me!

247
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,840
What makes you think I don't?

248
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,160
Well, whenever we make love,

249
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,680
you're never in the mood anymore.

250
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,480
Are you seeing someone else?

251
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,080
I'm not,

252
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,440
and I've never even thought of it.

253
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,760
The reason it's not getting up

254
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,230
is not because I'm falling out of love.

255
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,720
I love you so much

256
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,160
that I'm doing everything to fix it;

257
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,200
that's why we're in
each other's bodies!

258
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,120
You're saying that I'm the reason

259
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,400
for all of this?!

260
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,360
So, I am the problem?

261
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,880
Say something!

262
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,760
Nobody loves me.

263
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,470
I'm used to it, though.

264
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,160
Madam never paid attention to me at home.

265
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,330
Guess you'll just be one more on the list.

266
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,640
Have you ever felt

267
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,400
like you're never enough?

268
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,720
No matter how hard you try,

269
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,280
you still run and run in circles

270
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
all while hurting the people you love.

271
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,190
It's not true that I don't love you.

272
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,760
Instead, I yearn for you
more and more each day.

273
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,880
But the more I do,

274
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,520
the more I'm afraid

275
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,840
you'll feel that I've changed,

276
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,400
or that you'll blame yourself

277
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,280
for something that isn't your fault.

278
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,280
The money I'm giving you is a loan.

279
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,150
Pay me back within two weeks.

280
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,360
If you can't comply,

281
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,760
then get out of my brother's life.

282
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,120
[07/07/25: Received THB 500,000
to Account No. X290768X]

283
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
This money

284
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,320
doesn't make me feel better.

285
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,640
It's just a statement...

286
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,820
of how much of a failure I am.

287
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,160
What's going on, Kaeng?

288
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,000
Also...

289
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,800
did you drink, Temp?

290
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,160
Toy,

291
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,240
what's happening to Sun and Nuea?

292
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,400
Toy,

293
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,600
tell me what happened.

294
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,000
You never lie;

295
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,360
if you do now, it'll be sinful.

296
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,400
No, I can't tell you anything.

297
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,330
Toy!

298
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,760
Tell us right now.

299
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,880
No, I can't.

300
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,960
I can't tell you.

301
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,560
No, I can't.

302
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,920
If you don't tell me, I'll kiss you.

303
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,150
I can't, I can't!

304
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,910
I can't...

305
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Temp, you bastard.

306
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,520
If you still won't tell me,

307
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,300
I'll kiss you one more time.

308
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,640
They...

309
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,260
They...

310
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,480
switched bodies!

311
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
- Switched bodies?!
- Switched bodies?!

312
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,910
What does that even mean, Toy?

313
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,520
Madam sent Miss Namkang
to you for etiquette training.

314
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,920
What etiquette training?

315
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,560
Glamour training.

316
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,360
You're not glamorous enough
according to her.

317
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,440
I won't let you tutor my son anymore!

318
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,040
Why is that, ma'am?!

319
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,360
This is a video from a club

320
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,500
where you were all drunk,
doing that inappropriate dancing!

321
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,880
Third's back.

322
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,480
Tomorrow, he'll be performing
the ritual for us.

323
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,960
Everything will soon be back to normal.
