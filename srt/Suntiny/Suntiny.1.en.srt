00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
We can bathe together.

193
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,319
I think I'm in trouble.

194
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,359
It's not getting up again?

195
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,680
Are you cheating on me?

196
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,520
You have to bathe alone
while using this soap.

197
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,040
Tutor Sun!

198
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
That's my body!

199
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,320
What's going on?

200
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
You're in my body!

201
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,280
What should we do?

202
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,520
Are we in a dream?

203
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,640
Ouch...

204
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,840
What, Tutor Sun?

205
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,560
We're not.

206
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Gosh, what do we do now?

207
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,480
Hi, Nuea.

208
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,630
Oh... Wait, no.

209
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,080
Temp, why the hell are you here?

210
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
Sorry?

211
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,120
Why did you talk to me like that?

212
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Sorry.

213
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,600
I forgot.

214
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,320
What's wrong with you guys?

215
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,680
You're acting weird.

216
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,760
Why was Nuea being rude to me,

217
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,680
and why are you acting so softly?

218
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,520
You need to teach me today, Sun.

219
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,480
What's going on here?

220
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,320
Shut up. We just...

221
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,960
Oh...

222
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
I mean, we...

223
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,930
We're fine.

224
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,360
Anyway,

225
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,880
no classes today.

226
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,640
Tutor Sun's not feeling well.

227
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,310
Right.

228
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,520
- Oh, are you okay?
- Nuea's right.

229
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,240
And why are you wearing
each other's clothes?

230
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,080
What's gotten into you?

231
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,880
Whatever.

232
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,800
I said no classes today.

233
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,360
He's not feeling well.

234
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,720
Just leave.

235
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,560
Trust me and leave.

236
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,360
He's sick.

237
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,040
Go and send him off.

238
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,120
Take him to the gate.

239
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
See you, Temp!

240
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Gosh!

241
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,320
What the heck is going on?

242
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,920
Yeah.

243
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,480
It's all messed up.

244
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,440
Today has to be
the craziest day of my life.

245
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,400
Ever since we switched bodies
this morning,

246
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,400
I still feel like I'm dreaming.

247
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,560
When I woke up

248
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,880
and realized I was in this tiny body,

249
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,640
I was totally shocked.

250
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,720
But what I was most worried about...

251
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,080
was Nuea.

252
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,520
I saw him wake up in my body.

253
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,080
He seemed terrified

254
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,640
and sad,

255
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
and he cried.

256
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,080
I didn't even know what to do.

257
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,880
I'm so sorry

258
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,680
that I put you
through something like this.

259
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,600
[The next day... at Third's house]

260
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,840
What?!

261
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,520
You switched bodies?

262
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,440
Are you for real right now?

263
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,200
Yeah.

264
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,240
We were taking a bath together.

265
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,680
The next thing we knew,
it already happened.

266
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,420
Calm down, guys.

267
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,320
But...

268
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,720
did you just say

269
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,440
you took a bath together?

270
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,200
Are you saying...

271
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,920
you shared the soap?

272
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,320
What soap, Tutor Sun?

273
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Oh...

274
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,080
Third's soap looked kinda interesting,

275
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,080
so I asked to try it.

276
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
I had no idea this would happen.

277
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,160
Gosh, Uncie.

278
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,120
You literally asked for trouble.

279
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,440
I'll text Third real quick.

280
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,120
Yeah, do it now.

281
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,290
He said he found it.
[Wait, I've found the scripture]

282
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,120
"The body-switching soap scripture."

283
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,870
- Yeah?
- But... there's only half of it.

284
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,710
What?

285
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,800
Half of it?

286
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,440
Where's the other half, then?

287
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,120
I guess it's termites' favorite food.

288
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:03,960
Gosh,

289
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,440
what do we do now?

290
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,440
Hold on.

291
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,200
Third said...

292
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,160
Give me a sec.

293
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,430
"Your mind and body torn apart;

294
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,480
your soul exchanged
with one close to heart.

295
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,710
But fear not; it's not hard.

296
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,480
When the time is met,
there will come a restart."

297
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,320
What does that mean, Toy?

298
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,240
You guys will switch back
when it's time.

299
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,230
Don't worry.

300
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,170
But...

301
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,880
how long do we have to wait?

302
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,680
Right, how long?

303
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,520
Third said,

304
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,880
"I need to study the scripture
at my grandma's for a few days.

305
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,080
I'll be fast."

306
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,240
In the meantime, calm yourselves down.

307
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,840
Live your lives as usual.

308
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
As usual?

309
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,420
Usual, my ass.

310
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,920
How can we be calm?

311
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,840
I don't want this body!

312
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,440
It's so big,

313
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,880
and so are the muscles.

314
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,200
I hate it.

315
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,680
It's all my fault.

316
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,600
If I didn't insist on using that soap,

317
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,520
we wouldn't have had to be
in such trouble.

318
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,160
Toy,

319
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,840
if something ever happens,

320
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,560
you need to tell us ASAP.

321
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,960
I'll show you Nuea's room,

322
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,190
so you'll know how to get there,

323
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,660
okay?

324
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,160
What's that box you're holding?

325
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,400
[Animal Shelter Donations]

326
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,960
It's a donation box.

327
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,920
I'm gonna go ask for donations.

328
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,640
Feel free to join me whenever you can.

329
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,750
Let's go.

330
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,880
Come on.

331
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,640
Oh, Sun and Nuea?

332
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,560
Hi.

333
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,480
Yeah.

334
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Sun, Nuea,

335
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,280
are you guys alright?

336
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,640
Something's off.

337
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,160
Yeah, we freaking...

338
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,920
No!

339
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
You freaking...

340
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,360
I mean, I'm totally fine.

341
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,360
You, too, right, Tutor Sun?

342
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,800
Yeah.

343
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,600
We're both fine.

344
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,440
Sun,

345
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,040
you need to make up that class for me.

346
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,200
With so little studying,
I won't pass the exam.

347
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,800
And...

348
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,600
is he a friend of Nuea?

349
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,840
Never seen him before.

350
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,400
Oh,

351
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,600
this is Toy.

352
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,680
Tutor Sun just introduced him to me.

353
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,880
Yeah, that's right.

354
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,200
I just introduced him to Nuea.

355
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,560
Fine,

356
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,840
I'll buy that.

357
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,160
Okay.

358
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:37,960
Right,

359
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,350
how about this, Temp?

360
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,400
Toy can teach you for now.

361
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,520
He's really clever.

362
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,080
I'm sure he'll be helpful.

363
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,320
I won't do that.

364
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,600
I prefer to learn my lessons from Third,

365
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,520
and I hate being a tutor.

366
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,680
Your friend could've just
let AI teach him.

367
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
Toy!

368
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,640
I'm your college senior.

369
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,360
Help me.

370
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,360
Also, keep this from Temp.

371
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Fine,

372
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,200
I can't deny if it's from you, can I?

373
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,240
Fine.

374
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,520
If you think he's good,

375
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,720
I think it'll be alright.

376
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
Anyway,

377
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,160
are you a strict tutor like Sun?

378
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,320
Gosh.

379
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,600
No, I'm not.

380
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,200
I'm sorry, Nuea.

381
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,040
I promise I'll do everything I can

382
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,680
to get us back to normal.

383
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,960
We even asked for Third's advice today.

384
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,840
He said...

385
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,120
our bodies will switch back
on their own soon.

386
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,960
But I'm still a little worried.

387
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,480
We don't know exactly
when it will happen.

388
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,400
But even though I'm scared,

389
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,720
I'm relieved

390
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,540
that at least we're still together.

391
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Thank you

392
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,520
for getting through everything
together today.

393
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,320
Why is it so complicated?

394
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,920
I'm totally lost.

395
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Sun,

396
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,320
what if our bodies don't switch back?

397
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,880
What will we do?

398
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,720
Don't worry, Nuea.

399
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,960
I'll find a way.

400
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,440
Okay.

401
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
Tutor Sun...

402
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,600
Yeah?

403
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,920
Are you cheating on me?

404
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,360
It's not getting up again?

405
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,680
Go get some rest, then.

406
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,440
I'll go back to sleep.

407
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,360
This feels weird.

408
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,280
It's like I'm kissing myself.

409
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,680
What?

410
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,800
It feels weird, doesn't it?

411
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,000
Yeah.

412
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,960
But if we can't see anything,

413
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,680
it won't be super weird, will it?

414
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,760
What a lovely outfit.

415
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,800
Are you coming late tonight?

416
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,400
I'll be back right after
finishing a meal with my friend.

417
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,240
I wanna be with you forever, Nuea.

418
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,400
You need to be punished.

419
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,520
This is Tutor Sun's body!

420
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
It's my turn now?

421
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,080
Yeah.

422
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,840
I'm done.

423
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,880
Hi.

424
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,240
This feels weird.

425
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,240
Hello.

426
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,400
I'm Nuea...

427
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,840
even though this is Tutor Sun's body.

428
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,560
It's weird that...

429
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,440
I appear as a big man.

430
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,719
When I looked into the mirror,

431
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,560
I saw you.

432
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,360
I was stunned.

433
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,280
But I'm lucky

434
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,710
to have Sun by my side.

435
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,840
It really made me feel a lot better.

436
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,320
I know you've been feeling guilty

437
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,360
for using that soap,

438
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,600
but I understand

439
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,880
that you used it

440
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,320
because you wanted me to be happy

441
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,480
and not worried about our problems.

442
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,639
I'm not mad at you, Sun.

443
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,600
If anything, I want to thank you

444
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,480
for trying so hard for me.

445
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,080
And I want you to know, too,

446
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
that us switching bodies...

447
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,720
has made me more certain
about how I feel.

448
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,320
Though our bodies have switched,

449
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,920
I still feel...

450
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,800
we're side by side, just like always.

451
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,640
In your eyes looking at me,

452
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,640
I see the love,

453
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,160
the care,

454
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,720
just like you've always looked at me.

455
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,680
It hasn't changed at all.

456
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,440
So, whether it's tomorrow or whenever,

457
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,400
I'm sure we'll get through this together.

458
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,640
Yeah.

459
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,800
We'll get our bodies back

460
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
eventually.

461
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Tutor Sun...

462
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,360
Yeah?

463
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,280
Whatever happens,

464
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,400
we'll go through this together, okay?

465
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,640
That's it.

466
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,560
You like this shirt?

467
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,800
You went outside with it,

468
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,960
and you're still wearing it now.

469
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,000
You didn't let me change.

470
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,920
You think I like it?

471
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,520
It's so tiny.

472
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,760
It won't even fit in these arms.
