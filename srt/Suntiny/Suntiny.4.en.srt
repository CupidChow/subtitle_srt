What are you doing, Toy?

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,680
It's like you're counting something.

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,960
I'm counting my steps.

8
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,070
It's a kind of meditation.

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,520
I see.

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,080
Why, though?

11
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,870
Why can't you just keep walking?

12

Without meditation,

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,240
your mind might start to wander,

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,840
and that might lead to
all sorts of problems.

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,520
Alright, then.

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,000
No more questions.

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,920
Anyway,

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,800
what made you decide
to be Third's disciple?

19
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,240
I joined his club because...

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,480
he found his soulmate by helping others,
as everyone knows.

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,280
So I thought I'd try doing the same.

22
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,400
Maybe I'll find mine, too.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Who knows, by helping me study,

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
you might find your soulmate, too.

25
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,000
It's about to rain.

26
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,040
Let's go.

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,240
Right.

28
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,400
If he were an investment,

29
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,079
do you see profit in the future?

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400
Or...

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,600
the more you invest,

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,240

33

Tutor Sun!

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,340
Tell me.

35
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,320
What did Madam say?

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,600
Did she mention you?

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
No.

38
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,230
I spoke impolitely without meaning to,

39
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,750
so she was kind of offended.

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,280
But that was it.

41
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,360
She was on a call the whole time.

42
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,530
That's great, then.

43
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,920
I thought she'd talk about
something else, too.

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,360
Right,

45
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Tutor Sun...

46
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,900
How did we switch again?

47
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,840
We just switched back
a few hours before.

48
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,400
I guess our hack didn't work completely.

49
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,760
It was just temporary.

50
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,080
I see.

51
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,720
That means we need to do it often

52
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,360
so that it works completely.

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,600
Okay?

54
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,080
I don't think
that'd be good, though, babe.

55
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,800
You'll never know unless you try.

56
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,360
Gosh! What the heck is going on?

57
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm so sorry

58
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,040
that I put you
through something like this.

59
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,720

60
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,560
Nuea!

61
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,960
- We've switched back!
- We did it!

62
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,840
It's my fault.

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,800
I know you're not asking for much.

64
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,740
But I made you feel the opposite...

65
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,480
I'm sick of this.

66
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,920
Don't worry, okay?

67
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,880
We just have to switch roles for now

68
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,470
until Third comes back.

69
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,800
If this body switch can bring us closer,

70
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,800
then I want to thank him...

71
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,960
for going through all of this with me.

72
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,640
I know you're in a relationship.

73
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,240
Do you see profit in the future?

74
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,480

75
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,840

191
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,750
What's with him?

192
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,920
Couldn't stop nitpicking me.

193
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,640
Been craving this for ages.

194
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Let's go for it.

195
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,020
You're so expensive, huh?

196
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,600
You're Nuea, right?

197
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,560
Can I take a picture with you?

198
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,480
Yeah, sure.

199
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,280
How about your signature pose, though?

200
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
That one.

201
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,680
Oh!

202
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,840
I got it.

203
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
Thank you.

204
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,800
No problem.

205
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,600
If this body switch can bring us closer,

206
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,480
then I want to thank him...

207
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,720
for going through all of this with me.

208
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,000
You're here?

209
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,280
Been looking for you.

210
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,200
Whoa, Nuea, isn't that too much food?

211
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,040
You don't drink coffee, though.

212
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,480
Oh, Temp!

213
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,080
You're here, too?

214
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,550
Why can't I have these?

215
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,140
I paid for them.

216
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,400
And it's my cheat day.

217
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,680
Nuea,

218
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,880
you seem...

219
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,560
kinda stiff and offensive.

220
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,240
It's weird.

221
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Are you okay?

222
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,120
I'm fine.

223
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,760
I just didn't have much sleep,

224
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,120
so I might seem aggressive.

225
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,290
It's not me at all.

226
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,640
Nuea,

227
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,360
why are you peeing standing up?

228
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,420
You always use the toilet stall.

229
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,640
And didn't you say
you hate standing up to pee?

230
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,360
Imagine if your fans saw this.

231
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,400
He can't leave me alone, can he?

232
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,840
There's no one around.

233
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,160
I really had to pee, so I did.

234
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,800
Sun!

235
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,440
What's wrong with you today?

236
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,560
You sucked, bro.

237
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,600
You kept forcing me.

238
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,920
I told you I didn't wanna swim.

239
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,920
Whatever.

240
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,200
Do it better next time.

241
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,220
Let's get showered now.

242
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
I'm hungry.

243
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,920
I'm good.

244
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,840
You go first.

245
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,000
- Come on.
- No!

246
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,000
- Hurry.
- What do you want?

247
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,850
Come with me!

248
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,000
Won't you take a shower?

249
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,640
I will.

250
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,120
How often do we shower together, anyway?

251
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,880
Every single time.

252
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,040
To save time, you know.

253
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,960
What's wrong with your brain?

254
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,200
And...

255
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,560
besides showering,
do we do anything else?

256
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,740
Are you hoping
for something more than that?

257
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,200
You're nuts!

258
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,520
I'm just joking.

259
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,600
Who'd wanna have sex with you?

260
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,770
You're not even hot,

261
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,240
and you're no match for Puth.

262
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,000
Don't say that!

263
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,820
You've been with Nuea
for way too long now.

264
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,200
I'm not doing this anymore.

265
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,960
What the fuck does he want?

266
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,520
He can't fucking leave me alone.

267
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,840
- Oh!
- Whoa!

268
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,800
Shit...

269
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,000
- Uncie...
- Nuea!

270
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,480
I'm tired, Uncie.

271
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,400
Let's go.

272
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,400
Okay.

273
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,560
Oh...

274
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,960
- Kaeng!
- Temp?

275
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
Do you think...

276
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,160
Sun's been acting weird?

277
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,760
Yeah, you're right.

278
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,680
Do you think
Nuea's been acting weird, too?

279
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,160
Then...

280
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,440
should we look into this?

281
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
I'm sick of this.

282
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,880
I wanna be me.

283
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,840
I'm also sick of this.

284
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,000
Then...

285
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,080
should we do our hack and switch back?

286
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,640
At least for a while.

287
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And I'll teach my students online.

288
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,880
We just took a bath together.

289
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,360
Who would have thought

290
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,800
that simply soaking in a tub

291
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,600
could soften...

292
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
one's heart this much?

293
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,720
You were exhausted,

294
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,650
and I could tell.

295
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,120
I see it every day.

296
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,040
But today, when you said
you wanted to be yourself again,

297
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,600
I felt like...

298
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,160
being in each other's bodies

299
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,360
might actually help us
understand each other better.

300
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,100
I used to wonder...

301
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,640
When my body worsens,

302
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,440
will our love worsen, too?

303
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,360
But no.

304
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,000
Just sitting across from you
in that tub,

305
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,200
hearing your voice,

306
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,320
and looking into your eyes,

307
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,760
I realized...

308
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,560
my love doesn't depend on appearance.

309
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:32,970
If that soap caused us to switch bodies
so we could understand each other better,

310
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,320
then I want to thank it.

311
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,020
Because it showed me that

312
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,240
you really are everything to me.
