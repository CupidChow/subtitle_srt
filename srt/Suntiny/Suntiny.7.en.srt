The money I gave you is a loan.

188
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,240
Pay me back within two weeks.

189
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,880
If you can't comply,

190
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,960
then get out of my brother's life.

191
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,360
I don't know

192
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,160
if we'll switch back tomorrow.

193
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,400
I don't know if you'll get your life back

194
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,480
after tonight,

195
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,360
or if we'll have to keep living like this.

196
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,680
But one thing I'm sure of

197
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
is that no matter whose body I'm in,

198
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,560
there's no doubt

199
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,200
my heart still belongs to you.

200
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,560
You don't have to say anything just yet,

201
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,920
but if you go back to this video,

202
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,600
just know that

203
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,000
this is how much I love you

204
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,000
even on the day you're not yourself.

205
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,680
It's actually strange.

206
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,200
I wanted a body that functions properly,

207
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,880
but, ultimately...

208
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,480
I'm scared by the thought of
being in this body forever.

209
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,000
I was afraid that you wouldn't love
a body that's...

210
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,760
broken.

211
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,120
But, even though I'm more broken now,

212
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,200
I can feel your love more vividly
than ever before.

213
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,920
If we can't switch back by tomorrow,

214
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,880
I just want you to know that

215
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,200
I love you

216
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,680
for your soul,

217
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,320
regardless of the body you're in.

218
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,320
And I'll always be here,

219
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,960
regardless of the body I'm in.

220
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,280
Do you think we will switch back tomorrow?

221
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Your guess is as good as mine.
