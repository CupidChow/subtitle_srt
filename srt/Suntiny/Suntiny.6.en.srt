I think I'm in trouble.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,040

00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,520
What did you just say?

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,239

Sun,

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,610
you nailed it today.

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,600

48

49

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,320
You're crazy.

51
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
It is impossible.

52
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,680
You're right.

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,640

exactly like Nuea's.

54

Alright!

55

59

You go first.

60

Then...

68
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,640
should we look into this?

69

Nuea,

70
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,960

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,640
Are you inviting Sun?

72
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,200
Totally.

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,240
Won't you take a shower?

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,640
I will.

75

Yes, Sun, Neua.

What is this for, Toy?

119
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,140
Your yin and yang energies are unbalanced.

120
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,520

161
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,040

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,240
right by your side

190
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,240
because I love you.

191
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,920
Fair taste.

192
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
Madam.

193
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,080
Let's go inside.

194
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,640
Tutor Sun!

195
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,320
Let's go.

196
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,160
Just the two of us.

197
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,440
Come on.

198
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,620
Yes...

199
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,920
Yes, Madam.

200
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,840
Hurry.

201
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,520
I know you're in a relationship,

202
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,120
If he were an investment,

203
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,560
do you see profit in the future?

204
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,720
Or...

205
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,920
the more you invest,

206
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,560
the more you lose?

207
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Tonight,

208
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,520
I might not have the courage
to face everything.

209
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,560
But whenever you look at me,

210
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,800
I'll always smile at you.

211
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,920
Come hell or high water,

212
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
I will never run off again.

213
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,080
Though our bodies have switched,

214
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,640
I still feel...

215
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,440
we're side by side, just like always.

216
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,880
Today,

217
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,960
I feel like staying home.

218
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,320
And I don't want you to go anywhere.

219
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,600
I wanna be with you forever, Nuea.

220
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,760
Tutor Sun,

221
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,400
wanna hang out tonight?

222
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,760
Can I finish grading
these assignments first?

223
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,480
By the time you're done,

224
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,640
we'll have missed the start of the party.

225
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,440
I thought you weren't gonna come with me.

226
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,720
I don't want to break my promise.

227
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,200
I don't know how to talk business, though.

228
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,620
It's all good.

229
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,080
I don't, either.

230
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,720
Come on, let's get inside.

231
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Hey, Temp!

232
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,700
How's it going, bro?

233
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,080
Let's head in.

234
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Sun,

235
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,000
I don't belong here at all.

236
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,240
Hang in there, Toy.

237
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,360
I'm doing the same.

238
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,280
I'm serious, Sun.

239
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,400
I feel so misplaced.

240
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Toy,

241
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,710
don't give up yet.

242
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,560
I don't think I belong here either.

243
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,520
You are really good at dancing.

244
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,880
And today's look is just...

245
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,880
so beautifully glam.

246
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,960
Glam?

247
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
You mean "glamorous"?

248
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,720
These Gen-Z slang words...

249
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,600
I almost couldn't keep up.

250
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,960
Glamour...

251
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:16,120
derives from proper discipline,
education, and upbringing.

252
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,440
Similar to Nuea,

253
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,040
whom I know by heart,

254
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,600
he doesn't swear

255
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,800
and is always selective like I am.

256
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,560
And for that matter,

257
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,640
I'll send someone
to provide further training.

258
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,320
Yes, Madam.

259
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,800
Let's schedule a meal later.

260
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
It's time for me to leave.

261
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,040
Yes.

262
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,560
Tutor Sun,

263
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,560
let's go home.

264
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,160
You don't have to wear a mask around me.

265
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,200
I love you for who you truly are.

266
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,280
Are you uncomfortable
with me sleeping over tonight?

267
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,120
You lost your room key.

268
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,720
How could I not help?

269
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,880
Don't think too much of it.

270
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,920
Temp!

271
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,880
You can't undress here!

272
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,320
You look like a prince tonight, Uncie.

273
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,560
- Shit!
- Shit!

274
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,000
- We switched?!
- We switched?!
