Since our first day together,

188
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,070
you've never given me
a kiss on the cheek.

189
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,380
I'm upset, you know?

190
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,000
See?

191
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,580
There you go.

192
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,540
I love you, Temp.

193
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,000
Damn,

194
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,000
I was getting nauseous
from miles away!

195
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,510
Yeah.

196
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,630
So in love that you probably forgot
the way back to my place, huh?

197
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,570
Don't be so hard on him.

198
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,360
It's the honeymoon phase after all.

199
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,320
Toy,

200
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,670
congrats on your relationship.

201
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,760
And Temp,

202
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,270
thank you for speaking to Madam about me.

203
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,850
I wouldn't if Nuea hadn't paid me.

204
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,380
Just kidding.

205
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,380
I was genuinely rooting for you.

206
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,100
You deserved that.

207
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,380
Well said, brother.

208
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,570
Can you tell me where the monument is?

209
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,870
Just go straight, cross the overpass,

210
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,940
and walk another 300 meters.

211
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,010
Okay, thank you.

212
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,420
Hold on a sec.

213
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,010
Temp,

214
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,780
didn't you say
you couldn't speak English?

215
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,250
Uh...

216
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,990
Well...

217
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,190
I was just following my mission.

218
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,800
Right.

219
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,060
You're a bad one.

220
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,380
Alright, then...

221
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,490
shall we start?

222
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,080
- Your donations help!
- Thank you!

224
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,000
Tutor Sun,

225
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,600
it was only when I switched to your body

226
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,970
that I realized

227
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,810
why you never complained of being tired.

228
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,770
I also just realized

229
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,150
how exhausting it was

230
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,010
being a person
everyone expected you to be;

231
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,380
even your loved ones

232
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,630
didn't realize how hard you were
on yourself.

233
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,930
I'm sorry

234
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,880
for never expressing it.

235
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,320
I was always scared

236
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,380
that if I did,

237
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,380
you'd fall out of love with me.

238
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,840
Being in each other's bodies,

239
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,380
there was no way for us...

240
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,970
not to listen

241
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,980
to the voices in our hearts,

242
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,780
which were once silenced.

243
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,960
So...

244
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,940
even though we're not switching anymore,

245
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,810
we will always stay attentive,

246
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,700
aren't we?

247
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,630
Of course.

248
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,130
I will forever listen to you.

249
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,830
Are we gonna switch again?

250
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,450
If we are,

251
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,710
I'm ready to spend the rest of my life

252
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,290
in your body.

253
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,550
Hard pass.

254
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,380
I don't want to damage your hair.

255
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,100
If we ever had children,

256
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,770
would they understand

257
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,930
how appreciative their dads were

258
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,490
of each other?

259
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,170
If they greeted the world,

260
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,030
they'd realize

261
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,790
that love doesn't have to be traditional;

262
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,290
they just have to show...

263
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,550
how attentive they are for their love.

264
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:08,010
[And they live happily ever after]

265
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,650
I won't stop before the seventh time.

266
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,920
I wonder if I could take that.
