140
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Fine.

141
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,520
I'll give it a try.

142
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,790
Okay,

143
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,120
I'll join you if you like.

144
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,240

145
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,800
and also very tired.

146
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,400
I spent the whole day in Uncie's body.

147
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,560
But when I finally lay beside him,

148
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,910
it felt oddly comforting.

149
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,460
He once told me that

150
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,400
when we sleep,
we should keep some distance.

151
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,200
So tonight, I lay right in the middle.

152
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,520
I could hear him breathing so close by,

153
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,200
and it made me feel safe.

154
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
I love how he always teaches me things.

155
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,400
I love how quiet he is.

156
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,920
And I love that he never wins
when I tease him.

157
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,400
If this body switch can bring us closer,

158
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,280
then I want to thank him...

159
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,640
for going through all of this with me.

160
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,400
And if we ever get back to our bodies,

161
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,720
I still want him by my side.

162
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,640

Uh...

168
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,000

169
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,760
Oh...

170
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,280

171

- We just came back from the North...

177
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,200

a mountain up north.

178

179
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,480
- Yeah, kind of.
- Okay.

180
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,000
Alright,

181
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,960
but these outfits are so dope.

182
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,600
Well...

183
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
We don't wear these often.

184
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,360
It's 2025, you know.

185
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,960
Right.

186
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,400
So...

187
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,400
please excuse us.

188
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,080
Okay.

189
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,320
Bye.

190
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,600
See you.

191
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,560
What's wrong with them?

192
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,000
Babe,

193
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,440
let's be more cautious, okay?

194
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay.

195
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,440
Madam's calling me!

196
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,630
Wait...

197
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,280
Tutor Sun...

198
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,160
take this call for me.

199
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,800
I can't!

200
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,350
How can I do that?

201
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Tutor Sun,

202
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,870
you are me right now.

203
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,080
What am I supposed to say?

204
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,290
Uh...

205
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,640
Just say yes

206
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,800
to everything.

207
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,600
Don't worry.

208
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,900
I'm right here.

209
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,240
Hi, Madam...

210
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,720
What are you doing?

211
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,080
What took you so long
to pick up my call?

212
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,080
The church!

213
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,440
Just went to the church.

214
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,040
Just went to the church...

215
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,720
I just went to the church, Madam.

216
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,760
Did you wish to tell me anything?

217
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,120
I want to have a meal with you.

218
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,080
We need to talk

219
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,840
tomorrow.

220
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,070
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

221
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,940
Who are you with?

222
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,980
Why are you so shocked?

223
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Say you're alone!

224
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Alone!

225
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,280
I'm alone, Madam.

226
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,560
It's echoey in the church.

227
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,000
Echoey?

228
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,760
Church?

229
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
Echoey church?

230
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,120
It's echoey in the church.

231
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,050
Oh...

232
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,320
It's echoey in the church, Madam.

233
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,860
I happen to be free.

234
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,140
You need to come.

235
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,340
It's important.

236
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,800
Say yes. Say you'd go.

237
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,960
Okay, Madam.

238
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Where?

239
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,560
Where?

240
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,480
And...

241
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,200
where should I go?

242
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,510
The usual place.

243
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,920
Gosh...

244
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,280
Jeez.

245
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,920
Here we go again.

246
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,020
- What do we do?
- Tutor Sun...

247
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,760
You're really well-prepared.

248
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,080
What should I teach you?

249
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,400
How far have you gotten in the lesson?

250
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,400
Listening and translations.

251
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,630
Right here.

252
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,839
Is something wrong?

253
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
I...

254
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,960
uphold a vow of chastity.

255
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,960
I'm not supposed to touch anyone.

256
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
Really?

257
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,600
Then why did Nuea, Sun, and Third...

258
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,470
can touch you?

259
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,600
They're taken,

260
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,660
so I have no feelings for them,

261
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,400
and I believe they feel nothing for me.

262
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,160
But you...

263
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,980
I have no idea

264
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,520
if you're taken or not.

265
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,920
Are you trying to ask if I'm single?

266
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Not like that.

267
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,960
I was just explaining.

268
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,360
So, if I'm single,

269
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,240
we can't touch, right?

270
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,200
What if...

271
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,030
I'm not?

272
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,660
That means I can touch you, right?

273
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,700
It doesn't work that way.

274
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,030
Basically,

275
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,660
if we're not close

276
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,690
or clueless about each other's status,

277
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,840
I don't want to touch anyone.

278
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,240
You're weird.

279
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,160
Most people think that

280
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,110
you shouldn't touch someone who's taken.

281
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,240
But if you're single,

282
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,740
it's okay to have physical contact.

283
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,160
I just think that

284
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,920
those in a relationship wouldn't cheat.

285
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,840
So when they're close with someone,
it's purely platonic.

286
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,460
But with single people,

287
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,840
it's easier to send the wrong signal.

288
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,200
I might really be weird, like you said.

289
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,880
That's probably why
I've never dated anyone.

290
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,840
But...

291
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,580
don't get the wrong idea.

292
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,480
You shouldn't assume
I have feelings for you.

293
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,490
Okay, fine. I get it now.

294
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,910
Should we start our lesson?

295
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,140
Yeah, let's do it.

296
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,320
What if we keep switching our bodies?

297
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,120
I'll have to join my family
for a meal, too.

298
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,160
I happen to be free.

299
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,310
You need to come.

300
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,740
It's important.

301
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,680
Could it be that
the way to break the spell is that

302
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,820
you have to sleep with yourself?

303
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,320
Nuea...

304
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,880
Yeah?

305
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,190
What should I do?

306
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,580
I'm sure your madam will find out
I'm not you.

307
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Tutor Sun,

308
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,400
you don't need to worry.

309
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,400
Just talk nicely.

310
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,960
"Yes, Madam."

311
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,680
"Yes, Madam."

312
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,640
That's all.

313
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,880
Trust me.

314
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,080
I don't think...

315
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,040
it's that easy.

316
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,480
But if you don't wanna go,

317
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,100
I know a way.

318
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,120
You do?

319
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,920
If we do it again,

320
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
we might switch back.

321
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,800
I don't think we will.

322
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,180
Third didn't mention this rule...

323
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,400
Tutor Sun,

324
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,640
there's always a way
to hack around the rules.

325
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,280
Should we give it a try?

326
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,220
Tutor Sun...

327
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,560
- Yay!
- Yay!

328
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,080
Nuea!

329
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm in my body!

330
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,790
I don't need to go there as you now!

331
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,200
See? I told you we could hack it.

332
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,560
You're amazing!

333
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,440
My baby's so clever.

334
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,880
What?

335
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,520
Well, Nuea...

336
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,720
Yeah?

337
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,760
Can I wear something else?

338
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,360
Why, though?

339
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,440
I think it's cute.

340
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,480
Seriously?

341
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,320
You like it when I wear this?

342
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
I do.

343
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,560
You should wear it every day.

344
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,200
If it makes you happy, I'll do it.

345
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,600
Did something come up, Madam?

346
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,200
You don't usually invite me out
for meals.

347
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,720
And I don't get to see you very often.

348
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,640
It sounds like
I don't really care about you.

349
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,280
You know better than anyone
how hard I work for you.

350
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,760
Don't ever say that again.

351
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,120
I'm sorry.

352
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,880
Why didn't you tell me
you had a boyfriend?

353
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,900
Don't ask how I found it out.

354
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,920
Yes?

355
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,000
The upcoming event, right?

356
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,000
We're definitely coming.

357
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,240
How about the other party?

358
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,760
Why didn't you tell me...

359
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,560
- you had a boyfriend?
- What if we keep...

360
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,030
- switching our bodies?
- When the time is met,

361
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,320
there will come a restart.

362
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,480
Shit!

363
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,280
What did you just say?

364
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,240
Did you get all those words

365
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
from that guy you're dating?

366
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,920
What did you say, Madam?

367
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,920
I know you're in a relationship,

368
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,200
and I have no intention of stopping you.

369
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,000
I just want you to consider something.

370
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,880
If he were an investment,

371
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,600
do you see profit in the future?

372
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,790
Or...

373
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,120

Do you think Sun's been acting weird?

376
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,200

377
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,800
Do you think

378
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,520
