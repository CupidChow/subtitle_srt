it's not getting up again?

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,600
I think I'm in trouble.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,600
Well, well,

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,920
what brings you here, Sun?

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,720
Here is the soap to make you get hard.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,040
You have to bathe alone
while using this soap.

12

- Whoa...

13

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,480
Let me join you.

That's my body!

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,380
You're in my body!

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
You go first, Sun.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,200
Tonight,

19
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,310
we just had sex

20
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,830
while in each other's body.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,920
At first, it scared me a little

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,120
as it felt strange.

23
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,180
I wasn't sure if we should continue,

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,539
but you started it.

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,530
Yeah.

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,680
I saw it in your eyes.

27
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,960
It wasn't just desire,

28
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:38,860
but it was love

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,280
and trust.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,560
It wasn't just sex,

31
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,759
but we were making love...

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,080
when nothing on the outside
could get in the way.

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,440
I never thought I'd have the courage
to do it, either.

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,039
Tonight only made me more certain

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,440
that love...

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,000
has nothing to do with appearances,

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,660
but everything to do with two hearts

38
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,100
that stay close no matter what.

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,200
It's Temp. What are you doing?

40
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,390
Meditating.

41
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,480
For real?

42
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,720
Gosh, you're actually meditating.

43
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,760
How did you get my contact?

44
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,390
From Third?

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,800
Easy, if you're curious enough.

46
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,360
Anyway, where's our class
taking place tomorrow?

47
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,480
I have to go with Third tomorrow.

48
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,000
Not sure where we're going.

49
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,790
Okay, got it.

50
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,270
If you become my tutor,

51
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,820
will your lover be okay with it?

52
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,450
Uh... I mean...

53
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,600
I just don't wanna cause any trouble
for you two.

54
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,660
I'm single, though.

55
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,120
That's unbelievable.

56
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,750
Is that a lie?

57
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,920
No, I've never been
in a relationship before.

58
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,440
Alright, text me
when you know the location, then.

59

Nuea,

60
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
it's time to wake up.

61
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,450
- Wait.
- Tutor Sun!

62

- We've switched back!
- We did it!

65
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,800
Could it be that
the way to break the spell is that

66
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,200
you have to sleep with yourself?

67
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
I guess so.

68
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,060
I'm sure it is.

69
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,020

But I'm still sitting right here.

108
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,800
Haven't moved an inch.

109

110
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,520
you were going out with Temp,

111
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,640
I didn't feel mad,

112
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,520
but my heart just sank.

113
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,600
I don't even know what hurts more:

114
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,920
the weakness in my body,

115
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,520
or the fear of being dumped.

116
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,160
It's my fault.

117
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,600
I know you're not asking for much.

118
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,560
You just want to feel like you matter

119
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,600
and to be loved.

120
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
That's all.

121
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,800

122
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,560
once again.

123
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,150

128

I guess it's too fake.

190
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Could it be that...

191
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,080
the way to break the spell is that

192
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,200
you have to sleep with yourself?

193
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
I guess so.

194
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
I'm sure it is.

195
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,320
Gosh,

196
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,440
Tutor Sun!

197
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,640
What if we keep switching our bodies?

198
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,920
I'll have to join my family
for a meal, too.

199
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,120
I'm sure your madam will find out
I'm not you.

200
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,320
But if you don't wanna go,

201
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,120
I know a way.

202
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Shit!

203
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,520
I honestly thought
this whole body-switching thing

204
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,850
would be a total mess,

205
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,840
annoying

206
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,100
and exhausting.

207
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,200
But after spending time in your body,

208
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,060
living as you…

209
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,520
I realized...

210
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,800
it's not just a body.

211
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,840
It's the life of someone I love.

212
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,290
I found sleeping pills in the drawer.

213
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,370
I saw the cuts
you hid beneath your favorite shirt.

214
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,200
I read the sticky note

215
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,400
that said,

216
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,160
"Don't forget to smile

217
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,800
even when you're tired."

218
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
It hit me right in the heart.

219
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,640
All this time, I was so afraid
you'd get sick of me

220
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,000
and worried I wasn't enough for you.

221
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,240
But now I know...

222
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,060
that...

223
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,240
I never truly understood you at all.

224
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,360
I'm sorry

225
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,040
for never asking if you were okay.

226
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,800
I'm sorry

227
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,360
for making it seem like
I was the only one struggling.

228
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,690
I'll take the best care of this body

229
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,160
because it belongs to my beloved one.

230
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,720
No matter when we switch back,

231
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,520
or how long we have to stay like this,

232
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,080
I promise…

233
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,690
I won't let our love be hurt
by misunderstanding ever again.

234
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,160
When we do get our bodies back,

235
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,170
I hope you'll watch this video

236
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,000
as it holds the feelings
I've kept hidden.

237
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
And today,

238
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,400
I finally understand them.

239
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:48,200
