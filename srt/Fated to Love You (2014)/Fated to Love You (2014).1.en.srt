1
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,900
What is this?
-Cut.

2
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,280
Unni, why?

3
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,610
Hyeri, what's the matter?

4
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,770
Where is Manager Do?

5
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,170
Oh Noona, I'm here.

6
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,080
What is wrong?

7
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,980
Can you say things like that after looking at this situation?
Try to do something!

8
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,410
Miss Hyeri, if you have something to say, you can tell me. What's wrong?

9
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,640
When all the other places use a stand-in, it doesn't make sense for me to be the only one doing this!

10
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,640
Well, you already signed the contract.

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,620
For the model to do it personally, without using a stand-in.

12
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,720
Anyway, humanely, this is too much! I don't think this is right.

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,050
I know that you are really suffering a lot,

14
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,270
but let's just go one more time.

15
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:34,270
Director, I'm the one who has been picked four years in a row for having the most desirable hair by the CEOs.

16
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:39,960
If my hair gets all ruined after using such a trifle shampoo like this, how are you going to take responsibility for it then?

17
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,970
Okay, okay. I got it. Fine, okay. I will do it.

18
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,520
Then go and bring mine.

19
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,640
You know the one from Finland, the one with White Birch extract.

20
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,780
Okay.

21
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,090
Move this!

22
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,590
Let's go.

23
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,530
Wait a moment.

24
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,090
Do you know me?

25
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,360
But who are you to be here...

26
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,350
Oh my, what is this? Who is he?

27
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,000
Hey!

28
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,310
Who are you to be here?

29
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,840
Even if your hair gets wet,

30
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,820
and even if the lighting is hot, never be flustered.

31
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,090
As if this is your own house, act natural...

32
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,400
without hesitation,

33
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,000
the work of 3 generations of artisans,

34
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,920
from ruined hair...

35
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,920
with the determination of relaying it all the way to

36
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,860
the root of your hair... you have to be thorough, really thorough!

37
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,270
Lastly, with the satisfaction from using this kind shampoo,

38
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,770
you explode into a big laugh.

39
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,970
The words that come out without my even knowing,

40
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,150
"I feel fresh."

41
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,580
Cut!

42
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,020
Without even me knowing, it was so perfect, I just...

43
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,440
What?
-But who are you?

44
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,460
Me?

45
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,820
President! President!

46
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,490
Excuse me... President, something big has happened!

47
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,690
What... Something has happened here, too.

48
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,100
I'm Jangin Chemical's President Lee Gun.

49
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,840
Attention please. This is not a "trifle shampoo."

50
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,140
With our Jangin Chemical's name on the line, this is the number one product

51
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,570
that's been in production for 3 generations which has history and authenticity.

52
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,040
The reason why I wanted a model to do it personally instead of a stand-in

53
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,230
was because of my wish for the authenticity of this shampoo to be relayed well to the customers.

54
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,600
I'll say it again, but this is not a "trifle shampoo!"

55
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,000
-Director Tak?
- Yes, sir.

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,300
Get the penalty fee ready.

57
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,930
No, no, President. I can do it.

58
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,560
This time, I think that the director will approve of this cut.

59
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,300
Or while we are having dinner tonight, together,

60
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,620
what about we talk again about the contents of the contract.

61
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,480
It's fine.

62
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,800
A model who has no amount of authenticity,

63
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,710
who just asks for a lot of money,

64
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,600
I don't need you.

65
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,420
Please leave.

66
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,270
Here, keep going.

67
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,990
President!

68
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,690
How many times is this?!

69
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,020
At this rate, he's going to take this company down!

70
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,470
President, why are you... ?

71
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,980
What is the big problem?

72
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,650
Oh. Yeah... the problem has finally unraveled, President!

73
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,960
Chairwoman Wang was finally called by the elders and has left right away. There is big chaos, yes.

74
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,290
Jeonju Lee's Family emergency meeting

75
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:39,360
To my Gun, there is a girl that he dated for six years.

76
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,230
You all know that our Gun, without his sense of responsibility and trustworthiness,

77
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,260
is just an empty corpse.

78
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,760
Please trust him.

79
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,620
At the latest, I'm going to get him married off within this year.

80
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,080
He will get married after turning 30. You also guaranteed us this 3 years ago!

81
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you think we will get tricked again?

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,780
If that is true, you will have to write a memorandum as a promise

83
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:10,610
saying that Gun will get married in 100 days.

84
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,420
Is all this really necessary?

85
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,360
Do you not have confidence in this one thing?

86
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,080
At this critical time when our bloodline might end.

87
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,660
What is it that you have done, Chairwoman Wang?

88
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,240
Jeonju Lee's family's 22nd generation grandson and the 9th generation only son, Lee Gun.

89
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,320
I will greet all the elders of many households.

90
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,490
I, Lee Gun, using the enterprise activity, that my grandmother spent all her youth raising, as a footing,

91
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,390
I made our Jangin Chemical the number one company in the daily supply field.

92
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,400
Even right now, the company is wielding status in the global market,

93
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,680
I made it possible that the stock rose 5 times...

94
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,390
more than 5 times.

95
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,040
Thanks to this, to have lessened the worry of

96
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:33,480
each and every elder in our family's later years, I find this to be ve~ry worthwhile.

97
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,540
Your yacht and the mansions you bought last time; you are managing them well, right?

98
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,090
The woman that I love

99
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,670
is finally coming to Korea.

100
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,620
Putting not my grandmother's, but my, Lee Gun's name at stake,

101
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,450
this fall I will definitely

102
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,580
get married!

103
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,120
Wasn't I cool?

104
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,420
♫ Buy it, use it, break it, fix it, trash it, change it, mail - upgrade it. ♫

105
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,140
♫ Charge it, point it, zoom it, press it, snap it, work it, quick - erase it. ♫

106
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,760
♫ Write it, cut it, paste it, save it, load it, check it, quick - rewrite it. ♫

107
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,320
♫ Plug it, play it, burn it, rip it, drag and drop it, zip - unzip it. ♫

108
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,940
♫ Lock it, fill it, call it, find it, view it, code it, jam - unlock it. ♫

109
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,440
♫ Surf it, scroll it, pause it, click it, cross it, crack it, switch - update it. ♫

110
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Hello.

111
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,740
♫ Scan it, send it, fax - rename it. Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it, turn it, one more time... ♫

112
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,160
Wait for me!

113
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,680
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

114
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,740
Wait, wait, wait, this is hot!

115
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,520
I'm sorry.

116
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,490
Wait a moment.

117
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,360
Give it to me.

118
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,670
Ah, thank you!

119
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,970
Excuse me.

120
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,920
It smells great.

121
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,180
It is freshly brewed. Do you want one?

122
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,420
Is it okay if I drink it?

123
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,800
It's not the smell of the coffee though...

124
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,450
I think the smell is coming from somewhere else.

125
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,570
But why do you always do this kind of thing?

126
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,670
I was on my way out.

127
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,910
Thank you.
-Have a good day!

128
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,630
Well, I can just eat the coffee mix anyway.

129
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,960
One Americano with an extra shot and one glaze.

130
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:30,110
2 green cappuccinos, and a choco cream box.

131
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,150
There's always a person like this around.

132
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,510
When they're not even a part-timer, but they run all the errands.

133
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,830
When they're busy with their own work, but cannot refuse .

134
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,460
Even if others don't thank them, a person who still listens to everyone's requests.

135
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,150
Bagel.

136
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,310
Coupon.

137
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,390
Kim Mi Young, can you photocopy this?

138
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,830
Kim Mi Young, did you clean the desk yet?

139
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,160
I need a copy.
-Get me a cup of coffee.

140
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,330
Miss Mi Young, go to the court for me.

141
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,780
Miss Mi Young, you didn't water my plant?

142
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,700
Miss Mi Young, photocopy this too.

143
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,410
Miss Mi Young, two glasses of iced coffee here!

144
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,070
Kim Mi Young, here is today's to-do list.

145
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,740
That's right. I'm Kim Mi Young.

146
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,560
It's a really common and plain name, right? Like my face...

147
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,620
If I look at the post-it, it's just like me.

148
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,060
Although it's needed by everyone, it's not precious.

149
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,130
Because it's comfortable and easy to throw away.

150
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,970
Miss Mi Young, please throw this out.
-Throw this out, too.

151
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,360
Shred this.
-This, too.

152
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,960
As expected, today as well.

153
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,370
Mine, too, since you're on your way there.

154
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,410
Oh!
-Hey, hey, hey!

155
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,700
These fine-dust like people in an expected crisis... seriously!

156
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,300
Unnie, I told you to never do this again, didn't I?!

157
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,940
Every time you do this, it makes me feel upset, too.

158
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,210
Even so, I should separate the trash.

159
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:33,460
"I'm not a housekeeper." "I'm not running errands as a part-timer!" Why can't you say that? Just say it!

160
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,390
Are you Kim Jung Eun from Lovers In Paris?

161
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,400
When you reject them, tell them clearly that you can't.

162
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,230
Why can't I do that? I can't say no.

163
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,550
That's a disease. A disease. You're-too-nice-it's-annoying disease!

164
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,260
It's not because I'm nice.

165
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,440
If I refuse to do it, imagine how embarrassed the other person would be.

166
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,600
I can't stand that.

167
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,900
Even with saying no, it's possible if you practice!

168
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,080
Everything is hard at first, but it's easier the next time.

169
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,600
From now on, everyday, before you sleep, say to your pillow,

170
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,190
"No~~! No~~!" Practice that.
(Parody of Gag Concert Skit Late Love)

171
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,520
"No~~! No~~!"

172
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,560
It's hard.

173
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,200
Will it really work if I practice?

174
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,920
Aigoo.

175
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,050
Miss Mi Young!

176
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,770
Yes, Lawyer Yong.

177
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,520
Here. Apply this to the court.

178
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,040
Yes, I got it.

179
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,130
Also, can I ask for a favor?

180
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,880
Favor?

181
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,510
I can't do it today.

182
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:47,460
Okay, I understand. That's possible, right?

183
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,820
Ah, I have to endure it. It'll be fine if I just pass this timing well.

184
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,100
1 second, 2 seconds, 3.

185
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,260
No. As expected, I can't do it.

186
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,620
Sure. You can ask for a favor. What is it?

187
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,370
It is just a personal errand.

188
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,860
It's okay.

189
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,250
Chores are best when they are personal.

190
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,580
My daughter, who's in Canada,

191
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,010
asked me to make sure to get it from here.

192
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,200
Cherry pink, cherry...

193
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,900
Just looking at the name, it's already sweet.

194
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,690
Gun, Gun.

195
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,250
Just now, what you said at the meeting,

196
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,770
why were you saying it so boldly?

197
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,870
How are you going to manage the aftermath?

198
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,290
Madam Wang, this time, Se Ra is coming to Korea for good.

199
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,290
Welcome to Korea!

200
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,350
So, for good?
-For good!

201
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,960
So she'll stop doing ballet now?
-She'll stop!

202
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,860
Aigoo! This punk! Why do you say such good news just now?!

203
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,840
It's because I'm happy!

204
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,780
Um, just in case,

205
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,500
if she doesn't accept the proposal, just in case?

206
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,160
What do you mean "just in case"?

207
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,380
Why are you saying something so negative when I'm preparing for a once-in-a-life-time event?!

208
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,550
I'm sorry, President.

209
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:18,100
Are you sure that I don't have to go with you?

210
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,100
I will pick my lover's ring carefully.

211
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,890
Director Tak, you stay here and prepare the things I told you about without any errors.

212
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,250
Meticulously!
-Meticulously!

213
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,550
Grandma, I'll get going.

214
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,050
Bye bye!
-Bye bye!

215
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,450
It must be great. Who could it be?

216
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,290
How about this?

217
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,360
This is the best ring we have for a proposal.

218
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,630
Do you not understand?

219
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,550
Is it difficult?

220
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,640
To explain it a bit easier,

221
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,990
don't you have something more elegant and graceful?

222
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:39,370
Uh, you already looked at all the products we have in our store.

223
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,230
Ah! If you know what kind of person your girlfriend is,

224
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,590
it will make it easier for us to recommend something for her.

225
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,680
She is...

226
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:13,190
She is my poet.

227
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,840
Not a poem that you read and hear, how should I put it...

228
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,690
Umm, a poem that on the stage, gives off

229
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,000
a comfortable radiance with an entire body.

230
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,390
The world is peaceful and fresh,

231
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,130
and it's really calm.

232
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,610
Like during the days of a young child,

233
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,990
with both arms around me,

234
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,330
like my mom's warm embrace.

235
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,980
She writes poems for me.

236
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,480
She's a special woman like that.

237
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,890
Ah, so cute.

238
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,140
Who is it?

239
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,090
My younger sister. How is she?

240
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,320
She's pretty, right?
-She's really pretty.

241
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,840
Her older brother is good looking, too.

242
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,820
I think the two of you look so much alike.

243
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,500
I also wish it was like that.

244
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,810
I lost her when I was too young. I forgot her face, so...

245
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:36,080
I thought she might look like this, so I drew her as I imagined.

246
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,570
Ah, too obvious and too cheesy.

247
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,230
More than that,

248
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,370
I know for a fact that I won't even recognize her if we meet again.

249
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,820
What to do?

250
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,080
It's too sad.

251
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,530
When I was in first grade,

252
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,690
my sister and I parted.

253
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,500
I was in an orphanage and was adopted to America.

254
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,150
Even if I look for her every time I come to Korea,

255
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,290
it's not easy.

256
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,160
Stinks. Who falls for things like that these days?

257
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,730
If it was me, I wouldn't fall for it for, even if it's just for my pride.

258
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,880
That's right! Yeah, that's right.

259
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,330
Why is this so interesting?

260
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,830
Excuse me?

261
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,020
Oh, a mouse!

262
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,230
Really...

263
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,620
You can hear it all. If you like me, just be honest.

264
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,070
Don't act all cute.

265
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,150
You're protesting because I didn't flirt with you, right?

266
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,160
What should we do?

267
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,790
You are not my type at all.

268
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,690
What is your type?
-From head to toe,

269
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,920
someone who is completely the opposite of you will do.

270
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,720
Princess, we welcome you for coming to Magical Candy House!

271
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,150
Princess, if you need help, call us at anytime.

272
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,240
I'm not a princess...

273
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,570
Princess, these are Love-Love Candies that achieve your love!

274
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,860
My oppa gave me this when he confessed to me and it was so sweet,

275
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,750
that I said "yes" without even knowing it.

276
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,050
I didn't like him all that much at the time.

277
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,490
Give me this please.

278
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:12,450
Princess, you bought a lot.

279
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,860
This is cherry pink, as a bonus.

280
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,910
This is the famous Love-Love Candy.

281
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,350
Thank you.

282
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,640
Se Ra,

283
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,630
I think it will suit you well.

284
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,250
I hope you'll accept it.

285
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,670
Oh..

286
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,220
Oh my.

287
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,400
Aigoo aigoo, what should we do?

288
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,500
Ring...

289
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,160
Candy...

290
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,100
Ring!

291
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,370
My ring!

292
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,950
My ring...

293
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,780
My ring, my ring...

294
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,900
ring...ring..

295
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,160
What's wrong?

296
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,560
There! It's my ring. I said my ring is there!

297
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,310
My ring, my ring!

298
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,960
I'll go get it.
- Yes, quickly.

299
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,530
No, not there, but it's rolling to the side.

300
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,180
I'm sorry.

301
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,380
Look over there!

302
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,400
Not there!

303
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,810
Quickly!

304
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,320
Left, right, left!!

305
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,640
It's gone over!

306
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,820
I found it!

307
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,860
What are you guys doing?

308
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,910
It's over there!

309
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,560
The wrinkles... it's going towards there.

310
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,950
He hit it! That wrinkly dog hit it.

311
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,230
Go slowly!

312
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,530
What are you doing? The ring...

313
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,790
Pick up that ring!

314
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,820
Me?
-I really can't touch dogs..

315
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,200
Just go quickly!

316
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,670
I'm scared. Quickly!

317
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,200
He looks a bit scary...

318
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,150
Do it.

319
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,980
Did you get it?

320
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,360
Just a little more.

321
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,330
Almost there!

322
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,590
Did you get it?
-To the side.

323
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,110
A little more?

324
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,590
Did you get it?

325
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,240
Why can't you get it yet?!

326
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,380
Okay, okay.

327
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,860
Is it the end?

328
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,640
Following my ancestors who died in their 30s...

329
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,810
Is it... the end for me as well?

330
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:43,980
Father, Grandfather, and the grandfathers after that,

331
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,270
Am I, too, in the end,

332
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,900
not possible to escape from my fate?

333
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,520
No!

334
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,790
If this is the end, it's a useless death!

335
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,830
But

336
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,520
who is this woman?

337
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,220
She's fast.

338
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,190
She is a really fast woman!

339
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,820
No...

340
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,670
Let's go together..

341
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,710
Let's go together...

342
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,020
Under construction

343
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,120
What should I do?!

344
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,590
No!

345
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,920
What should I do?

346
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,630
Oh my...!

347
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,860
Don't worry, don't worry.

348
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,590
I'll try to do something.

349
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,050
I can do it.

350
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,240
It could be dangerous!

351
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,920
Don't worry.

352
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,520
You rascal. You must be scolded, you rascal!

353
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,410
You rascal. Wait right there!

354
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,980
I will...

355
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,420
Don't worry.

356
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,100
You must be scolded, you rascal!

357
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,230
Woof, woof. You punk.

358
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,670
This person is weird, too. I must be crazy, seriously.

359
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,530
Come here!

360
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,230
Is it dead? I killed it, right?

361
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,150
Don't...

362
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,580
Don't touch her!

363
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,880
What should I do....

364
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,870
Hey, you!

365
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,120
Don't touch her!

366
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,150
Hold on, just hold on!

367
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,040
It's this. . .

368
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,560
Cherry!

369
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,150
Cherry! Why did you follow her?

370
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,500
My goodness.

371
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,570
Oh, this is cherry flavored, right?

372
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,840
He goes crazy if he gets a whiff of cherry scents.

373
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,360
So, that's why his name is Cherry.

374
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,260
Look here,

375
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,610
you should tie him up really well.

376
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,880
What would you have done if it had bitten a person?

377
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,870
I was going to scold him, really scold him,

378
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,690
but I held back.

379
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,760
Oh. . . I'm sorry.

380
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,140
He's usually a cute and gentle dog.

381
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,830
I'm sorry. Let's go Cherry, let's go.

382
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,460
Let's go.

383
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,010
My ring! My ring.

384
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,340
Did you get it? Did you get it or not?

385
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,290
You didn't get it?

386
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,750
I got it.

387
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,060
I did good right? Your ring is here.

388
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,860
Oww!

389
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,530
Ouch, my finger almost fell off.

390
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,170
What kind of person are you?

391
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:30,980
Why is this on your finger? This is the ring I'm using to propose!

392
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,210
It's a kind of ring that another girl should not wear first and bring bad luck!

393
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,220
Since I was in a hurry, I did it so I wouldn't lose it!

394
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,600
Also, why did you run and make this situation?

395
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,180
I'm sorry. But isn't it a relief that we found your ring?

396
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,800
Relief? What's a relief?

397
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,070
This precious ring rolled around in a mess because of you.

398
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,450
And ultimately, that Cherry or whatever was following you.

399
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,730
There's nothing that was a relief. So, why are you saying it was a relief? Why?!

400
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,280
How was I supposed to know, that the dog followed me because of the candy?

401
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,250
Enough. But if . .

402
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:05,910
If I propose and it turns out bad, just know that it is because you and your bad luck. Got it?

403
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,190
Do you know what kind of ring this is? Such an unlucky situation happens as soon as I buy it...

404
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,990
Does this make any sense! So unlucky! Seriously...

405
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:15,030
What...
-This unlucky...

406
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,030
This makes no sense!

407
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:21,900
What kind of person is that? Only saying what he needs to say.

408
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,300
Candy.

409
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,500
Attention please.

410
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,390
Today, as you all know,

411
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:39,440
it's the 10th anniversary of our giant law firm.

412
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,800
That's why we'll begin raffling the presents

413
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,180
that the company has specially prepared for us.

414
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,840
But I feel like something is missing.

415
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,840
Mi Young isn't here.

416
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,210
Do you have to actually think about that? It's not like she's a prop that doesn't need to be here.

417
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,900
Why are you looking after a person that is useless?

418
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,680
Nobody would take notice even if she was absent from work.

419
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,800
That's what I'm saying.

420
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,630
Miss Mi Young! Thank you.

421
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,400
Leave it there.

422
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,050
Your business cards

423
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,440
are in here.

424
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,420
The person who is picked from the raffle,

425
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,430
will go to the best resort in Macau.

426
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,240
Macau!!!

427
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,290
Wow!!!!

428
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,100
You have to buy your own airplane ticket though.

429
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,040
Why not just give everything?

430
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,080
There are a lot of cheap ones, too!

431
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,590
Whoever it is, must be so happy! I never get picked for those.

432
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:48,580
The person who will be taking today's fortune is...

433
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,270
Oh, I'm nervous.

434
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,830
I'm so nervous.

435
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,640
Kim Mi Young.

436
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,540
It's you.

437
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,880
Which Kim Mi Young?

438
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,970
Oh, there is more than one Kim Mi Young.

439
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,410
It's general affairs, Kim Mi Young.

440
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,440
It's you!

441
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,360
Really me?

442
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,000
Oh my gosh! Thank you!

443
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,040
Congratulations.

444
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,770
Ji Yeon, since this is a couple package you and I can go together.

445
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,560
Am I crazy? I wouldn't be a couple with you.

446
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,450
Then who do you go with?

447
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,410
It's a problem even when you get picked.

448
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:39,890
That's why you need to have several men in tow, so that you can use one on cases like this.

449
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,370
No way.

450
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:49,950
How can I go with you? You have to go with a man to a place like this.

451
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:53,230
Meticulously!
-I prepared it meticulously!

452
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,890
First.

453
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,950
President... this, you see this, right?

454
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,610
You got the ring back from the doorstep of death.

455
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,890
The problem is the location of the proposal.

456
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:10,130
The place that you were planning to use

457
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:15,500
is the best resort in Macau!

458
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,860
Thi...Huh?

459
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,640
That is the place where I first met Se Ra.

460
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,420
That is why you chose this place!

461
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,210
Wow, remembering the first place that he met with you,

462
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,870
and a guy who proposes from there.

463
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,410
That kind of a man. Well, this is just...

464
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,800
After your parents passed away early on,

465
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,910
how lonely have you lived till now with Chairwoman Wang?

466
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,900
What are you saying right now?

467
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,020
Who are you saying is lonely? I am not lonely!

468
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,300
If I had a younger sibling...

469
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,240
I bet that you are feeling this. For me, you should act like a gentleman.

470
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,410
No, don't act like a gentleman and please . . .

471
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,860
Why? Why?
-Surprise!

472
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,880
It's me, Gun!

473
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,410
No!

474
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,610
What's wrong?

475
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,420
Turn on the lights.

476
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,050
You came, Se Ra.

477
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,900
Welcome.

478
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,760
Se Ra is here! I said Se Ra is here!

479
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,900
Se Ra is here!

480
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,780
Se Ra! It's been a while since I saw you. You guys can talk privately.

481
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,110
Se Ra is here!

482
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,340
Director?

483
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,610
You came, Se Ra?

484
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,610
What is it? Tell me honestly. What were you doing without me?

485
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,820
I surrender!

486
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,670
Tell me.
-Alright! My neck is going to twist.

487
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,360
I was planning.

488
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,730
A plan to go somewhere fun with you.

489
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,920
What is this? You were being good.

490
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,640
Of course.

491
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,280
How did you come here so suddenly? Didn't you say you were coming tomorrow?

492
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,620
Since I surprised you like this, aren't you happy?

493
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,680
Are you joking? Of course, I'm happy to see you!

494
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,300
It's a shame though...

495
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,360
I was going to have a parade from the airport to here tomorrow.

496
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,680
With a red carpet made of roses.

497
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,170
Really? Should I leave and come back in?

498
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,050
Don't go.

499
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,950
Now,

500
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:56,570
I am never going to let you go anywhere again, my love.

501
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,610
Three Daughter's Mother Restaurant

502
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,240
Why? Why did you call me?

503
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,730
A trip? You and me together?

504
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,890
What? Me, too!

505
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,430
Take me with you, too, Mi Young! Don't forget about your sister!

506
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,860
Your big sister, too! This life is so boring that it's sad.
Please let me escape!

507
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,770
You're so loud! Go over there!

508
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,750
Where?

509
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,800
South East Asia?

510
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,440
It's an awfully luxurious resort! It's in Macau.

511
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,480
Luxury resort?

512
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:40,190
It's okay. You go have fun.

513
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,660
I said I'm not going! Hang up!

514
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,730
Wench! Why at a time like this?

515
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,330
Where am I going to go when the whole island is concerned about the soap factory?

516
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:00,480
I think I should just sell the tickets.

517
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,870
I feel like the air plane tickets are a waste.

518
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,600
It doesn't suit me either.

519
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,520
Wouldn't it be awesome at a time like this to rain men?

520
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,960
So, that we could choose according to our liking.

521
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,690
Mi Young!

522
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,520
Hello!

523
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,200
Here is what you ordered! Enjoy!

524
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,280
Here, Mi Young.

525
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,610
Aigoo.

526
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,380
You waited long, didn't you? Please eat.

527
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,430
Thank you. I will-
-No, it's okay. I'll do it.

528
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,570
Please eat.

529
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,620
How is it?

530
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,180
It's delicious.

531
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,020
Your expression looks totally burdened that you're about to get indigestion.

532
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,710
No! It's really good.

533
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:31,440
When you get nervous, you say "really" a lot.

534
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,320
How did you know?

535
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,210
What do you think of me?

536
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,830
You don't have to answer me right away. We can get to know each other from now on.

537
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,740
Eat.
-Okay.

538
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,920
Wow!

539
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,290
Once we turned on the visuals with this music, it sounds totally different.

540
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,140
As expected.

541
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,570
Let's have a blast starting this weekend, okay?
-Yes, Hyungnim.

542
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,860
Good night!

543
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:59,810
I'm taking care of it in front of the office. Have a good lunch.

544
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,050
I'm sending it. Seriously.

545
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,150
Without a hitch! Right now!

546
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,710
Press it immediately.

547
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,510
What does it say?

548
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,430
It's still on 1.

549
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:28,720
He hasn't read it yet. I shouldn't have sent it.

550
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,500
He's going to laugh at me, right? He only bought me a meal once.

551
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,840
Why am I being delusional?

552
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,840
No, never.

553
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,800
Males, if they aren't interested in you, they never buy you anything expensive.

554
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,640
He read it!

555
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,400
But there's no reply.

556
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:01,260
I'm going crazy.

557
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,950
Why are you only eating ddukbokki? You should eat rice.

558
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,780
See you later.

559
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,040
My sweetheart.
-He called you 'sweetheart'!

560
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,590
Unni, it's over. It's over.

561
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,450
He is bluntly asking you to date him.

562
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,890
You think so?

563
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:20,890
You can't take this and stay still. You have take it further!

564
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,530
Tell him you want to go to the resort with him.

565
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:26,020
Hey.
-Just tell him! Send him a heart, too!

566
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,410
A heart, what heart?

567
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,660
You put it (heart) there and..

568
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,160
Aigoo.

569
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,550
That person over there, he's Lawyer Min, right?

570
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,030
Go over there and tell him now. I'm going in first.

571
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,360
Hey, hey, right now-

572
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,320
Excuse me, Lawyer Min.

573
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,770
Lawyer Min!

574
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,450
LAWYER MIN!

575
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,710
Mi Young!

576
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,470
Was the kimbap and ddukbokki delicious?

577
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,700
Yes.
-That's strange.

578
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,930
I didn't see you for just a bit but I missed you.

579
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,310
Well...about that...

580
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,520
What is it?

581
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,380
Was it weird I called you "sweetheart"?

582
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,110
No! Not at all!

583
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:31,110
I'm glad you think the same way I do.

584
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,360
I thought to myself that I was moving too fast.

585
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,950
I'm going to speak comfortably now.

586
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:48,430
That resort, if there isn't anyone you're going with yet, do you want to go together?

587
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,960
Company: Jungin Chemical Inc.
CEO: Gun Lee

588
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:21,250
I'm happy that our company's products will be supplied to the best resort in Macao.

589
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,130
I'm happy that our company's products will be supplied to the best resort in Macao.

590
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,250
We are ones honored to do business with Jangin who take pride in the best products.

591
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,240
We are ones honored to do business with Jangin who take pride in the best products.

592
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,920
Thank you.

593
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:15,240
I am honored to serve you while you are staying here.

594
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:19,150
In any case, is this the place?

595
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,550
Yes. When you get off the gondola and start walking this way,

596
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:25,820
an orchestra will start playing.

597
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,420
Then, you can go over there and do the proposal that you planned.

598
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,430
Over there?

599
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:57,420
But why didn't the person who is going to become your wife come here with you?

600
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,010
She had something important to do so she is coming here in the evening.

601
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:02,850
Before that, I would like to check in advance.

602
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:06,740
Of course. Then let's go this way.

603
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,870
Our island's enemy, Lee Gun.

604
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,400
Whatever we have to do... that evil human being,

605
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,580
we have to drop him into the trap.

606
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,760
Ji Yeon, I have arrived!

607
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,350
Unnie, you are finally in Macau!

608
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:59,190
You have to completely enjoy it until you get your money's worth for your plane tickets.

609
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,010
You just let it go today

610
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:05,620
But what should I do tonight?

611
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,330
It hasn't been long since we have started dating. I'm worried...

612
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,700
Why are you worrying?

613
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,220
You went with the man that you like.

614
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:19,180
When you like him, isn't it obvious for your body to follow?

615
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,780
It isn't perhaps your first time, right?

616
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,650
Ah, Lawyer Min is coming. I'm going to leave now.

617
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:31,830
It was crowded at the currency exchange booth.

618
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,510
This must have been heavy!

619
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,480
Why didn't you tell me to carry it?

620
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,180
It feels like I asked you to.

621
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,920
It's not like that!

622
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,640
Macau is really awesome!

623
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:48,730
Let's go!
-Alright!

624
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,240
Yes, I just arrived.

625
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:30,580
I said I got it! I also put my life on the line.

626
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:37,320
Hey!

627
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,690
Hey! I said it's no joke.

628
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:43,160
We have to really put our lives on the line!

629
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,850
Please, Miss Kim, okay?

630
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:51,810
Ah, wench. Just watch what happens if you don't put your life on the line.

631
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,160
You know how much money I've invested in her?

632
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,180
President, I don't think you have to worry about it.

633
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:59,940
Miss Kim is a pro in this area.

634
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,910
Let's get to work.

635
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,560
Carefully, carefully....

636
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,130
Hey, slowly!

637
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:22,410
Now, we just have to feed it to that enemy at all cost.

638
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:23,980
That's right!

639
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,190
If he just takes this drug, tonight will be flared up! (he'll be excited) It'll really be no joke.

640
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,000
We have to be successful. Are you sure about this?
-Of course!

641
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,250
Hey!

642
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,480
What are you two doing here?

643
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,960
What's going on?

644
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,540
He seems to be asking something.

645
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,150
Ask?

646
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:48,180
Of course, I know. Ha mu ha mu...

647
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,670
Ha mu ha mu...

648
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,730
What are they saying? Maybe it's a dialect...

649
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:54,420
Hurry! Hurry!

650
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,160
Hurry, hurry. Move it quickly.

651
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,370
There are so many things to do! Hurry! Hurry!

652
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,550
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

653
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,610
There are so many things to move! Get it together!

654
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:08,250
No! What is this?

655
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:12,390
What are we going to do?

656
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:32,080
You are like that.

657
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,790
You don't understand men's pride.

658
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:40,160
When I said to pay half-and-half, you keep saying that you'll pay for it all. You can't do that!

659
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:46,220
This is my ticket, so I should be the one paying.

660
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,300
Half-and-half is a little...

661
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,220
It's not like it's half-sauced chicken and half-fried chicken.

662
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:57,170
I understand. But tonight, I will take care of you.

663
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:01,850
Oh my...

664
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:05,780
Don't be shy. Imagine it.

665
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:17,920
We are almost there.

666
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,260
Oh, it's here, Honey.

667
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:28,040
Come in.
- Okay.

668
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,750
It isn't famous for nothing. It is pretty great.

669
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:00,090
Pretty!

670
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,960
Wow, this is great.

671
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:17,820
What should we do now?

672
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,490
Huh?

673
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,310
What does he mean by that?

674
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,100
Perhaps, as soon as we arrive...

675
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,720
Do you have somewhere you want to go?

676
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:32,440
Oh, I saw the brochure.

677
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:37,620
There is a swimming pool, spa, and casino.

678
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,540
Casino...

679
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,390
Then where should we go first?

680
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:46,860
Then I am going to take a look, so rest a bit.

681
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,620
Okay.

682
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:52,540
My honey, you must be tired.

683
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:02,300
Lawyer Min must be shy when we are alone.

684
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:22,040
Wow, what am I going to do with that back? It is downright lethal.

685
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,260
Hi!

686
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:28,460
Your back is pretty lethal, too.

687
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,470
You are Korean?

688
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:34,690
I am Miss Kim, who burned down Seoul and who will soon take over this Macau.

689
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:37,690
I'm lawyer, Min Bun Chon.

690
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:41,540
Casino and a beauty are two things that you can't think separately.

691
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,620
Where did Lawyer Min go?

692
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,560
I shouldn't catch a cold.

693
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,120
The air conditioning is super high.

694
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,410
He said that he is just going to take a look...

695
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,630
Did something happen?

696
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,490
This is the real beginning.

697
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:31,210
Se Ra...

698
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,340
Thank you.

699
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:39,640
For coming back to Korea

700
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,060
and also coming to travel with me.

701
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,730
I know that you coming back to Korea

702
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:50,420
is not just a happy thing for you.

703
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:54,010
And I, who is proposing to you,

704
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,100
may seem selfish to you.

705
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,860
But...I...

706
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:03,550
Instead of being next to you when you are proud

707
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:07,190
and are at the top of your life,

708
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,070
I want to be the kind of man who stays next to you

709
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:13,710
during a difficult time, and share the burden.

710
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:17,100
It's good when you're smiling, too.

711
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:21,590
But I want to be someone that you want to see when you cry.

712
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,980
Can I do that?

713
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:31,690
I love you, Se Ra.

714
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:38,620
Will you marry me?

715
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,480
What was that sound?

716
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,350
Is someone there?

717
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,670
There is someone, right?

718
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,380
Excuse me!

719
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:09,110
Is someone here? There is someone, right?

720
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:16,570
It seems like someone is here. I know.

721
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,780
Cool, cool!

722
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:39,710
The effects are showing!

723
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,210
What is your true identity? You're a gold digger, aren't you?

724
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:46,250
Gold digger?
-How do you expect me to believe this kind of unbelievable situation?

725
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,550
What the... !

726
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,760
We just came here to have fun anyways.

727
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,890
Let's just think that our partners changed.

728
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,860
Have confidence.

729
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:58,600
From now on, you are a queen.
