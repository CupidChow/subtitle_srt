00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,500
Episode 18

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,980
Jangin Chemical's CEO, Lee Gun, is about to enter to reveal his decisions.
- Grandma.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,790
Where is Gun right now?
- Mi Young...

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,100
Our Gun... What are we going to do with our Gun?

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,270
CEO Gun of Jangin Chemicals holds a press conference.
- What are we going to do with our Gun? What should we do?

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,560
What's your relationship with CEO Lee Gun?

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,870
Did you know anything about CEO Lee Gun's hereditary disease?

8
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,670
Tell us!

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,270
Please move.

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,960
Stop!

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,240
Say something!

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,880
♬ I try erasing but I can’t erase you ♬

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:53,960
♬ You’ve become my everything ♬

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,960
♬ Oh you, I can’t see you, ♬

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,420
♬ I can't touch you, ♬

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,950
♬ But I’m okay ♬

17
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,260
♬ Even if goodbyes are sad ♬

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,680
I am Lee Gun,

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,200
Jangin Chemicals' CEO.
♬ But if you are happy, ♬

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,170
♬ If you can smile, then I… ♬

21
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,250
Taxi!
♬ The more I erase you, ♬

22
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,180
♬ I will miss you. ♬

23
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,750
♬ I will shed more tears than today ♬

24
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,080
Firstly, the rumors about

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,740
my genetic disease are all true.

26
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,860
However, all the vicious rumors about my disease

27
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,540
are not true.

28
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,650
And because of my disease, I understand

29
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,090
the stock holders' worries about my ability to run the company.

30
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,300
So I, Lee Gun, here today,

31
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,720
officially announce my resignation

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,920
as Jangin Chemicals' CEO.

33
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,550
♬ I will miss you the more I erase you ♬

34
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:30,200
I'm sorry for worrying many people because of my personal reasons.

35
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,770
♬ Like fate, I won’t ever have anyone like you ♬

36
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,940
Lee Gun!
♬ Only you♬

37
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,800
♬ Only you ♬

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,570
♬ As much as my tears, ♬

39
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:52,180
I found out everything.

40
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,490
♬ Good bye, my love ♬

41
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,770
The reason why you kept lying to me

42
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:10,200
and why you pushed and sent me away that viciously.

43
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,750
Look, Ellie Kim.

44
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,730
What are you doing at somebody else's press conference?

45
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,760
Lie to me while looking in my eyes.

46
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,900
Tell me that you didn't miss me at all for the past three years

47
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,970
and that I was not meaningful to you in your life.

48
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,980
Secretary Tak!

49
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,290
Get her out of this room.

50
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,770
What are you doing right now?!

51
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,710
Tell me.

52
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:54,250
If you are confident that you can live without me,

53
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,750
I will really let you go.

54
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,540
♬ Your smile spreads ♬

55
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,150
Fine. I lied.

56
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,370
If you are having a hard time, or if you are in pain, I will also be in pain!

57
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,720
That's why I lied!

58
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,140
Gun, are you stupid?

59
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,340
What did you say?

60
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,610
♬ I keep thinking of you,♬

61
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,290
♬ You, who just seemed like coincidence ♬

62
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,170
Why are you worrying in advance

63
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,500
about the hard times I might face?

64
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,900
Don't do that anymore.

65
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,570
Why...

66
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,210
Because of a disease that hasn't occurred yet,

67
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,950
why do we have to be sad,

68
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,600
be in despair,

69
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,850
or cry in advance?

70
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,400
We can cry when when we have to.

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,930
Look, Kim Mi Young,

72
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,540
don't misunderstand.

73
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,010
Even if you say that you found out everything,

74
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:22,120
nothing changes. My disease won't change,

75
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,370
and I...

76
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,970
♬ I shout out loud, I only love you ♬

77
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,280
I don't have the right to love you.

78
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,310
♬  You who is like destiny ♬

79
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,370
♬  I love you ♬

80
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,670
Why do you need a "right" to love?

81
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,910
I'm saying that it's okay.

82
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,280
That ticking bomb...

83
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,600
even if we don't know when it might explode, don't be scared in advance.

84
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,010
No matter what happens,

85
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,190
I won't let you be sick alone.

86
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,250
I love you.

87
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,820
♬ I miss you ♬

88
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,420
♬ So I turn around again ♬

89
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:34,890
♬ I think of you as I stop in place ♬

90
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,160
♬ When I hold out my hand♬

91
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,710
♬ And hug you tight ♬

92
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:49,030
♬ The twisted destiny will become love ♬

93
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,310
♬ I shout out loud, ♬

94
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,780
♬  I only love you ♬

95
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,230
♬ My heart wants you, ♬

96
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:07,700
♬ you who is like destiny ♬

97
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,710
♬ I love you ♬

98
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,240
♬ I only love you ♬

99
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,600
♬ My heart wants you, ♬

100
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:28,350
♬ You who is like destiny ♬

101
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,210
♬ I love you ♬

102
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,250
Room 2006 again.

103
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,980
Room 2006.

104
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,280
I thought that we have to talk by ourselves quietly.

105
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,090
So I asked Secretary Tak.

106
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,330
This is shocking, just shocking. Do you know where that place was?

107
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,040
In front of all those people,

108
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,340
you somehow took up courage.

109
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,840
Why did you act so coldly

110
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,320
and push me away?

111
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,680
Look, Kim Mi Young,

112
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,700
this disease is not a joke.

113
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,070
I don't know when I will not be able to remember you,

114
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,720
or when my body will be paralyzed and make me unable to move.

115
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,800
When there is a ticking bomb inside me, how can I ask you to stay with me..

116
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,020
so shamelessly?

117
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,080
Why can't you?

118
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,000
It doesn't matter to me.

119
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,310
Then Gun,

120
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,200
if there is a ticking bomb in my body, will you just abandon me and run away?

121
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,810
That makes no sense! How can that make sense?

122
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:01,790
If I have a pair of scissors, I would cut the red line, blue line, or all lines of the colors of the rainbow.

123
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,520
If that doesn't work out, I will see your face for the last time, hug you, and

124
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,970
after I do everything, we will explode together. How do you think that makes sense?

125
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,960
See. You will do that, too.

126
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,470
Why are you telling me that I can't do that?

127
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,270
Do you think that I can just abandon you?

128
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,480
There is no use now.

129
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,980
Even if you push me away,

130
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,340
I'm not going to move a step.

131
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,220
How can I be greedy about you?

132
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,240
When you are this nice

133
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,690
and stupid.

134
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,290
Gun,

135
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,160
sometimes it's better to be greedy.

136
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,550
In the press conference, CEO Lee Gun and Ellie Kim kissed
Is a Korean version of Notting Hill couple going to be born?

137
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,120
What is she doing?

138
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,290
What is this? Is she crazy?

139
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,860
Why? It's so romantic.

140
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,740
That level is considered erotic.

141
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,330
Hamo hamo. They are so into each other.

142
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,400
Oh my...

143
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,500
MBS news, This was Kim Soo Ryun.
- How could they.. over there..

144
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,840
Why?

145
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,850
It seems like I am dreaming right now.

146
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,660
Listen carefully.

147
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,450
A dove, dove, dove!

148
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,220
That's a dove.

149
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,360
There is one... No, two doves flying.

150
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,670
There is an another one.

151
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,430
Oh, there's another one flying high up over there!

152
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,860
Mi Young,

153
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,960
the fact that I'm eating with you on the same table,

154
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,340
seems like a dream.

155
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,730
Why are you like that to me? Are you taking your revenge on me?

156
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,890
Yes.
- What did you say?

157
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,330
For three years, you lied,

158
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,360
acted harshly, made me sad.

159
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,800
Consider this a punishment you're receiving because of those things.

160
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,010
Yes, I deserve this.

161
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,470
I deserve this!

162
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,560
Kim Mi Young,

163
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,420
can you take your revenge on me on this side, too?

164
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,150
Do it!

165
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,440
Revenge!

166
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,460
Poke.

167
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,960
Then...

168
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,690
are we sleeping together here?

169
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,050
Sleeping together?

170
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,610
Of course, we should sleep here.

171
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,790
Really?

172
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,210
If we come in, it costs the same whether we sleep here or not.

173
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,710
We have to sleep here so that money isn't wasted.

174
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,530
Yes!

175
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,030
Three years...

176
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,350
Those times that made me cool.

177
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,310
Great, great, great!

178
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,920
That's right. We should eat first.

179
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,140
We should eat.

180
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,620
Mi Young,

181
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,630
we are sleeping here

182
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,850
because you wanted to.

183
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:15,330
The distance between us isn't coming closer.

184
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,180
Since we already paid for the room...

185
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,830
Yes, we are conserving money.

186
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,290
You are so meticulous!

187
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,220
It's a yawn. I'm just yawning.

188
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,460
I'm so tired. I'm going to sleep.

189
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,790
You are tired, right?

190
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,660
Yes. I'm so tired.

191
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,320
Since so many things happened today,

192
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,450
I'm also tired.

193
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,900
I'm going to sleep.

194
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,480
Mi Young, look at me.

195
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,890
Before,

196
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:26,610
the thing we did...

197
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,870
The thing we did?

198
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,830
That thing we did.

199
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:40,760
In English, k-i- double-s.

200
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,610
K-i-s-s.

201
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,820
Yes, that.

202
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:55,420
There were too many people earlier, so I wasn't in my right mind.
So even though it still lingers in my body...

203
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,870
Yeah, we weren't in our right mind.

204
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,210
Can we try it again?

205
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,170
One more time, k-i- double-s.

206
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,730
Retry it once again.

207
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,890
Again?

208
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,650
Secretary Tak! Secretary Tak!

209
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,340
That damned Secretary Tak!

210
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,700
It might be an emergency, so answer it!

211
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,460
It's okay.

212
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,730
Then, Mi Young, up to here...

213
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,270
Stop the beat.

214
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,670
You are paused, until I come back.

215
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,870
Frozen!
- Frozen!

216
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,890
You really have to be frozen.

217
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,680
Frozen!

218
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,050
CEO, something big happened.

219
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,060
What now? What, what?!

220
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,730
All the big things that I know of already happened. What else is there?

221
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,350
You're the one in trouble!

222
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:50,540
The love story that happened at the press conference is melting the whole nation.

223
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,480
You are Gunmeo from Romeo and Juliet,

224
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,700
and Madam is Julmiyoung from Romeo and Juliet.

225
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,820
Julmiyoung? What, is she some julmiyeok(string seaweed)?

226
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,880
Just call her Miliet.

227
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,540
Yes sir. Oh, I forgot.

228
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,830
Chairwoman Wang initially collapsed,

229
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:13,420
but regained her strength because she thought that she can't be bedridden in your current situation.

230
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,750
As expected, Madam Wang.

231
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,160
And...

232
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,160
the board of directors doesn't seem to want to accept your letter of resignation just yet.

233
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,400
So everything is on hold.

234
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,120
Everything is because of your

235
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,310
ability to do work, which cannot be replaced, and people's favorable opinion of you.

236
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:42,280
This charm. I'm sick of it! It won't die out!

237
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:49,210
Then did you decide with Madam to go along the highway of love?

238
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,900
Without a speed limit, just straight on.

239
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,640
And kiss along the way

240
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,550
and the ending has to be dramatic!

241
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,500
Kiss? Hang up!

242
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,660
This rascal chatters like a sparrow.

243
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:12,650
Mi Young, I'm going! You can unfreeze now!

244
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,330
Yeah!

245
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,180
Mi Young.

246
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,610
Mi Young, Mi Young, Mi Young!

247
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,600
How can this person, in that short amount of time.

248
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,190
Don't be ice, not ice.

249
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,380
Ttang. Ttang (unfreeze)!

250
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,410
Aiyoo...

251
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,160
My snail.

252
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,010
With this small body.

253
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,070
How did you take up such courage?

254
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,240
Thank you.

255
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:12,280
Grandmother, from now on, I will stay next to Gun.

256
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,120
Mi Young!
- Even if it hurts when it hurts...

257
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,600
I'm not going to leave Gun alone.

258
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,480
No, you can't.
- Yes?

259
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,760
Knowing Gun's condition can recur again,

260
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,750
I, from now on,

261
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,000
won't be able to grab your hand again (and ask you to come back).

262
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,590
Grandmother.
- At a young age, with your grandfather,

263
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,390
I didn't know when I got married.

264
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:43,300
Later, when I found out everything, I was already in love with him.

265
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,630
But I don't regret it.

266
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,980
We loved each other, and it was enough for us.

267
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,690
But the regret could go on for a life time.

268
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,910
Without knowing anything, it was that difficult.

269
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:05,360
If you run to it while knowing everything,
how painful will it be for you?

270
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,650
Grandmother...

271
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,340
No matter how hard the road is,

272
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,300
if I am next to him,

273
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,770
I think I can overcome anything.

274
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,380
Please consent, so I can be next to him.

275
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,720
More than my consent,

276
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,310
should you not get your mother's consent first?

277
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:39,190
If that is what you will, and you have your mother's permission,

278
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,770
I will follow what you want.

279
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,210
Thank you, Grandmother.

280
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,580
Of course, we should let him go.
Didn't he personally say he would resign?

281
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,800
In fact, other than the time he temporarily lost his memory 3 years ago,

282
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,730
there have been no events pointing towards disease progression since then.

283
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:02,990
Furthermore, in the past three years,
our Jangin Chemicals has grown so much.

284
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,690
That's true. That's a fact.

285
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,730
He was actually diagnosed with the disease,

286
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,770
which can recur any time. We cannot leave

287
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,990
our Jangin Chemicals in such a person's hands.

288
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,750
Then, those who do not want CEO Lee Gun to resign,

289
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,860
raise your hands.

290
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,980
Look here! The majority does not want his resignation.

291
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,580
How can we vote by just raising our hands

292
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,900
even before we officially propose the agenda?

293
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,350
Why not? Why can't we do that?

294
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,820
Calm down, everyone.

295
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,980
Here, here, here.

296
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:57,320
Stop it already! You're having a bloody battle!

297
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,210
Have such fire and enthusiasm at a company meeting!

298
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:10,140
CEO Lee Gun, the words you said at the press conference,
don't you have to keep it?

299
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,030
I will decide my own fate.

300
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:26,680
I, Lee Gun, will resign

301
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,760
as Jang In Chemicals' CEO as of today.

302
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,020
But...

303
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,900
the time will be three months.

304
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,600
What kind of retirement is that?

305
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,500
I never said that I would retire. It's a vacation.

306
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,230
Vacation.

307
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,700
I thought about this long and hard, and realized that after I've become CEO,

308
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,870
it seems I never took a proper vacation.

309
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,770
That's absolutely absurd.

310
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,930
Then...

311
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,920
why don't we take an official vote to make it reasonable? I'm fine with either.

312
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,380
Then...

313
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,150
during the three months,
who will take responsibility of the company affairs?

314
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,620
Who will take responsibility?

315
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,300
Who?

316
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,010
A management specialist who will take on
the responsibility for 3 months,

317
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,730
whom you already know, I brought him here!

318
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,070
Chief Secretary.

319
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,380
It's the chairwoman.

320
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,900
Once I retired,

321
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,760
everyone's mouth became fast but the body became slow.

322
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,760
How our Jangin Chemicals has survived these past 50 years,

323
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,140
I will clearly show you.

324
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,220
This place has changed a lot.

325
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,930
I know.

326
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,640
It seems like just yesterday when we decorated this place.

327
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,770
But what's wrong? Bringing me all the way here.

328
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,590
If your getting in the mood that makes it seem serious.

329
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,990
Then, tell me. My heart is ready.

330
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,780
Thank You, Daniel.

331
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:46,220
If not for Daniel, I would have left without knowing his truth.

332
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,250
I know.

333
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,760
I looked so cool when I u-turned with one hand, right?

334
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,360
Thank you so much.

335
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,250
Daniel, without changing, was always next to me, like this.

336
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,860
But I...

337
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,440
won't be able to stay next to you.

338
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,390
I'm really...

339
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,810
really...

340
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,640
Sorry, right? Inside you're sorry to death, right?

341
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,490
And you regret letting such an attractive man go.

342
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,040
Yes, that's right.

343
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,810
I'm really, really, going to regret it.

344
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,760
I've been through a lot myself. So I thought of competing with him,

345
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,660
but I'm no match for him.

346
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,570
But really, I think my personality is too nice.

347
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,110
Maybe I need to change and be a bad guy.

348
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,290
But Mi Young.

349
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,560
I also need time to settle my feelings on my own.

350
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,390
I was with you for three years, I can't just say goodbye.

351
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,500
I'm really sorry, Daniel.

352
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,180
How will I be able to face you if you feel so bad like this?

353
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,360
Just for a little while.

354
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,110
Give me some time to settle things on my own.

355
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,510
Father,

356
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:50,130
I think I am pregnant.

357
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,150
Excuse me.

358
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,420
Cheer up.
- Father.

359
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,300
Don't be scared and cheer up!

360
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,650
That side is a little off.

361
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:06,280
No, no, not like that.
- Does it look okay now? It is. Good job!

362
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,220
To you,

363
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,830
I really don't have any secrets from you now.

364
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,130
That's why I feel so comfortable with you.

365
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,940
I want to gain courage to pursue you, Mi Young.

366
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,820
Mi Young, will you be my real family?

367
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,870
I wanted Mi Young to be my real family

368
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,450
so desperately,

369
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,770
but no matter how earnest you are, I guess it'll never work out if you're not meant to be.

370
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,560
Hey, what's wrong with you? Is something wrong?

371
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,970
Mom, what am I going to do?

372
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,910
I lost my wallet today,

373
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,390
and I don't know where I lost it. I searched everywhere.

374
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,970
But as it turns out, it was in my bag.

375
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,150
And so?
- Then while listening to music on my cellphone,

376
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,490
I looked for the cellphone for quite a while thinking
I lost it.

377
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,480
Well, that could happen. So?

378
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,390
I think I have the hereditary disease.

379
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:29,470
Why would that be the disease? You're just forgetful.

380
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,920
No, no, it's the disease. I'm sure it's the disease.

381
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,410
I'm also from the Lee family. It's possible.

382
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,590
Yong, about that...

383
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:45,190
I have something to tell you. Come here.

384
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,410
Madame Wang!

385
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,790
Brother-in-law!

386
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,360
Dragon, what's wrong?

387
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,070
Brother-in-law!

388
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,400
I'll go after him.

389
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,710
Why is dragon like that?

390
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,440
Let's talk.

391
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,830
What is it that you want to say?

392
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,270
I'm sorry about your illness exposed on the media.

393
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,860
I didn't mean it to go that far.

394
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:34,110
That's a first. You apologizing to me, it's a first.

395
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,800
To you, I might be a thorn in your side and

396
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,350
the woman who made your mom's life miserable,

397
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,560
but in some way, I'm more pitiful than your mom.

398
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,360
What a ridiculous thing to say.

399
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:58,670
What are you trying to say?
- It's my unfortunate past.

400
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:02,100
I was going to forget about it all and throw it away,

401
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,260
but I still have these lingering feelings.

402
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,360
Why are you giving this to me?

403
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,500
For my failure to act like an elder all this time,

404
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,000
consider it my apology.

405
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,640
Brother-in-law!

406
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,670
Brother-in-law--

407
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,040
Are you okay?

408
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,870
Please don't call me brother-in-law anymore.

409
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,250
What do you mean?

410
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,900
Sister-in-law,

411
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,620
I...

412
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,670
am not a son of this house.

413
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,560
Who told you that?

414
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:06,470
What am I going to do? I was so happy I had a grandma and a brother.

415
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:11,590
I was so happy that I could finally be a decent brother
to hyung-nim and that grandma gave me compliments.

416
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:16,350
Also, I was happy that you were like my real sister.

417
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:19,990
But Mom says I'm not in the bloodline of the Lee family.

418
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,730
- Brother-in-law.
- My mom's more pitiful.

419
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,690
Keeping it a secret her whole life.

420
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,300
How heavy and difficult must it have been for her?

421
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:40,800
To me, once a brother-in-law is a forever brother-in-law.

422
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,780
Sister-in-law.

423
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:24,320
I tried so hard, but I ended up losing my memories again.

424
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:31,700
Honey.
- My wife doesn't know that I have such a secret.

425
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,840
Honey, don't go. What would Gun and I do? Don't go.

426
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,450
Please don't go.

427
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,610
And I... couldn't possibly

428
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:48,800
tell her I became ill with the disease.
- Honey!

429
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,520
My loved ones,

430
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:58,650
I didn't want them to be in life-long pain

431
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:03,660
because of me.
- Honey...

432
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,390
There came another person whom I was sorry to.

433
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,630
The person who's looking after me.

434
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,820
That woman.

435
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,490
I couldn't give her love, but

436
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:25,580
I wanted to at least give her and her son a place of comfort.

437
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,180
This is like a dream.

438
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,480
Aigoo.

439
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,060
Even though Yong was not my son,

440
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:42,120
I want to give him love, at least a little, that he didn't receive from the father he has never met.

441
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,950
Gun,

442
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,770
my son Gun,

443
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:55,570
I miss my Gun especially today.

444
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,730
What are you doing here?

445
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,500
Mi Young,

446
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,520
thank you.

447
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,910
For not going anywhere,

448
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,300
even though how harshly I treated you.

449
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,340
For staying with me till the end,

450
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,320
thank you so much.

451
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,600
I should be thanking you.

452
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,080
For accepting my feelings.

453
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:59,260
To me,

454
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:05,580
there isn't a second that I want to be away from you.

455
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,740
Starting now, let's stay together forever.

456
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,710
I will.

457
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,130
Every minute, every second is precious.

458
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,190
Madame Wang,

459
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,120
I have something to say.

460
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,410
What is it?

461
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,850
Now I don't budge at things that easily anymore.

462
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,060
I, from today on...

463
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,370
Right away,

464
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,020
I'm going to live with Mi Young.

465
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:54,290
Right away?
- Yes, right away. You don't want to?

466
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,920
No. I can't permit it.

467
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,010
Seriously, why? Why can't you?

468
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:05,430
Did you get Mi Young's mom's approval?

469
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:10,220
No, I didn't.
- That's why I can't.

470
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,630
As a person who's also a mother, that's not right.

471
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:17,290
Then, if I get permission, it's a go?

472
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,320
Yeah.

473
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,110
She said that's okay. She said okay.

474
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:26,620
Since my grandson left the company to me to go on his vacation,

475
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,390
I have to go to work early. You two, leave.

476
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,180
Yes, Grandmother.

477
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,420
Madame Wang, seriously. I'm disappointed. You were so cool before.

478
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,340
But now you care about what others think.

479
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,920
You've become average now. Average grandma. I'm disappointed.

480
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,330
Kids nowadays don't have romance.

481
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:48,060
Back in the days, if we fell in love, we would just leave home

482
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,900
and start a family so that no one could say anything.

483
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,660
Kids these days. I don't know if it's because we raise them so well or something..

484
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,470
It's a problem. They've all become bland.

485
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,850
Mother, what are you planning to do?

486
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:09,650
Are you okay with Sister-in-law

487
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,920
getting back with Lee Gun?

488
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,720
No, I'm against it.

489
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,840
I would feel iffy about them getting back together
even if he weren't sick,

490
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,160
so why would I let our Mi Young go to a sick person?

491
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,960
Based on the articles, he is fine.

492
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,720
They can be together if they like each other.

493
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,340
Hamo hamo. It's her life, let her decide.

494
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,430
It's not like we could live their lives for them.
- No, I'm absolutely against them.

495
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,670
How could you? CEO Lee Gun even received Dae Chul.
You shouldn't be like that.

496
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,180
That's that. This is this.

497
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,330
Be quiet! Everyone shut your mouths.

498
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,400
Oh! Mi Young.

499
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,460
Mom.

500
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,530
What were you thinking that you decided to do that?

501
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:01,440
I heard he has an illness.

502
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,120
And you still want to get back with him, really?

503
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:10,210
Mom,

504
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:14,990
I know too well what you are thinking and worrying about.

505
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,290
But can't I live the way I want just for once?

506
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:26,830
As you know, Mom, I've always minded the people around me,

507
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:30,290
and couldn't refuse things because I was afraid that
people would feel sorry.

508
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,370
But...

509
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:37,240
this time, I want to live the way I want.

510
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:43,180
Not knowing that he broke up with me for my sake
due to his illness,

511
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,400
I ended up hating him.

512
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,380
Now it's not hate anymore,

513
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,650
I really want to be good to him.

514
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,500
Mi Young.
- Huh?

515
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,520
I can't accept this. I will never approve of this.

516
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,290
- Mom.
- Are you the only one who likes that rascal?

517
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:12,180
I really like that kid, Gun.

518
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:17,150
But when I know first hand what being left alone feels like,

519
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,160
I can't do that to my own child.

520
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,860
After spreading your father's ashes in the sea,

521
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,880
you know how I raised you by myself.

522
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,040
It's not like you and Gun have a light relationship. You two love each other very much.

523
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,460
You'll live as if you can't live without the other.
But if one of you disappears,

524
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,280
how devastated you'll be.

525
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:40,880
I... can never approve.

526
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,250
Mom...

527
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,370
Mmm...

528
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:51,250
Our snail must be sleeping tight by now.

529
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:54,240
Look at you sleeping.

530
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,080
Yes, come on in.

531
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,490
Dragon, what are you doing here late at night?

532
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:18,850
What is this?
- I'm quitting the company.

533
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:21,170
Why are you telling me this?

534
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,510
I'm not even the CEO anymore.

535
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:26,100
I felt you should know.

536
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:31,100
Me and my mom are planning to leave this house
as soon as we find a place.

537
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,730
All these times, for all you've done,

538
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,470
I'm really thankful.

539
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,640
Hey, Dragon.

540
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,500
You...

541
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,260
Who said you can be out of the picture?

542
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,020
Huh?

543
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,340
Do you know how big of a societal problem it is
of the number of young unemployed these days?

544
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:04,340
If a company that's diligently paying you, you should be diligently working for that company. How dare you try to weasel out?!

545
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,140
You!

546
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,640
Who said you could leave this house?

547
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,770
I!... am leaving this house.

548
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,230
That's why you!

549
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,740
with your mother,

550
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,270
in this house,

551
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,530
with Madame Wang, instead of me,

552
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,800
you should stay well.

553
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,710
CEO.

554
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,750
I told you to call me hyung, you rude punk!

555
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,900
Hyung-nim...
- Freeze!

556
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,920
♬ Find those dragon balls, ♬

557
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,820
♬ the world's most mysterious secret. ♬

558
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,020
Oh.

559
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,070
Hi, Se Ra.

560
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,860
We see each other often lately, right?

561
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,760
Well, since you live next door,

562
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,040
I see you often.

563
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,570
Why did you drink so much?

564
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:25,860
Are you currently healing your broken heart?

565
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:31,340
Kang Se Ra, you must consider me pathetic.

566
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:35,690
I had a company dinner with my staff.

567
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,420
Not a broken heart, but a company dinner.

568
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,920
Don't emphasize it. It makes you look even more pitiful.

569
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,880
Aren't you on the same boat?

570
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:43,980
What did you say?

571
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,640
Let's not be harsh on each other.

572
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,150
It wouldn't even be enough to comfort each other.

573
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,620
Well, I guess.

574
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,210
Why isn't it coming?

575
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:07,040
Oh, you're going to fall.

576
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,210
Ah, ah! Really!

577
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,950
A little more. Just a little more.

578
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:21,140
No! No!

579
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,800
Just a little more.

580
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,280
Seriously.

581
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,540
Here. Here.

582
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,630
Why is he so tall like a pole?

583
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,280
Ah, so exhausted.

584
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:47,820
Look here, Daniel.

585
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:50,300
Just brush it off quickly and get back on your feet.

586
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:55,380
We are both hurt people. That's why I'm saying this to you.

587
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,830
So foolish.

588
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,560
You should throw it away.

589
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:21,820
- CEO Lee Gun.
- Yes.

590
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:28,490
For a person who said he'd take 3 months off to do some reading and renew his mind,

591
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:32,160
do you realize you've been looking at my face for an hour?

592
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,720
What kind of nonsense is that? I've been looking at this book.

593
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,650
I've been staring at this book the whole time.

594
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,540
It was for a second. Just a glance.

595
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,030
Lies.

596
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:51,840
It's upside-down. You should read it the right way.

597
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:57,040
How did this happen?

598
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,150
when did it become upside-down.

599
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:01,950
That's weird.

600
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,560
But...

601
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,810
How are we going to convince my mom?

602
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:13,760
It's weighing on my mind.

603
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,170
That ssam-bap lady...

604
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:24,340
is full of charm.

605
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:26,560
There is another side to her.

606
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:30,760
I will do whatever it takes to get her permission,

607
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,850
so just believe in me.

608
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:36,870
This is a precious time that's been so difficult to acquire.

609
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:41,180
We can't spend this time being full of worry.

610
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,770
I will try to convince my mom, too.

611
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,600
Okay.

612
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,070
What are you painting?

613
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,820
You can't see it yet.
- Why not?

614
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,240
- Why can't I see it yet?
- Not yet.

615
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:01,810
Oh, this...

616
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:04,420
I haven't finished it yet.

617
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:13,950
♬ Kiss...♬

618
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,000
♬ Kiss...♬

619
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,940
♫ Kiss me darling, kiss me, kiss me tonight ♫

620
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,480
What are you doing?

621
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,120
What? What?
- I've caught you, I've caught you. Red handed.

622
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,020
Come here, come over here.
- I've caught you. Hahah.

623
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,860
Come here. Hurry up!

624
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,990
Your timing is unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

625
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:39,360
Wow. This is great! Great, I love it.

626
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,460
It's refreshing to see you here instead of work.

627
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,660
Ex-Madam... No, Comeback Gun.

628
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,290
Our madam who did that,
have you been well?

629
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:55,570
Since I couldn't see Chief Secretary Tak's face for a few days,
I've missed you.

630
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,370
"You've missed him, you've missed him."
You shouldn't say these kind of words rashly!

631
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,830
What do you mean she can't?!

632
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:07,610
Stop saying nonsense, and show us what you've brought.

633
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:12,960
What's all this?

634
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,120
These are places you two can have a nice time at, which I have

635
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,620
"select", have selected.

636
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:22,130
Since Chairwoman Wang won't let us go into her place, I thought we'll have to live somewhere else.

637
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:25,550
A place so expensive feels burdensome.

638
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:31,260
I'm on vacation right now, but it's not like I run a mid-sized company.

639
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,230
I'm CEO Lee Gun of the great Jangin Chemicals.

640
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:38,640
I've worked hard until now, and saved up a large amount of money.

641
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,250
So, these costs are just the cost of gum to me.

642
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:51,690
CEO Lee Gun of the great Jangin Chemicals,

643
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:55,810
I know a place where we can live closely to each other.

644
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,070
A place where we'll be close to each other?

645
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:00,740
Tightly?
- Tightly.

646
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:08,710
Ji Yeon, we're here!

647
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:12,340
Unnie! Unnie!

648
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,650
Welcome!

649
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:16,560
I'm honored to meet you, my VVIP client

650
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,000
and returning brother-in-law.

651
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,430
She's Jun Ji Yeon, right? Not, Ji Hyun but Ji Yeon.

652
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,530
Ji Yeon is going to lend us her house.

653
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:28,840
You are lending it to us?

654
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:34,340
As a couple manager, I'm happy to have brought you two together.

655
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,220
When did you bring us together? We were brought together ourselves.

656
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,150
Please don't get on her nerves.

657
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,720
Okay, of course.

658
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,100
Come inside.

659
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,210
As a couple manager with a strong sense of responsibility,

660
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:53,250
I am trying to complete my duties by giving you this house as the last step in creating this couple.

661
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:57,940
I know you'll be very grateful, so I will post

662
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:01,430
your ardent love story on my couple manager blog.

663
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:06,010
That, well.. You will have to talk to my legal team...

664
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,250
I understand it all, so make yourselves at home.

665
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:14,200
Ah, really?

666
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:19,120
But Ji Yeon, where are you going? Are you moving back home?

667
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,870
Unnie!

668
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:26,680
Don't you know who my dad is? If I go home now, I'll be on house arrest immediately.

669
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,890
Then where are you going?

670
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,950
Hello...

671
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,100
Are you saying that you are going to live
in this house from now on?

672
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,540
Yes, Chairwoman, could I do that?

673
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,360
No! With whose permission?

674
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:47,210
Is this your house? This is my house, I make the decision!

675
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:49,970
This is the house exchange contract

676
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:52,910
that I've signed with CEO Lee Gun.

677
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:55,370
Noona, are you serious?

678
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,540
Yong, what are they changing?

679
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,570
She exchanged houses with Hyung
and they are going to live in each other's houses.

680
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:05,730
No way. It's not like they're exchanging clothes.

681
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:08,890
Even though it's simple, a contract is a contract.

682
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:12,930
So you are saying that you are going to accept her living here?

683
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:15,510
Yes, it's written here in the contract.

684
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:19,830
It felt empty without Gun and Mi Young anyway.

685
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:23,100
It worked out well. Go and unpack your things.

686
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,220
Thank you so so much, Chairwoman.

687
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,240
You. Until when are you going to live here?

688
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,340
Until you like me.

689
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:35,750
Look at her. She's not your average girl.

690
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:42,000
Look how nice it is with a new blanket.
- The new blanket is nice.
- The blanket is here~

691
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,800
♬ You’re my girl oh my sunshine
Brighter than sunshine ♬

692
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:55,930
Tada! We're done.
♬ I wanna feel you I wanna be loved. Like a dreamy paradise ♬

693
00:54:55,930 --> 00:55:02,870
Should we lay down to try it?
♬ A love story like the movies
since we met like destiny ♬

694
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:11,980
♬ I’m nervous, my heart races
Like I’ve been enchanted, I’m falling in love ♬

695
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:18,870
♬ I look for you like a habit
I think of like a routine ♬

696
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,500
Mi Young.
♬ My clueless ♬

697
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:26,360
You didn't need to push me away. Why are you being like this?
♬ heart didn’t realize it’s love ♬

698
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,800
The blankets are so nice.
♬ I’ll make you smile♬

699
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,180
There's no place for you to hide in this small place.
♬ forever ♬

700
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:41,990
Hurry, hurry! I'm almost catching up to you! Here I come!
♬ I’ll wipe away the tears. I promise you. ♬

701
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:48,790
♬ You’re my girl oh my sunshine
Brighter than sunshine ♬

702
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:55,880
Aigoo... Aigoo... Aigoo...
♬ I wanna feel you I wanna be loved
Like a dreamy paradise ♬

703
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:02,860
♬ A love story like the movies
since we met like destiny ♬

704
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:12,480
♬ I’m nervous, my heart races
Like I’ve been enchanted, I’m falling in love. You’re my love♬

705
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,730
Hello. I'm a mandarin duck.

706
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,800
Hello...

707
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,130
Didn't you say that they don't go with the house?

708
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:28,900
Aigoo, about that time, I'm sorry.

709
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:36,980
But this picture sure is pretty.

710
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,670
Where should I put them?

711
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:43,040
Put them wherever is pretty.

712
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,930
No. Where should I put them?

713
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,350
On the bed.

714
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:25,740
It's the chip that made you Lady Luck.

715
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,670
We can't always win the game of life,

716
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,910
but as long as you have that "chip,"

717
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:37,060
you will always have hope and the chance, so keep it well.

718
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:48,650
Mi Young! Mi Young! Out the window,

719
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:53,420
there's a swallow's nest. How can that happen?

720
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,480
Wait, Mi Young.

721
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:04,070
What's wrong? Did something happen?

722
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:04,920
No.

723
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,550
If nothing happened, then why are you crying?

724
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:11,740
Tell me, what is it?

725
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,650
It's because I like it.
- You are crying because you like it?

726
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:17,400
What is it? Hurry up and tell me.

727
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,200
By any chance, do you remember this?

728
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,710
Ah, this. Isn't this the lucky chip that I gave to you in Macao?

729
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,850
You had this all along?

730
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:32,740
I can't believe that you are by my side now.

731
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:43,420
Because I can't believe it either,

732
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:50,910
I keep looking at you to make sure you're still there.
♬ I like the dazzling sunlight, ♬

733
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:57,500
But now you can't. You can't disappear during this precious time.
♬  your smile spreads ♬

734
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:02,620
You need to stay put right beside me.
♬ My heart is rushing, ♬

735
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:07,980
Just like super glue.
♬ I laugh like a fool ♬

736
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:12,820
Just like you said, I'll really be super glue.

737
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:20,190
♬ I keep thinking of you, ♬

738
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:27,230
♬ seems like coincidence ♬

739
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:34,690
♬ In case you see my heart, I secretly look at you from far away ♫
- Stay by my side for sure, forever.

740
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:42,290
Just like super glue, okay?

741
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:49,370
♬ I draw you out then I erase you again ♬

742
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:59,930
♬ I stand in place and talk to myself again ♬

743
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:08,200
♬ When I hold out my hand and hug you tight ♬
