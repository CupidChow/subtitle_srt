1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,730
Come in.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,920
Come in.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,800
Watch your step.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,300
Come take a look around.
 Episode 5

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,620
It's really big.
Right?

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,730
Come along.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,360
Are you on your way out?

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,050
What are you doing?

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,930
Hello, I'm...

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,610
This is...
- The new housemaid?

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,310
Huh? No, she's actually

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,020
the Madam (CEO's wife).

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,330
That's right, I'm now a Madam (the late CEO's wife).

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,520
Come in.
- Yes.

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,770
Come in.

16
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,930
Look around.
-Aigoo, my baby~

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,260
Yes, Mother-in-law.

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,680
My granddaughter-in-law is here.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,460
I missed my granddaughter-in-law and great-grandson so much

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,400
that I thought my eyes were going to fall out (from waiting for them).

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,300
I really missed you too, Grandmother.

22
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,800
You did?

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,700
Pay your respects, it's Gun's father,

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,480
your father-in-law.

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Hello, Father-in-law.

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,330
No, not him.

27
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,480
Hello.

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,540
No, that's my father-in-law.

29
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,400
Hello.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,400
How is she? Our granddaughter-in-law.

31
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,590
In any case,

32
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,740
due to all of your efforts,

33
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,430
a blessing has come into our family.

34
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,990
You don't have to say it like that.

35
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,790
Gun and I met by accident.

36
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,750
No, don't say that.

37
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,690
No matter how you met, your meeting was by fate

38
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,340
and it is a blessing to both Gun and our family.

39
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,140
It's important to carry on our family name,

40
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,740
but we would not have accepted you if you weren't a kind and caring girl.

41
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,500
Thank you, Grandmother.

42
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,160
I will try to become a respectable wife (to Gun).

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,240
That's right!

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,510
See, you need at least this much to become our granddaughter-in-law.

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,610
CEO, I've taken your wife...

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,030
What the?

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,050
CEO?

48
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,380
Where are you, CEO?

49
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,740
CEO..

50
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,240
Who are you? What do you want?

51
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,680
Who are you?
- Chief Secretary Tak...

52
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,740
CEO!

53
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,030
Did something happen last night? You have dark circles, and why did you tie your arms like that?

54
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,400
I tied myself so that I won't cause any trouble.

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,340
What is it?

56
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,000
I wanted to tell you that I've safely taken your wife to your house.

57
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,490
She eventually came, that snail.

58
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,370
You know.. What is it? Remember how

59
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,160
that industry competed with us for the bidding on Yeoul Island Soap Factory?

60
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,050
You remember, right? Doodoo Industries.
- Yes.

61
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,710
Go ask them if they're still interested in the soap factory.

62
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,830
You're not trying to sell the soap factory to them, are you?

63
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,000
Why not? Can't I sell it to them?

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,150
Of course not! Your wife now lives with you. How disappointed would she be if you did that!

65
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,550
Look, take a look around.

66
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:20,070
This is the living room,

67
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,720
this is the dressing room,

68
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,320
and this is the bedroom.

69
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:59,410
Put it where you can see it well, and stick together like these ducks.

70
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,640
Live happy and well, okay?

71
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,000
Mom...
- If your husband or anyone else bothers you, don't hold it in

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,890
and call your mom right away. Okay?

73
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,130
Even if there aren't any boats leaving this island, I will fly over there

74
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,250
and beat them to death.

75
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,840
Mom,

76
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,900
that person is a warmhearted person even though he doesn't seem that way.

77
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,470
He helped and encouraged me a lot when I was going through hard times.

78
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,730
Really?

79
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,120
Okay.

80
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,110
They're so pretty.

81
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,200
What are you doing?

82
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,290
Come in.

83
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,500
Come in, son.

84
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,310
Introduce yourself. This is my proud son.

85
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,130
Nice to meet you.

86
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,060
Can I call you sister-in-law?

87
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,640
Of course.

88
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:21,570
Gun doesn't consider me his brother since I'm his step-brother.

89
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,270
That's why it's hard to be a mistress.

90
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,960
You were shocked to hear the word "mistress," right?

91
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,810
But can I call you daughter-in-law?

92
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,790
Whatever's convenient for you, Mother-in-law.

93
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,640
What do you mean "Mother-in-law?"

94
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,400
How dare you call her "Mother-in-law"?

95
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,600
When did you get here?

96
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,950
You're home late, older brother.

97
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,500
Are you two going to continue to stay here?

98
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,420
She looked lonely by herself, so we came to keep her company.

99
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,670
Then, spend a lovely time together.

100
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,290
I'll see you later, Sister-in-law.

101
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,590
You must be hungry.
(literally: You need to eat dinner.)

102
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,530
I already ate. Don't worry about me.

103
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,530
I'm sure you know it already, but let me repeat myself.

104
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,500
We didn't marry to become a married couple, but for the baby.

105
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,200
So, we don't need to take care of each other like normal married couples.

106
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,510
Of course, we also won't be sleeping on the same bed.

107
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,690
My grandmother must not know of this

108
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,910
because she won't be happy if she heard it.

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,410
Of course, we should try not to worry her.

110
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,340
We both agreed to this before we got married.

111
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,520
And that person is not my mother.

112
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,790
My only mother is my mom alone.

113
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,510
Just like how the only person I love

114
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,050
is Se Ra alone.

115
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,360
You saw that earlier, right?

116
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,200
Even though they should be sweet like this ice cream, it felt like winter in there.

117
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,550
You felt that, too? That weird spark between the two..

118
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,040
It seems too weird to say that they spent that one, hot night together because they fell in love.

119
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,730
Something's fishy.

120
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,180
But they conceived a baby together.

121
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,750
Then this.. maybe it's all a lie?!

122
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,950
Surprise!

123
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,090
Welcome, our cute granddaughter-in-law.

124
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:09,190
I bought some clothes for the newborn to wear.

125
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,810
I hope you like them.

126
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,080
And these are your pajamas. Wear them and sleep well.

127
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,400
Damn it! Damn it!

128
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,950
Grandmother did something unnecessary.

129
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,520
Oh my.

130
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,790
Excuse me, what are you doing?

131
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,440
What are you...

132
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,610
What are you thinking?! Turn around!

133
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,140
Then, do I just need to sleep on this sofa here?

134
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,320
No.

135
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,530
If not here, then on the floor?

136
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,400
You can sleep on the bed.

137
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:05,320
No, it's okay. That has always been your own space.
Besides, I think I'll be more comfortable here.

138
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,400
Well, if that's what you want...

139
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,180
Why does it have to be now?

140
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,940
Snail! Uhhh... Snail!

141
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,390
Snail...

142
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,480
What is this?

143
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,680
Is it here?

144
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,910
Ever since that snail came into our house, it's become grim.

145
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,510
Snail...

146
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,750
Snail...

147
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,290
Snail, really...

148
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,720
Hello.

149
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,920
What are you doing there?!

150
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,440
Come out, come out! Hurry! Hurry and come out.

151
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,180
Of course, I may look foolish being like this,

152
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,750
but there is a physiological explanation.

153
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,890
Since I'm pregnant, being hungry makes me feel nauseous and I'm unable to sleep.

154
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:10,250
By any chance, if you're hungry, do you want to eat together?

155
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:15,390
Forget it. Eat lots of it by yourself. Lots of it.

156
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,340
Eat a lot. Eat a lot.

157
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,200
Excuse me.

158
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,520
What?

159
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,440
Because it's my first day,

160
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,790
I wasn't sure and so I made a mistake. I know that.

161
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,840
In the future, if there's something that I have to be careful about please tell me.

162
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,820
In any case, since we have to live together, we should be considerate of each other.

163
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,230
I don't have any thought of constricting you,

164
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,250
so please stop being concerned about me, too. Okay?

165
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,420
Also, I don't care about what you do in here,

166
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,400
as long as you don't irritate me, and act as if you're not here.

167
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,400
You can just live like that. Do you get it?

168
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:11,300
I understand. As if I'm not here.

169
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,700
It would be better if you just got angry, too.

170
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,550
You only made me, who's angry, uncomfortable.

171
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:42,120
What I'm saying is, no matter how I Iook at it, it seems like it's a fake wedding.

172
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,570
A fake wedding?
-Think carefully.

173
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,230
He was boasting that he would get married within the year,

174
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,200
but Se Ra ran away to the US to do ballet.

175
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,210
Since he could lose his CEO position to me,

176
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,680
he went to an extreme and made such a decision.

177
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,780
Then, the baby is also fake?

178
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,520
Since there are so many fakes in the world,

179
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,450
I think the baby may be as well.

180
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,720
The weather is hot so please buy a drink with this.

181
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,310
Why do you keep on giving me this?

182
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,150
You should take care of your body and live long.

183
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,990
So you can see our Yong become the successor.

184
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:30,010
That way, although not much, I can give you a share of the company.

185
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,520
Okay, okay. We're all in the same boat anyway.

186
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,250
Let's see this to the end.

187
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,250
Then, secure some evidence regarding the relationship between those two.

188
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:47,560
Then I will support you well from behind the curtains.

189
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,820
What happened to the documents I requested?

190
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,440
It's all done.

191
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,720
I'm just saying this because you might still change your mind,

192
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,550
but can you think this over one more time?

193
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,150
No. Please continue doing it like before.

194
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,840
Also, send the documents to that person.

195
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,480
Is there any problem?

196
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,520
No, there isn't. Also, have you confirmed if that company is still interested in the Yeoul Island factory?

197
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,220
Yes. It seems that because their bidding price was lower than ours,

198
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,080
so they failed in taking over the Yeoul soap factory.

199
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,040
Then arrange a meeting with them so that we can negotiate.

200
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,810
You wench!

201
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,360
You scared me.

202
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,580
You mean unnie. How dare you act like a top star?

203
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,440
When was it when you kept on rejecting, saying you don't even know a man?

204
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,490
And you married like that?

205
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,200
I'm sorry. It happened all of a sudden and it became like that.

206
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,830
I was thinking of not letting you get away with this because I felt so betrayed,

207
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,230
but seeing you like this, it seems like I can forgive you already.

208
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,280
I can see how much Brother-in-law kept you awake.

209
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,960
Your face expresses both happiness and exhaustion.

210
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,550
Do I look like that?

211
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,570
This is the document that the CEO has requested.

212
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,390
And I've asked of you to do a lot of personal requests in the past,

213
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,590
don't take it to heart.

214
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,910
Lawyer Yong, can't you just treat me comfortably like before?

215
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,020
I don't know what to do with myself.

216
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,660
It won't do if you don't know.

217
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,930
That's right. I wouldn't know about other people,

218
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,650
but I knew you wouldn't change.

219
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:48,380
I came to say hello anyway.

220
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,120
Because of you, I was able to go to Macau.

221
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,020
That's why you were able to marry the President, too.

222
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,350
I don't know if I did something to be thanked for.

223
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:08,070
If by chance, Mi Young, if it gets to hard or something comes up, come by anytime.

224
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,520
I will help you with anything.

225
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,330
Yes, I will do that.

226
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,510
Thank you for everything.

227
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,540
Thank you.

228
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:40,540
Because of you, I was able to go to work, now I think its finally over.

229
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,960
How will I go to work when you aren't going to be there anymore?

230
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,130
That's not something to see.

231
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,240
But a day like this, shouldn't the husband pick you up?

232
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,770
Are you sure, Brother-in-law treats you well?

233
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,050
Yeah, of course, he treats me well.

234
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,220
Treats you well at night, too?

235
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,250
True, seeing how he doesn't let you sleep...

236
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
It came.

237
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,460
I'm going to go. Go inside, I'm going to go.
-Yeah

238
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,050
Thanks!

239
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,330
I will go visit.

240
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,080
Oh, yeah, hello.

241
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,620
Are you alright? Soon Dol, you want a scolding?

242
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,770
Are you not hurt?
- Yes, I'm ok.

243
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,200
Father?

244
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,820
How did we meet like this again? Why are you here?

245
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,500
Oh, I live over here. I got married.

246
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,800
Marriage?

247
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,180
Really?

248
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,840
That's great. That means the baby is fine, too.

249
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,890
Yes, it's all because of you.

250
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,230
Yes, I think our prayer worked out well.

251
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:38,100
That's right, Soon Dol, you have to say sorry for startling her.

252
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,990
No, he was probably more surprised by me getting so surprised.

253
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,310
He doesn't bite, right?
-Yes, it's alright.

254
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,530
You're so gentle.

255
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,800
You must be Soon Dol because you're so gentle.

256
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,880
Let's open this a little.

257
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,160
Divorce Request

258
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,280
You came together, Soon Dol.

259
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,750
But what is this?

260
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,100
That's my husband's, he asked me to bring it.

261
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,510
Did you by any chance look inside?

262
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,920
No, it's not even mine.

263
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,370
Does your husband even treat you right?

264
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,670
Yes, of course.

265
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,050
Then, that's fine.

266
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,680
If by chance, he doesn't treat you right, you shouldn't just take it.

267
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,210
If you need to say something, say it, without shame.

268
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,800
Yes.

269
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:51,360
Father, every time I see you, you always say words of strength.

270
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,530
Well, it's because I'm a father.

271
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,740
Thank you, Father. I'll take my leave.

272
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,830
Do you want me to carry it for you?

273
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,860
Farewell.

274
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,570
Excuse me.

275
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,730
Usually, I don't give out my number because it's troublesome,

276
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,240
but this time will be an exception.

277
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,450
If something happens, call me at this number.

278
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,990
Here.

279
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,050
Always, used to get post-its for requests...

280
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,030
When the cafe opens, I will be there so you must visit often.

281
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,360
You are welcome anytime.

282
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,210
Yes, I will definitely come by, Father Daniel.

283
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:59,210
But how come Father isn't at the church but at a café?

284
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,610
It's not that I'm running it, I'm just here to help out.

285
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,510
As you can see, I'm a special Father.

286
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,860
Special Father...

287
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,130
It's the perfect saying.

288
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,360
But I don't even know your name.

289
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,870
I'm Kim Mi Young.

290
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,930
Kim Mi Young, really?

291
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,770
Yes, it's a common name, right?

292
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:33,020
I will come by.

293
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,850
It's an amazing fate.

294
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:59,410
My, you really won't listen to me when I offered to carry this for you.

295
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,690
Aigoo, really.

296
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,900
I'm not that far along (in pregnancy), yet.

297
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,870
And although I may not look it, I'm really strong, too.

298
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,390
Aigoo, really.... aigoo...

299
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,840
You have suffered working at the company.

300
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,540
From now on, you're a madame and

301
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,690
do whatever you like and live as you like.

302
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,630
Thank you.

303
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,690
OK.

304
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,960
Here, Kang Se Ra,

305
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,930
let's check to see if she is pretty.

306
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,520
Aigoo, pretty.

307
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,590
Don't look at me.
- You look like a goddess.

308
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:52,580
Don't go. Don't go.

309
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,440
I told you to stop.

310
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:00,950
Your body is... amazing!!!

311
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,960
I wonder whose girlfriend she is?

312
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,360
I'm so jealous.

313
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,900
My boyfriend needs to know this truth, too, right?

314
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,810
Should I do an interview with your boyfriend as well?

315
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,990
Of course, she's the most beautiful in this world. She's a bit overly, though, right?

316
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,930
Now, I will go back to my girlfriend.

317
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,820
Now, show me something cute.

318
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,200
I'm cute as I am, how can I show you something cute? You'll pass out from cuteness overload.

319
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,590
No, no I can't.
- Hurry and show me~

320
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,030
You might regret this. I'll do this since you want me to, Se Ra.

321
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,550
Batman~~ The world's savior~

322
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,840
Here I come!

323
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,890
What is that?

324
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,870
What do you think you're doing?

325
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,290
Not here.

326
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,080
Why did you come into someone else's room and touch my stuff?

327
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,370
I didn't watch it on purpose.

328
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:11,100
This is not a place where a person like you can come and go.

329
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,110
Listen to my words carefully.

330
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:19,520
To keep the relationship like this, you need to keep these three rules in mind.

331
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,170
First:

332
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,910
Never come into this room.

333
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,280
And second:

334
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:31,060
We're only married by paper, so we don't have any responsibilities towards each other.

335
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,130
And the third?

336
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,010
Lastly, the third:

337
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,000
Did you see this?

338
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,280
No.

339
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,820
If you didn't look at it, look at it and sign it.

340
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,720
Go on and look.

341
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,640
Divorce Settlement Agreement

342
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,570
You'll know once you read it,

343
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,680
but it is a divorce settlement agreement.

344
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,420
We married for the baby.

345
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:30,140
So once the baby is born, there will be no reason for this marriage.

346
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,860
It states that after the baby is born, divorce will follow naturally.

347
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,080
After about ten months,

348
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,200
the reparation will be one million dollars.

349
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,970
What do you think?

350
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,670
Do you agree?

351
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,620
I asked you if you agree.

352
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,270
I...

353
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,260
I...

354
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,930
The reason why I married

355
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:10,310
was to protect the baby

356
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,680
and the island.

357
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:20,510
This was the first time that many people needed me,

358
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,850
and it was the first time that people congratulated me.

359
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,080
And I was grateful for you.

360
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:39,900
Whenever I was going through hard and difficult times, you always appeared and helped me.

361
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:44,340
I was thankful because I thought that you were sincere.

362
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:50,300
I felt relieved that you were the baby's father.

363
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,700
I sincerely wanted to follow you,

364
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,430
and married you.

365
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,220
I also have a precondition.

366
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,300
I don't want the money.

367
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,730
What I wanted from you wasn't money.

368
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,860
Then what do you want?

369
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,210
I will do everything else according to this agreement.

370
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,070
But...

371
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,920
I will raise the baby.

372
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,540
What did you say?

373
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,510
What did you just say?

374
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,680
Why did I agree to this marriage?

375
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,470
Do you know how hard it was for me to marry you?!

376
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,680
Yes, Mom.

377
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,590
Did something happen? Why does your voice seem like it's dying?

378
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,030
No.

379
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,250
Nothing happened.
-Are you already living uncomfortably?

380
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,870
Let me talk to Son-in-law Lee.

381
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,260
How dare they make our precious daughter feel uncomfortable.

382
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,250
That's not it, Mom.

383
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:48,080
I'm being treated like a princess.

384
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,320
Grandma is very nice to me.

385
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:58,910
Mi Young, it's me, your sister.

386
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,200
When you were getting married, Son-in-law Lee

387
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,570
promised to take President Park and my honey to the Seoul factory.

388
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,760
Hamu hamu!
- Hamu hamu!

389
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,760
But we didn't hear from him after that.

390
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,170
Do you know anything about it?

391
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,910
Probably,

392
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:21,630
it's taking some time because he is being careful.

393
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:25,670
Sister-in-law! When are you going to call us over? We are waiting over here!

394
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,160
I think that my neck has gotten one centimeter longer.

395
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,750
My neck became longer, right?

396
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,050
Is Secretary Tak doing well?

397
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,590
Give this to me.

398
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:40,430
Son-in-law Lee will take care of the issues with the factory. Why are you asking her?

399
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:43,950
Mi Young, don't worry about anything else.

400
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,820
Just worry about the baby inside of you.

401
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,350
The baby will be happy only if the mother is feeling comfortable.

402
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,270
Do you get that?

403
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,890
I got it, Mom.

404
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,170
I am happy. Really.

405
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,740
Gun takes good care of me.

406
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,410
You wretch, you are too nice!

407
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,970
You aren't just holding back on everything, right?

408
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,620
You have no background or money,

409
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,120
but you have your mother!

410
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,570
I know.

411
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,230
I feel safe because of you.

412
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:30,150
I will call you again. Good night.

413
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,080
Kim Mi Young,

414
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,010
you are a mother.

415
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,130
Be strong!

416
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,000
Strong...

417
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,130
Listen carefully.

418
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:09,140
The company isn't like it was before.

419
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,720
Yong and his mother are trying to target you.

420
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,470
They are just looking for an opportunity.

421
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:18,060
At least because we have a grandson to continue our legacy,

422
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,660
I am able to talk big in order to turn the tides in our favor.

423
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,720
Are you planning to mess everything up?

424
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,090
What did I do?

425
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,730
Ow!

426
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,300
You didn't take any actions to Se Ra.

427
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:39,410
And you are treating the woman who married you coldly and making her sleep on the sofa.

428
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,260
What do you want me to do?

429
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,760
My heart doesn't reach out for her. What do you want me to do?

430
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,870
It would have become another story if you didn't marry.

431
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,930
Not being faithful after marriage

432
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:57,860
was enough in this Lee family with just your father.

433
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,650
Grandmother,

434
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,690
don't compare me to my dad.

435
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,830
I don't know what I should do.

436
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,290
What am I supposed to do in this kind of situation?

437
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,840
You are smarter than me.

438
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,720
At least you know where you are supposed to go.

439
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:23,980
Please check this. I prepared a perfect and magnificent contract.

440
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,600
Factory Disposal Contract

441
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,290
Isn't this incorrect?

442
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:37,380
It seems that you have set the price a little high.

443
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,360
That isn't much.

444
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:46,150
They said that they would just give it to us without any objections. We should be grateful.

445
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:52,160
I am famous for my loyalty.

446
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,930
Yes.

447
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,040
Well, let's continue on with the contract.

448
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,360
Really, you are so manly and great, you are just my style.

449
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:11,650
I'm curious. What are you planning to build?

450
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,650
I am going to destroy the factory and make a building.

451
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:21,040
After I destroy that, everything will be solved.

452
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:34,190
Yes.

453
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,960
What does that man plan to build on Yeoul Island?

454
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,230
CEO, CEO!

455
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,640
Something bad happened.

456
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,780
What, what, what happened?

457
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,320
Q..queen... (he's saying wang, which means King, but since it's the grandmother, replacing it with Queen)

458
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,850
Q..qu..queen!

459
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,560
Queen?

460
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,760
Grandmother! Grandmother!

461
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,060
Grandmother, are you ok?

462
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,520
Grandmother, what's wrong?

463
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,210
I woke up because it hurts.

464
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:21,680
She was sitting in the living room, and suddenly she was nauseated.

465
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,930
How is she, Dr. Octopus?
 *The Lee Family's Doctor, Moon Min Suk (Nickname: Dr. Octopus)

466
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,260
Is it serious? You must perform the surgery on her, Dr. Octopus.

467
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,230
I will go and get all the procedures done.

468
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,250
The important thing is her psychological stability.

469
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,480
Above all, since stress is the main culprit behind it...

470
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,640
It's best for you to ease her mind.

471
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,310
Gun..
- Yes, Grandmother.

472
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,310
With Granddaughter-in-law...

473
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,810
With Granddaughter-in-law...

474
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,440
Go to this place.

475
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,500
What is this?

476
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,170
You two need to hurry

477
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,850
and attend this prenatal education class.

478
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,960
Today is the first day.

479
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,330
Why a prenatal education class?

480
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,570
Her stomach is not even out.

481
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:13,550
What's so important whether or not her stomach is out?

482
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:19,680
My precious great-grandson is in her stomach right now.

483
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,040
You've become a dad, and you can't even do that?

484
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,800
In a little bit...

485
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,740
I have to attend an executive board meeting.

486
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,060
That is at five o'clock!

487
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,870
Aigoo, my head hurts all of a sudden.

488
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,550
You're going to go, right?

489
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:39,750
Alright, alright! Stop it.

490
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,770
You are all doing well. Do it more actively.

491
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,840
Going down. Yes. Yes.

492
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,620
Don't be tense. Yes, that is good.

493
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:57,520
The position is very good! Good! It is good!

494
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,200
You are doing the best! I like this the best!

495
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,980
Yes, good...

496
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,820
Over there! The ones sitting furthest back!

497
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:18,760
Yes, you two. Would you mind coming out to the front for a moment?

498
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,670
Yes.

499
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,030
The others, keep doing what you are doing.

500
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,720
Taking breaths in. The breathing is very important!

501
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,140
Good. Good. It is good.

502
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:40,570
Here, these two are going to be an example. Applause!

503
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:46,470
Yes, good.

504
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,540
What is your name?

505
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,400
It's Kim Mi Young.

506
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,320
It's Gun.

507
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,620
Lee Gun.

508
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,170
Yes.

509
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,700
Have you named the baby yet?

510
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:00,980
Not yet.

511
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,190
Do we have to make a name for that?

512
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,980
Those of you here who have named their fetus, please raise your hand.

513
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,990
There. There. And there.

514
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,410
You see, everyone already has names.

515
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:16,400
If you haven't made a name for your fetus yet, that will be your homework.

516
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,160
Yes.

517
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,190
They make you do all sorts of things. All sorts!

518
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,560
Yes.

519
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,860
Yes, we will name it.

520
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,950
Starting now, we'll work on the areas where pregnant mother's swell the most.

521
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:35,980
Massage the calves and feet, which tend to swell easily in pregnant women.

522
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:40,990
Sit down prettily. Careful, careful, careful. Stretch the feet in front of you.

523
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:45,200
Now, put your (husband's) fingers between your wife's toes.

524
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,360
Rotate the toes left and right. Yes, smoothly.

525
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,070
Please turn it gently. Yes, you are doing well.

526
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:00,770
No, what are you doing, not sitting?

527
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,300
Her feet are not swollen. It doesn't look like it hurts.

528
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,140
Does it hurt? She says it doesn't hurt.

529
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:11,120
Other people are all looking over.

530
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,560
Okay, okay.

531
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,300
Sit.

532
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,380
Do you like it?

533
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,570
But do we really have to do this?

534
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,410
As time passes, the swelling will eventually go down on its own.

535
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:32,280
Gun, what is the harm in doing this?

536
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,730
The baby inside is listening.

537
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:38,110
I understand. I understand.

538
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:44,440
Now, shall we do a back massage this time?

539
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,070
Back massage, please turn around.

540
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:52,420
The husbands need to massage

541
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,730
the wife's spine by going downwards.

542
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:00,500
Gently go down.

543
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,020
Gently, gently, massage it.

544
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:11,180
Good, good.

545
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,460
Finally, it is the highlight. It's the chest massage.

546
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,250
All of the husbands put your hands up like this.

547
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:23,120
Place your hands in between your loving wives' armpits.

548
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,100
Place it in.

549
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,020
Gently. Yes, place it right in there.

550
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:32,430
Then massage her lovingly.

551
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:36,100
Yes, turn it around gently. Yes!

552
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,540
Lovingly tell her that you love her.

553
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,860
I will do it.
- Where...

554
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,930
There...

555
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:48,640
It's going. It's going in.

556
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,890
I'm going in.

557
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,800
I don't know. I'm going to do it.

558
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,060
Softly. Yes, that's good.

559
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,510
That's good.

560
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:24,540
With a loving heart.

561
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,380
Now, together...

562
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,630
What are you doing now?

563
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,760
Oh my, we were way off.

564
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,430
When did you get here?

565
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,900
You should've called.

566
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:48,140
Well, now! It's for the baby. You shouldn't be so uncooperative.

567
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,800
I will help you.

568
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,630
Your hands can't be stiff like that.

569
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:54,960
Straighten it.

570
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,190
And then, like this.

571
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:02,090
After putting it through, you need to (place it on her breast)

572
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,630
What's wrong??

573
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,460
My stomach... my stomach hurts.

574
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,820
Oh, really?

575
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,850
Tingly. (My hands) Their tingly.

576
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,870
Why are you out here instead of being inside?

577
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,550
It was too embarrassing to go back inside. I didn't want to be a bother.

578
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:01,300
Why do I need to think about what others think when I paid my own money to take this class?

579
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,300
Thank you.

580
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,890
It's okay now that we've come here at least once.

581
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:13,840
I will pretend that we took the other classes, so there's no need to continue coming here.

582
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,020
What if Grandma faints again?

583
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,800
That's fake, can't you tell?

584
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,920
Are you that dense?

585
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,190
She's received a lot of nutrients (via IV), so she will be fine now.  (literally: she'll be flying now)

586
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,650
It's already hard enough seeing each other at home.

587
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:32,650
There's no need to come here and suffer like this.

588
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,610
It was great.

589
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:38,820
What?

590
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:42,890
The baby and the dad, did something together for the first time, so...

591
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:45,510
it was really great.

592
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,970
The child inside must have been happy since it came with the dad.

593
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:55,450
Thank you so much.

594
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,620
No, how...

595
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,160
How do you know that?

596
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:09,150
After becoming a mom, I think I know it.

597
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,610
It's really interesting.

598
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:24,830
Why?

599
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:28,500
Does it hurt somewhere?

600
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
No, it's just that...

601
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,610
Stomach...

602
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:34,220
Stomach? Stomach, sit here.

603
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,610
Stomach where?

604
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,620
Where? Here?

605
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,200
Is hungry.

606
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,740
What?

607
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,490
Are you joking?

608
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,500
Joking, joking?

609
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:55,150
Look here, I

610
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,230
I have a meeting so I have to go in now.

611
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,920
Make sure to eat when you get home.

612
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,530
Do you understand?

613
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,430
I have money, too. I'm really okay.

614
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:10,770
Take it.

615
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:14,480
I have money. Do well on your meeting.

616
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,810
I told you to take it.

617
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:16,990
I have money.

618
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:19,240
Take it...

619
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,850
I think I can live now.

620
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,000
Father!

621
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,180
Are you eating alone?

622
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,230
Please help me.

623
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:27,910
Where?

624
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:30,670
A little bit to that side. I think that's right.

625
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,210
No, no.

626
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:34,000
Over there?
-Yes.

627
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,110
It's done. It's done!

628
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,020
That's alright.

629
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,430
Like this?

630
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:52,860
Like this.
-Like this?

631
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:58,740
Don't splatter it.

632
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:05,630
♫ My slow-witted feelings didn't realize it was love. ♫

633
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:12,670
♫ I'm going to put a smile on your face. ♫

634
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:20,930
♫ I will wipe away all your tears, I promise you. ♫

635
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:25,060
♫ You are my girl. Oh my sunshine. ♫

636
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,280
♫ You're brighter than the sun. ♫

637
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,050
♫ I want to feel you. I want to be loved. ♫

638
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:35,360
♫ The paradise of my dreams. ♫

639
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,180
♫ A movie-like love story. ♫

640
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,420
♫ Ever since we saw each other, like fate. ♫

641
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,220
♫ My restless feelings keep fluttering (beating pitapat). ♫

642
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:51,690
♫ You're also being drawn. I'm falling in love, you're my love. ♫

643
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:56,740
We have to keep this as a souvenir since you're our cafe's first customer.

644
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:07,380
Look this way. Smile~
♫ A movie-like love story ♫

645
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,770
♫ Ever since we saw each other, like fate. ♫

646
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:14,450
♫ My restless feelings keep fluttering. ♫

647
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:19,880
♫ You're also being drawn. I'm falling in love, you're my love. ♫

648
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,320
Oh!

649
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,570
Oh, when did you get this?

650
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,480
This?

651
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,650
I don't know.

652
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,490
Just wait a second.

653
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,450
I'm okay though.

654
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,480
Just stay still.

655
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,840
Oh, this must sting.

656
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:53,130
I'm sorry for making you worried for nothing.

657
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,650
If you keep on saying sorry, it will become a habit.

658
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:59,280
You can just say "Thank you".

659
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,370
Nonchalantly, okay?

660
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:16,490
I will explain the benefits of this item.

661
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:18,440
By trying to decrease the raw plant material,

662
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,980
we've minimized the skin irritation.

663
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:24,220
From the sample tests, compared to our existing products,

664
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,190
it is a new product that has shown benefits to the troubled areas.

665
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,830
We'll look at the next product.

666
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:33,850
This product targets the existing problem areas.

667
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:36,550
It's Jang In Snail Cream.

668
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:43,470
I will explain the benefits of this item.

669
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:48,180
It was able to raise moisture levels and the regeneration of the skin.

670
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,510
I wonder if our snail hasn't eaten?

671
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:54,370
The snail has to eat though.

672
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:55,970
Snail food?

673
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:58,110
Did you feed the snail?

674
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,690
Did you say snail food, CEO?
-Snail food!

675
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,900
Hurry and look it up. Snail food! Food!

676
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,770
Yes, that food.

677
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:07,670
Ah, hurry and look for it.

678
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,410
Ah, I'm sorry.

679
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,910
What about the snail food?

680
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,980
Find it quickly!

681
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,860
Wha...at does it matter if the snaaaaaail eats or noooot?!

682
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,540
What is everyone thinking..sna....snai...snail!

683
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,060
Snail.

684
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,830
Your drawing is really good.

685
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:34,290
Anyway, who is this?

686
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,240
My baby.

687
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,650
I wish that my baby grows this prettily.

688
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:43,000
It would've been great with Mom and Dad on both sides.

689
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,520
Do you want to draw them even now?

690
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,260
No.

691
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,210
We won't be together anyway so why do that.

692
00:55:56,270 --> 00:56:00,400
I'm sorry. I'm speaking nonsense.

693
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,120
Saying sorry again.

694
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:06,160
I think I have to say this.

695
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,100
It's driving me crazy with concern after reading it.

696
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,680
Yes?

697
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:16,310
I actually saw it. The divorce agreement. That weird document.

698
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,160
Does that makes sense? You just got married and now divorce?

699
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,300
Could it be that your husband has some problems?

700
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,700
Or is he just a bad person?

701
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,960
It's not because that person is bad.

702
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,730
There's a reason for doing it.

703
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:36,130
Where in the world would you find a reason like that?

704
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,790
There shouldn't be one.

705
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:42,180
Father, please don't get mad.

706
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:49,420
Because it was sudden, it's true that I was shocked.

707
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,710
But I understand why he did it.

708
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,170
He has someone he loves.

709
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:01,910
But because of me, everything has disappeared into thin air.

710
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,460
Then what about the baby?

711
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:07,560
I'm still thinking about that.

712
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:11,040
I want to raise the baby,

713
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,240
but I'm not sure because I might be too lacking to be a mom.

714
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,610
Is it just my greed?

715
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,260
I'm a little scared, too.

716
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,030
Why be scared?

717
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:25,890
A child is a child. A drawing is a drawing.

718
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:28,150
I know you'll do everything right.

719
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:31,920
I'm not just good at knowing if a drawing is good. I have a good eye for people, too.

720
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:41,850
Now, I don't have any secrets from you, Father.

721
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:47,060
Still, it feels really comfortable. It's weird, right?

722
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,810
Is it because you're a priest?

723
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:59,590
I also like it because it seems like I got a cute younger sister.

724
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,840
Please go back now. I'll be fine by myself.

725
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,590
That won't do. What if someone grabs you right here? It's dangerous at night.

726
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,110
By the way, Father, is it okay for you to go back this late?

727
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,020
I have to go, of course.

728
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,080
We're here.

729
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,560
This is my in-laws home.

730
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:45,630
Then you are Wang..

731
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,710
Fated to Love You
~ Preview ~

732
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:34,110
I thought something smelled from the start.

733
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:38,030
In the end, you've become a certified philosopher.

734
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:41,240
Maintain your dignity while you're with me.

735
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,250
What was I expecting?

736
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,920
Even though his wife is trying to protect it, he's trying to sell it?

737
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,100
I really can't give this child up.

738
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:53,230
There will never be a change in the fact that we are getting a divorce.

739
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:56,170
Regardless of anything "The End".

740
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,490
"The End!"

741
00:59:57,490 --> 01:00:00,410
You think a genetic disease is frightening without any reason?

742
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,990
You're the one who needs to be strong.

743
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:06,250
Don't you remember me?

744
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:09,670
I'm Se Ra's friend, Shi Eun.

745
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:12,140
I'll help you.

746
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:16,630
What kind of person is he? Do you want to check it out?
