Episode 19

2
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,560
Congratulations.
- Ah, yes.

3
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,530
Congratulations.
- Yes, thank you.

4
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,140
President Park. Come down here.

5
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,750
Why are you up there? Come down.

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,370
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

7
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,810
Chairwoman! Chairwoman!

8
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,200
Why are you all here without the bride and groom?

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,130
Th... the... the thing is...

10
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,890
What is it?

11
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,990
The thing is... Unni and Brother-in-law...

12
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,320
They have both suddenly disappeared.

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,800
Aigoo!
- What did you say?

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,300
Seriously, where did they go?!

15
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,310
Secretary Tak, how could you handle things in this manner?!

16
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,780
Go!

17
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,700
Gun.

18
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,590
Gun.

19
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,310
What's the matter, Gun?

20
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,350
It's me. Don't you know who I am?

21
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,450
Who are you?

22
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,960
Could you by chance have forgotten again?

23
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,630
It's me, Kim Mi Young.

24
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,360
Dog Poopie's mom, snail. Super glue!

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,890
Don't you remember at least one of them?

26
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,070
Jang Na Ra.

27
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,210
What's he saying?!

28
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,420
Jang Na Ra!

29
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,760
Gun!

30
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,000
Gun, what's the matter? What country(nara)?

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,390
What's the matter? Did you have a bad dream?

32
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,460
In my dream

33
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,460
a dog was chasing me.

34
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:02,530
But Mi Young. What are you doing so early in the morning with that apron on?

35
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,250
I was doing something fun.
- Something fun?

36
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,210
- Finger.
- Finger.

37
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,850
This is fun, making bread?

38
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,460
It's so fun.

39
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,580
There are many more fun things over there.

40
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:33,020
Then I'll get ready to go to the studio while this is cooking.

41
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,040
Kim Mi Young!

42
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,670
Are you abandoning me right now?!

43
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,190
I'm on vacation.

44
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,860
I need to earn, since you're not working.

45
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,790
Those words are nice to hear.

46
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,100
Like a real married couple.

47
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,440
Should I give everything up and become your secretary?

48
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,830
Madam, do you not want this charismatic and attractive man as a secretary?

49
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,350
I'll be on standby 24/7, both day and night.

50
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,580
I'll get in trouble with my husband.

51
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,130
This healthy attitude of a wife, a very good attitude!

52
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,990
So, when are you going to release me?

53
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,870
I'll let you go if you kiss me.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,350
What the... What do you think you're doing?!

55
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,120
Go and clean this room. Clean everything!

56
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,450
Clean everything thoroughly!

57
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,770
What are you going to do today?

58
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,710
I have a lot to do today.

59
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,290
Mother, Mom, I'm hungry.

60
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,030
Dialect is not that hard.

61
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,650
Yeah right, you did so well.

62
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,820
Ssam bap lady!

63
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,070
You've been waiting for me, haven't you?

64
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,410
You did honestly wait for me!

65
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,740
I've come prepared with something subdued.

66
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,340
This is a straight up bribe.

67
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,360
This is the "Mother, I'll be filial."

68
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,320
"No more worry" it's supplements.

69
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,990
I don't need it. Take it back.

70
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,520
You're coming out strong. You won't even blink an eye.

71
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,770
Fine, then I'll prepare something that sparkles more, something stronger!

72
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:56,250
Regardless of how shiny it is, could it even come close to the sparkle in my rice wrap lady's eyes?

73
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,800
Stop talking to me. I don't need any of these,

74
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,390
so take it and go.

75
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,410
I'm very

76
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,260
hungry. Give me some food.
(in a lousy dialect)

77
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:21,460
Mother, I need to eat before I go.

78
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,820
Mother.

79
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,530
Why do you keep calling me?

80
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,420
Who am I that I can't call my mother, mother? Am I Hong Gil Dong?

81
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,420
Gun.

82
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,010
Mom called my name.

83
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,080
She called my name.

84
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,160
What? What?

85
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,100
You may not believe this, but

86
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,450
you're really like one of my own children.

87
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,340
I feel like my rice wrap lady is really like my own mom, too.

88
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,350
So, accept me once, ooh la la la.

89
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,480
Let me marry Kim Mi Young, huh?

90
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,940
Let me marry her.

91
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,710
That's why I'm saying this, but if you get really sick,

92
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,640
I'll take care of you.

93
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,710
I don't know to what degree you are sick, but

94
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,550
I'll help you no matter what.

95
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,490
Rice wrap lady,

96
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,820
I'm not sick at all.

97
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,030
Do I appear like a sick person?

98
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,790
I haven't even had a cold for the last 3 years.

99
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,380
I get a physical every 6 months.

100
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,520
Should I show you how healthy I am? Should I do a push up?

101
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,080
Look, I can do it even with my thumb.

102
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,570
That's fine. That's alright.

103
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,830
I believe everything you say.

104
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:04,290
But Gun, in place of me being your mother,

105
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,130
can't you let my Mi Young free?

106
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:15,540
I can't help it even if others call me a selfish or a terrible person.

107
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,960
It's not someone else but my Mi Young.

108
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,570
She says that she's going to take the obviously painful road.

109
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,330
How can I just sit by and watch?

110
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,930
I really like you, too, Gun.

111
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,630
But I'm still against you and Mi Young.

112
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,920
You know how I feel, right?

113
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,920
You understand what your mother is saying, right?

114
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,130
You thought I would give up just like that, rice wrap lady!?

115
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,210
Wait and see. Wait and see!

116
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:10,410
I'm going to come back stronger! Much stronger!

117
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,630
I will be back, lettuce wrap lady!

118
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,790
How can this be?

119
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,770
It's been a while.

120
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,640
What is this?

121
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,530
Why are you treating me like the invisible man?

122
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,140
Were we not drinking buddies?

123
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,840
I'm not in the mood for drinking, so I'll pretend not to know you for a bit.

124
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,110
Totally confusing.

125
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,960
Such a drastic change.

126
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,960
Aren't you getting on?

127
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,560
You go first. I left something behind.

128
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,390
Why is she acting like that all of a sudden?

129
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,080
Hello! Hello.

130
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,030
Who am I? I am...

131
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,320
you know the rice wrap place in the front?

132
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,610
I'm Lee Gun, soon to be the owner's 3rd son-in-law.

133
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,090
The 3rd son-in-law.

134
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,070
Please take a drink.

135
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,580
This is very refreshing.
- Aigoo, thanks.

136
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,370
Ah, your hair is really nice. How about a little bit of bleach here?

137
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,260
Really?
- Oh! Of course.

138
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,170
Try bleach then.

139
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,180
Our mother came for a perm?

140
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,570
It'd be nice to color your hair to make it brighter.

141
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:38,240
Trust me. I know, I know. You're looking at me 'cause I'm handsome, huh?

142
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,570
Just take this one and...

143
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,120
Rice wrap madam, you were getting your hair done?

144
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,360
Oh, really?

145
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,720
Rice wrap madam, take one of these, too.

146
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,470
I don't want it.

147
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,350
Strong!

148
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,100
How can I change my mother's mind?

149
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,450
I have just one wish. Do you know what it is?

150
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,250
I'd like to see my rice wrap lady in a beautiful hanbok(traditional Korean dress).

151
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,890
Something splendid. You know what I mean.

152
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,200
Forget it. If I say no once, that means no.

153
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,380
Rice wrap lady,

154
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,830
you are a lady of principle!

155
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,570
How can I not love my rice wrap lady?

156
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,050
But rice wrap lady, I know

157
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,070
that you will give your approval in the end.

158
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,770
I'll go back today, but I'm going to come back stronger tomorrow.

159
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,110
You can look forward to it.

160
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,770
Also.. drink this.

161
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,610
This is my sincerity. It's good for you.

162
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,280
I'm going.

163
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,200
How can a son-in-law be so friendly? It must be nice.

164
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,180
He's so good looking and he's so affectionate, too.

165
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,350
I would be happy if my son-in-law had even half of that.

166
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,570
I'm so jealous.

167
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,790
What is this?

168
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,690
This is...

169
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,910
It's the ramen that you wanted to eat so badly. Ramen with pollock eyes.

170
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,500
Is this the ramen that Dragon ate and went on and on about?

171
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,120
I'm so curious about how it tastes.

172
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,590
This has something different from the anchovy rice wrap,

173
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,250
it has soul.

174
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,130
Hey, Dragon, I had it too!

175
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,320
My mother isn't easy, is she?

176
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,500
I know.. that you're trying everything to get her approval.

177
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,340
Easy women are not fun.

178
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,830
Thank you.

179
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,430
My mother could make you feel upset, but you don't show that at all.

180
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,870
Just trust in me.

181
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,780
I'll do whatever it takes to get the rice wrap lady to give in.

182
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,020
Gun, fighting!
- Fighting!

183
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,360
Why is there only one bowl?

184
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,440
I'm not very hungry.

185
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,770
You should still eat with me. I don't like eating alone.

186
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,920
Should I?

187
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,490
This is really delicious.

188
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,820
Hey, Mi Young, shall we make a nest today?

189
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,360
A nest of love.

190
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,620
Would that be alright?

191
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,980
Who is it?

192
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,150
What kind of punk is it? Who is it?!

193
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,840
What are you all doing here?

194
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,200
You must have a house warming party if you've gotten a new home.

195
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,800
You didn't call regardless of how long we waited, so we just barged in.

196
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,280
Hamo hamo.
- Let's go inside.

197
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,480
Wait just a minute.
- Let's go in!

198
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,740
What a nice house.

199
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,100
Sister-in-law.

200
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,260
Mi Young.

201
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,300
Unni, what are you doing here?

202
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:24,630
Great timing. Your timing is amazing.

203
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,280
Why? What were you two doing to make your face so red?

204
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,970
What would we do?

205
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,520
We were eating ramen. Right?

206
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,250
We were eating ramen. Eating ramen.

207
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:42,020
Should we just order something since we were not expecting company?

208
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,540
That's fine. We've already eaten.

209
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,280
These days one eats before going to a house warming. We have sense!

210
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,780
That's true. One must have common sense.

211
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,920
Forget about the food, but this must not be forgotten.

212
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,560
What is that?

213
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,170
Something one can't be without at a house warming. Sense!

214
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,390
Are you a tazza(master)? Are you Goni (main character from the movie/drama Tazza that he played)?

215
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,150
It's not Goni but Gunnie, Gunnie.

216
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,450
Oh my, you have gwang coming out.

217
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,680
He's getting everything.

218
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,190
It's not going so well.

219
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,380
Here you go godori!

220
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,460
Godori! Godori!

221
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,880
- Go
- Dori

222
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,230
Dori, dori, dori.

223
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,640
Godori!

224
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,900
Now I'm going to do 'stop'.

225
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,030
If you add it up, it's 1200 won. 1200 won.

226
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,130
It's a loss for me.

227
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,850
Excuse me.

228
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,150
I'll try the next round.

229
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,270
Mi Young, this is a gathering of "tazzas."

230
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:03,100
Park tazza and Choi tazza, they are all tazzas.

231
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:09,510
I may not know about anything else, but I can play Go-Stop pretty well.

232
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,400
Go-Stop? Well, okay, go ahead. The stakes aren't even high.

233
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,880
Shall I?

234
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,680
When did you change into pants?

235
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,810
Brother-in-law, deal the cards.

236
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,460
Sister-in-law, do you know the rules?

237
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,410
I guess there isn't anything for Mi Young to take.

238
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,170
The best, best, best, best!

239
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,650
Aigoo.

240
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,550
I'll take the dong
(poop, also refers to an animal card).

241
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,020
Sseul!

242
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,420
You crapped out. You crapped.

243
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,420
What is this?

244
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,600
What to do... ?

245
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,270
What is this?

246
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,690
One go. One go!

247
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,120
I'll put this down.

248
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,200
Godori, godori, go godori!
- Godori?

249
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,060
If she gets godori, what's there for me to take?
There's nothing.

250
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,640
Get the cho-dan first.

251
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,630
You did!

252
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,590
Dong is mine.

253
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,860
Money. Money. Give us money.
- Take it, take it.

254
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,500
The President hasn't paid us yet.

255
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,610
President.

256
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,770
President.

257
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,600
Is it me?

258
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,420
Is that it? Okay.

259
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,470
Dong, pi.

260
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,520
Go... Aikoo. Good going.

261
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,960
Chung dan!

262
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,310
Let's stop now.

263
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,020
The sun is out.

264
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,220
Let's go, Mi Ja.

265
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,960
Gwangbak and pibak and...

266
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,750
Since I shook it, it's double of double of double, so...

267
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,150
15,000 won and 30,000 won.

268
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,620
Just give her the 15,000 won.

269
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,970
Applause. Applause.

270
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,910
Gun. This is what you lost, right?

271
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,340
Go home now already.

272
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,520
Should we slowly start now.

273
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,380
So you've ended things with CEO Lee.

274
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,710
You saw the article also?

275
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,220
You wouldn't listen when I told you to settle things.

276
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,910
In the end you were completely rejected.

277
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,160
Mom, you are so odd.

278
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,570
What is that suppose to mean?

279
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,100
Other mothers would be consoling at a time like this.

280
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,580
Or they would curse the man out together, but

281
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,100
why do you blame me first on everything?

282
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,690
It's been that way since I was young.

283
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:12,340
To you, I was a rising star to put it nicely, but a puppet to put it bluntly.

284
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,830
Mom,

285
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,150
is it possible...

286
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,950
Never mind.

287
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,920
I'll leave for now.

288
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,340
I'm leaving first.

289
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,970
It's amazing. Absolutely amazing.

290
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,220
I thought you were a tazza. Tazza.

291
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,010
It had been a while since I played.

292
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:02,470
Why did you come out when you barely even slept. I could have come by myself.

293
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,620
I think it's about time I step up, too.

294
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,630
What is she doing?

295
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,570
She's stretching.

296
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,800
She's running.

297
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,950
Good morning.

298
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,220
Whew...

299
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,600
Oh my!

300
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,910
Good morning, rice wrap lady!

301
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,950
What are you doing? Are you following me up here, too?

302
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,180
You thought it was just me?

303
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,950
Mom, good morning.

304
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,250
Why did you come here again?

305
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,500
I can't not be involved.

306
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,930
A married couple is of one body.

307
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,780
These two... One's not working out, so they're coming at me with numbers.

308
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,610
It's frightening, right? You must be scared.

309
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,620
You never thought we would join forces.

310
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,500
This is useless.

311
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,450
Once I say no, it means no.

312
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,000
But lettuce wrap lady, this thing you do where you clap hands in front and back,

313
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,270
does it do anything?

314
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,580
I don't know either.

315
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,380
I do it because it's supposed to be good for you.

316
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,170
I wanted to do something earnestly if it was beneficial.

317
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:52,070
There is a lady I know. Someone I need to look really good to.

318
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,050
That lady is really tough.

319
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,090
She thinks I'm only going to live a day or two.

320
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,170
So I will live a long time and live

321
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,920
to show how well I can protect the girl I love.

322
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,260
Then that lady's heart will start changing slowly, bit by bit.

323
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,970
Watch me well, rice wrap lady. I'm going to show you how healthy I am.

324
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,230
First, it's a parallel bar!

325
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,590
Aja! Aja!

326
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,390
This is so hard to do. I can't even hang on.

327
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,590
Do it, do it!

328
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,840
Like this and this.

329
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,230
You thought coming up here was the end, but no, keep hanging!

330
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,220
You thought it was the end, huh?

331
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,490
I come up here, and then what?

332
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,740
And then, tada!

333
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,860
You thought this is the end, huh?

334
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,760
You're surprised already.
♬  like destiny, I’m nervous, ♬

335
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,200
Watch, Mom.
♬ Like I’ve been enchanted, I’m falling in love ♬

336
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,950
This is really difficult. Reverse!
♬ I look for you like a habit ♬

337
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:01,960
From here stretch out the waist and back over.

338
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,390

340

Do you know how difficult this is?
♬ didn’t realize it’s love ♬

341
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,010
There isn't something just anyone can do.
♬ didn’t realize it’s love ♬

342
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,840
You see what I do?

343
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,740
I'm taking off one hand.
♬ I’ll wipe away the tears ♬

344
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:23,760
Look at him.

345
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,920
Look at him, Mom!

346
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:35,340
See what I do to live long.

347
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,790

♬ Like a dreamy paradise

352
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,990
Oh my tummy!

353
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,050
This is a whole body exercise.

354
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,740
Lettuce wrap lady!

355
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,640
Where are you going, rice wrap lady?

356
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,750
You think we're going to just give up?

357
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,700
Never. This isn't the end!

358
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,620
Mi Young, is this doable?

359
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,890
Since we're doing it together.

360
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,700
You've really suffered.

361
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,190
Here, get on my back.

362
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,740
No, it's harder for you.

363
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,340
What kind of behavior is this, Mi Young?

364
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,230
I'm a really strong man.

365
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm definitely not a weakling.

366
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,250
Get on my back, quickly.

367
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,090
Really?
- Of course.

368
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,660
I'm heavy.

369
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,800
It's hard, right?

370
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,170
No, it's not hard at all.

371
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,600
My Gun is the best.

372
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,530
Should we

373
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,930
go have some sweet ramen?

374
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,540
Should we?

375
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:51,970
Every moment in my life, because of my fear of death,

376
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:57,630
the times during which I lost the things I had to love and protect are so regretful.

377
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:02,590
Why did I choose such an idiotic route.

378
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,730
A man needs to live life laughing.

379
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,900
Looking at things from high up here like this.

380
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,370
You're so beautiful!

381
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:21,270
Yahoo!
- Yahoo.

382
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,470
I'm going to regain those moments back even now.

383
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,760
It's time to return back to my family.

384
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,820
Nuna, you really know how to cook.

385
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,030
I've lived on my own for many years.

386
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:04,030
Most Korean restaurant menus are a piece of cake!

387
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,820
Nuna, the more I get to know you, the more you become my ideal type.

388
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,950
But Honey, how long are you going to call me nuna (older sister)?

389
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,490
I don't want to be your sister anymore.

390
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,530
What should I call you then?

391
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,670
What's the point of having a name?

392
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,810
Ji Yun.

393
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,330
Yes...

394
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,710
Did you just speak formally to me?

395
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:33,720
Between an older woman and a younger man,
it's better to be more formal, I hear.

396
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,340
Ji Yun,

397
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,220
you've woken up the real man that was dormant inside me.

398
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,230
Brace yourself.

399
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,370
How dare you kiss in this house?

400
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,810
Mom!
- Mother-in-law!

401
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,890
Yong, why are you home instead of going to work?

402
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,570
I'm off today, I told you.

403
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,690
You! Why am I your mother? I never gave birth to you.

404
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,320
She's too much!

405
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,430
Ah, Yong! He's really...

406
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:16,190
Why does he have such low standards for girls?

407
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,800
You were here.

408
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,200
You are planning to leave now?

409
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,960
Can I... ask you one thing?

410
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,150
Father...

411
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,050
How it felt when you last saw him...

412
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,370
Do you remember that moment?

413
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,990
That day, he seemed like someone else.

414
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,720
I'm sorry.

415
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,630
And thank you.

416
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:31,240
I was just a thankful and sorry person to him.

417
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,490
So when he said that he wanted to return to his family again,

418
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,620
I could not stop him any further.

419
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,280
Even during the times when his memories were gone,

420
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,390
I wished that he was my person.

421
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,780
But it was just my greed after all.

422
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:53,530
That person, too, it was too bad.

423
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:59,010
When he went to visit the family that he so missed,

424
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:03,230
the car accident happened.

425
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,980
Since he took the last walk

426
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,780
with the person he truly loved,

427
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:13,730
I think, at least, that's fortunate.

428
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,760
Father...

429
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,800
Giving me his diary...

430
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,270
I really thank...

431
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,100
Huh?

432
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,120
Thank you.

433
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:58,220
Did he just say thank you to me?

434
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,380
It was the first.

435
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,300
What is this place?

436
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,550
When I looked it up,

437
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:29,330
smarter than ghosts, they will find whatever you need. It's that kind of place.

438
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,730
Isn't this a gangsters' hideout?

439
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,840
Gangsters.

440
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,460
Their fashion is incredible. What is this?

441
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,990
One button.
- One button.

442
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,270
It's two buttons.

443
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,460
This is two buttons?

444
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,870
Doesn't close.
- Yes, doesn't close.

445
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,120
Very colorful.

446
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,830
Oh, is that right?

447
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,940
Ah, of course. Daddy, too, I miss our daughter so very much.
Private Investigative Agency

448
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,010
Bye! I love you!

449
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,620
The way he talks on the phone...

450
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,060
Did the customers arrive?

451
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,960
Is the contract a joke to you?

452
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,800
Oh no, that...!

453
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,720
Am I that laughable!

454
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,090
Do, do, do, dodo!

455
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:25,820
Isn't that CEO Cha?

456
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:30,460
Who is this? Isn't this Jang In Chemicals' CEO Lee Gun?

457
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,250
What are you doing here?

458
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:38,270
Ah, perhaps did the wife you really love cheat on you?

459
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,520
How? Should I take care of things for you?

460
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,390
Look here. Are you now doing things like this?

461
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:49,980
Ah, I guess you haven't heard about me.

462
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:57,900
While you didn't see me, I did something illegal,
so I was at the big house (jail) for some time.

463
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,880
Why the big house (eldest sibling's house) when it's not even a holiday?

464
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,180
Jail!

465
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,940
Do I have to explain everything with my own mouth?

466
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,520
Anyways, due to that reason, my company failed.

467
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,600
So returning to where I started, I've decided to do what I originally used to do.

468
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,020
Enough with verse 1. So basically your company failed, that's what you're saying!

469
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,490
Aren't you saying that your company failed? It failed. It failed.

470
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,860
His company failed.

471
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,460
Let's go, let's go. What can we expect from here?

472
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,630
Let's go, Secretary Tak.

473
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,820
Then, work hard.

474
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,320
One Button, Doesn't Close, did you just block me right now?

475
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,800
Secretary Tak.

476
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,520
His right fist... a fragrant smell. And leaving.

477
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,390
His left first... the crying sound.

478
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:56,840
There's something in here.

479
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,060
If you get hit by this, you will be forever disassembled.

480
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,610
Doesn't Close, One Button, do you want to be disassembled?

481
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,270
Do you want to be disassembled?

482
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,660
You're still quick-tempered.

483
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:20,050
In this field, it's hard to find a company that works as hard as mine.

484
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,650
Fine. Since you are an acquaintance of mine,

485
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,630
I'll give you a 10% discount, leave it to me.

486
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,790
My concentrating power is unbelievable!

487
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,250
Can you really find it for me?

488
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:36,550
Even if it's hidden anywhere in this world, my own know-how to find it right away...

489
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,780
This... what tree?

490
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,860
Can you really find this tree?

491
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,730
A tree?

492
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,370
If you can find this tree, forget the 10% discount. I will give you double.

493
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,500
You guys,

494
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,190
get started right away!

495
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,190
Yes, Hyungnim!!

496
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,950
What's wrong?

497
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,840
Do you want to eat this?

498
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,740
The shape is very metaphysical.

499
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,020
I made it for the first time.
- What?

500
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,480
You are sharing it with me when it's your first time making it?

501
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,350
Wow, this is an honor.

502
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,710
Well...

503
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,020
The taste... better than it looks..

504
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,170
Um, it isn't bad.

505
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,230
I researched your background.

506
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,730
And you are quite a famous person.

507
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,190
Are you coming out that you did a background check on me?

508
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,820
Usually, everyone always...

509
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,290
But you didn't research up on some complicated girl relationships, right?

510
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,220
Complicated...?

511
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:17,240
It seems you are the professional at unrequited love.

512
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,530
Ah, seriously...Making me choke.

513
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,310
Last time...

514
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:37,920
You know the time that you were so drunk that I took you home?

515
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,600
Yes, yes! Yes.

516
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:46,030
I accidently saw it. Those childhood photos beside your bed, what are those?

517
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:50,510
Ah, that's my younger sister.

518
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,710
Sister?

519
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:57,200
Her name is Mi Young. The sister that I lost when I was younger.

520
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,330
But, why are you curious about that all of a sudden?

521
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,880
Ah, no. It's just...

522
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,440
Then, I'll be taking my leave.

523
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,590
These dishes, I will wash them for you.

524
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,870
No.. you can just keep it.

525
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:15,780
Um? No, wait a minute!

526
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:33,120
Ah, I really can't eat these.

527
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,180
Did you leave something?

528
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,420
The little girl inside those photos,

529
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,170
I think it's me.

530
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:56,460
But... I don't know why I'm inside those photos.

531
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,390
This color came out a little different than the original painting.

532
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,690
Please make the correction.
- Yes, will do.

533
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,130
Doesn't this seem a little too heavy?

534
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,800
It should be much lighter.

535
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,490
Please make another sample with a different material.

536
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,400
Yes.

537
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,270
Daniel

538
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,220
Hello?

539
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,020
It's been a while.

540
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,890
I know.

541
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,880
I was thinking about calling you while drinking and throwing a fit.

542
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,730
You're still amusing.

543
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,460
It's a problem when you smile in such a fatal way.

544
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,150
If you do that, I might ask you to let me start over as the neighborhood oppa again.

545
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,950
How have you been?

546
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:31,210
As you know, since I have so many people calling me... I'm kidding.

547
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:36,330
Well, I've been busy going back and forth to and from Sejong City, getting the biennial ready. You too?

548
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:39,250
Since I've been trying to start my work in Korea in full capacity,

549
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,750
there are so many things that I need to take care of personally.

550
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:48,430
It's nothing special, but I honestly

551
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,270
called you to give you a tiny present.

552
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,440
Present?

553
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,990
Something I want to give you for the last time.

554
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,670
I left it there. Just a minute.

555
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:34,020
♬ As usual, the sunlight was warm. ♬

556
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:41,890
♬ And you who were leaning on me was beautiful. ♬

557
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:49,730
♬ The time suddenly talked about going separate ways. ♬

558
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:55,480
♬ So I smiled so you won't suffer. ♬

559
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:03,060
♬ What I said like a habit. ♬

560
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:11,470
♬ I'll do anything you want. ♬

561
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:19,700
♬ Like a fool, to keep that promise, ♬

562
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:29,220
♬ I sent you, who was my everything, away. ♬

563
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,790
How are you related to her?
I'm the neighborhood oppa.

564
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:37,260
No matter how hard it is, I will help you with everything!
Just as if I am a real brother.

565
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:42,150
I don't know if how I feel toward you, Daniel, is

566
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:47,040
thankfulness or love.

567
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,570
I understand what you're saying.

568
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:09,220
♬ Since that day, I'm always in pain. ♬

569
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:47,500
Now that I did it in front of you, I'm so embarrassed.

570
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,750
Thank you.

571
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,420
That was a really precious present and I will keep it close for a long time.

572
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,370
You can't forget even when you become a grandmother.

573
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,250
Yes, I won't.

574
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:14,870
Contact me if you ever need a priest or a neighborhood oppa.

575
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,400
Yes.

576
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,830
I'm going to be strong.

577
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,380
Strength!

578
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,820
Oh, CEO Cha, did you find that tree?

579
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:55,840
Honestly, how can I find it with one single picture of a tree?

580
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,320
Give me some other clue.

581
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,690
If there were many clues, would I have asked you to do it?

582
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:04,010
Go back to basics, with the eyes of an eagle...

583
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:07,250
Look it over again carefully.

584
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,840
This person.

585
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,870
Ey, Eagle, I really don't know...
-If you have nothing to do,

586
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,240
come to the restaurant right now.

587
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:25,910
Oh, so strong.

588
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,810
Don't just drink the alcohol, stuff yourself with the side dishes too.

589
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:37,890
What is this for side dishes? So weak!

590
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:41,030
Tofu should have kimchee or seasoned soy sauce.

591
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:43,850
Did I just get out of prison?

592
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,170
What's up with the raw tofu? Am I a sinner?

593
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,320
From now on, you're a sinner to me.
- What's that supposed to mean?

594
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,940
Since you're going to take my perfect daughter away from me forever.

595
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,910
Rice wrap lady.

596
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:03,050
Can you make a promise not to die, and to protect Mi Young?

597
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,890
Rice wrap lady!

598
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:12,470
I'll make my Mi Young laugh always.

599
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:17,620
I will make her so happy that her cheeks never come down!

600
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:33,340
Cheers! Take one.

601
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,730
Give me one too!

602
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,050
What's the matter?

603
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:52,080
Because it's so sweet.

604
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,280
Just stuff this down your throat!

605
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:02,230
♬ Without the lettuce wrap ♬

606
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:06,180
♬ What fun is it to live in this world ♬

607
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,080
When the sun's up.
- Lettuce wrap!

608
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,110
When the moon's up.
- Lettuce wrap!

609
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:14,150
Lettuce wrap is the best!
- The best, the best!

610
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,090
Why isn't this door opening up?

611
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,920
Why isn't the door opening up?

612
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,020
Hey! Can you really not forget me?

613
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,720
How can I forget you? I can't!

614
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:36,370
You can't ever forget a woman like me. Never!

615
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,780
Oh my, I'm so drunk.

616
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:53,050
Why are you hanging on to me? It's hot!

617
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,800
Mom, don't worry.

618
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,770
Why would I worry about you?

619
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:05,880
You never listen and do as you please.

620
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,190
You're going to wear something pretty to the wedding, right?

621
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:15,670
Are you bragging about getting married twice to your mother who's living alone?

622
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:18,610
I've seen it already. I'm not going.

623
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:21,500
Are you really not going to come?

624
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,910
I, because of that punk that knows only about himself,

625
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:29,580
gave my permission because I have no choice,

626
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,880
but I can't give my blessings while smiling.

627
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,580
You may say that I'm vicious but it can't be helped.
That's how I feel!

628
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,650
That's how I feel.

629
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:50,650
You punk, it's my pillow! Don't put your head on it!

630
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:55,440
Hey, eat well and live well! I don't know.

631
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,910
Of course, we should eat and live well! We should eat and live well!

632
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,430
Thank you.

633
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,640
Thank you.

634
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,030
CEO Cha, did you find anything?

635
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:53,880
What?

636
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:01,960
Mi Young, you look so beautiful!

637
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,080
Do I look pretty?
- Wow, so pretty!

638
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,850
You're so beautiful.

639
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,010
It seems Mom is really busy today.

640
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:18,730
You know how she's stubborn.

641
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,970
There are things she said as well, so...

642
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:26,110
It's Mom's loss, not being able to see this angelic Mi Young.

643
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:28,400
I'm so jealous.

644
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,510
Mi Young.
- Gun.

645
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:34,070
We have to go somewhere. Hurry now.

646
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,830
Where...
- Where are they going?

647
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:37,690
Don't cry.
- Open the door!

648
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,960
Open the door! Open the door!
- What, what?

649
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,020
CEO!

650
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,080
Why? Why? Why?
- What is it?

651
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,690
Where are you going?

652
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,230
Car key! Key, key, key!

653
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,690
Why?
- Where are you going?!

654
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,540
Where are they going?
-I don't know.

655
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,300
Where are you going?

656
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,580
What is this?

657
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,980
Gun, where are we going right now?

658
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,350
What about the wedding?

659
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:14,670
Right now, there's a place where I must go with you.

660
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:22,230
We're already going together.

661
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:33,670
Chairwoman!

662
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,500
Chai... Chairwoman!

663
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,260
Chairwoman!

664
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:43,510
Why are you all here without the bride and groom?

665
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,560
Th... the... the thing is...

666
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,270
What is it?

667
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:53,460
The thing is... Unni and Brother-in-law...

668
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,090
They have both suddenly disappeared.

669
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,100
Aigoo!

670
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:03,290
What? Where on earth did they go?

671
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,850
OH!

672
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:10,730
Chairwoman, here!

673
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,390
We will go somewhere for a moment.

674
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:16,040
Please wait for us. I'm sorry.

675
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,180
Where did he go this time?!

676
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,640
Gun.

677
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,790
Wait a moment.

678
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,080
You came?

679
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,920
It would've been bad if you were even a little late.

680
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,180
They were going to move the tree immediately today

681
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:51,690
and I'm barely halting it now.

682
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,080
Oh! Oh! Oh!

683
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,710
W-Wait a moment.

684
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:01,680
Just a moment. Can you give me just a moment?

685
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,210
I can't. We have to do this right now.

686
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:09,880
Well, a moment won't be too difficult.

687
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,140
Everyone, let's take just a short rest and come back.

688
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,000
Then...

689
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,170
I'm done here, so I'll be gone as well.

690
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:29,480
Ah, really. I even get to find a tree.

691
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,420
Kids, let's go!

692
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,610
Yes!

693
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:52,900
Look at that!

694
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:56,980
Here! He stood in the middle.

695
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:03,030
Strike! Aigoo, you're doing well.

696
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:06,460
Alright.
- Now I'm going to throw it hard.

697
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:24,270
What will come out?

698
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:27,930
Tada! Do you know what this is?

699
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:32,320
When you grow up to be an adult like me,
only gentlemen can put these on.

700
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,730
Our Gun should wear these later too, okay?

701
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,050
Yes.

702
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:40,400
Daddy will put these precious things in here.

703
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,220
Then, this one... for me!

704
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:46,290
It's a signed ball I got when you and I went to a baseball game for the first time.

705
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:49,180
Ok, putting the signed ball in.

706
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:54,480
This, when you become a big adult like me later,

707
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,670
you open it then.
- This is really fun.
- It's fun?

708
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:00,330
Let's do it next time, too!

709
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:02,080
Next time.

710
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,400
Of course, we should do it next time.

711
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,320
Gun, listen to me carefully.

712
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:12,440
Even now and from now on, too, when you feel scared,

713
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,670
like Daddy, going eu-eu-eung,

714
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:21,900
like this, always smile, okay?

715
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,640
Then I'll always protect you by your side.

716
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,200
Alright, shall we put it in?

717
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:34,840
It's going in. It went in. Now let's put those back on.

718
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:33,130
Gun, when you read this letter as an adult,

719
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:38,430
you'll probably know everything about me (Dad).

720
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:42,270
That I walked the same path as you did.

721
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:48,500
I decided to leave you and your mom,

722
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:54,210
but I know I may regret this decision.

723
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:59,870
When you encounter a moment where you have to make an important choice,

724
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:04,030
rather than being insecure about the time that hasn't arrived,

725
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:11,600
don't waste the very present moment, but enjoy everyday to the fullest.

726
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,600
My son, my son, whom I love, Gun.

727
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:30,040
♬ When I hold out my hand and hug you tight ♬

728
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:37,610
♬ The missed destiny will become love ♬
