1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,190
What is this sound?

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,260
What is this sound?

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,370
The door is locked! Why is the door locked?

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,260
Are we prisoners or something?

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,230
Open the door!

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,200
Ahjumma, just hit me instead like earlier. Huh?

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,140
Open the door!

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,740
Episode 4

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,800
Excuse me. I'm sorry,

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,760
for many reasons. You even got hit because of me.

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,710
Your mom is severely wild.

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,700
Different than her daughter.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,290
At least she gave us blankets.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,990
So? Are you really going to sleep here?

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,880
We have no choice.

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,210
No matter what we say, my mom will never open the door for us.

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,740
Chief Tak! Chief Tak!

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,310
There's a door there!

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,480
It's locked...

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,500
Locked... That one might be open.

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,880
Careful, careful.

22
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,190
Can you get out from there?

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,500
Then should I dig a tunnel with a spoon?

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,570
I should! Just go over there, you're disrupting me.
-Yes.

25
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,370
But you should be careful.

26
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,570
This is ridiculous. Really!

27
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,780
Why... didn't you tell me?

28
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,750
About the baby...

29
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,900
You had the chance to tell me.

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,460
Sorry. I wanted to tell you, but

31
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,870
I couldn't bring myself to say it.

32
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,950
Um. You're hungry, right?

33
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,190
This is a "seaweed ear," would you like some?
(part of the seaweed at the root that's not common)

34
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,960
"A seaweed ear?" Why is there an ear on seaweed?

35
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,210
You haven't had anything to eat yet.

36
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,510
Usually people get angrier when they're hungry.

37
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,090
Just a little to get rid of your hunger for now...

38
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,860
Forget it, forget it. How can I eat that?

39
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,030
Well, even so... I can't ignore your sincerity...

40
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,230
Give me a little.

41
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,500
What kind of taste is this?

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,830
Anyway, in this country village there isn't any...

43
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,930
How is it? It's edible, isn't it?

44
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,760
Do you think I'm eating it because it's good?

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,060
I'm forcibly eating it to survive.

46
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,900
Give me some more.

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,500
I have to live a long, long life.

48
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,850
Surprisingly, you're not a picky eater.

49
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,810
I thought you'd be picky about everything since you're from a wealthy family.

50
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,150
I know, right. It's not like I'm Tarzan of the jungle.

51
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,900
In this sort of place.

52
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,940
Eating this sort of stuff.

53
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,390
I have to live a long life. Ugh, it tastes so bad.

54
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,250
Would you like to try this, too?

55
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,440
Why? What is it this time?

56
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,280
Is it a cochlea?

57
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,140
What is this?

58
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,650
Isn't that a fish eyeball?!

59
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,140
It's really chewy.

60
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,760
Should I pull out the other side?

61
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,400
Our CEO

62
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,340
hates skipping meals the most.

63
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,090
So I can drop off food,
(something done in prison)

64
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,990
at least make some rice balls.

65
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,640
He won't die from skipping one meal.

66
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,410
Also, the storage room is full of food.

67
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,930
Then,

68
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,270
lock me in with him.

69
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,560
Why do you want to go in?

70
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,910
Perhaps, do you like our Mi Young?

71
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,710
Ah, I'd rather prefer the oldest sister...

72
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,040
Oh my... me?

73
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,950
That, that... it's not like that.

74
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,160
Aigoo, you frustrating fellow.

75
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,880
We have to lock them up together so they can either become attached or detached,

76
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,320
a decision will be made.

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,800
Looking at him from before,

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,730
I don't think he hates her.

79
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,860
Ah, really. This.

80
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,840
Do you think anyone would like this?

81
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,970
You probably couldn't even give it to someone.

82
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,840
What is this?

83
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,340
Wish Box? What's a Wish Box?

84
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,490
Oh!

85
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,170
No, give it!
-Wait, wait. Let me read it.

86
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,210
It must be something amazing.

87
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,130
No, you can't!

88
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,520
Why?

89
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,480
It won't be interesting.

90
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,020
If it's really not interesting, I'll give it back.

91
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,540
He really can't see it...

92
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,890
Let me read it to see how amazing it is.

93
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,760
I hope my friend can

94
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,380
return the stuff she borrowed.

95
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,610
Why can't you ask your friend to give back the things she borrowed?

96
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,670
Does your friend have something on you?

97
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,910
I feel bad.

98
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,260
Maybe she couldn't give it back because she lost it.

99
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,890
I shouldn't put her in a difficult situation.

100
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,490
And what's this?

101
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,800
If I do an errand, I wish my friends would

102
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,230
tell me "thank you," even just once.

103
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,590
Did you have some sort of trauma when you were little?

104
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,580
This is a serious disease, a disease.

105
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,340
Stop reading them.

106
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,830
I told you they were boring.

107
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,070
One more. Last, last. Last.

108
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,970
I hope Dad

109
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,820
went somewhere nice in Heaven.

110
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,430
When did your father pass away?

111
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,070
He used to go out on boats.

112
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,090
He passed away when I was young.

113
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,700
I missed him so I put this in the Wish Box.

114
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,790
You're similar to me.

115
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,800
When I was young, my father

116
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,970
and mother also passed away from a car accident.

117
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,800
Don't worry too much.

118
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,640
I thought about it and

119
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,310
I think it's only right that I go to the hospital tomorrow.

120
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:12,160
Ah, um...
-You already have a girlfriend that you want to marry.

121
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,640
Realistically, we won't be able to raise this child.

122
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,860
Even if I raise him on my own,

123
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,620
even after you two are married,

124
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,760
you will still be concerned.

125
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:40,670
This baby will become

126
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,270
a burden to you and your wife.

127
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,770
I don't want to give the baby

128
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,250
a life without blessing.

129
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,930
Sorry.

130
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,510
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:20,380
Kim Mi Young...
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,080
No, it's alright.

133
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:27,560
It's my mistake for going to the wrong room.

134
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,130
Tomorrow, let's go to the hospital together.

135
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,980
I won't be able to take responsibility,

136
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,020
but I still don't want to let a girl go through something so hard alone.

137
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,000
I can go alone.

138
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,320
Wait a moment.

139
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,580
Lie here.

140
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,710
Yes.
-Lie down.

141
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,940
Put this on.

142
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,420
I'm ok...

143
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:21,170
And... don't refuse, because I'm going to go to the hospital with you.

144
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,680
I'm not going to let you go by yourself.

145
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,760
Lie down now.

146
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,770
Good night.
-Good night.

147
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,280
Still, I think it is really fascinating that

148
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:58,190
we've met 4 times, and we've slept together 2 of the times.

149
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,080
That connection between people is really

150
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,230
hard to understand.

151
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,110
If we met in a good situation,

152
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,440
I guess we would call it

153
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,860
destiny.

154
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:29,350
♫ Even a bad fate may turn to love. ♫

155
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,640
♫ Shout and call out.♫

156
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,110
♫ I only love you.♫

157
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:44,770
♫ My heart wants you, you who is like fate. ♫

158
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,060
♫ I love you. ♫

159
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,620
Mosquitoes!

160
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,310
I'm going to kill all of you! All the mosquitoes!

161
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,730
Kim Mi Young!

162
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,310
I'm going to the hospital.

163
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,180
You don't have to worry.

164
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,610
I will cheer up.

165
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,940
Kim Mi Young!

166
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,320
I was going to wake you up just now.

167
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,150
Where... where is the hospital?

168
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,390
Obstetrics, obstetrics!

169
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,760
What about obstetrics?

170
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,020
What is this?

171
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,140
That girl! These two were playing with fire.

172
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,420
And now she is going to get an abortion!

173
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,960
Nothing will happen if we go after her right now.

174
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,510
I'm going to break her legs if something were to happen.

175
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,860
So where is this? Quickly! Where?

176
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,740
But I think the first ship has already left. What are we going to do?

177
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,620
What do you mean? We have to make a ship.

178
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,890
We have to make one!

179
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,080
Follow me.

180
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,650
Wake up now!

181
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,920
Why? Why?

182
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,670
What is this? There is nothing here.

183
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,710
Is she answering the call or not?

184
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,620
Why, why, why?

185
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,690
Mi Young isn't picking up.

186
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,680
She must be causing trouble for real.

187
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,350
That girl, seriously...

188
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,480
Are we really going to have to make a ship?

189
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,370
Ship, ship, ship, ship!

190
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,410
Here, here!

191
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,310
Hello? Isn't that President Choi?

192
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,500
We are coming, we are coming.

193
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,910
Nothing is working without me.

194
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,060
I'm coming, coming, just wait a bit.

195
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,190
Hurry up!

196
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,540
Obstetrics

197
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,110
Okay,

198
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,700
I made the right decision.

199
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,590
Is it done yet? How much longer do I have to wait?

200
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,600
I told you, wait a little longer.

201
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,510
We are on a rotation right now.

202
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,440
Ok. Give me a notice when it is finished.

203
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,040
Hello,

204
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,740
I came for a surgery.

205
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,330
I came for a surgery.

206
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,240
I can't hear you. What did you come here for again?

207
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,250
That, that, that surgery.

208
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,170
Oh, you are

209
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,440
the person from the church.

210
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,240
Don't you remember?

211
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,920
Oh, Priest.

212
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,110
Hello.

213
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,480
Wait.

214
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,530
From now on, how are we going to find her?

215
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,010
You said that there are three hospitals here in total, right?

216
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,590
One on the three way road, one next to the market, and one downtown.

217
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,350
We need to break into groups to find her.

218
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,040
Me and Chief Secretary Tak.

219
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,240
Mi Young's mother with the sisters.

220
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,350
Okay, okay.

221
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,710
And you two, since you guys are always scheming things together.

222
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,710
Hamo-hamo~~

223
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,470
We will go from the farthest.

224
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,500
If someone finds her, call everyone, ok?

225
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,820
Let's hurry up!

226
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,950
Hurry and find her.

227
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,940
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,550
Every time I see you, I tell you horrible things.

229
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,890
There is nothing to be sorry about.

230
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,010
The only thing I did was listen to you.

231
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,470
You are the one who is going through a hard time.

232
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,770
But how come you are here, Priest?

233
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,920
I heard that the person I wanted to meet is here,

234
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,220
but it is more nerve wracking than I thought.

235
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,770
I wanted to look good.

236
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,390
You look nice even now.

237
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,880
Have some confidence.

238
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,400
I wanted to cheer you up,

239
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,770
but there is nothing I can tell you except for you to rethink it.

240
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,710
It is something you can't have back even if you regret it later.

241
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,370
Priest,

242
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:25,250
I have a favor to ask you.

243
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,840
Can you pray with me?

244
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,930
Huh? Pray?

245
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,160
To be honest, I'm not...

246
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,680
Well, if I can help you with that.

247
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,270
I get confused sometimes.

248
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,070
Praying is all about the heart, so...

249
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,960
Now, you just need to talk comfortably, like you talked to me before.

250
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,600
Kim Mi Young! Kim Mi Young!

251
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,010
Kim Mi Young!

252
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,150
Please take pity on

253
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,910
the baby that met a

254
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,880
very, very bad mother.

255
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,730
Kim Mi Young!

256
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,800
Please let it go to a wonderful place.

257
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,880
For not being able to protect this baby,

258
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,630
I'm very, very sorry..

259
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,850
I'm sorry. Amen.

260
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,970
Thank you for helping.

261
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,490
I'm relieved that I could help.

262
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,760
I'll see you later.

263
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,090
Yes.

264
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,470
Priest,

265
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,650
don't be nervous and strengthen up.

266
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,480
Strength!

267
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,710
Strength!

268
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,260
♫ When I open my eyes ♫

269
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,750
♫ let me hear it. ♫

270
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,300
♫ the words of "I love you", my melody. ♫

271
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,830
CEO! CEO!

272
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,300
CEO!

273
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,110
Kim Mi Young!

274
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,830
Kim Mi Young. Kim Mi Young.

275
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:15,880
Excuse me. I'm looking for a patient named Kim Mi Young. She has big eyes and pale skin.

276
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,210
One moment please.

277
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,990
Why are you looking for her so hard?

278
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,380
You are going to have the baby?

279
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,380
At any rate, a girl shouldn't come to a place like this alone.

280
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,040
Are you okay? It hurt a lot, didn't it?

281
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,010
You jerk!

282
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,020
I'm really sorry. I was wrong.

283
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,560
I'm really sorry, okay?
-You're really sorry? We're really over.

284
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,380
Yes, I've found her. Kim Mi Young is in consultation right now.

285
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:54,190
You just have to relax. I will take care of everything.

286
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,780
Here. Right here.

287
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,950
Right... here.

288
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,790
You won't be able to see it well because it's still early.

289
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,400
Here, this is the baby right here.

290
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,950
Looking at it right now, the baby is about 0.2 cm.

291
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,080
0.2...

292
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,010
0.2 cm?

293
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:27,220
It's much smaller than you thought.

294
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,540
But the fetus can understand everything the parents say.

295
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,960
Who's there? Who are you?

296
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,660
I am...

297
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,340
I am...

298
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,690
The baby's father.

299
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,850
Ah, yes.

300
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,000
But what is this sound?

301
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,690
The baby's heartbeat.

302
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,410
According to the Mother and Child's Health Act, Article 14,

303
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,730
you and the baby's father are allowing me to conduct an induced abortion operation,

304
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,210
as you were impregnated while you were unconscious due to alcohol or sleeping medication.

305
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,120
Is this correct?

306
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,400
Yes.

307
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,870
Do you agree?

308
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,530
Yes.

309
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,030
This is a consent form for the surgery. You just have to sign it.

310
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,080
This is...

311
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,090
But this is a life form of its own.
This child will become

312
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,870
a burden to you and your future wife.

313
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,390
He's got fingers and toes. He's got everything.
To the baby,

314
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:04,370
I don't want to give him a life without blessings.

315
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:08,700
Oh, peekaboo. Peakboo...

316
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,890
Why are you giving this to me?

317
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,570
What... Where...

318
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,840
Where are you going?!

319
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,790
Don't worry and relax. I'm going to put you
under general anesthesia now.

320
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,870
Wait! Don't! Kim Mi Young, get up!

321
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,870
What are you doing?

322
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,120
I'm sorry. Hurry and take this out.

323
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,200
Take it out.

324
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,910
I'm sorry.

325
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:03,110
After hearing the heartbeat, 9 out of 10 can't go through with the surgery.

326
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,350
What are you planning to do now?

327
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,620
I don't know.

328
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,650
But I don't think this is right.

329
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,840
But what are we going to do?

330
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,080
Mi Young is over there!

331
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,810
Sister-in-law!

332
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,780
You! Do you know what you've done?

333
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,660
Ah wait. Let's talk about this. Do you know how tough it was for her?

334
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,690
Is this something we can solve by talking?
What happened? What about the baby?

335
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,760
The baby...

336
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,740
You! How could you not even stop her? Do you still call yourself a man?

337
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,140
Ah really!
- Oh, it's the Chairwoman's car!

338
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,470
Oh, it's the Chairwoman's car!
- What?

339
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,370
What is this?! What are you?!

340
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,520
Do you know how cruel you are! You murderer!

341
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,980
Listen to me, first!

342
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,570
This grandma of yours... My neck.

343
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,210
Grandma!

344
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,750
Ah, listen to me first, please! Everyone, just listen.

345
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,760
Grandma! Mi Young's mother!
-What?

346
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,900
The baby... The baby!

347
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,950
Is fine. It's fine!

348
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,710
The baby is alright.
- Is that right?

349
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,150
Also, Kim Mi Young,

350
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:56,360
I have made a selfish decision. I hope you will agree to it.

351
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,200
Yes?

352
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,110
I will..

353
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,940
I will...

354
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:11,810
What? "I will," what? Tell us what you are thinking comfortably as if you are at home. "I will," what? What?

355
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,910
We will have this baby.

356
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,550
Chairwoman, Chairwoman.

357
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,070
Aigoo.

358
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:30,240
That means, you will marry our Mi Young?

359
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,780
No, that..!

360
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,740
Why does it become that?

361
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,340
I meant that I will have the baby.

362
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,690
I didn't say anything regarding Kim Mi Young.

363
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,340
Also, I can't marry her.

364
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,310
What? You won't marry her but you want the baby?

365
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:56,130
Do you see our Mi Young as nothing but a surrogate mother?

366
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,110
No, your words are rather harsh. What I mean is...

367
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:05,870
After she gives birth to the baby, I will guarantee a new start to her life with exceptional treatment.

368
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:09,320
Chief Tak. Ah, ow, ow.

369
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,220
Aigoo, what a shameless punk. You want her to be a surrogate...

370
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,530
Hey! Who do you think we are?

371
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,980
Aiyoo. We don't think of you that way.

372
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:25,490
In my eyes, you're our in-laws and Mi Young is my granddaughter-in-law,

373
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:30,180
And I see the baby as my great-grandchild.

374
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,980
I've decided. I will definitely get them married.

375
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,730
Tell me what you think. I heard the blabber that he said, but

376
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,010
you must have something in mind, too.

377
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:49,980
For me, I think it's practically impossible for us to get married.

378
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:55,160
What..? Are you in your right mind?

379
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:01,630
We conceived this baby by mistake, not out of love.

380
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,490
Marriage should happen out of love.

381
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,180
That is exactly what I'm trying to say!

382
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,300
That's what I mean!

383
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,550
Shut up! How dare you..

384
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,450
It's alright.

385
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,220
There's nothing more to say here, especially when the person involved is coming out like this.

386
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,850
End of discussion. Take your irresponsible grandson and leave from here.

387
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,450
I will deal with my own daughter.

388
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,330
Aigoo, aigoo, you can't.

389
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:36,710
Mi Young is now my granddaughter-in-law, too.

390
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,600
Hold on! Sister-in law...

391
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,700
just say you'll get married.

392
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,020
CEO, Chairwoman...

393
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:50,490
Why doesn't my sister-in-law marry your grandson, and we'll become in-laws afterward!

394
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,940
So, why don't you cut our factory some slack?

395
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,430
We'll starve to death without the soap factory.

396
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:02,050
Mi Young, please save us.

397
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:07,020
Mi Young, we beg of you. You just need to make up your mind.

398
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,000
Enough! What kind of embarrassment is this?!

399
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,290
Although we sold our factory and land, we have never sold our souls before!

400
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,110
I won't stand still if you try to cling onto them one more time!

401
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:20,530
President Park, you have a boat at least, so you have something to lean on!

402
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:24,090
But we have nothing if we lose the factory!

403
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,090
Mi Young, please think this through.

404
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,780
Our lives are in your hands.

405
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,140
I told you to stop!  Are you not listening to me, now that the factory is bankrupt?! Is that it?!

406
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,190
Why are you like this so suddenly, President?

407
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,560
We should at least hold on to our pride to live!

408
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,810
STOP!

409
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,110
What are you guys doing with my daughter?!

410
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:50,010
She, as you can see, is not pretty nor does she have a great body.

411
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,830
Then, was she smart?

412
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,890
No, she did poorly in school as well!

413
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,820
Mom, why are you saying such things?

414
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,340
She was always last in math, too.

415
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,110
Even though she's lacking in so much,

416
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:10,190
instead she is also a child that can never be calculative in her head.

417
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:14,100
Even though her room is a mess because she can't throw things away (sentimental),

418
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,550
instead she can't also ever throw away (ignore) a person's feelings!

419
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:23,750
Even though she doesn't listen to her mother when I tell her countless times to please live more shrewdly,

420
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:29,270
she's a child that can never refuse the request of a complete stranger!

421
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,770
But...to our Mi Young, who is like this,

422
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:37,000
how dare you pressure her like this?!

423
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,870
Who are you all?

424
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:43,050
Who are you to tell her what to do?

425
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,060
How dare you ask this so easily?!

426
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,320
Marriage is like an eternal promise.

427
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,430
We don't know each other well enough to make such a commitment.

428
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:40,130
Even if we say that we can have the baby, marriage is a different thing.

429
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,450
Look at you with your senseless talk. Your stomach is so full it's about to burst!

430
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,160
Do you understand what you're saying?

431
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,860
One! You are going to have this baby and give it up to them.

432
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,990
Then you'll become a woman that has a past.

433
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:57,650
Two! You are going to have this baby and raise him/her yourself.

434
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,920
All you are going to be is a single mom.
 -That's right.

435
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,380
You still don't want to get married?

436
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,320
That's true but how bewildered must that other person be?

437
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,480
I don't think it's right to force him like this.

438
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,400
You... you, I want to ask you something.

439
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,390
Are you certain

440
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:23,730
that he pulled you out of the operating room?

441
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,460
Yes.

442
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,780
At least, he has some conscience.

443
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,140
Think through this carefully. It's not like there is no father.

444
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,060
The baby's dad is alive and well. Why in the world would you have this baby as a single mom?

445
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,870
This is your own selfishness. Isn't that right?

446
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,230
Kim Mi Young,

447
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,390
come see me for a moment.

448
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,480
Okay.

449
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:03,740
He's a man. I bet he'll be amazing as a husband if they get married.

450
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:21,130
Do you have no intentions of marrying me at all?

451
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,070
You are a great person, Gun,

452
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:33,360
and I believe you'd be a great dad to the baby.

453
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:38,490
But you have someone you love.

454
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,440
I know how much you love that person.

455
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,760
I don't want to go through with this marriage if it's going to make someone unhappy.

456
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,270
I've already lost

457
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,830
my qualification as a man to Se Ra.

458
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,220
And although it was our mistake,

459
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,170
the fact that the baby in your stomach is our child

460
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,940
will not ever change.

461
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,590
I'm already the bad guy,

462
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,440
but...

463
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,520
I want to be a great dad to the baby.

464
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,010
You mean...

465
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:29,050
Of course, Se Ra is still the only one for me right now,

466
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:34,390
and I can't guarantee how much

467
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:38,020
and when my heart will move towards you,

468
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,260
but I will promise you this one thing.

469
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,000
At least to our baby,

470
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,040
I want to be a great dad.

471
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,280
If you can accept this,

472
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,760
yes,

473
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,550
let's get married.

474
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,760
I, too,

475
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,560
want to be a great mom to this baby.

476
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,870
Yeah.

477
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,840
Help out over here, please!

478
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,900
Hello! 
Are you okay?

479
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,670
Honey! You look so handsome!
 Come over here!

480
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,390
I've always looked like a celebrity.

481
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,800
Please clear this over here!

482
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,460
Mi Sook! You're here! Today you went for a red fashion.

483
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,760
With the elders of both families...

484
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,180
I wonder if she's done getting ready.

485
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,450
Are you ready?

486
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,230
Here.

487
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,960
What is this?

488
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:47,310
Mom, getting married today is a little too fast, don't you think?

489
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:52,010
Then do you want to wait until your belly is as big as a mountain to go then?

490
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:57,600
I know buying things together as newlyweds and going on a honeymoon is part of the fun in getting married,

491
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,170
but what can you do? What's done is already done.

492
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:04,890
They can have the baby, we can reserve a banquet hall

493
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:08,270
and have a stunning wedding one more time!

494
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,370
I felt bad that I wasn't able to prepare a dowry because it was so last minute.

495
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,780
Then why don't we prepare everything then, too?

496
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,750
What dowry?

497
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:20,670
The best dowry has already been prepared right here.

498
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,880
My Gun.

499
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,070
Hello?

500
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,730
Hello? Gun?

501
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:05,130
Are you really Gun? It's you, right?

502
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,160
It's me.

503
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,350
Hold on. Don't hang up, you can't hang up, okay?

504
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,140
Se Ra! Where are you going? We're going to start soon!

505
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,720
Se Ra..

506
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,990
Gun!

507
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,290
I actually have something to say to you..

508
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,630
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you to call?

509
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,590
You wouldn't know.

510
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,620
I didn't know how painful it was to wait like this.

511
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,630
I..

512
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,840
I've wronged you greatly.

513
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,590
Of course you've wronged me.

514
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,980
To be honest, as a human being you've made me wait too long.

515
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,200
Although you had every right to be upset.

516
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,340
But don't do this again, okay?

517
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,540
And about the proposal turning out like that...

518
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,230
I'm sorry once again.

519
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,350
Don't be sorry.

520
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,350
I'm even more sorry.

521
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,560
Then we're calling it even, okay?

522
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,980
We're letting this go completely, okay?

523
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,790
There's no one but you.

524
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:26,050
You called exactly at the right time.

525
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,440
Se Ra, hurry.

526
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,930
It seems like someone's looking for you. Is something going on today?

527
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:36,100
Today's my first performance as the prima ballerina.

528
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,500
The first day I stand on stage.

529
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,630
Oh, I see.

530
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,510
To be honest, I was a bit worried I might mess up because I was so nervous.

531
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:50,330
But now that I've heard your voice, I think I can do well.

532
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,120
Se Ra...

533
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,680
Do well today.

534
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,590
Se Ra, there's no time. Everyone's waiting.

535
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,450
Gun, thank you for calling me.

536
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,060
I love you. I'll call you.

537
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,860
Se...

538
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,010
Se Ra..

539
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,700
Here comes the groom!

540
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,750
Applause!

541
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,340
He's handsome!

542
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,970
Brother-in-law! You look so handsome!

543
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:39,850
Brother-in-law!

544
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,190
He's really handsome.

545
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,460
Here comes the bride!

546
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,300
Pretty! Wow!
 She's so pretty!

547
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,340
She's beautiful.

548
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,310
She's a goddess!

549
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:07,050
Cute! You're really pretty.

550
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,530
Beautiful!

551
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:23,530
Now, the bride and groom will exchange their vows.

552
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:27,290
Do you the bride, Kim Mi Young,

553
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:32,310
promise to take Lee Gun as your lawfully wedded husband,

554
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:36,780
through happiness, sickness, and loneliness,

555
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:41,320
and to love him unconditionally

556
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,460
without change?

557
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:46,980
Yes.

558
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:53,910
Do you, husband, Lee Gun, promise this as well?

559
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,790
Yes.

560
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,020
Come now, come now...

561
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,660
Your voice is too soft!

562
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:15,880
YES!!!!!

563
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:21,150
He's answered 'Yes', everyone you've heard his answer!

564
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,630
Congratulations!

565
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:31,030
Now, there will be the exchange of the rings.

566
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:34,640
This is what your father wore.

567
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:42,130
♬ I had no idea you'd be my life.♬

568
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:53,730
♬ For when I looked into your eyes, I knew someday you'd be my wife.♬

569
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:59,290
♬ I know there's times when I am wrong.♬

570
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:02,990
Applause!

571
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,380
Ring!
- I did well, right?

572
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,120
This is a proposal ring!

573
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,530
It can't be worn by another woman first! It'll bring bad luck!

574
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:27,650
♬ You took my heart so unexpectedly.♬

575
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:32,430
Applause!
♬ I knew that you would be the one.♬

576
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:38,790
♬ I always knew that there was something special about you♬

577
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:44,530
♬ the day that you walked into my life.♬

578
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,100
Why don't you stay here for a couple of nights?

579
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,670
I will take care of all the company matters.

580
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:55,500
No, no. Take him with you.

581
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,510
It's not like he runs a small corner store. He's in charge of a huge enterprise.

582
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:04,120
I understand that much. It was an unexpected marriage, after all.

583
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,240
Son-in-law Lee,

584
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,610
you know what'll happen if you wrong our Mi Young, right?

585
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:20,280
It won't be the rice scoop, but a baseball bat that'll fly your way.

586
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,750
Okay, okay.

587
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:34,130
Then my granddaughter-in-law, you stay here with your mom for a couple of days before you come.

588
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,570
Your mom must be sad to send off her youngest daughter.

589
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:41,440
I will prepare a beautiful newlywed's room in the meantime.

590
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,540
That's alright, right?

591
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,930
Yes, then I will do that.

592
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,820
Okay~

593
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,790
Then..

594
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:51,090
Yes, yes. Have a safe trip back.

595
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:56,350
I'm leaving.

596
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:59,030
You go ahead.

597
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,560
CEO!!!

598
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,680
Oh my.

599
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,340
Aigoo, aigoo...

600
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:11,930
I'm out of breath.

601
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:18,010
CEO, I'm really thankful that you have accepted all the factory workers,

602
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:21,450
so I prepared this amazing gift for you.

603
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,820
I heard the men in your family

604
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,430
are lacking a bit in stamina. So, that's why you're the 9th generation of the only sons.

605
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:31,270
What kind of nonsense are you spouting?! Our family is not just normal.

606
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,860
We're above normal!

607
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:37,880
Then from now on, you will be above normal and become the greatest in Korea!

608
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,280
As long as you have this!

609
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,160
What is this?

610
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,900
Open it when you get to Seoul.

611
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,410
I wasn't going to brag or anything,

612
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:52,080
but I'm the best contributor to this wedding, aren't I?

613
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:57,810
This is our island's finest selection at the same level as our famous soap.

614
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,000
We have developed this ourselves.

615
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,080
That's right. This is what brought

616
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,920
you and our sister-in-law together.
- Hush.

617
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,240
Don't say anymore. Hurry and get on the boat!

618
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,050
The chairwoman is waiting.

619
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:14,820
Where is Chief Secretary Tak? Not taking care of his CEO...

620
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,340
It's strange.

621
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:20,910
I never knew the sea that you look upon from a dock would look so sad.

622
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:25,190
Everything with the word "Jang" added to it is sad.

623
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:30,310
Station (like a bus station), airport, dock,

624
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:33,160
and Chief Secretary Tak.

625
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:38,530
Mi Sook, I don't know when it'll be,

626
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:43,760
but be well until we meet again.

627
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,560
You too, Chief Secretary.

628
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,680
Mi Sook!

629
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,770
Chief Secretary Tak!

630
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:51,110
Yes, Chief Secretary, yes! (I hear you calling my name)

631
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:54,340
Let's go.

632
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,060
What is this?

633
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,160
Just hold it. She wants us to say our goodbyes.

634
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,610
Okay.

635
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,190
Bye!

636
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:03,370
Have a safe trip!

637
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:05,680
Be well, Mi Sook!

638
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:16,840
Brother-in-law! Have a safe trip!

639
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,190
Very good!

640
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:34,640
Kim Hee Won

641
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:39,560
I heard your name was Kim Mi Young when you were little.

642
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,890
Yes, I remember that clearly.

643
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:45,520
My older brother used to call out, "Mi Young, Mi Young."

644
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,590
Do you, by any chance,

645
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:51,880
remember this photo? It was at the zoo.

646
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,300
I can't tell from this picture.

647
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,770
I have a memory of going to the zoo with my older brother.

648
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:07,410
I heard you have a scar from a fire, is it ok for me to see it?

649
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,420
Do you know how you got the scar?

650
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,840
Of course, I think it was when I was 10.

651
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:26,590
The kettle on the heater in the orphanage fell.

652
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:30,750
My sister got the scar when she was 4.

653
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:37,260
I wish you were my brother.

654
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:47,200
Oppa...
- Are you okay?

655
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,850
How is our baby?

656
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:51,580
I'm really sorry.

657
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,260
For not being able to protect this baby,

658
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,780
I'm really, really sorry.

659
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,810
I'm sorry.

660
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:26,700
Star, I can see a star, Chief Secretary Tak.

661
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,030
Your wife is looking at you from there.

662
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,440
Madam, hello.

663
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,920
Hello.
- Hello.

664
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,700
Hello.
- Hello.

665
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,310
CEO,

666
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,510
because it wasn't Miss Se Ra but Mi Young,

667
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:51,290
I was surprised.

668
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:56,040
But I'm glad that the CEO who is 9th generation's only son,

669
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:01,470
got not only a wife, but a child, like a 1+1 deal.

670
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:06,190
It makes me very happy.

671
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,120
Everyone is so happy.

672
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:16,120
My grandma is happy, and Mi Young's mother is happy.

673
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,240
Chief Secretary Tak is happy, too.

674
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,070
But I...

675
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:26,700
I... I can only laugh.

676
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,480
Only laughter...

677
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,790
Hey, but... (suddenly speaking in lower terms)

678
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:35,880
It's not "hey".

679
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,940
I'm sorry. But what about Mrs. Mi Young attracted you?

680
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,640
She is very different from Miss Se Ra.

681
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,020
You really like a wide variety of girls.

682
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,280
Chief Secretary Tak, what do you mean by attracted?

683
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,210
Attracted?

684
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,060
It was a mistake.

685
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:07,440
Aren't you going to open this?

686
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,960
President Park told you to open it when you get to Seoul.

687
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:21,910
Chief Secretary Tak can have it. I hate him so much that I can't stand a word he says.

688
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,290
What is this?

689
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,170
Strength, strength "Joagra".

690
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,160
Really.

691
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,570
Even with one gulp you will become

692
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:38,540
the Superman of the night.
- Superman!

693
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:43,610
You can go around Hong Kong 3 times in one night and 24 hours isn't enough.

694
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:46,410
A super stimulant for

695
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:51,430
those who are afraid of the night.
It says it is a stimulant.

696
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,480
Stimulant?

697
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,400
This is our Island's specialty.

698
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,690
We, two, invented it ourselves!

699
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:09,170
You, and my sister-in-law...

700
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,920
Don't say it.

701
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:16,410
Drink, Drink!
- Health tonic, health tonic.

702
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:19,640
It stimulates me?

703
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,030
Oh, good. Cool~ Cool~

704
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,780
Then...

705
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:33,870
I'm sorry, I fell asleep.

706
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,720
I didn't notice that you came in.

707
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:44,420
So, it was because, because, of this?

708
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:49,660
Then, because of those islanders, I..

709
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:52,080
I got in this mess?
- CEO, what do we do?

710
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,350
Then, this, this, this...

711
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:57,810
I fell in their trap, then?!

712
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:00,150
Does it even make sense?

713
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:03,270
Act all innocent in the front,

714
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:06,380
and in the back, cheat like this?

715
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,030
How?!

716
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:11,240
I cannot forgive this.

717
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,560
I'm never going to forgive this.

718
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:36,530
Chief Secretary Tak!

719
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:38,510
Oh!

720
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:39,870
Why are you here?

721
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,980
What do you mean? I came here to escort you.
Give it to me.

722
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,650
No, it's ok. I'll do it.

723
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:47,610
It is not fine with me.

724
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,300
From now on, you have to be used to this.

725
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,900
Let's go.

726
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,450
Yes.

727
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,250
Is the restaurant doing fine?

728
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:56,980
- Yes, of course.
- And is Miss Mi Sook doing well, too?

729
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,330
- Ah, yes.
- Get in, please.

730
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:01,170
Get in, get in,

731
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,360
Thank you.

732
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,880
Huh!

733
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,860
The CEO is really busy today, so he couldn't come.
Continue on getting in the car.

734
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,270
Yes.

735
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:28,010
I thought it was all my responsibility.

736
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:32,260
"It happened because of my mistake. That's right."

737
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:36,040
"I should take responsibility."

738
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,390
But now,

739
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:43,720
I feel like I've been unfairly cheated.

740
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,650
If it wasn't for that medicine, if only not for that woman,

741
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:51,520
maybe she might be part of the plan...

742
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,730
They must be on the same team, same team.

743
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:57,170
Same team, same team.
- You want to vent your anger on anyone

744
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:01,850
and you feel like you will explode right away if anyone touches you, right?

745
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:04,950
You can't get to sleep?

746
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:09,520
Yes. If I drink like a mad man

747
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,800
and I work out 'till I feel like dying,

748
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,720
I sleep like a dead man, but after exactly 30 minutes,

749
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,960
my eyes open and

750
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,510
my heart...

751
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:24,990
hurts so much and the first thing that comes to my mind is

752
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,410
"I got married!"

753
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:30,540
"I got married"...

754
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,880
I got married.

755
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,340
I got married!!!!!

756
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:41,580
But the thing that makes me so mad is

757
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,760
the fact that,

758
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,760
I need to live my married life

759
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,810
with that snail woman.

760
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,520
What do you mean by "snail"?

761
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,600
You mean the Mud Snail Bride (from Korean folk tale)?

762
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,590
No, no, no not something good like that.

763
00:57:56,590 --> 00:58:00,720
It is about a terrifying snail that lives in Yeoul Island.

764
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,230
Terrifying snail.

765
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:05,070
You are scared of snails? Why?

766
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:07,820
The thing about snails is that

767
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:11,080
they look innocent from the outside,

768
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:15,430
but their suction force is so strong. It's just incredible!

769
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:17,150
If you get sucked by a snail,

770
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:22,010
that terrifying sucking feet,

771
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:28,340
slowly, little-by-little, piece-by-piece,

772
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:31,350
with a giant house on its back,

773
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:32,640
toward the target,

774
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:38,330
slowly, little-by-little, piece-by-piece, getting closer..

775
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:40,980
These...
- Hello.

776
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,600
These are worse then turtles.

777
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,450
But at the end, they acquire it, the victory.

778
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:49,730
They win.

779
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:53,270
But at some point,

780
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:58,520
when I think about that scary snail that will be on top of my head...

781
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:10,420
I... I... I can't do anything but laugh.

782
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:23,610
Fated to Love You
~Preview~

783
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:27,500
Finally, a piece of luck has entered our family.

784
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,000
Do you think that you fit in with this place?

785
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,660
Damn it!

786
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,510
Wait, what are you doing?

787
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:37,290
Although she is armed with a countrified and naive look,

788
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:41,100
she might be a Master of Lies.
