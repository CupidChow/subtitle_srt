00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,130
♫Goodbye my love♫

2
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:53,070
♫I think my heart knows♫

3
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,510
Is it true that you married me under the condition that
♫ almost in my grasp ♫

4
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,750
you'd receive money from me, and give me the child,
♫ This yearning ♫

5
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,460
and we would get divorced?
♫ I cannot hide ♫

6
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,270
Kim Mi Young, the baby that you carry,
♫ inside my heart ♫

7
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:16,420
is it truly my child?
♫ you are there, oh you ♫

8
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,880
You... know me, right?
♫ Although I can't have you ♫

9
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,230
♫ Although I can't touch you ♫

10
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,940
My name is Kim Mi Young.
- Kim Mi Young? Kim Mi Young. Kim Mi Young...
♫ I'm still okay ♫

11
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,930
Did I really propose this to you?
♫ Even if it hurts a lot ♫

12
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,040
In those 3 months that you couldn't remember,
many things happened...
♫ Even if I cry, as long as you are happy ♫

13
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:45,170
Though I can't tell you right now.

14
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:51,940
♫ The more I try to forget, the more I'll long for you ♫

15
00:01:51,940 --> 00:02:00,760
♫ I'll probably cry more than today, like fate ♫

16
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:08,670
♫ The only thing that I will never have again ♫

17
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,130
CEO!

18
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,810
Someone help!!

19
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,570
♫ I wait for you ♫

20
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:30,400
♫ LIke a moment's goodbye ♫

21
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,960
♫ Goodbye my love ♫

22
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,860
Episode 11

23
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,350
Isn't CEO Lee Gun being too much?

24
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,900
How much does he look down on us that he isn't coming nor calling us?

25
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,090
That's right, when we even gave him a chance to redeem himself.
- Let's just get started without him!

26
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,810
-Yes!
-Yes!

27
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,270
Then, now...

28
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,460
We'll start the meeting about Lee Gun's suspension.

29
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,740
Something bad's happened!

30
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,450
My older brother (hyung-nim)...

31
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,760
No..no.. I mean CEO Lee Gun...

32
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,150
has fainted, so he's been taken to the hospital.

33
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,460
What?!
- Does this make sense?
What is he saying?

34
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,530
This is unbelievable, fainting when the dismissal resolution is about to get passed.

35
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,210
But nothing's going to happen to my brother, right?

36
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,860
Gun, it's me.

37
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,460
Oh, Se Ra!

38
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,080
Did you come to your senses?

39
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,670
I was so worried! I thought something terrible happened!

40
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,730
Why?

41
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,810
Here...

42
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,300
Are we in Macau?

43
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,600
What?

44
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,740
Well... I mean I was on my way to board the plane to Macau..

45
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,840
Gun...

46
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,300
Why's your expression like that?

47
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,430
Are you ok?

48
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,730
Yes, obviously I'm fine.

49
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,020
Chief Secretary Tak, what is this?

50
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,030
Boss?
- Yes..

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,890
Do you know how worried I was?

52
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:43,300
I thought my heart would stop!

53
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,530
It hurts.. let go.

54
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,970
What? Did I get into some sort of accident before boarding the plane?

55
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,670
An accident..?

56
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,150
Did I really get into an accident?

57
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,500
My legs!

58
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,280
Why is the CEO like this exactly?

59
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,590
Does Gun have some sort of problem?

60
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,930
This is very obscure.

61
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,330
Secretary Tak, you know that there's a genetic disease in Gun's family, right?

62
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,470
Yes..
- It's called Huntington's Chorea.

63
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,340
One of the effects of it is amnesia/memory loss.

64
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,750
Then... do you mean that

65
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,230
the disease has kicked in already?

66
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,540
You don't have to be that surprised. If the disease had already started,

67
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,280
there would have been symptoms like motor disorders.

68
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,400
But CEO Lee doesn't show any of those symptoms yet.

69
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,110
So, what should we do now?

70
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,620
Forcing him to remember his lost memories can be

71
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,350
bad for him,

72
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,470
so let's wait a few days.

73
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,180
If it happened because of a light shock or stress,

74
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,110
he will be able to regain his memory.

75
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,250
What if... it's because of the disease?

76
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,800
Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's just see how it goes.

77
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,290
Mi Young, slow down. You'll get hurt.

78
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,770
Stay calm.

79
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,300
Where did they all go, leaving a person who isn't even ill in the hospital.

80
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,820
Why is it so hot?

81
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,810
Oh.. it's hot.

82
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,860
Se Ra! Where have you been?

83
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,130
Why don't you ever listen to me? I told you to sit safely in the hospital room, didn't I?

84
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,220
If I stay in that bed while I'm not even sick, I feel like I'll really become sick.

85
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,440
Wait a second.

86
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,040
But Se Ra...

87
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,770
why am I here, instead of in Macau?

88
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,010
That... um.. Gun...

89
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,960
This is a little complicated...

90
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,080
Who made our Se Ra complicated?

91
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,340
I should... just scold that person.

92
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,670
Did you just say 'Our Se Ra'?

93
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,090
Of course, it's 'Our Sera'. What? Are you someone else's?

94
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,970
Hey, Se Ra, what's wrong with you?

95
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,060
Because I like it..

96
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,370
It's just you and me, it's just like before.

97
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,660
Did we ever change then?

98
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,440
Ah... I like this.

99
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,350
Se Ra, should we have some sweet Americanos?

100
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,370
Oh?
- Let's go.

101
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,380
Yeah...

102
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,370
One second.

103
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,380
You...

104
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,670
know me, right?

105
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,430
Yes!

106
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,810
I know you.

107
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,850
The dog-ring incident.

108
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,520
That weird lady in the shopping mall, that made my ring drop into the dog's play area.

109
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,760
So, we meet again here.

110
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,090
This is such a weird coincidence.

111
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,380
Your boyfriend?

112
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,900
Then...

113
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,460
Gun, right now.. he has memory loss.

114
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:44,980
He's been like this since he woke up.

115
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,760
What did Dr. Moon say?

116
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,750
That I have to keep a close eye on him.

117
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,470
He doesn't know the exact cause yet.

118
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,580
How...

119
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,330
How could something like this happen?

120
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,290
I have a favor to ask you.

121
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:09,610
As you saw before, Gun doesn't remember marrying you.

122
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,460
Also, if he's forced to remember or experience any shock,

123
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,420
the doctor said that it would be bad for him.

124
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,510
So,

125
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,030
for starters, you should leave.

126
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,640
You're not uncomfortable anywhere, right?
- Yes.

127
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,630
But.. why is the weather so hot?

128
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,760
It's hot because it's summer.

129
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,650
What are you on about? Summer in May?

130
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,290
But, it's July.

131
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,730
What are you talking about, July? It's May.

132
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,580
How weird you are.

133
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,470
Here you go.

134
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,830
What are these?

135
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,960
These are the things you had on you
when you were brought in.

136
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,460
What is this?

137
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,670
My watch.

138
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,090
Why's there a ring here?

139
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,210
It's not my ring.

140
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,110
Thank you for today.

141
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,780
Mi Young, are you ok?

142
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,490
Yes.. I'm fine.

143
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,570
It's shocking that Lee Gun lost his memory, isn't it?

144
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:56,620
Why does that person, always make it so difficult for you?

145
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,480
No, the difficulties...

146
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,640
Gun has it worse than me.

147
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,820
That person will definitely remember me and Dog Poopie soon.

148
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,280
I trust he will.

149
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,080
I'll leave now. Thanks.

Seeing him in the hospital today,

163
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,840
your dad looked weak today.

164
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,370
Your dad that always protected me.

165
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,640
Our Dog Poopie, too, will pray

166
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,340
for dad's memory to come back, right?

167
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:03,070
Poor girl, all your strength is gone. Look at your skin tone.

168
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,510
Mom! What about me?

169
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,560
I'm totally fine.

170
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,650
I didn't think that guy was like that, but

171
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,050
he keeps disappointing me to no end.

172
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,590
What is it now?

173
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,120
He shouldn't be this way to you, or me.

174
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,500
I was going to turn a blind eye if he came for you crying and bawling.

175
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,300
But he doesn't even come around.

176
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,540
Are a person's affections that quickly forgotten. Aigoo.

177
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,450
Cruel punk.

178
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:39,270
Gun has a reason.

179
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,030
What reason is that?

180
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,860
Has he broken his ankle or something?

181
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,950
That person is hurt...

182
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,230
Hurt? Where?

183
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,300
His heart...

184
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,680
Is his sick heart the problem?!

185
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,590
Take care of your own heart!

186
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,360
I'm so heartbroken.

187
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,580
Mom,

188
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:06,560
he'll definitely recover his memories.

189
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,680
Right?

190
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,400
Mi Young, there's still 10 minutes until your birthday ends.

191
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,980
Even though I wasn't able to say Happy Birthday to you first, I'll be able to be the last person to say it, right?

192
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,810
Happy Birthday, from now on, you'll only have happy days.

193
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,620
Thank you for saying happy birthday.

194
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:08,090
Happy birthday, Gun...

195
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,290
So, after I fainted..

196
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:20,050
That thing that happens frequently in movies and dramas, memory loss, I'm in that state?

197
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,400
Probably. I think you're missing a few months of memory.

198
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,190
It's July right now, so...

199
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,020
It's just 3 months.

200
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,700
I can get all work related information from Chief Secretary Tak.

201
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,550
You can tell me all the personal matters.

202
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,930
Then, did you come to Macau?!

203
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,690
I succeeded in proposing!

204
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,120
Right?

205
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,270
I'm really sorry for making you wait so long.

206
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,790
I'll give up ballet and see only you.

207
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,300
Really? You're serious, right?

208
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,550
Is that the truth?

209
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,560
Se Ra, then..

210
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,940
This, did you give it me?

211
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,170
Just a sec.
- Yeah.

212
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,690
Mom

213
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,330
One second, let me answer the call.
- Okay.

214
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,590
Where the hell are you?

215
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,120
Where are you??

216
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,030
Why can't you answer?

217
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,330
Mom, I'll call you later.

218
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,980
Kang Se Ra! Kang Se Ra!

219
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,390
You need to eat something.

220
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,760
She hasn't eaten anything the whole day.

221
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,380
Gun makes all this trouble and

222
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,340
where is he right now.

223
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,310
Mr. CEO has handled the dismissal matter well and

224
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,420
he's in deep reflection, so

225
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,350
with the burning desire to concentrate on work,

226
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,430
he's in the office, focusing on his work.

227
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,610
Isn't that so, Dr. Octopus? And...

228
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,150
That idiot, is this a time for him to be doing work?

229
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,750
He needs to go to new granddaughter-in-law right now!

230
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,750
I'm at least going to meet with the in-law and give her my apologies.

231
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,760
Apologize and...

232
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,120
Noonim, where do you think you are going in that physical state?

233
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,640
If you don't listen to doctor's orders and go wandering around all over the place, and something goes wrong,

234
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,240
my feelings would be very hurt.

235
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,730
Until I allow you to go outside,

236
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,840
you must definitely stay inside and rest.

237
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,550
You must! You must keep your word.

238
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,070
You must!

239
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,510
You must!

240
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,500
Then.

241
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,740
Is this the best that we can do?

242
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,410
As of now.

243
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,520
If she knows that Gun is sick, she will collapse immediately.

244
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,620
That can't happen...

245
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,040
You told this to Gun, right?

246
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,240
Of course. Let's go.

247
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,380
One second.. Doctor, why are you sweating so much?

248
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,770
Is acting that hard?

249
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,500
I have something to do, so I might come late to the hospital.
I'm sorry.

250
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,970
This pathetic Chief Secretary Tak. Where is he?!!

251
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:03,620
And Dr. Octopus, locking me up in here
when I'm not even that sick...

252
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,170
Perhaps, if it's amnesia,

253
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,990
did the disease kick in...

254
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,000
No, no, no.

255
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,660
He definitely said that there were no signs of it happening.

256
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,870
This darn quack octupus doctor...
Did he shoot ink into me?!!

257
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,720
As of right now...

258
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,770
He really needs psychological stability.

259
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,800
It may be hard.. but you have to endure it.

260
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,870
And you are also pregnant.

261
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,290
If you worry too much, it's not good for the child.

262
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,060
So try to relax.
- Yes.

263
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,150
I'll be careful.

264
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:56,490
To think that the moment he lost his memory is before he met his wife...

265
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,490
Oi, what?

266
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,030
Gun, what are you doing here?

267
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,500
Who said that you can just burst into my office?

268
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,550
Aw, why are you acting so old-fashioned like this between us?

269
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,470
Why are you bursting inside, Dr. Octopus?

270
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,740
What kind of fate is this?

271
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,140
I see you again, Dog Ring.

272
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,740
Hello.

273
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,530
Yes.

274
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,360
Do you know her, too?

275
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,800
I know. I know her. Yes.

276
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,930
But why do you keep appearing in front of my eyes?

277
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:43,020
Was someone you know admitted to this hospital?

278
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,700
Yes. There is.

279
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,180
Who is it?

280
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,810
Yes.. That is...

281
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,070
And what chart is this?

282
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,410
One second... isn't this my chart?!

283
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,970
Dr. Octopus, why are you talking about my chart with this lady here?

284
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,880
Why are you showing my medical records to her?

285
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,740
Isn't that illegal?

286
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,680
It's suspicious.. Tell me!

287
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,770
Quickly tell me.

288
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,670
Ah, this.. Really...

289
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,650
Isn't she your personal secretary?

290
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,840
Your personal secretary.

291
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,870
She is worried about you.

292
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,620
So why are you questioning and overreacting like that?

293
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,830
Yes,

294
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,060
Secretary.

295
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,060
Look here Dog Ring, you...

296
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,560
What is your name?

297
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,820
Kim Mi Young.

298
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,290
Kim Mi Young?

299
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,860
Kim Mi Young.

300
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,540
Kim Mi Young.

301
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,770
It just glides on my mouth.

302
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,140
That's because my name is very common and ordinary.

303
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,140
Look here, the fact that it's common is evidence that there are many people who like that name.

304
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,550
That senseless complex of yours.

305
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,370
Have pride in yourself.

306
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:15,490
The fact that it's common is evidence that there are many people who like that name.

307
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,030
Anyway, so you're saying that you are my personal secretary, right?

308
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,940
Yes.

309
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,470
It's weird.

310
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,430
How did Dog Ring become my personal secretary?

311
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:34,420
So... So... to put it into words,

312
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,700
during that dog-ring incident,

313
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,140
you saw the way I ran and...

314
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,940
Like this...
- Yes.

315
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,160
You were so fast.

316
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,360
You said that you liked it.

317
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,130
Saying that you thought I would accomplish every task very quickly. So you asked me to come for an interview.

318
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,320
So that's how I got appointed as your secretary.

319
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,480
No way.

320
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,150
Really? Real?

321
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,480
It's completely real.

322
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,310
That's a very strange way to hire a secretary.

323
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:18,600
So, I was very flustered thinking if I can be scouted like this.

324
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,790
Where have you been coming back from right now?!

325
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,690
While you are in the hospital, I was making sure that the Chairwoman doesn't find out.

326
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,900
I came after settling this and that for the company.

327
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,530
Oh, Secretary Kim, you were here?

328
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,760
Dr. Octopus told me...

329
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,960
Oh, Chief Secretary Tak, you came.

330
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,720
You're working very hard.

331
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,880
Is she really my personal assistant?

332
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,480
Of course!

333
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,240
We made such a good combination! Isn't it mada...

334
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,100
I adore you, Secretary Kim.

335
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,620
We were really a great combination.

336
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,250
Alright, alright.

337
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:10,810
Anyway next time, I have to choose my secretary with great thoughtfulness.

338
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,090
Ay, go outside, leave.

339
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:17,250
Ah, Secretary Kim, come over here.

340
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,110
Come here!

341
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,190
I said "Come here"!

342
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,980
This, you see...

343
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,760
Do you know what this is?

344
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,370
My girlfriend didn't even give this to me, so why was I carrying it around?

345
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,920
It's mine.

346
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,810
Yours? Why?

347
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,310
Because it's mine.

348
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:47,650
I left it in your care because of some situations.
I'll take it back.

349
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,130
You actually thought I'd give it to you.

350
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,000
How can I trust you?

351
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,820
I won't give this back until my memory returns, okay?

352
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:04,300
But why do we keep getting entangled over a ring?

353
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,120
It's weird.

354
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,110
You were startled, right?

355
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,400
Madam, you must have been surprised.

356
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,900
In one day, to think that you have been degraded from a madam to a secretary...

357
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,000
It's okay.

358
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,470
Right now, it's more important that Gun recovers and gets his memory back.

359
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,240
Well.. CEO...

360
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:39,430
Actually, he insisted he had to celebrate your birthday with you
but fainted on the way.

361
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,810
You, who he risked getting dismissed from his CEO position for,

362
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,640
to think he forgets you like that, ah!

363
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,020
I feel like Gun is like that because of me, so...

364
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,570
my heart hurts.

365
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,390
Don't think like that.

366
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,720
You don't know how he was worried about you.

367
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,740
It's absolutely not because it's your fault.

368
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,530
I definitely requested that from you and you couldn't wait that long?

369
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:15,590
I'm sorry that I couldn't carry through with your request.

370
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,400
But, I can't stay still.

371
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,450
What are you saying?

372
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,040
That person...

373
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,930
is like that because he was coming to meet me.

374
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:31,870
I want to help and protect him until his memory comes back.

375
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,690
I wasn't going to take it this far, but..

376
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,850
are you some kind of great existence to Gun to be acting like this?

377
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,530
I read it in the newspaper.

378
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:46,030
About you and Gun. I heard it was a contract marriage over a child.

379
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,350
So what do you help and wait for?

380
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,230
There is no need for that.

381
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,690
After Gun recovers, isn't the only thing left
between you two, a divorce?

382
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,410
That is...

383
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:03,440
If Gun's memory comes back, we'll know.

384
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,420
Dog Poopie.

385
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:22,030
Earlier, you're not upset that Dad didn't remember you, right?

386
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:27,440
Right now, Dad is a little sick, so...

387
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,750
let's wait just a little bit.

388
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:36,240
At times like this, I'm very reassured because I am with you, Dog Poopie.

389
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,150
Mi Young!

390
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,880
The present that you sent me that day... I really appreciated it.

391
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,640
Thanks to you, I laughed a lot.

392
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,350
You remember the present, but what about the words I said on your birthday?

393
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:59,590
I wish you wouldn't do that anymore.

394
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,600
I can't stand seeing it anymore.

395
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,420
I...

396
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,020
I'm going to show you my courage.

397
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,140
That's because you were worried.

398
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,530
I feel reassured.

399
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:18,540
Having a good person like you beside me.

400
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,700
A good person...

401
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,320
Yes, I am a good person.

402
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,330
How is he doing? Has he gotten some of his memories back?

403
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,380
Not yet.

404
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,620
But, what's really a relief

405
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,030
is that he hasn't forgotten me completely.

406
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,190
He remembers the moment when we first met.

407
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,770
That's interesting.

408
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,010
How you manage to find the one best thing out of this mess.

409
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,250
Mi Young,

410
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:10,010
there's isn't any need to act as if you're alright when you're not.

411
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,360
Yes, I'll do that.

412
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,530
Also, you have a good person.

413
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:20,370
Don't ever forget that you have a good person right here.

414
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:28,660
♬ You took my heart so unexpectedly♬

415
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,410
♬ Who knew that you would be the one♬

416
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:39,610
♬ But I always knew that there was something special about you♬

417
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:45,880
♬ From the day that you walked into my life♬

418
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,080
Mom.

419
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,300
You just notify the ballet company that you're not going back,

420
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,780
and what are you doing here?

421
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,810
I'm not going to do ballet.

422
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,690
What? What are you not going to do?

423
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,590
I'm not going to do ballet anymore. I have something more important than ballet.

424
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,560
You've lost your mind.

425
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,800
I need to leave now. I'm late.

426
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,250
Are you going to that guy who threw you away and married someone else?

427
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,800
Do you think I killed myself to teach you ballet so that you would end up like this?!

428
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,140
Look at yourself. Following a married man around with a lunch pack.

429
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,220
You need to hold on to ballet so that you won't appear so pathetic.

430
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,390
The disease won't possibly kick in at this point, right?

431
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,200
But what if it does...

432
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,450
My grandmother,

433
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,360
Se Ra and Chief Secretary Tak.

434
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,110
Chief Secretary Tak will take care of himself.

435
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,330
But why does it feel like there is someone else?

436
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,830
Snail heart Dog Poopie?

437
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,250
I don't know who that is.

438
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,520
Over here! Over there! More rice over here.

439
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,270
Yes, it's coming.

440
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,390
Yes, CEO.

441
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,220
That...

442
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,330
Secretary Kim?

443
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,920
Wait a moment.

444
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,270
Yes?

445
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,920
Was Snail ♥ Dog Poopie you?

446
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,200
Yes, "Snail?"

447
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,170
I think you saved the name like that because
I have many different nicknames.

448
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,910
But where are you, Kim Mi Young?

449
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:30,050
I'm taking care of work outdoors.

450
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,290
Listen to me carefully. You're busted.

451
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,300
You just got busted playing hooky while the CEO isn't in the office.

452
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,200
Do exactly what I order immediately.

453
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,620
From now within 30 minutes, go to Chief Secretary Tak

454
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,190
and all the papers that I need to sign and

455
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,610
the clothes I need to wear when I'm discharged, bring them to me.

456
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:54,430
Also on your way, a sweet americano with 2 and half shots of syrup and

457
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:59,650
vanilla and chocolate donuts. Buy those also.

458
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,410
Why?

459
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:06,150
Do you have a complaint since I'm making you do a personal errand for me?

460
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,240
That's not possible.

461
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,930
Personal errands are the best of all errands, Mr. CEO.

462
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,890
I'll be right there.

463
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,200
At least she's personable. Not bad. Not bad.

464
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,890
Let's go see Daddy, Dog Poopie.

465
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:33,120
Anyway, shall I see what is going on in the world?

466
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,460
What is this? It looks like something I haven't seen.

467
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,850
Jangin Chemicals' CEO Lee Gun's Contract Marriage Unveiled

468
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:50,030
What?? Does this make any sense?!

469
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,390
Madam!

470
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,180
Hello.

471
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,540
He shouldn't be asking this of you regardless of how confused he might be.

472
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,240
That's alright.

473
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,560
It's an opportunity to see his face. It's good.

474
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,530
I'll call the car, so at least ride that there.

475
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,100
No, that's alright. Thank you, Chief Secretary Tak.

476
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,690
Madam.

477
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,990
This also.

478
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,930
Good bye.

479
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,570
Gu.....

480
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:03,620
CEO, I brought everything you asked for.

481
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,260
Wait here.

482
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,630
Secretary Kim.

483
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,880
Yes?

484
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,400
Secretary Kim.

485
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,980
Yes?

486
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,870
Are you really still my secretary?

487
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:48,680
Gun... I mean,

488
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,850
Mr. CEO.
- Gun.

489
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,560
You must have called me Gun.

490
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,580
Look here, Kim Mi Young,

491
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,280
why did you lie that you're a secretary?

492
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,560
You

493
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,960
are not my secretary.

494
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,200
I'm sorry Gun for deceiving you.

495
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,660
We apparently shocked the world quite a bit just a little ago.

496
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:23,670
How could you bluntly tell me that you were my secretary?

497
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,350
Wow, impressive, Kim Mi Young.

498
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,360
I didn't do it because I wanted to deceive you.

499
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,830
Since you've forgotten your memory,

500
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:40,760
you shouldn't receive too much shock,

501
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,470
Dr. Moon said that out of concern.

502
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,500
The shock must have been extreme.

503
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:54,310
Since I married a woman like you because you were pregnant after us spending one night together.

504
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,530
Everyone is saying that.

505
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,880
Is that the truth?

506
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,190
Yes.

507
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,240
It is the truth.

508
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,150
Was I insane?

509
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,680
How...

510
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,910
could I leave my Se Ra behind and do such a thing with you?

511
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,430
Kim Mi Young,

512
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:22,280
Is it true that you married me

513
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,410
based on condition that

514
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:28,750
you would receive money, give me the baby,
and get divorced?

515
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,470
Did I really suggest such an arrangement?

516
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,410
During the three months

517
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:41,740
that you don't remember, truly many things happened.

518
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,570
I can't tell you now, but

519
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,060
that's how it was.

520
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,800
It's fine, since it's been concluded.

521
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,350
Since we had a contract marriage and

522
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,950
I didn't love you the slightest bit. Right?

523
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,720
Then, that's fine. That's more than enough.

524
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,290
Kim Mi Young?

525
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,080
The baby that you are carrying,

526
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,190
is it truly my child?

527
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,440
Yes.. Dog Poopie...

528
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,250
is your baby.

529
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,610
Dog Poopie.

530
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,030
Madame Wang, I'm home.

531
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,540
Now.. you..

532
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,160
Where on earth did you go?

533
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,540
You should look for Mi Young first!

534
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,960
Why would I even look for her..

535
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,450
What are you doing to me right now?

536
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,040
Our CEO holds his work in very high importance,

537
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,540
so he decided to leave things regarding Madame be for a while.
Isn't that right, CEO?

538
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:24,470
Y..es..yes. It was really important.

539
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:28,130
Bring Mi Young here tomorrow.

540
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,960
Bring back my granddaughter-in-law at any cost.

541
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,420
Otherwise, I won't talk to you anymore.

542
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,830
What's wrong with Madame Wang? What's so important about that tacky woman?

543
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,980
Does she have my weakness?

544
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,790
Come over here.

545
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,260
What are you doing right now?

546
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,000
How dare you touch your CEO's body?

547
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,560
CEO, that was just skinship.. skinship.

548
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,360
And please lower your voice.. down.

549
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,020
If Chairwoman Wang finds out that you've been in an accident and have memory loss, something bad will happen.

550
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:13,290
Even just thinking about what could happen... ugh.

551
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,750
Our Chairwoman Wang doesn't know, right?

552
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,170
Of course she doesn't know!

553
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,900
And, also...

554
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,700
How can you do that to me?

555
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,530
Was it fun to plan to trick me with that woman and pretend that she was my secretary?

556
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:36,430
Then what was I supposed to do? I didn't want your head to be all mixed up after getting shocked.

557
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,490
It was all for your own good. We didn't have a choice.

558
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:45,020
We? Were you guys that close to make me a fool?

559
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,540
Madam was thinking about you...

560
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,810
How dare you.

561
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:54,080
She isn't someone that low.

562
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,510
Don't do something that you'll regret later and calm down.

563
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,040
This really isn't right.

564
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,170
This isn't right. This really isn't right (sounds like Lee Gun).

565
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,080
Don't say Lee Gun on purpose.

566
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,040
Yes. That wasn't my intention.

567
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,050
I hope that your memory comes back

568
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,920
so that Madam will stop being troubled.

569
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,900
She already suffered through a lot. I'm going to leave now.

570
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,900
Oh, right.

571
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,680
You are having morning sickness, so eat in your room.

572
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,080
Don't cause trouble by talking with Madam, no, Chairwoman.

573
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,280
I'll go. Fighting.

574
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,570
What is he saying?

575
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,160
Morning sickness? How can a man have morning sickness?

576
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,310
Is he crazy?

577
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,900
Why is he acting so strange?

578
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:08,220
Who is that woman? How bad must it have been for me to do that?

579
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,790
What...

580
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,100
What happened to me?

581
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:02,170
Hey, hey. Hey! Eat slowly! You're going to get sick.

582
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,700
Are you okay?

583
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,410
Of course. I'm okay. Why would I not be?

584
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,820
That boy is very strong-willed.

585
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,200
After that happened, he stopped contacting with us.

586
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,970
He will come back someday.

587
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:22,150
You know. He isn't someone who will pretend not to know us.

588
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,320
You are going to stop living with him, right?

589
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:30,010
Living with him after what happened is what a fool will do.

590
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:34,090
I will take care of this shop on my own.

591
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:36,910
I have to give back what is his.

592
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,840
I agree with that.

593
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,820
But since we already started, let's earn money and pay him back with interest.

594
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,210
Yeah, Mom. This isn't right.

595
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,750
If you get a divorce with the rich, you get alimony too.

596
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,170
What Mi Ja just said is correct.

597
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,950
If you guys mention alimony in front of me one more time,

598
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:01,470
I'm going to break you guys' legs!

599
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,680
Eat.

600
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,290
CEO.

601
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:16,670
This man.... this man is Daniel Pitt.

602
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:20,990
He is collaborating with our company for the new products.

603
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,910
Secretary Tak, I can hear you.

604
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,870
He is a world re-known designer.

605
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,130
Oh, really?

606
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,610
Perhaps,

607
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,310
didn't we meet in the hospital?

608
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,370
Yes, I went with Mi Young.

609
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,320
Mi Young?

610
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,080
What kind of relationship do you have with her for you guys to be together?

611
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,770
Why are you smiling?

612
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,970
Before, we had a similar conversation over here.

613
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,780
You asked me then.

614
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,850
"What is your main purpose in collaborating with my company?"

615
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:10,110
"Is it because of my wife?" You asked me that.

616
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:15,400
So I answered back like this.

617
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,670
"Yes. It's because of Mi Young."

618
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,600
This should be an enough answer for that question.

619
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,090
Today, we are about to be done with our collaboration. I just came here to say my greetings.

620
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,650
Then, I'll leave now.

621
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,630
Daniel Pitt.

622
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:46,400
There seems to be something more that you want to tell me.

623
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:51,480
I hope that you regain your memory as fast as you can.

624
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,020
If you want to know how good and grateful person Mi Young is.

625
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:58,030
If you are too late,

626
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,740
even that opportunity can disappear.

627
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:24,770
Do you remember any memories?

628
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,760
No, not at all.

629
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,620
Se Ra,

630
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,170
that contract marriage...

631
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:37,370
No, I don't care.

632
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:42,310
Even if you don't regain your memory about that, I don't care.

633
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:46,400
Don't worry too much. Just rest.

634
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,050
Thank you.

635
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,400
Gun, you liked this place, right?

636
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,810
Yes, it's been a while.

637
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:56,150
It's finally out! Snail.

638
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:58,150
Snail?

639
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,590
Snail...

640
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:15,820
There are many things to eat in this world, and I suddenly don't feel like eating snails. Why am I like this?

641
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,850
I used to like eating this.
- It tastes good. It doesn't smell.

642
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,830
Here, try it.

643
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,080
Dad Lee Gun!

644
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,760
Hello, it's been a while.

645
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,090
Do you know me?
- Of course!

646
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:39,490
That "motion" in the prenatal care class.

647
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:44,260
You created that one-man show. How could I forget you?

648
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,050
I went to a prenatal class?

649
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:50,200
Of course, you were famous for being an "overlock Gun".

650
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,130
Anyways, is Mom Kim Mi Young doing fine?

651
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:01,560
Did Kim Mi Young have major plastic surgery?

652
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,600
This isn't what how she looked before.

653
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,150
Unnie (sister)!

654
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,840
Yes.

655
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:10,010
What are you doing here?

656
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,940
Oh my! Hello!

657
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:18,460
This person bought baby products at the store I work in last time.

658
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,480
The VVip customer.

659
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,200
I came to buy baby products?

660
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,200
Yes!

661
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,780
You came in together with your adorable wife.

662
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:34,990
But her size has changed completely.

663
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,950
Se Ra.

664
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,650
What's wrong with the both of you?!

665
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,460
Annoying, looking the same as well.

666
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,160
How could he forget this?
-We do not look alike!

667
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,300
How could he?
- I clearly...

668
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,510
have a mole here.

669
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:55,900
Why do you have to look like me? So upsetting!

670
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,050
Se Ra,

671
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:03,290
sorry..

672
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,280
You're really angry, aren't you?

673
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,110
You saw the way people looked at me, didn't you?

674
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:09,090
Making me feel bad!

675
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:14,020
What did you go around doing?

676
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,810
You said that she was a money digger.

677
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,730
You said it was a contract marriage.

678
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:19,420
Then settle things quickly.

679
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,870
You have the divorce documents and I even came back for you.

680
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:25,870
What's the problem?
-I'm going to settle everything.

681
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,460
But there is a child.

682
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,830
What baby?

683
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:33,570
If this is because of the baby, then you can bring it home when it's born.

684
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,720
I'll even raise the baby like it's mine.

685
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,920
So, get divorced with that woman already.

686
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,310
Give me a bit more time.

687
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:43,070
Why do you need more time?

688
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,910
I even gave up ballet for you.

689
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:48,120
I gave it up for you.

690
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,060
But what are you hesitating for?

691
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:14,400
♬ I like the dazzling sunlight,♬

692
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:19,670
♬ your smile spreads♬

693
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,790
Dog Poopie?

694
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:29,100
♬ My heart is rushing,♬

695
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,470
♬ I laugh like a fool♬

696
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:35,470
Why is this so tacky?

697
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:42,510
♬ I keep thinking of you,♬

698
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:44,990
Prenatal diary?

699
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:51,020
♬ seems like coincidence♬

700
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,490
Hi, Dog Poopie!

701
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:57,590
This is our first time greeting each other, right?

702
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,720
Have you been well today?

703
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,870
I..

704
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:06,050
went to grandmother's house and had a fun time.

705
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,570
Also..

706
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:11,610
it was more fun because I did it together with your dad.

707
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,270
Dog Poopie,

708
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:17,900
I..

709
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,820
want to become a strong mom for you,

710
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,050
but sometimes I get scared.

711
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:30,440
Tomorrow, it's me and your dad's birthday, on the same day.

712
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,820
Interesting, right?

713
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:38,700
At first, I thought that he was a totally different person from me.

714
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,290
But I keep finding more similarities over time.

715
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:43,230
I find it fascinating.

716
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:45,580
I like it a lot.

717
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:48,120
Tomorrow, let the three of us

718
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,440
have a fun day like today.

719
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,760
Dog Poopie,

720
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,660
meeting him was

721
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,580
the best thing that ever happened to me.

722
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,630
♬ I love you, my heart wants you♬

723
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:11,910
♬ Even when you’re by my side, I can’t say these words♬

724
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:16,180
♬ I shout out loud, I only love you♬

725
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,840
♬ I only love you♬

726
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,200
♬ My heart wants you ♬

727
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,780
♬ you who is like destiny♬

728
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,150
Se Ra...

729
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,660
I heard you had a guest so I decided to wait.

730
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,130
What's with your face? Are you hurt?

731
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:51,100
My head just hurts a bit.

732
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,120
It must be because I'm tired.

733
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,360
Then, shall we get off work now?

734
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,520
There are still some things that I need to do, so I'm not sure.

735
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,060
I'll have a look first.

736
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,810
Ok.

737
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:12,520
But Gun, I don't see the pictures of us that used to be on the desk.

738
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,490
Where did they go?

739
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:19,090
I don't know. Are they in the drawer?

740
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,570
Oh! Here they are.

741
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:28,620
Ah, they were there.

742
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,060
What's wrong?

743
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:01,680
What is that? Is it important?

744
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,630
It's a candy that brings love.

745
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:14,370
This.

746
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,670
Wear them.

747
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:25,050
Gun, sorry.

748
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,320
I'm really sorry.

749
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,830
Se Ra...

750
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,260
By any chance, 3 months ago,

751
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,000
did you not come to Macau?

752
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,580
The proposal?

753
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,340
You didn't come to get it.

754
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,120
Gun...

755
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,930
I...

756
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,480
Gun!

757
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,960
Where are you going? Don't go! Please don't go.

758
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,860
Se Ra...

759
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,250
Somehow I...

760
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,440
feel like I lost something very important.

761
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:36,550
This is my present to you.

762
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:41,440
They say that this candy brings love.

763
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:46,780
It was the first time

764
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:51,330
I wanted to be greedy.

765
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:56,970
The nicer you are to me, unknown to me,

766
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:59,350
I became more greedy.

767
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,550
I'm scared...

768
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,840
that...

769
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,220
I won't want to leave you.

770
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:13,040
That if it isn't you,

771
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,550
it can't be anyone else.

772
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:24,060
♫ The more I try to forget, the more I'll long for you ♫

773
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,730
♫ I'll probably cry ♫

774
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,030
I'm Kim Mi Young.
♫ more than today,♫

775
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:29,820
Is it true that
♫ like fate ♫

776
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,690
you married me on the condition that

777
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:35,130
you'll receive money, give me the baby,

778
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:38,850
and get divorced?

779
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,760
Kim Mi Young,

780
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,650
the baby that your carrying

781
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:47,480
is it truly my child?

782
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,860
Snail...

783
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,220
Dog Poopie...

784
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,220
Did I really make you that kind of offer?

785
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,840
During the 3 months that you can't remember,

786
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,200
a lot of things happened.

787
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,290
I can't tell you now, but...

788
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,310
Snail...

789
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,520
Dog Poopie...

790
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:29,230
Snail!

791
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:48,060
Fated To Love You
Preview

792
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:49,960
I remembered..

793
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,890
My snail.

794
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:55,960
A guy who has an unsure future

795
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,080
ought not hold onto a poor woman's life, don't you think?

796
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,440
Forget everything and

797
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,970
what if I say we start over?

798
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:05,960
Please, my baby..

799
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,760
If it hurts this much,

800
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,510
then that should mean we're not destined for each other.
