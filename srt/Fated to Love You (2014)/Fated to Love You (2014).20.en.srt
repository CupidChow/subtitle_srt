1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,760
Final Episode

2
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,680
Tell them to go home.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,550
Chairman.
- It's over.

4
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,160
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,400
Everyone,

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,600
please go back home. As soon as I hear an update,

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,500
I will let you know immediately.

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,870
I am really sorry.

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,250
No. No. We haven't even started the wedding yet.

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,480
Where do you think you are going?

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,740
Gun!

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,110
Aigoo, what happened?

13
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,130
Anyway, we have to have the wedding ceremony fast.

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,530
Aigoo, let's do that. Of course, of course.

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,050
We don't know what other things can happen. Aigoo.

16
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,030
Wait. Wait. Wait.
- Everyone be quiet and...

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,630
we'll begin right away.

18
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,340
Groom! Bride!

19
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,050
Enter!

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,100
I'm here!!

21
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,300
What is this?

22
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,590
I'm not too late, right?
- No, you're not late, lettuce wrap lady.

23
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,250
Aigoo, Mi Young.

24
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,800
Aigoo. Aigoo.
- Mom.

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,870
I'm really thankful.

26
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,810
Lady In-Law.

27
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,300
Aigoo, I apologize.

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,610
Mi Young.

29
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,450
This event is a wedding that is spectacular and

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,250
full of romantic suspense.

31
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,110
Then... can we start the real wedding?

32
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,670
Yes!

33
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:19,500
Bride and groom, for your beautiful...

34
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,540
happiness!

35
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,470
With strength!

36
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,050
Enter!

37
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:41,580
♬ I like the dazzling sunlight, ♬

38
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,120
♬ your smile spreads ♬

39
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,740
♬ My heart is rushing, ♬

40
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,770
The officiant is Mr. Lee Joo Yong, who serves as an advisor

41
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:02,140
at Jangin Chemicals. He's also a distant relative of CEO Lee Gun.

42
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:08,120
Then, we will have the ring exchange and the exchange of vows.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,340
♬ seems like coincidence ♬

44
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,650
I, Lee Gun, will...

45
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,150
I, Kim Mi Young, will...

46
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,290
take Kim Mi Young as my wife.

47
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,910
take Lee Gun as my husband.

48
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,490
And cherish and love each other for the rest of our lives...

49
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,530
until death leaves us apart...

50
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,440
No, even if death separates us,

51
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,350
we swear to be together forever.

52
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:50,940
♬ I stand in place and talk to myself again ♬

53
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:59,610
♬ When I hold out my hand I only love you ♬

54
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:09,920
♬ My heart wants you, you who is like destiny ♬

55
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,950
♬ I love you ♬

56
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,490
It's exactly Jeju island. Exactly Jeju island.

57
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,960
What should we do first?
- Well, just

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,760
eat some local snacks and go up to Halla Mountain

59
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,110
and have some citrus fruit. Then our two days and three nights will disappear in no time, won't they?

60
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,480
Why are you acting like this since earlier?
- Do you know

61
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,820
how thoroughly I planned this honeymoon packed with
things to do for a month?

62
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,370
How can we only have a 3-night honeymoon?

63
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,650
Is giving me time so wasteful to you?

64
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,820
Since I have a new project starting next week, I didn't have too much time.

65
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,360
Can I

66
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,350
really seriously ask you something?

67
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,940
You are not going to ask a childish question like "Do you love me or your work," right?

68
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,030
That won't make any sense.

69
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,020
Look here, Kim Mi Young. It's me. It's me.

70
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,400
The 22nd eldest descendant of Jeonju Lee family
and the only son of the 9th generation,

71
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,490
that's me. I would never ask such a childish and absurd question.

72
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,430
Who do you think I am?

73
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,220
Are you feeling better now?

74
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,300
I didn't feel bad before.

75
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,430
When I am with you Mi Young, I always feel good.

76
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,830
Mi Young, can I show you a really fun thing?
- Okay.

77
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,670
Okay.

78
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,290
Do you know what this is?

79
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,220
A car key.
-Does a car move when you have this or not?

80
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,560
The car moves.
- What if you don't have the key?

81
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,860
Then the car won't move.
- Right?

82
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,740
You are going to see how far I can throw this.

83
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,020
We have to get to the hotel soon.

84
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,980
But you will notice that there are lots of traffic lights.

85
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:25,320
Every time we stop at the traffic light, you have to kiss me. How about it?

86
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,000
But there are so many traffic lights.
- There are a lot of lights.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,220
Because I have this.

88
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,800
Ah! Mi Young!

89
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,340
Come back here! Come on!

90
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,300
A traffic light!

91
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,310
This is nice!

92
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,720
Mi Young, have you driven before?

93
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,940
Yes, I have a license, too.

94
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,160
But it's a closet license.
- No, it's a closet license!!
(never actually operates a car)

95
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,660
I got my license seven years ago.
- 7 years?!!

96
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,840
How do you drive now? Look forward!

97
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,600
Are you excited?
- Yes, yes. I am!

98
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,660
Mi Young, you're driving way too fast.
Slow down!

99
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,160
I just thought of something since we are like this.

100
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,390
There's a good thing about you driving the car.

101
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,430
What is it?
- I can kiss you anytime.

102
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,320
Gun!
♬ A love story like ♬

103
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,340
♬ the movies ♬
Don't stand up in the car.

104
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,760
Agent Dragon, the name of today's mission is...

105
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,820
"Revival Macao."

106
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,430
We came to Jeju Island because of Chairman's orders,

107
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,410
to do this operation without any mistakes.

108
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,730
Do you follow up to this point?

109
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,440
Yes, Chief Tak.

110
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,260
I mean, Agent Tak.

111
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,170
But...

112
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,120
I have a question.

113
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,170
Ask now.
- Why is the name of the operation

114
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,790
called 'Revival Macao'?

115
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,090
That's because...

116
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,600
Do you remember what happened to the CEO,

117
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,930
three years ago in Macao?

118
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,640
Ahh!

119
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,560
They met in Macao for the first time, and spent the night together,

120
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,410
and ended up...
- That's right!

121
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,170
On this honeymoon, the Chairwoman wants that to happen again.
-But...

122
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,650
Hyung and his wife...

123
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,110
I mean the snail couple. They don't need our help, they're already in love.

124
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,450
Why do we need to do this?
- It all began that day.

125
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,860
Lee Gun... No,

126
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,790
the Snail's husband greatly provoked the Chairwoman.

127
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,290
Gun, you know...

128
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,800
what you should do on this honeymoon with Mi Young, right?
- Know what?

129
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,390
Do it like you did before, and do it all at once.

130
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,220
You'll hand over a grandchild in my hands after 10 months, okay?

131
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,950
Not after ten months. It can't happen.

132
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,030
Why not?

133
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:40,410
I thought about it and realized my Snail and I have
never really enjoyed the time together as newlyweds.

134
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,320
So for about 6 months, I'm going to enjoy sweet time with her as newlyweds as if we're swimming in sugar water.

135
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,960
What? What, what? 6 months?!!!

136
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,840
No, never.

137
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,520
Even 6 days is too much.
- I'm going to enjoy sweet time, no matter what!

138
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,500
That's right, I'm all for a sweet time as newlyweds!

139
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,440
But the completion of such sweetness is ultimately

140
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,330
that, isn't it?

141
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,690
What is that?!

142
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,950
Then about 3 months?

143
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,450
No, no, no. I don't want to.

144
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,620
I'm going to have a fun honeymoon with my Snail.

145
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,230
Why would he say such reckless words?

146
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,140
The Chairwoman's long waited dream is the propagation of the species...

147
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,420
No, having an heir,

148
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,680
so she decided it's an emergency and called upon me.

149
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,910
That's why she sent me on this special mission.

150
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,820
Re-enact the glory of the past Macau event.

151
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,970
So the operation name is...

152
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,500
Revival Macao!

153
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,240
2006

154
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,130
Mi Young, what are you doing?

155
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,440
This is room 2006 for sure.

156
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,230
We can't let it roll around or flip over.

157
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,200
What if someone misunderstands and comes in just like in Macau?

158
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,190
Check carefully.

159
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:12,070
It's good.
An ant won't even be able to bother us tonight.

160
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,930
2009

161
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,290
What is it?

162
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,370
What? Oh, I'm going in. I'm going in.

163
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,160
2009

164
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,710
It's amazing.

165
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,660
It's nothing. What's heavy?

166
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,660
Thank you.

167
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,750
It looks alright.

168
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,310
Let's see.

169
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,300
Gun!

170
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,510
You can see the ocean from here!

171
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,050
Why are you suddenly...

172
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,140
Mi Young, you only see the ocean.

173
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,460
And you can't see me?

174
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,130
Huh?
- Here, the two of us.

175
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,510
The two of us.

176
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,000
Gu-Gun!

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,400
What?

178
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,910
The sun hasn't even set yet.

179
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,980
Oh, the sun. Right.

180
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,370
♬ Let's leave, the two of us ♬

181
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,180
♬ Abandon everything ♬

182
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:55,310
When I was young, on days when my dad didn't go out to the sea,

183
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,560
I would sometimes dance with him like this with music on.

184
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,060
Really?
- While he was calling Princess Mi Young.

185
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,390
Princess Mi Young.

186
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,090
But when you usually hear those words,

187
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,630
you should feel as if you really became a princess

188
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:19,460
and think you'll meet a really cool prince one day.

189
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,650
But while I was thinking about those thoughts, I always gave up on it.

190
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,060
Why?
- I felt a princess and I didn't fit together.

191
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,690
More like a maid type.

192
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,450
Who says you, my Mi Young, are a maid?

193
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,730
My Kim Mi Young is a princess.

194
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:44,210
A very pretty and kind princess

195
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,520
who opened up the locked up Lee Gun Prince's heart.

196
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,330
I'll keep that in mind, Prince Lee Gun.

197
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,910
Aigoo. They're so happy.

198
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,680
I can't watch because I'm getting goosebumps.

199
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,520
Oh, so cheesy. So cheesy.

200
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,580
It's so cheesy I can't watch.

201
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,410
Did you make sure to get the hotel's help on music and lighting?

202
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,350
Yes, I surely prepared it.

203
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,620
Great.

204
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,750
And the moment they drink the cocktail...

205
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,740
To Secretary Tak, did you surely pass over our Yeoul-do's special item?

206
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,820
Of course! I wrapped it tightly and gave it to him.

207
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,410
What a waste. We should have followed them and created a Macau revival.

208
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,230
That's right.
- In Macau, we did hamo hamo.

209
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,780
Hamo Hamo.
- Hamo Hamo.

210
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,270
It was great.
- You're right.

211
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,160
I'll order this.

212
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,240
You don't know why the cocktail is coming out, right?

213
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,940
Yes.

214
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,440
The cocktails are supposed to come out first when you go to places like that.

215
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,020
At places like that...

216
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,310
Mi Young.
- Yes.

217
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,200
Today is our actual first night together.

218
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,020
It is.
- You don't remember anything from Macau.

219
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,610
Yes. I don't remember anything.

220
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,330
So,

221
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,020
today we need to keep our heads on straight.

222
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,040
Meticulously.
- Meticulously.

223
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,140
Meticulously.

224
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,900
Oh, wait.

225
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,920
Let's have a love shot.

226
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,630
Love shot...?

227
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,630
There's people watching.

228
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,630
Last time, you did a love shot

229
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,960
with Daniel... holding each other.

230
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,790
You... Were you then...

231
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,970
You even went there to spy on me?

232
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,770
Who says I spied on you?

233
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,210
It was just a coincidence. I coincidentally saw it.

234
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,780
That's a bit harsh. How could you follow someone around?

235
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,520
Then you did a background check on me?

236
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,020
Since when did you do a background check?

237
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,330
No, it wasn't a background check.

238
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,860
I'm not allowed to have even that amount of interest when I like you?

239
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,930
Why would you call that a background check?

240
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,140
No, but at that time...

241
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,640
Give me another shot please.

242
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,620
Me, too.

243
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,610
Anyways,

244
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,390
mission, clear!

245
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:13,860
Kim Mi Young, this is alcohol.
What woman drinks so much?

246
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,660
This, this is just a cocktail.

247
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:22,160
And there is no law about women drinking well.

248
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,550
Were you always so rigid, Gun?

249
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:29,590
I said it for your own good.
Why are you getting mad?

250
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,390
My own...

251
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,530
I want to leave.

252
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,080
Go then. Go.

253
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,860
Either way you go up, we're going to meet at the same place. Sweetly.

254
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,840
What is this familiar taste?

255
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,210
Why do I feel so dizzy?

256
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,420
Gun, I'm dizzy.

257
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,740
That's right.

258
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,010
We had a love fight.

259
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,910
Gun.

260
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,700
It's a mountain, mountain.

261
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,080
This is also a mountain, mountain!

262
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,210
A mountain, mountain.

263
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,340
Ah~haha

264
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Why do I feel like I've had 'deja vu' all day long today?

265
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,980
Why is the door not opening?

266
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,130
This is Room 2006.

267
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,600
That's not it.

268
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,210
It's room 2006.

269
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,540
It's room 2006!
- So why can't I open it?

270
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,380
Open sesame!
- No, no, no!

271
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,690
No, no, no!

272
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,900
No, no.

273
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,320
Nine! It's nine!

274
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,090
Nine!
- Is it nine?

275
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,610
Room 2006 is over there.

276
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,420
Here's 6.
- Over there!

277
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:14,150
Here. Here.
- It is 2006.

278
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,360
What?
- Oh!

279
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,140
Are you the mountain hikers? Mountain hikers!

280
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,620
The mountain! It's the mountain.

281
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,230
Go in! Go in!

282
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,620
Please go in!

283
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,990
Our mission is finally over.

284
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,840
Finally, it's time for Grandmother's dream to come true!

285
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,390
Hyung, I wish you the best.

286
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,190
Where's my Snail?

287
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:48,080
Honey, Father-in-law...

288
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,430
What our Gun said about playing sweet newlyweds...

289
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,430
never mind such nonsense.

290
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,590
The purpose of this trip is just for one thing.

291
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,430
Two go on a trip, but three should come back.

292
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,810
Give him some power, please!

293
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,940
Please, you got it, right?

294
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,890
Yong's da... No, Gun's dad.

295
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:15,210
I have nothing more to add,

296
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,240
while you're at it, let it be twins.

297
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,160
They have the same birthday and get morning sickness together,

298
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,630
so let's make it consistent, hmm?

299
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,430
You're actually good.

300
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,260
Mother, did you just compliment me?

301
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,340
Well, it wasn't a curse.

302
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,900
Tonight, for our Gun and Mi Young,

303
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,170
please gather up all the energy and...

304
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,610
Fighting!

305
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,670
Rice! Rice, rice, rice, rice, rice!

306
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,740
♬ Did one night pass? ♬

307
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:18,420
♬ Spin, Wheel. ♬ 
Barley.

308
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,590
♬ Even a burning candle looks lonely tonight ♬ 
Rice, rice, rice!

309
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,350
Barley!

310
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:31,690
♬ The spinning wheel ♬

311
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,920
Aye! What's this?

312
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,460
What happened?

313
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,560
I don't know either. Why are we like this?

314
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,030
Wait, this familiar picture.

315
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,300
Deja Vu?

316
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,770
Macao!
- Macao.

317
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,830
How could this be?! This is insane!

318
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:18,690
I've been waiting for last night for so long with big expectations. This can't be happening.

319
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,870
By the way, did we sleep?

320
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:25,200
We did. Of course, we did.

321
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,080
That't why it's already morning.

322
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,150
The sleep I'm talking about is not that kind of sleeping...

323
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,830
Like you know, that sleeping..

324
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,400
That... I'm going crazy!

325
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,750
I'm going crazy, too. I really don't remember anything.

326
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,610
How could this happen?

327
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:49,540
What nonsense!

328
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,690
On my way to the room after drinking the cocktail,

329
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,100
I was suddenly really dizzy.

330
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,810
After drinking the cocktail on my way to the room,

331
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,930
I was like that, too.

332
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,250
Wait a minute.

333
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,310
No way.

334
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,200
Gun! Why are you doing this?
You don't even know who's in that room.

335
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,230
Just wait. I'm sure those spies are in there hiding.

336
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,210
Open the door.

337
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,990
Open the door before I break it open!

338
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,150
1-2-!

339
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,850
Brother-in-law, Chief Tak.

340
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,370
Hello, Sister-in-law.

341
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,620
CEO... Hi!

342
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:58,750
This is horrendous! Hey, Chief Tak.

343
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,140
I won't forgive either of you.

344
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:07,770
They must have had a reason for it. Stop.
They're grown-ups.

345
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:13,070
Mi Young, you're flawless, but you're just too nice.
That's the problem.

346
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,560
Being a full-grown adult,

347
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,060
how can they do this sort of thing?
Do they have no dignity?

348
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,690
You dare deceive your CEO?!!!

349
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,550
It's because of what you said to Chairwoman Wang.

350
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,440
What did you tell her?

351
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,480
Nothing.

352
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,870
It's all because, you told Grandmother

353
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,350
that you'll raise a child later, because you want to have fun in your newlywed life.

354
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,800
Dragon, I'll tear off your wings!

355
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,980
Did you really say that? Why?

356
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:48,160
It's because we never had time as sweet newlyweds,

357
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,230
so I wanted to live with only both of us together.

358
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,580
Anyway...

359
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,240
I will never forgive either of you.

360
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,270
How dare you ruin the first night of my honeymoon?!

361
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,630
I can't remember anything of our long night!

362
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,920
CEO, you'll spend countless nights with her from now on.

363
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,040
Just the first night...
It isn't a big deal, right?

364
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,290
That's right. A wise answer to a foolish question, Chief Tak.

365
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,220
What are these people saying?!
- Calm down!

366
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,200
Chief, you can't do that! Brother-in-law!

367
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,510
Answer me!

368
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,200
Calm down! Calm down!

369
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,420
Daniel Pitt?

370
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,340
Yes, I am Daniel.

371
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,330
Thank you for coming out here despite the sudden call.

372
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,710
You said you had something to say regarding Se Ra.

373
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,100
What is it?

374
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,730
This picture is...

375
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:16,260
Can you recognize who this little girl is?

376
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,890
Please tell me. I beg you.

377
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,970
You're right.

378
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,220
It's my Se Ra.

379
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,480
Mom.

380
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,250
Se Ra.

381
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,210
Why are you crying?

382
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:03,770
Are you crying because you're sad that you're not my biological daughter?

383
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:08,390
Even so, I hoped I was your biological daughter.

384
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,950
It's true that I brought you from the orphanage.

385
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,740
What's wrong with that?

386
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,740
I did my best raising you.

387
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,330
I never neglected you.

388
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,450
So why are you pitiful?

389
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,900
Don't pity yourself.

390
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,660
That will help you be happier.

391
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,490
Mom.
- That's right.

392
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,350
I am your mom.

393
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,270
And you are my daughter.

394
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,270
Am I not fit to be your mother if I didn't go through the pain to give you birth?

395
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,060
Thank you, Mom.

396
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,880
For saying it like that.

397
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:09,940
This work is really powerful, and...

398
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,850
leaves a definite impression.

399
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,770
The person who did this even said he won't be able to do this again.

400
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,970
It's his masterpiece.

401
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,370
To say that means he put his everything into it. I'm jealous.

402
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,970
You can also do it.

403
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:36,550
Oh, actually my wife is also a very famous artist.

404
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,150
She's shy to say it herself.

405
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:44,700
From Paris, France, do you know Ellie Kim?

406
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,060
You're the Artist Ellie Kim?

407
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,020
She's really the artist.
- Oh, my. I'm really a fan.

408
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,660
Please give me a autograph. Of course.

409
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,240
Thank you.

410
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,230
Look at those stars.

411
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,280
Wow. They're really sparkling.

412
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,190
We did great to come to Jeju Island. We even get to see this.

413
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,810
If I listen to your words well,

414
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,790
I think we'll only be filled with good events.

415
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,910
If that's true,

416
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:31,520
then I think it all began the moment you called me the goddess of fortune in Macao.

417
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,340
I think our fate began

418
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,130
when we both started

419
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:43,080
running for the ring.

420
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,320
The ring!

421
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,450
I wish it really was that.

422
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,600
The thing called fate,

423
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,520
I thought it would be something special, but

424
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,160
I don't think it is.

425
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,490
Right now, the person in front of my eyes...

426
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,420
Everything will be fine if that one person is there.

427
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:17,140
The feeling of not even being able to imagine anybody but that one person,

428
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:21,410
I think that feeling is fate.

429
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:28,850
I'm okay even if we aren't fate.

430
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:35,130
Because I'll love you like you're my fate.

431
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,330
Mi Young,

432
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:52,450
as we live together,

433
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,300
later, because of me,

434
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:01,160
because of my problems,

435
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,940
a really difficult and sad day may come.

436
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,550
Gun,

437
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,020
don't be afraid.

438
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:25,250
Every day and every moment, let's do our best to love each other.

439
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,890
Let's also try our best to be happy.

440
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:38,140
I'll give an oath to those stars that you like so much.

441
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:42,620
Until the day those stars disappear,

442
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:50,560
every day, like you're my fate, I'll love you.

443
00:35:54,510 --> 00:36:01,470
Until the day those stars disappear,

444
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:08,700
every day, like you're my fate, I'll love you.

445
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,260
Let's do that.

446
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:16,140
Mi Young.

447
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,550
Mi Young.

448
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:27,330
Ahh...This is great.

449
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,550
Mi Young,

450
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:53,910
thank you for staying next to me.

451
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:59,710
I'm very happy to be next to you.

452
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:07,230
I really love you a lot.

453
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,450
I also... love you.

454
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:22,350
♬ Don’t go away
When the long night passes and sun shines ♬

455
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:28,030
♬ I hope my warmth from my fingertips reaches you ♬

456
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:34,800
♬ My everything, my destiny ♬

457
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,060
♬ My heart keeps going to you ♬

458
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:47,850
♬ When I open my eyes, let me hear it ♬

459
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:54,700
♬ Let me hear you saying I love you
Sweet melody ♬

460
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,370
♬ I’m in love with you, ♬

461
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:01,280
♬ I’ve never felt this way ♬

462
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:10,210
♬ Do you know about my love? ♬

463
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:16,890
♬ You’ll stay in my heart, forever more ♬

464
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:25,010
♬ Let me hear you saying I love you
Sweet melody ♬

465
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,050
Oh, what did they say? What did they say happened?

466
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,480
What did they say? Did they say it's correct?

467
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,220
I... have twins.

468
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,000
Twins?!

469
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,090
They are really... really twins!

470
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,410
What do we do?

471
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,560
What do you mean what do we do?

472
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,060
What a cheerful surprise!

473
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:07,470
My Gun did it in one try again. Two strikes!

474
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,100
Aigoo.

475
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,370
Aigoo.

476
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:16,270
Aigoo.

477
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,590
But, wait.

478
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:23,490
It's great, but our new honeymoon life is over?

479
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:27,340
You took away my sweet honeymoon time!

480
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,230
You took it.

481
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,880
Hurry up and return it.

482
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,520
Aigoo.
- Ah, I don't care.

483
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,510
Sorry.

484
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,550
Who is it?

485
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,910
If you feel like eating ice cream,
come to the park in front of our house.

486
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,340
Your Oppa.

487
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,920
You called really fast. Within just a month.

488
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,420
It took some time.

489
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,320
From here on, we should be a brother and a younger sister.

490
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,430
I thought that both of us needed some time
to take care of our feelings.

491
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,940
Thank you for waiting and giving me time.

492
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,620
Because of you, I've become more at ease now.

493
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,440
By the way, who is that woman?

494
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,340
How is she? She's my younger sister. She's pretty, right?

495
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,830
Your sister seems to be a bit pretty.

496
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:14,260
Well, as you can see (me), my family does have good looks.

497
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:25,360
But.. where did your sister go that you're drawing her alone?

498
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,780
I,

499
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:42,650
while buying ice cream, lost her.

500
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,430
It's your fault then.

501
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:56,660
You should have come earlier.
Your sister must have waited so long.

502
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,800
Mi Young!

503
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,340
That's what I'm saying.

504
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:15,540
If only my legs then were as long as what they are now,
I could have run faster then.

505
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,860
Then I wouldn't have lost my pretty sister.

506
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,810
I'm so sorry it kills me.

507
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:29,020
Then why don't you just go there now?

508
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,130
I'm curious as to how fast you've become.

509
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:51,230
I will never go by myself again.

510
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:55,020
I have to go around while holding our Mi Young's hand.

511
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:02,030
Oppa...

512
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,660
3 Years Later

513
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,850
Dr. Octopus, so what does that mean?

514
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:33,030
How do you think it is?
- Quickly! Just tell me!

515
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,350
It's clean, as always.
- Is that true?

516
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:40,500
Seeing that there have been no signs or symptoms by your current age,

517
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:46,410
I think you can live the rest of your life
comfortably and happily.

518
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,400
I understand.

519
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,430
You can go now since I have an appointment.

520
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:57,360
Wait a second, Dr. Octopus.

521
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:03,930
By any chance, are you going to my mother-in-law to spout ink at her?

522
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,530
Well, that...

523
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,220
I have to eat dinner and...

524
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,220
I'm in a good mood, so

525
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,750
I will give you a really special tip. Come here!

526
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,250
Doctor, you also came today.

527
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,550
I'm sorry to come at this late hour.

528
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,580
I came to eat dinner.

529
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:40,790
It's a given to eat at a restaurant, right?

530
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,610
Please, have a seat.

531
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,260
Yes.

532
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:57,490
I will give you the rice wrap shortly.

533
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,460
Rice Wrap Lady.

534
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,790
What did you just say?

535
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:12,760
Gun gave me a tip.

536
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,840
He said when you're called that, you kind of like it.

537
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:23,610
'Ssambap' lady sounds way better, than 'Ssambap' grandma.

538
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,250
Rice Wrap Lady.

539
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,040
Well...

540
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,210
What is it?

541
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:38,480
Tomorrow, do you want to go and watch a movie with me?

542
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,130
Movie?

543
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,840
Tomorrow, I can't.

544
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:52,660
I'm sorry for asking that.

545
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,680
I was only going to eat and then leave.
I'm sorry.

546
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,230
I can't... Can... I can.

547
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:04,470
I can.
- Really?

548
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,950
You're really a miracle lady that makes the impossible work.

549
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,900
Wow! Our mother-in-law's flirting techniques are awesome.

550
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,850
Hamo! Dr. Octopus is hopelessly trapped.

551
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:29,490
But when did those two become like that?

552
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,600
Aigoo.

553
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,220
At that age, it's not like they're looking for their destined match.

554
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,390
Isn't it too late to find love?

555
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:49,190
Why does age matter? If A, who used to like B,

556
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:53,820
gets nicely involved with C, who used to like A,
that's love and fate.

557
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,580
What? What? Is there anything special about that?

558
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:59,410
By the way, why are you not seeing Secretary Tak these days?

559
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:03,040
That person is very busy.

560
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,350
Just a second!

561
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,270
Bravo!

562
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,850
Your dance was great.

563
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,160
Really?

564
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:44,140
Thank you. I think my skills are getting better
thanks to your compliment.

565
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,330
If you have lessons from Charles for one hour,

566
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:53,820
I think you'll be able to go and represent our dance class in next year's dance competition.

567
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:57,940
Really? The legendary dancer?!!

568
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,780
That's right! The legendary dancer! Leg-dan.

569
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,430
Really? Leg-dan?!!

570
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:03,390
That's why I invited the legendary dancer here today.

571
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:06,380
Oh, my what should I do? Really? What to do?

572
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:11,370
Come out. Legendary dancer!

573
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,020
Is that really him?

574
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:25,270
Wow! This is an honor! I really like and respect him.

575
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,120
Teacher Leg-dan. Are you really Teacher Charles?

576
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,560
I really love and respect you...

577
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,570
Lawyer Hong!

578
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:36,210
Here, people call me Charles.

579
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,660
Call me Charles.

580
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,920
Call me Charles? What happened here?

581
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,130
Living as a lawyer is very hard and boring.

582
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:49,990
You need to have an exciting hobby at least.

583
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:56,830
Now... let's put aside using petty human language for a bit
and start talking through dance.

584
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:59,380
I'll learn from your great expertise!

585
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,870
Alright.

586
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,530
Teacher, please accept my feelings!

587
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:28,490
Hey, Moon Woo Bin, you can't do this to your teacher.

588
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:32,350
Why? Why can't I? Is there anything impossible in this world?

589
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:37,080
Look at this. What kind of situation is this right now?

590
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,670
Oppa!
- Aigoo.

591
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,340
Did you come back from New York today?
- Yeah.

592
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,370
What's with this kid.
- Should I tell you about my popularity with my own mouth?

593
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,110
Aigoo. Really...

594
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:50,670
Ahjussi, who are you? What's your relationship with our teacher?

595
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:55,440
I'm the person who loves your teacher the most in this world.

596
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,750
Is it true, Teacher?

597
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,850
That's right.

598
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:00,820
He's also the person I love the most in this whole world.

599
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,630
Teacher, even so, there are no words called "give up" (pogi) in my dictionary.

600
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:08,050
Those words are only for when you're buying cabbages!
('Pogi' is used when counting napa cabbage)

601
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,870
That is a statement that I heard somewhere.

602
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:18,060
What should I do? Because of me, you might have missed the future match.

603
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:22,060
Kim Tae Woo, instead saying weird things, go date a woman.

604
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,730
Isn't it funny that your sister is the person that you love the most in the world?

605
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,480
Talk about yourself.

606
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,820
Kim Mi Young, who is pretty but useless.

607
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,860
I am telling you once more...

608
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:39,140
I didn't come out here because I wanted to.

609
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:44,240
I came because I feel like I have to show my disapproval once and for all.

610
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,520
Mom,

611
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,100
we are the only two fated for each other. Destiny!

612
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,580
Does destiny feed you dinner?

613
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,780
Yong! Mother!

614
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:09,980
Hello, I am Jun Ji Yun's father.

615
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:19,280
I think that with your daughter...

616
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,510
First, let's order.

617
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:26,370
Right, this restaurant is affiliated to the company I own.

618
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,270
I hope that you like it.

619
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:30,970
Ji Yun, why didn't you tell me?

620
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:36,430
I don't want somebody to like me because of money.

621
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,530
Chairwoman Wang.

622
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,940
Aigoo, hello.

623
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,470
Sit down, sit down.

624
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,700
Aigoo, I didn't know that Ji Yun is your youngest daughter!

625
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,280
Mother, how did you come here?

626
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,010
What do you mean how?

627
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:02,460
This is the meeting of the in-laws for my grandson.
Should the eldest of the house,

628
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,000
just stick her butt at her house?

629
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,320
Grandmother, thank you.

630
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:14,050
It's been a while since I've lived alone, and I'm sick of fighting with Ji Yun.

631
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:17,910
Now, I want to let her do anything that she wants to do.

632
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:18,910
Yes.

633
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:21,570
Of course. We should get them married as soon as possible.

634
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:25,470
They must be desperately impatient around each other.

635
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,300
Here, this is japchae.

636
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:35,840
What is this? Kimbab! And lastly...

637
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,280
And what could this be?

638
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,200
There are so many!
- It was really hard to make these.

639
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,670
Here, Suk and Yoon, let's eat fruits with Mommy.
- Wait a moment. What are you doing right now?

640
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:50,410
I already fed our twins food,

641
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:55,490
fruits, vitamins, and everything, so don't worry about anything

642
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:58,560
and just eat. Take this!

643
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,380
Thank you.

644
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,940
This is Mommy's. This is whose? This is Mi Young's.

645
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:07,740
And who is this? It's Mommy's. All of this is your mother's.

646
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,130
Don't touch the kids. I will take care of them,

647
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,750
so eat all of this here.
- Thank you.

648
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,710
Alright. What do you want to play with Daddy?

649
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:19,150
What shall we do?

650
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:22,420
Should we cook? While the food is cooking,

651
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:28,330
I will do something funny. High five me! High five!

652
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,960
Here, high five!
- That's right!

653
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,760
That time comes back. When we high five, what time comes back?

654
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,710
Story-telling time!

655
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,470
Today, I will tell a story that is the most beautiful

656
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,940
and happy in this world.

657
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,270
Look forward to it, look forward to it!

658
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:51,200
Eat food! Eat now!
- I got it.

659
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:56,270
Here. Princess Snail.

660
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:58,750
Princess Snail.

661
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,920
Here. Your dad is reading. Here, freeze!

662
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,940
Freeze! You guys have to listen to this!

663
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,280
Be quiet and listen.

664
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:16,120
A long, long time ago, there was a princess who lived on a small island.

665
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,920
But that princess was wearing circle glasses. The same ones as your mother!

666
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,090
It's the same as Mommy's!

667
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:28,510
But she was bad at studying; so bad that she'll be the worst in her class in math!

668
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:31,360
She was bad at studying.

669
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,090
She was bad at studying.

670
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,440
What is this?
- She was bad at studying. What is next?

671
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,810
It's so interesting. Let's read the next page!

672
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:47,840
The princess has an illness, in which she can't refuse even a stranger's demands.

673
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:53,040
And second, she can't abandon the heart that she receives from other people.

674
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,920
What are we going to do? She was a strange princess who

675
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,490
has a strange illness in which she doesn't know that she's a princess

676
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:05,290
and thinks that she is a maid.

677
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:09,280
She was a princess.

678
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:15,580
As expected, there was a rude prince that lived in the neighboring land,

679
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:20,040
but that prince

680
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,780
first called that princess "Snail".

681
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:27,890
"Where is Snail? Did you see Snail?" Saying this...

682
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:36,310
Like a snail, the princess crept in slowly

683
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:40,250
and in the end, she took over the prince's heart.

684
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:45,240
One day, the prince became addicted to the princess.

685
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:50,910
And got an illness where he can't live without that princess.

686
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:56,410
People were worried about the prince and felt sympathetic,

687
00:55:56,410 --> 00:56:01,520
but the prince wasn't afraid at all.

688
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,320
Because the princess was near him.

689
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:11,000
As long as the princess is next to him,

690
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,120
as long as she loves the prince,

691
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:20,590
the prince will never be sick again.

692
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,600
The princess and the prince had twins

693
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:33,620
and are living happily ever after. And forever more,

694
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,680
they will

695
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,150
live happily.

696
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,750
Yoon and Suk, be careful!

697
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:49,070
Aigoo!

698
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:51,330
Suk!

699
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,010
Thank you.

700
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:03,550
Mi Young, do you ever regret marrying me?

701
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:07,910
Why would I regret that? When you, Gun,

702
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:10,710
are in front of me right now.

703
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:19,100
Today and the moment right now, thank you for being next to me.

704
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:23,920
For being next to be from back then,

705
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,190
till this moment...

706
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:30,160
Thank you.

707
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,200
I love you, Princess Snail.

708
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,180
I love you, Prince Lee Gun.

709
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:44,200
