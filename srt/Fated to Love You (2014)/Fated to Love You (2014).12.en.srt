1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,010
Episode 12

2
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,720
We came outside.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,230
Ian, were you like that?

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,730
Aigoo, so sleepy.

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,260
You're so sleepy...

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,130
Peek-a-boo!
- Are you awake, Ian?

7
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,150
Ian.

8
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,090
Dr. Octopus.
- Oh! You startled me.

9
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,280
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,140
Tell me truthfully..

11
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,470
Did I get the illness?

12
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,240
I told you to rest.

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,800
You know... me fainting and having memory loss...

14
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,900
does that have something to do with my genetic disease?

15
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,380
I should know the truth, don't you think?!!!

16
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,400
Alright...

17
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,070
Your father, too, when he was around your age...

18
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,500
he showed similar symptoms that you had.

19
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,890
I'm not definitely positive yet.

20
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,960
But it's in the similar order.

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,420
Then..

22
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,460
My father had the illness, too?

23
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,580
Then I...

24
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,730
just like my father, my grandfather

25
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,780
and my great grandfather...

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,730
that's how it's gonna be then.

27
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,370
In my thirties...

28
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,630
Getting ahead of yourself and worrying...

29
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,610
I told you not to do that.

30
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,610
How can I not worry about it?

31
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,430
My grandmother...

32
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,220
our Mi Young and Dog Poopie...

33
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,440
my family, there are people that I have to protect.

34
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,890
How can I not be worried!!

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,130
Thank you, these days I'm out of my senses.

36
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,730
Losing something this important...

37
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,770
CEO Lee Gun... what are you going to do if his memory doesn't return?

38
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,770
I don't want to think negatively.

39
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,050
I'll trust him and wait for him till the end.

40
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,560
CEO!

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,450
The real estate agent brought people who are
interested in buying the cafe.

42
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,770
I'll be there soon, just wait a moment.

43
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,980
Are you not going to run the cafe anymore?

44
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,400
Yes...

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,340
I'm going to France next week.

46
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,930
So suddenly?

47
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,940
I've always been thinking about it.
It's just happening sooner.

48
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,740
Finding my younger sibling, too...

49
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,860
I've lost almost all my hope, so...

50
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,250
Nothing has been impossible for me, but strangely,
things aren't working out well these days.

51
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,930
I'm going to be strong and start anew.

52
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,420
Stay strong. It'll all turn out fine.

53
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,960
Aren't you late? You said you have to go to a parental class.

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,090
I can leave now.

55
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,560
You've all worked really hard.

56
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,920
Today, for our happy families,

57
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,170
this is our last prenatal class.

58
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,670
Thinking of it as the last class, makes me all emotional.

59
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,550
Then, today for the last lesson, we will,

60
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,920
for the soon to be born babies,

61
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,140
write letters of blessing to them.

62
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,030
The messages that you as the mom and dad

63
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,990
want to tell your children.
Write it as beautifully as possible in this letter.

64
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,500
Then, why don't we start as I turn on the music.

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,540
The things you want to say..

66
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,740
The baby will see it once it is bigger, so try your best.

67
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,890
Dog Poopie, it's your dad..

68
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,170
Is it a bit iffy?

69
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,830
Dog Poopie, it's your dad.

70
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,080
Dog Poopie, it's me, Gunnie.

71
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,700
By Lee Gun.

72
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,230
Werid.. weird.. way too weird.

73
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,410
Hello.. continue writing.

74
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,590
Even if there is a problem with my brain, like I've been shot,

75
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,710
would I start the first sentence of the letter for my junior like that?

76
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,720
How are you here?

77
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,350
Now that I know the baby inside you is my junior,

78
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,780
I should fulfill my duty as the dad.

79
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,630
Since you have pretty handwriting,

80
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,690
write down my words.

81
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,230
Letter by letter... very meticulously!

82
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,900
Yes, meticulously.

83
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:22,460
Dog Poopie, the world is very abundant and...

84
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,420
life is... quite beautiful.

85
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,400
N... no, no. Re-start.. re-start.

86
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,690
I should talk realistically.

87
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,190
Life is... quite lonely and...

88
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,470
life is very difficult.

89
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,800
If you don't live long,

90
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,600
fortune and honor is meaningless. Regardless,

91
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,610
try to survive in this world as best as you can.

92
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,330
Try to avoid stress..

93
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,580
Don't over-strain yourself.

94
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,490
If you want to have a healthy body.. then eat it all. All of it.

95
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,190
You have to definitely eat everything.

96
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,700
Be careful of dogs, cars

97
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,230
and be careful of fires.
- Excuse me...

98
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,770
I told you to keep writing.

99
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,910
Write it quickly... or else I'll forget it all.

100
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,590
Aren't these too serious for a letter blessing the baby?

101
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,980
We're writing a letter that should tell him how to live life.

102
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,350
Write it quickly.. while I'm being serious.

103
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,330
Thank you.

104
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,520
I normally really like these types of things..

105
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,010
It smells a lot, doesn't it?

106
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,620
That's why I said that I'd be fine eating it alone.

107
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,510
No, eat a lot.

108
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,230
Why are you smiling?

109
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,740
Just because I like it.

110
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,180
It reminds me of that time we came here.

111
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,050
When we came here before,

112
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,650
you said that it smelt really bad, so

113
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,680
you went crazy stuffing tissues up your nose.

114
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,410
Nonsense.

115
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:32,420
I've never lost my dignity in my whole life.

116
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,780
No way.

117
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,490
You were so scared of the dogs, you ran like a crazy person.

118
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,770
You played well with my mom, you even rapped for her.

119
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,190
You were such a fun person.

120
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,990
You were a really good husband.

121
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,930
You always made me laugh.

122
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,550
I...

123
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,900
never caused you heartache

124
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,350
or made you cry,

125
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,960
not even once?

126
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,210
Yep.. not even once.

127
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,960
Mi Young, you are really too nice, almost to the point that you're an idiot.

128
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,720
You did find it a bit frustrating.

129
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,140
But thanks to you, I went from being 'Post it girl' to 'Bond girl'.

130
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,810
Like the princesses that only appear in movies.

131
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,240
I wore a pretty dress and had pretty makeup on.

132
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,360
Bond girl...

133
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,790
would have looked very pretty.

134
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,500
But, Kim Mi Young,

135
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,560
you can't always have someone by your side.

136
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,870
In the end, you have to make it through on your own.

137
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,710
That's why I'm working hard.

138
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,600
I want to become someone that can give you strength.

139
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,150
So that you'll be able to depend on me,
just as I depended on you.

140
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,870
Just in case your memory returns...

141
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,180
So, if we can be together again...

142
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,700
Your birthday present.

143
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,410
This is what you originally wanted me to make you.

144
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,730
Gunnie cup.

145
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,180
How is it? Looks the same, right?

146
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,240
Would've been nice if your birthday hadn't passed.

147
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:16,180
Instead, I'll make an upgraded version for next year.

148
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,180
Are you ok?

149
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,940
It has a strong taste.

150
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,250
Here you go.

151
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,350
At first when he found out he was... humiliated like he didn't...

152
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,180
he didn't even really want.. to see his family.

153
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,060
I don't want to give up hope, but seeing him...

154
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:58,710
changing and looking at my son and knowing that...
It just kind of... hurts.

155
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:03,300
CEO, these are the files that you have to sign today.

156
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,830
It must be really hard for Madame these days, right?

157
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,730
That's why I brought a plan

158
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,830
that would make her feel better.

159
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,910
Is this something like

160
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,760
setting off fireworks at the Han River, again?

161
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,100
That's right!

162
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,920
It was so hard that day because the fireworks wouldn't go off.

163
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,660
CEO.

164
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,880
CE-

165
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,280
What's wrong with you?

166
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,780
CEO! You've returned?! You've returned, right?

167
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,040
Our CEO!

168
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,980
I better quickly call Madame...
- Stop, stop!

169
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,450
Keep it a secret.. a secret.

170
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,040
Are you going to act like a man with secrets now?
- Secretary Tak.

171
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,110
I think it's my damned genetic disease after all.

172
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,910
So from now, to that nice lady,

173
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,960
I can't even imagine how much pain I will cause her.
I can't even imagine it.

174
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,080
I was about to call you for us to meet. We must have had the same thought.

175
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,930
I was very surprised yesterday because you just left like that.

176
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,710
Se Ra...

177
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,190
Us..

178
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,500
Let's break up..

179
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,800
Why are you being like this?

180
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,520
Sorry, for saying it so suddenly..

181
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,740
It's because of that woman. Kim Mi Young.

182
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,360
No...
- It's true though.
- With her, too...

183
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,620
I'm going to end it.

184
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:29,070
During the 6 years that we've been together... those very precious times...

185
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,320
I'm very sorry for wasting those times, Se Ra.

186
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,410
None of it is your fault. It's all my fault.

187
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,590
So don't be hurt over this, okay?

188
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,730
This is a lie.. right?

189
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,680
It's all because of that person, Kim Mi Young.

190
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,110
If it wasn't for that person, this wouldn't have happened.

191
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,600
I don't want to.

192
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,900
Not seeing you...

193
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,220
I never thought that I would live without seeing you.

194
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,380
France? When are you going to come back?

195
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,910
I don't know. I might not even come back.

196
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:36,120
Thanks to the video that you made for me, I was getting popular in this town.

197
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,090
If you do come back, make sure you call me.

198
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,680
No, thank you, boss! See you later.

199
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,480
Take care.

200
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,930
I'm leaving!
- Take care!
- Are you okay?

201
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,610
Yes..

202
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,600
Are you able to get home?

203
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,890
Well, whatever happens..will happen.

204
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:19,060
Excuse me. Just because you are having a hard and difficult time, don't do things that will hurt other people.

205
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:24,480
You seem to be hurt, too. In those times, you need to be even more rational.

206
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,130
I'm thankful for that advise, but I can't do that.

207
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,750
I already lost as much as I can, and was hurt as much as I can.

208
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,550
To you, this world may seem wonderful and amazing,

209
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:48,410
but for me... there is only one thing that I have left.

210
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,700
Here is the revised divorce agreement.

211
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,040
A - Lee Gun, B - Kim Mi Young.

212
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,650
1. The divorce will happen at the time B wants.

213
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:22,770
A will give B alimony even if B doesn't demand it.

214
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,170
3. As for the child between A and B,

215
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:32,420
until the child becomes an adult,
both parents will raise him/her together.

216
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,270
CEO...

217
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,830
I will say that everything in the old agreement

218
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,270
and the divorce agreement did not exist. Instead,

219
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,470
please draft a new document.
- Yes.

220
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,110
One moment.

221
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,430
Firstly, for the child between Lee Gun and Kim Mi Young,

222
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,880
Kim Mi Young will have

223
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,680
child custody.

224
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,580
Second, after the divorce comes into effect,

225
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,320
Divorce...

226
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,590
Two million dollars will be given to Kim Mi Young as alimony.

227
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,830
Will be given...
- Lastly, third...

228
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,660
If Lee Gun

229
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,550
dies...
 If Lee Gun dies...

230
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:40,140
To Kim Mi Young and her baby, at 50:50 ratio,

231
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,750
all fortune will be inherited.

232
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:51,890
Is this something like your last will?

233
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,900
Let's say it is.

234
00:18:53,900 --> 00:19:01,180
♬ Do you remember that lonely alley ♬

235
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:07,580
♬ I still remember it♬

236
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,070
Did you meet Gun recently?

237
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,420
Yes.. yesterday.

238
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,580
Then, you must have heard about the break up.

239
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,530
What?

240
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:26,790
He told me that he will finish things with you.
Has he not told you yet?

241
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,620
Yes.. not at all.

242
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,590
That doesn't make sense... that person.

243
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,950
Except for that his memories didn't return, he didn't change.

244
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:41,380
Why do you think that he can't remember his own marriage?

245
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:48,600
It's because he wants to forget about it.
He wants to erase it unconsciously.

246
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,580
The divorce agreement between you two was changed by Gun.

247
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,110
-Divorce Agreement-

248
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,940
1. Alimony will be given per discussion with Kim Mi Young.
2. After the divorce, nothing must be said to the media.

249
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,240
What is this?

250
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,080
Since you are so stubborn,

251
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,600
he wants you to hand over the baby, and end it as it is.

252
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,450
Since the baby was needed for his position
within the company anyway.

253
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,010
There is no way.

254
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,030
Dad wouldn't have done that, right, Dog Poopie?

255
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,100
Come to Luna restaurant at Cheondamdong by 8.

256
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,990
I have something to say.

257
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,150
You came?

258
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,760
Yes.

259
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,900
What is with your face?

260
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,870
Are you hurting somewhere?

261
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:30,070
No, I'm alright. It's because I'm tired.

262
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,260
Food? Are you not hungry?

263
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,610
I'm fine without food.

264
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,920
You had something to discuss. Let's do that first.

265
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,500
No matter how hard I look at it, it doesn't suit the atmosphere of our house.

266
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,750
You wanted to see me because of this?

267
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,330
Your role as the daughter-in-law of my household

268
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:40,520
and my wife has ended, as of today.

269
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,550
Please leave.

270
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:53,440
If you are unsure because of the baby,

271
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,770
the custody of the baby,

272
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,190
I will give it up.

273
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:09,360
I will leave it completely up to you what to do with the baby.

274
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,960
And I will give you a plenty of alimony and child support.

275
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,160
I must have greatly misunderstood.

276
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,180
When I heard that the reason why you lost your memory

277
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:48,960
was because you wanted to erase me even in your unconscious state,

278
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,000
I thought that that can't be right.

279
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,350
Even if you forget your memories about me,

280
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:06,180
I believed that you weren't the type of person to forget how precious a child is.

281
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,850
I thought that you will never do that...

282
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,340
It's always been like this.

283
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,090
Alone, stupidly I imagined.

284
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,600
Stupidly trusted.

285
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,470
Stupidly...

286
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,270
expected...

287
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,700
In the end, it was going to be like this.

288
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,820
Gun and Grandma, and my family.

289
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,560
even Se Ra, I ended up making them suffer.

290
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,360
Stop it now.

291
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,930
Do you think that anyone would understand if you act all pitiful?

292
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,830
Did I not say?

293
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,970
No matter who, there isn't anyone who will stay with you forever.

294
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,350
The world is where you live and fight alone.

295
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,270
Look here, Miss Kim Mi Young.

296
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,600
How long have we met?

297
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,990
It's only 3 months.

298
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:28,070
How will you fight, by yourself, if you can't forget the 3 months?

299
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,540
More so, with a child.

300
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,350
You don't have to say it so harshly.

301
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,530
I have already made up my mind.

302
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,620
Let's break up.

303
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,330
I'll get going.

304
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,310
Wherever you go and however you live,

305
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,880
I hope that you become happy.

306
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,940
I wonder if there is any more happiness that is left for me.

307
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,160
It seems like I already used all of the happiness that I dreamed of.

308
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,220
After meeting you,

309
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,960
things that I would have never imagined happened.

310
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,970
Bad things became good things,

311
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:00,730
and I became a family with the person that loves me.

312
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:10,170
Don't look back at the path that you already passed. Just look forward.

313
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,070
Just forward...

314
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,640
I should.

315
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,040
It's not like we'll see each other again anyways.

316
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,860
Thank you, for all you did.

317
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:34,270
♬ I draw out the one star in my heart, ♬

318
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:40,380
♬ the hidden you ♬

319
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,230
♬ I don’t know why, the more ♬

320
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,000
Kim Mi Young!

321
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:55,190
It's not good for a human to be only nice.

322
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,560
Don't get intimidated and always have dignity!

323
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,540
You know.

324
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,520
Super glue!

325
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,770
♬ My everything, ♬

326
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,940
♬ my destiny ♬

327
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:19,300
♬ My heart keeps going to you ♬

328
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:25,910
♬ When I open my eyes, let me hear it ♬

329
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:35,230
♬ Let me hear you saying I love you
Sweet melody ♬

330
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,630
It's not that good for a person to be only nice like that.

331
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,270
Stand proudly and don't get intimidated.

332
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,790
You know, super glue!

333
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,550
I found out that the baby inside you is my junior. I should at least do the jobs of a father.

334
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:04,720
Bond girl... would've been pretty.

335
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,760
Gun.

336
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,370
Gun.

337
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,760
Gun!
♬ My everything, ♬

338
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,580
Gun.
♬ My destiny ♬

339
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,280
Let's not look back, Gun.

340
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,140
Don't look back.

341
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,130
Gun!

342
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:42,040
Oh no! Is she not hurt?

343
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,730
Room 3, 3.

344
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,200
Save this person!

345
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,940
Alright, careful now.

346
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,170
Careful, one, two, three!

347
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,140
Carefully, carefully!

348
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,120
Here... please save her!

349
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,270
How, how is she now?

350
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,180
Guardian, please calm down.

351
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,450
Is this your wife?
- Yes, she's my wife.

352
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,130
It's my wife!

353
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:30,340
I have a baby.

354
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,140
I have a baby.

355
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,200
Is it.. ok?

356
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,460
Our baby...

357
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,020
Please save my baby. I don't care what happens to me.

358
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,430
Ple..please just.. just save our baby.

359
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,500
It's okay now.
- Nothing can happen to the baby.

360
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,910
Gun... Dog Poopie...

361
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,990
Don't worry..

362
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,560
It'll be ok..

363
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,580
Mi Young.

364
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,690
Guardian!
- What's going on?

365
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,570
One second.

366
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,370
Please move out of the way!
- Calm down. Please escort him outside.

367
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,110
Just a moment!

368
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,910
Guardian, please!

369
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,780
What happened?

370
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,290
There seems to be intestinal rupture.

371
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,740
Wh...what do we have to do?

372
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:41,350
She has to get surgery straight away, so
she needs to be under general anesthesia.

373
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:46,830
If that happens, the baby that she has
will be in a dangerous situation.

374
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:52,390
She's in the early stages of pregnancy, I think it may be a problem for the baby.

375
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:57,090
However, if she doesn't get the surgery done now,
then the mom will be in danger.

376
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,780
What are you saying now?

377
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:05,110
In this case, you have to give up on one of them...

378
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:16,060
♬  Goodbye my love ♬

379
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,770
♬  I think my heart knows ♬

380
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,010
We will start the anesthetics.

381
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:27,820
♬ This yearning, which is almost in my grasp♬

382
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:35,030
♬  I cannot hide ♬

383
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:42,250
♬  You, who is in my heart ♬

384
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:47,820
♬  You are there, oh you. Although I can't have you ♬

385
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,540
♬  Although I can't touch you ♬

386
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:55,810
I wonder if there is any more happiness.

387
00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:01,790
It's as if all the happiness I dreamt of was used all up.

388
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:05,920
Things that I'd never imagined happening in my life...

389
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,870
after meeting you, happened.

390
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:19,840
♬ The more I try to forget, the more I'll long for you ♬

391
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:28,650
♬  I'll probably cry more than today, like fate ♬

392
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,640
Mi Young!

393
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,960
Are you ok?!

394
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,560
What about the baby?

395
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,260
Our baby.. is doing well, right?

396
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,050
Why can't you answer?

397
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,130
Our baby..

398
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,930
is ok, right?

399
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,980
Dog Poopie...

400
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,720
Dog Poopie isn't here..

401
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:22,200
N..No... No.

402
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,130
No.. that can't happen.

403
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,510
Dog Poopie left.

404
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,350
I...

405
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,820
I told him to leave.

406
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,610
I requested, didn't I?

407
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,190
That I don't care what happens to me.

408
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:44,530
I didn't care about what will happen to me..
I pleaded with you to save Dog Poopie!

409
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,570
I requested it, didn't I?!

410
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:51,650
How can I live now that Dog Poopie isn't alive?

411
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,920
Please...return him.. Please return..our Dog Poopie!

412
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,650
Don't do this.

413
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,140
Bring him back!

414
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,350
Please return Dog Poopie!

415
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:11,650
Dog Poopie.. please give him back.
I can't do without Dog Poopie.

416
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,440
Dog Poopie... bring him back!

417
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,250
Mi Young? Why are you crying?

418
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,520
Mi Young? Why are you like this?
- This person...

419
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,790
keeps saying weird things.

420
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,910
He tells me our Dog Poopie is gone.

421
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,440
He was here.

422
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,460
Yes, yes, Mi Young.

423
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,500
Mi Young...

424
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,360
Mi Young!

425
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,760
Mi Young! Mi Young!

426
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,800
Aigoo, Mi Young. Mi Young!

427
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,250
Grandmother,

428
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,300
this is all my fault.

429
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:12,810
I should have been the one getting hurt.

430
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:18,050
How are you at fault?

431
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:22,010
It was an accident that you couldn't have stopped.

432
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,940
Our grandchild...

433
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:40,130
was not fated to meet us.

434
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,450
♬ I like the dazzling sunlight, ♬

435
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:02,080
♬ You, who just seemed like coincidence♬

436
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,740
♬ In case you see my heart, ♬

437
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:17,630
♬ I secretly look at you from far away♬

438
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,090
♬ I draw you out ♬

439
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:26,590
♬  then I erase you again♬

440
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:31,240
♬ I stand in place and talk to myself again ♬

441
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,940
I'm... sorry.

442
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:45,010
♬ When I hold out my hand and hug you tight ♬

443
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:51,440
♬ The twisted destiny will become love ♬

444
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:59,200
♬ I shout out loud, I only love you ♬

445
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:08,370
♬ My heart wants you, you who is like destiny ♬

446
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:12,070
Mom, I came. Your son.

447
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,100
A day like today, I really wanted to see you.

448
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,750
You see. I...

449
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,570
I found a girl I really, really like.

450
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,610
That girl is quite a weird girl.

451
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,290
She's as weird as you.

452
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,440
With a fragile and weak body like that,

453
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,290
I don't know how she's handling this situation.

454
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:45,930
I want to hold her tightly.

455
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,720
But I don't think that I should.

456
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,820
Mom, you know, right?

457
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,500
Kim Myung Sook

458
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,820
Lee Hee

459
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,690
It's been a long time.

460
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,010
Long time, no see..

461
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,770
How was it for you at that time?

462
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,200
After regaining your memories,

463
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,310
were you scared to lose them again, like I am?

464
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,050
I...

465
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:38,550
I found a girl that I really like, and want to be with.

466
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,260
But being scared to lose her,

467
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,390
I can't ask her to stay with me.

468
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,450
I just want to, shamelessly,

469
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,730
stay with her.

470
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,690
But I shouldn't do that.

471
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,550
Like you, Father.

472
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,150
You should eat to get energy into your body.

473
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,510
Here.

474
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,880
I'll eat a little later. I can't eat now.

475
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,950
You're here.
- Sister-in-law.

476
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,330
How are you now?

477
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,510
Is your body better?

478
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,880
Aigoo, look at you.

479
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,200
Your already small face lost half of it.

480
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,420
Mi Ja...

481
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,590
She can't be here 'cause she has to take care of her baby,
so she's very worried about you.

482
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,250
Yeah?

483
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,290
Oh, I miss my nephew, too.

484
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,100
Mi Young, I'm really sorry.

485
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,960
This all happened because of me.

486
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,520
Sister-in-law, because of your useless brother-in-law,

487
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,730
you suffered greatly.

488
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:11,060
Mi Young, you have a guest.

489
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,100
Daniel.

490
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,150
How did you know to come here?

491
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,840
You weren't answering my calls so I went to your mother's restaurant.

492
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,030
I heard what happened from your sister.

493
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,960
I see.

494
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,600
I don't know what I should say to console you.

495
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,280
You don't need to, since it's my fault.

496
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,680
Mi Young, don't blame yourself.

497
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,900
It was an accident.

498
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,570
No. That's an excuse.

499
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,470
It's always been like that.

500
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:02,740
Since an accident happened suddenly,

501
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:06,280
since someone did something to me...

502
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,780
With such excuses,

503
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:15,300
being dragged around...

504
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,090
I think that's how I've been living.

505
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,790
I didn't have courage to fight it on my own,

506
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,670
so being chosen, and discarded again...

507
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:30,110
It became like this being wishy-washy like that.

508
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:34,720
I just ended up

509
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,470
losing the innocent baby. Because of me.

510
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,180
From the tools in the workshop, I bought things that are suitable.

511
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,990
You are happiest when you're painting.

512
00:42:54,990 --> 00:43:00,220
Whenever you feel sad, you can do this to relieve yourself.

513
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,990
I'm really thankful.

514
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,270
You should be.

515
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:09,130
I only brought the most expensive and most precious ones.

516
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,840
You said that a person who likes sweet things
wants to be happy, right?

517
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:51,120
If there is any happiness left for me,

518
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,430
I will give it all to you.

519
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:59,150
You must become happy, Mi Young.

520
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,410
Come on in.

521
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,820
Careful. Careful.

522
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,130
Have a seat.

523
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,460
Yes.

524
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,090
Unni, congratulations for getting discharged.

525
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,080
Thanks for letting me stay here, Ji Yeon.

526
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,430
You are sprouting nonsense.

527
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:34,950
I have to go to my part-time now. You can spend time here with your mom. I'll see you this evening.

528
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,200
If you want something to eat, call me right away.

529
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,120
Mother, I'm leaving.
- Be careful on your way.

530
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,240
Make yourself at home.

531
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,670
Eat.

532
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:59,430
Even when the baby is gone, you have to take care of yourself the same as if you had the baby.

533
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,140
Since you had to go through surgery,
I made you seaweed soup only now.

534
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,420
Hurry, and eat. Drink up the broth as well.

535
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:18,240
You know why I'm not taking you home, right?

536
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,220
If you come home, there will be Mi Ja's son.
Whenever you see the baby,

537
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,650
you'll feel hurt. That's why.

538
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,360
I know.

539
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,920
I know how you feel. Am I a fool?

540
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,230
But then again...

541
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:40,310
What are you going to do with CEO Lee now?

542
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,090
When did you get here?

543
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,560
Not long ago.

544
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,430
Have a seat.

545
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,390
How is your health?

546
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,260
Are you better?

547
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,920
Why did you lie?

548
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,410
You could have told me that your memory came back.

549
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:31,650
Was I too much of a burden for you to go that far?

550
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:40,700
I thought you would feel lighter.

551
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,060
The end was already decided, anyway.

552
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,370
There's no need to get hurt, you know.

553
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:55,850
For the last time, I want to ask you a foolish question.

554
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:57,900
Okay.

555
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:05,150
What if I say, let's forget everything and start over.

556
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,010
It was short but

557
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:10,410
like before,

558
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,500
can't you stay by my side?

559
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:37,030
I'm sorry.

560
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,110
Does that answer your question?

561
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,430
Yes.

562
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,980
Definitely.

563
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:00,790
What is it?

564
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,180
It's our divorce papers.

565
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:07,270
If I knew it would end like this,

566
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:11,780
I should have just done it when you wanted me to.

567
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,670
I gave you a big scar.

568
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,070
It's my fault.

569
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,010
No.

570
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,400
It's no one's fault.

571
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,930
We just didn't know that it was a wrong encounter from the beginning.

572
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,650
Baby Diary

573
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:42,100
I'm sorry.

574
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,450
Wait a moment. Wait.

575
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:17,160
This is the pickled onion that you made.

576
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,820
They say that the taste of pickled onions change if the owner is gone.

577
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,920
You take it.

578
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:27,080
Then.. thank you.

579
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,260
I hope the both of you live happily.

580
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,880
Since you keep talking like that,

581
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,380
I remember when I was chased out long time ago.

582
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,920
That's why you should not have only trusted Gun.

583
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,520
Sister-in-law, I'll make sure to beat him up later.

584
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,700
Both of you, please stay healthy.

585
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,400
Goodbye.

586
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,420
When are leaving to go to France?

587
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:21,040
The day after tomorrow. I'm all packed and now I just have to go.

588
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,420
Yes.

589
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,460
Mi Young.

590
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,280
You're sad that I'm actually about to leave, right?

591
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,590
No matter which neighborhood you live in, it'll be hard to find a neighborhood oppa like me.

592
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,550
What is this?

593
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,490
It's an arts college in Paris.

594
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:57,860
I think it will be nice if you attend there.

595
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:01,060
Think about it seriously, for once.

596
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:05,090
How can I go somewhere like this?

597
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,490
If you put your heart into it, you can do anything.

598
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,710
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

599
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,560
You said this before.

600
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,920
Your life has always been led and ordered around by other people.

601
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,340
If you have courage to change yourself,

602
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,240
it's not bad to just try it

603
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:31,380
for an new chapter in your life.

604
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:53,090
Here.

605
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:56,910
This is the money my son-in-law took from you when he bought the restaurant.

606
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,790
I'm returning this after selling the restaurant.

607
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,200
Mother, this...

608
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:06,830
It was because I wanted to help with my heart.

609
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:09,080
It's not only heart...

610
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,930
Even better things... I can't receive anymore, between us.

611
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:14,930
The rudeness

612
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:18,750
of my family until now, please forgive it.

613
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,770
With this, you and I...

614
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:29,380
with no debt to give or receive, we become strangers.

615
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,210
Gun.

616
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:38,100
Yes.

617
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,870
The way I see it..

618
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:50,730
You and Mi Young have done all you can.

619
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:54,680
I don't think it's fate. What can we do?

620
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,850
Mother,

621
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,220
Mi Young...

622
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,500
can I see her just once for the last time?

623
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,260
Our Mi Young

624
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,740
left for abroad today.

625
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:20,810
I sent her so she can start fresh,

626
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:24,850
so now you live your life, too.

627
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,780
There was a time when I desired something that can't be done.

628
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:45,090
♬I must remember you.♬

629
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:50,580
I would take the jacket you wore to work and hang it on the hook.

630
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:54,710
While you were resting, I would prepare a delicious dinner.

631
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:58,400
At the table we would

632
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,110
discuss how the day was and share stories.

633
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,350
Oh, why, why?

634
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,610
While laying my head

635
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:10,170
on top of your arm, I wanted to be a good wife

636
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:13,730
who would tell you, "good night".

637
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:18,590
If you and I were meant for each other,

638
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:22,440
it would have been nice..

639
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:28,630
♬Even if parting is sad, even if my heart aches♬

640
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:32,780
You once said this.
♬If you are happy,♬

641
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,510
If we had met in a better situation,

642
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:40,870
we would have been destined to be together.

643
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,000
♬As much as I try to erase you♬

644
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:44,930
Mi Young!

645
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,800
♬ I will miss you♬

646
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,300
♬I will cry ♬

647
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:52,320
Kim Mi Young!

648
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,720
♬more than today♬

649
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:57,360
If it hurts this much,
♬Like destiny,♬

650
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:02,430
then we are not destined to be together.

651
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:05,970
If we were to ever meet again,

652
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:17,690
