1
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,980
I think that...

2
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,040
I should sleep on the sofa.

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,170
Good night.

4
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,580
We know this is a breach of contract.

5
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,680
Don't distract me and

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,870
let's just sleep.

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,180
Episode 8

8
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,910
How can you sleep?

9
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,610
You worry-free snail.

10
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,470
Hello.

11
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,090
Why are you in my neighborhood?

12
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,340
This is also my neighborhood. I live here.

13
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,600
♫Let's ride a motorcycle with a guitar ♫

14
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,060
♫Let's ride a motorcycle with a guitar♫

15
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,070
♫Let's ride the motorcycle with a guitar. Let's ride♫

16
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,780
♫Let's ride the snail with a watermelon♫

17
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,330
♫Let's ride the electric light with a quail♫

18
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:14,040
♫Let's ride the table with an ant. Let's ride♫

19
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,380
Give up, give up.

20
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,890
There is no such thing as "giving up" in my dictionary.

21
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,760
I'll buy you a new dictionary.

22
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,660
Your collaboration works with

23
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,710
corporations, it's not bad.

24
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm pretty useful.

25
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,220
I like your confidence.

26
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,320
Though, I'll have to see if you have the ability to support your confidence.

27
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,510
Of course.

28
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,960
My company will contact you in regards to the contract, soon.

29
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
By the way,

30
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,690
I'm sorry for unintentionally lying to you that I was a priest.

31
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,520
You don't need to apologize already,

32
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,780
I'll be keeping my eyes on you 'til the end.

33
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,150
I thought we were just going to shake hands and that's it.

34
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,570
Wow.

35
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,110
Oh!

36
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,710
This is so cool.

37
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,080
You designed all this?

38
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,080
I wanted to apologize for all the lies here and seek forgiveness like a man.

39
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,360
Ugh, now I won't look so cool.

40
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,370
You look cool even now.

41
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,450
So the rumors are right... Oh!

42
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,770
Isn't he D. Pitt?

43
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,220
It is D. Pitt!

44
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,170
D. Pitt!

45
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,610
D. Pitt!

46
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,790
Daniel. Look here.

47
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't look at them.

48
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,490
I can't even escape today.

49
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,620
Mi Young, you know how to walk like a crab, right?

50
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,130
Like a wuff, wuff, dog? (crab and dog sound similar in Korean)

51
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,570
No, like an ocean crab.

52
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,970
You have to walk with me to the side. Ok?

53
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,160
Ok.

54
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,240
Start.

55
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,060
Keep your head down.

56
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,670
Sit here. Sit.

57
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,860
Keep your legs up.

58
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,510
There is an emergency exit there. Be careful going through it.

59
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,040
I'll be held captive for a few minutes and catch up to you.

60
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,380
Will you be fine by yourself?

61
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,210
I need to do at least this much to save my sister, since we are sworn siblings.

62
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,900
Loyalty!

63
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,180
I'll be right back.

64
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,990
Please say something! Daniel!

65
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,850
Hello, Daniel!

66
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,330
You have unique artwork. Where do you get your inspiration from?

67
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:08,250
There's not a specific thing, but I usually work by what I feel.

68
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,630
He must be really famous.

69
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,650
I didn't know.

70
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,700
I have to see the conclusion at the upcoming general shareholders' meeting.

71
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,820
That's what I'm saying. The dismissal item really needs to get passed this time.

72
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,860
I'm so excited just from thinking about it.

73
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,530
You are laughing in this situation?
- Pardon?

74
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,860
When you were acting foolishly saying that he sold the Yeoul factory,

75
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,310
creating a problem and not being able to resolve it,

76
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,550
I took care of it for you.
And yet, haha, hoho...

77
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,230
You can still laugh?

78
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,980
I'm sorry.

79
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,790
Even if it isn't you two, do you know

80
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,350
how many people are dying to own Jangin Chemicals?

81
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,390
What? How can you say such things now?

82
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,630
Be careful with what you say!

83
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,640
I didn't just age.

84
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,380
If you keep acting up,

85
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,480
you could become like this silently.

86
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,020
Why don't you know that?

87
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,830
San Gang's father, you can't make the baby food like that.

88
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,170
Good bye.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

89
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,970
I'll see you later.

90
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,220
I'll have to thank Grandmother.
We even learned how to make baby food.

91
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,680
What about me? Aren't you thankful of me?

92
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,040
Thank you for coming here with me.

93
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,150
I was wondering why that didn't happen earlier. Let's go eat something together.

94
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,170
Don't you need to go to work now?

95
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,740
I still need to eat lunch. Am I some robot, to working without eating?

96
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,030
What do you want to eat?

97
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,680
There is one, but...
- What?

98
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,520
Fermented Stingray

99
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,420
Our Mi Young has interesting taste.

100
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,790
It is never normal.

101
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,520
It's really good.

102
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,430
You should try some.

103
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,580
It's okay. You can eat all of it.

104
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,890
It's not going to be enough. Eat everything. Clear everything up.

105
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,170
Did you

106
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,030
come up with the baby's fetus name yet?

107
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,080
Oh, well. We can just make one.

108
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,700
Well, there is nothing to be afraid of. Do you have any nickname in mind?

109
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,510
How about...

110
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,410
Dog Poopie?

111
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,410
Dog Poopie?

112
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,210
Dog...

113
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,420
Seriously, Dog Poopie?

114
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,770
We can't do that.

115
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,580
I really don't like dogs, and does adding the poop part to the name make sense?

116
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,970
We can't do that.
- Well...

117
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,330
I heard that if you give the baby a rural name, it will live for a long time.

118
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,660
It's weird to make the baby's real name that.

119
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,720
So I was wondering if we could just make that the baby's fetus name.

120
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,320
We can't. Not Dog Poopie.

121
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,240
How can the son of Jangin Chemicals CEO be named Dog Poopie?

122
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,910
Actually my fetus name was Dog Poopie, too.

123
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,050
So I'm really strong.

124
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,240
You saw me run before.

125
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,020
The baby will be very, very healthy.

126
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,880
Well... after listening to Dog Poopie for a while, it does seem relatable and homely.

127
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,710
It seems better than Bird Poopie or Horse Poopie.

128
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,540
Let's do Dog Poopie.

129
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,350
Dog Poopie!

130
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,630
Dog Poopie.
♬My everything.♬

131
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,880
♬ My destiny.♬

132
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,370
♬ My heart keeps going to you.♬

133
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,720
I'll be back.
- Okay.
♬ My heart keeps going to you♬

134
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,510
Dog Poopie, I'm leaving.
♬ When I open my eyes♬

135
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,550
Take care.
♬ Let me hear it♬

136
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:16,450
♬ Let me hear you saying I love you
Sweet melody ♬

137
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,670
Since you're here, don't you want to see it?

138
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,450
See what?
- My office.

139
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,800
Aren't you curious?

140
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,360
Mi Young.

141
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:13,970
Why?
- People are staring at me. You can go in first. I'll follow you quietly.

142
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,300
Gun.

143
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,920
Kim Mi Young,

144
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,440
you are not a post-it anymore.

145
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,600
Don't hide behind me, and walk proudly while matching your steps with mine.

146
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,040
Okay?

147
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,110
Here.

148
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,820
Let's go.

149
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,150
The CEO and his wife are going up the elevator.

150
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,850
Third floor... Fourth floor... Fifth floor...

151
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,650
No. 2 and No. 3. Let them pass the tenth floor.

152
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,070
They are getting off now.

153
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,770
Come in. Quickly.

154
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,280
Surprise!

155
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,740
Se Ra...

156
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,240
I missed you, Gun.

157
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,400
Don't go.

158
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,200
Who is she?

159
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,820
Se Ra...

160
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,400
That woman...

161
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,490
Hello.

162
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,490
I'm Chairman Wang's secretary. Hello.

163
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,570
Oh, is that so? This is my first time seeing you.

164
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,450
I'm Kang Se Ra.

165
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,150
Yes, nice to meet you.

166
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,170
CEO, I have something to tell you. Can I see you for a minute?

167
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,170
Go out. Follow her.

168
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,740
Okay.

169
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,860
What are you doing right now?!

170
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:21,610
Are you planning to tell Se Ra who I am?

171
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,210
If Se Ra finds out everything now,

172
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,360
I don't think that she will be able to endure it.

173
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,570
She isn't prepared for anything.

174
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,200
How about you?

175
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,280
I don't know well, but I don't think it's the right time to tell her yet.

176
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,320
She greeted you that warmly. Think about it one more time.

177
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,520
What was that, being interrupted like that in the middle of catching up?

178
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,400
Your secretary is so clueless.

179
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,820
Your choking skills have gotten stronger.

180
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:32,200
Here, tell me how happy you are? You're happy that I'm here, right?

181
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,820
Of course. I'm really happy.

182
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,500
You can die from happiness, right?

183
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,070
Yeah, I'm going to die from happiness.

184
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,140
To be honest, I've been feeling a little disappointed.
- Why?

185
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,620
You hung up on me first, and...

186
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,860
you used to call me at dawn after my performance was over, but you didn't.

187
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,180
I didn't?
- I was going to scold you when I saw you, but...

188
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,320
But...?

189
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,350
But I'm okay now.

190
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,100
Oh, I got a long vacation this time.

191
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,320
Four days and five nights!

192
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,070
You got a vacation of four days and five nights?

193
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,700
While I stay here, you will ditch work.

194
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,650
And hang out with me the whole day. Okay?

195
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,710
Where should we go?
- What is this, I just said that as a joke.

196
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,950
We should go somewhere.
- You became nicer!

197
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,150
I did?
- You're so cute.

198
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,150
This is the "Good Job" stamp.

199
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,240
Where shall we go?

200
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,080
Madame.

201
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,380
How is it? Isn't it pretty good?

202
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,200
Yeah.

203
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,450
Aigoo, you didn't even unpack yet.

204
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,890
It's nice.

205
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,340
I feel like I can breathe now.

206
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,070
Was it very difficult?

207
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,610
I was lonely.

208
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,680
I was also having a hard time

209
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,400
thinking about how lonely you must've been.

210
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,090
Se Ra...
- I'm only going to look at you now.

211
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,320
I realized that I can't be without you.

212
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,670
For the last month, I realized that over and over.

213
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:54,990
"It started snowing harder, and the wind started blowing."

214
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:02,030
But Dog Poopie, "there were still matches inside the pockets and basket of the girl."

215
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,600
"I'm so cold."

216
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,620
She must be really cold, Dog Poopie. Right?

217
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,670
It must be really cold.

218
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,820
♬You, who just seemed like a coincidence.♬

219
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
♬ To hide my feelings, ♬

220
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,600
Tada.
♬ To hide my feelings, ♬

221
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,300
♬From far away,♬

222
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:34,250
♬I look over you.♬

223
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,060
Where did Mommy read to, Dog Poopie?
♬I draw you.♬

224
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,450
♬ And then I erase you.♬

225
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:49,720
♬ I just talk to myself in the same spot.♬

226
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,260
You know the only person I can lean on to in this world is you, right?
♬ When I offer my hand ♬

227
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,570
Let's get married.

228
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,820
I'll marry you.
♬ and hold you tight,♬

229
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:07,200
♬ Even the twisted destiny will become love.♬

230
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:14,920
♬ I shout this. I just love you.♬

231
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:25,200
♬ My heart wants you. You are my destiny.♬

232
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,900
♬ I love you.♬
- Do well on the interview tomorrow,

233
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:34,350
and afterwards, let's talk. I have something to tell you.

234
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,880
What are you doing so early in the morning-

235
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,830
Why are your hands so big( means big portions)? You weren't even raised in a rich home.

236
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,690
I was craving pickled onions so I thought I would just make it all at once.

237
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,120
Oh, the smell. Doesn't it burn your eyes?

238
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,490
I thought I would be okay, but now that I'm actually doing it my eyes do burn a bit.

239
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,490
Gun was out all night yesterday, right?

240
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,510
Do you think he's cheating on you?

241
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,530
His father's tendencies are slowly starting to show in him as well.

242
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,810
He called saying that he was busy with the company. It's nothing like that.

243
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,690
I'll give you some advice, since we're both in a similar situation.

244
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,950
You're no different than a mistress, since you got involved with Gun after knowing that he had another woman.

245
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:34,130
Never knowing when you're going to get dumped is the life of the second woman.

246
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,920
Don't suffer later by blindly depending on Gun, and

247
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,770
get ready for that day in advance.

248
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:45,880
Not having anywhere to go after being abandoned is both our situation.

249
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,420
CEO A had sex with Employee B, who approached him on purpose and got pregnant. Because of that, he broke up Ballerina C

250
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,350
Dog Poopie, you've been feeling frustrated, haven't you?

251
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:13,450
Mommy hasn't been thinking about Dog Poopie and only of herself.

252
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,330
Dog Poopie, let's go for a walk.

253
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,300
Let's go with Mommy.

254
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,840
Hello. You're Jangin Chemicals' CEO's wife, right?

255
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,790
Yes, you're right, but why did you...

256
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,030
We are reporters for a women's magazine.
We wanted to ask you some questions.

257
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,100
How you intentionally approached the CEO and got pregnant

258
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:43,150
and then you even got married, these rumors have been floating around. You've heard them, right?

259
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,200
I'm sorry.

260
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,880
Just a moment, Madame.

261
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,250
-Please, just one second.
- Just a moment, please.

262
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,040
You only need to say one word!

263
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,010
Wait, please.

264
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,480
It's true that you approached him intentionally and got pregnant, right?

265
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,310
Please, please don't do this to me.

266
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,530
What do you people think you're doing?!

267
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,800
Mi Young, let's go.

268
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,620
Wait one moment, please.

269
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,600
You aren't moving out of the way?

270
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,400
Why are you getting involved and making it difficult!?

271
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,670
What relationship do you have with this person? Do you know each other?

272
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,960
This person is...

273
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,750
I am her neighborhood oppa.

274
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,930
A neighborhood oppa?

275
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,530
Are you stupid? Should I spell it out for you?

276
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,840
Neighborhood plus oppa, neighborhood oppa!

277
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,980
What?

278
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,560
Let's stop it here for today. I'm a bit of an expensive person, you know.

279
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,390
Rude brats.

280
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,830
Hey, you!

281
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,550
I can hear everything that you are saying!

282
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,520
I said it for you to hear!

283
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,460
And this is my cafe, so don't step on my property.

284
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,050
Those who aren't human are not allowed.

285
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,650
You are currently performing as the first Korean ballerina in a New York ballet.

286
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,650
Have there ever been any times when it has been difficult?

287
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,490
Why wouldn't there be? There have been many difficult times.

288
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:17,330
Um... first of all, going into it with the title of the first Korean ballerina was very burdensome,

289
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,510
but now due to the strength that it gave me, I think I am doing quite well now.

290
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,270
It must have been difficult while you were living abroad,

291
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,180
but you can also form friendships

292
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,720
with your colleagues at the ballet company.

293
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,260
You like me?
I like you.

294
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:55,440
When other people would call me a post-it,

295
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,710
you told me to become a superglue girl,

296
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,040
not to be discouraged.

297
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,430
You're the one and only person who said that to me.

298
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,730
Yes, Dr. Octopus, what is it?

299
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,880
Mom did?!

300
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,560
I'll ask my final question.

301
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,380
What are your future plans after this performance?

302
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,400
Ah...

303
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,170
One moment please.

304
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,580
Something urgent has come up. I'll be back.

305
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,090
I'm sorry. Let's talk later tonight.

306
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,260
I'm sorry.

307
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,680
You were put into a difficult situation because of me.

308
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,080
No, it's been a while so it was fun.

309
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,130
Use me often when you go for walks in the future.

310
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,700
I'm available 24/7 and you'll feel safe when we're together.

311
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,260
Moreover, it's free.

312
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,830
♬ I had no idea you’d be my life♬

313
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,140
It was nice walking while talking to Dog Poopie.
♬ But when I looked♬

314
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,060
Dog Poopie?
♬  into your eyes♬

315
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,560
My baby's fetus name is Dog Poopie.
♬ I knew someday, ♬

316
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,960
Oh, Dog Poopie for a fetus name.
♬ you’d be my wife.♬

317
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,960
How cute.
♬ I know there’s♬

318
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,030
Dog Poopie
♬ times when I am wrong♬

319
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:30,680
♫ And you know there is times when I'm right... ♫

320
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,040
I think I was too weak earlier.
♬ Just as long as we both give♬

321
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,020
I can't continue to rely on others.
♬ it all we can, and for both to see♬

322
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:43,240
At least for Dog Poopie...
♬  that we try♬

323
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,210
From now on, I'm not going to run away.

324
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:53,270
Don't run away anymore. Your husband seems to be treating you well, too.
♬ You took my heart so unexpectedly♬

325
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:59,030
♬ Who knew that you would be the one♬

326
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:04,450
♬ But I always knew that there was
something special about you♬

327
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:08,600
♬ From the day that you walked into my life♬

328
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,630
Mom!

329
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,130
Mom, how could this nonsense happen?!

330
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:17,760
Mom, what's happening? Where are you hurt?

331
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,350
Is my son here?

332
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,140
Dr. Octopus, what is happening? Tell me in full detail.

333
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,810
It's nothing much, but we discovered gallstones during her routine exam.

334
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:29,030
Gallstones! Isn't that very painful?!!

335
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,490
It will be fine if we immediately perform surgery to remove it.

336
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,300
She will be fine.

337
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,930
Nothing is wrong, right?

338
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,150
Don't worry so much.

339
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:42,780
Even if something were to happen, I have this dependable son-in-law, so what's there to worry?

340
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,100
Mom. Mom, are you alright?

341
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,210
This girl, what's all this fuss about?

342
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,840
Did you tell her that I was here?

343
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,050
I didn't say anything.

344
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,330
I did, Mom.

345
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,950
What if it shocked her? That was unnecessary.

346
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,900
I'm embarrassed to see Son-in-law Lee.

347
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,040
I'm alright. I'm okay, so don't worry.

348
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,820
Mom, nothing bad can happen to you.

349
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,180
You know this, right? Without you,

350
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,770
I can't handle it, right?

351
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,690
They said that she's alright.

352
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,990
They said that she'll be fine.

353
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,380
Don't worry.

354
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,890
What are they playing on the radio these days?

355
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,210
You're listening to Jung Joon Young's Break the Boredom.

356
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,450
My boyfriend recently met his old girlfriend again.

357
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,210
I knew they were together for a long time and loved each other very much, so I've been easy on him.

358
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,480
But he spent the whole night with her and I caught him.

359
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,650
She asks "should I try to understand this man or not?"

360
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,740
Understand this man?! This is a habit for this man.

361
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,780
Women listeners should never marry a man like this.

362
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,080
Tell the man to "get lost." "GET LOST!"

363
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,630
The sender sounds like my ideal type of woman, so just come to me instead.

364
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,210
What kind of DJ puts his own feeling on a radio show.
What's the use of seeing this jerk? Come to me.

365
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,660
It's not like he is proposing in front of everyone.
I liked you since middle school.

366
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,150
Please come to me. Noona!
(Jung Joon Young's Jang Na Ra's real life fan)

367
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,630
This...

368
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,730
I'm cheating on you.

369
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,090
I'm full of it.

370
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,810
Ha, I'm cheating on you.

371
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:38,270
The song is really... I guess they no longer review songs before playing them on air.

372
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,720
He's indecisively looking here and there right now-

373
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,250
This rough voice, it sounds nice.
Once a two-timer,

374
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,020
will it be difficult for him to become a third, four-timer?

375
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,910
If you still can't break up with him, are you saying you're willing to love him even if it's just half of him?

376
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,860
I think she's talking about Dr. Octopus, that old man.
At that rate, you'll be the one broken in half.

377
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,270
I know it hurts, but it's time to end it. End it! Are you stupid?

378
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:07,700
Is this the best man? There are so many men. End it right now! 
All the radio stations are weird. Every channel.

379
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,250
Right now. Over. The end.

380
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,650
Try Track 6...

381
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,300
Ah, I like it. This is good.

382
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,910
Goes well with this weather, too.

383
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,830
I think I like it.

384
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,760
Wait, what's...

385
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,360
What's wrong with this? What's this?
Why so complicated?!

386
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,930
It turned off. It's off.

387
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,820
I am very grateful.

388
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,330
For... what?

389
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,330
For today, too.

390
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,800
Then, leave first. I will go inside.

391
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,860
Wait.

392
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,000
That...

393
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,480
Is Dog Poopie doing okay?

394
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,400
Yes.

395
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,450
Of course. It's well.

396
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,110
Gun!

397
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,600
Se Ra.

398
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,420
I bought a gift for Grandma.

399
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,620
Before you came, I wanted to get some points from her.

400
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,360
Oh! The secretary from before. We meet again.

401
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,930
Hello.

402
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:45,040
Then I will leave.

403
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,530
What's wrong?

404
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,680
Se Ra,

405
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,590
this person...

406
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:11,130
...is not my Grandmother's secretary.

407
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,900
The truth is...

408
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,470
No. Don't tell her.

409
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,460
Don't say it.

410
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,570
I got married.

411
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,990
This person...

412
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,190
This person is my wife.

413
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:02,160
Are you expecting me to believe that now?

414
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:18,670
This joke is way too far, right?

415
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,900
I am sorry.

416
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,820
I am very sorry.

417
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,520
Se Ra.

418
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,230
Tell me it's a lie.

419
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,920
Please. Please tell me it's a lie.

420
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:07,550
You used to be a person that would do
everything I wanted to, weren't you?

421
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,110
I'm sorry.

422
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,610
Se Ra!

423
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:03,660
Se Ra. Se Ra.

424
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,690
What?

425
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,990
How you met that woman and why your heart changed...

426
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:12,940
Do I have to listen to your sad excuses in order for you to feel better?

427
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,260
Were you always this cruel?

428
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,140
The guy that I've been dating for 6 years,

429
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,320
you were like this?

430
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,430
Secretly getting married and seeing my face with such an innocent face, how did you feel?

431
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:35,200
Did you find it thrilling and exciting?
- I'm having a baby.

432
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,730
What?

433
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:44,330
That person...

434
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,760
She's the mother of my child.

435
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:03,460
♬ I like the blinding sunlight ♬

- I've never seen an angel like you.

441
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,210
Ah, don't do that. Aigoo.

442

445
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,390
Hello, Gun. How is it? Do you like it?
♬ In that place ♬

446
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:10,140
I was very happy after finding these.
♬ Talking alone♬

They will suit you really well.
♬  Talking alone ♬

448
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,820
You will have these cuff-links on when you sign contracts,
♬ I give you my hand ♬

449
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,870
and when you wave to me before you leave for work.

450
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:24,990
I get so happy every time I visualize the shining cufflinks in those moments, so I smile.

451
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,470
You know that you can't never lose these, right?
♬ can become love ♬

452
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:30,780
You can't use them even if you lose just one.
♬I call this out loudly.♬

00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,730

♬ You are my destiny.♬

463
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,330
Are you okay?

464
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:35,810
Pardon?

465
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:39,790
It's just that I've been hearing a weird rumor lately.

466
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,440
Have you heard?

467
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,290
Yes, I know.

468
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,850
But you're still okay?

469
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,590
Because it's not true.

470
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:54,190
People will find out the truth someday.

471
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:13,320
Today's charity event is, as a Madame of Jangin Chemicals,

472
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,640
will be your first official event that you are attending, so

473
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,970
come with me. Is that okay?

474
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,060
Will I be helpful if I went?

475
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:26,810
Of course! You'll definitely be helpful!

476
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,830
You are, in this household,

477
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:33,780
the one and only daughter-in-law.

478
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:39,450
Yes, Grandmother. I'll do my best to make you proud.

479
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:48,890
I'm sorry. For everything.

480
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:54,750
You married into this household, and weren't even treated that well.

481
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,370
Only created scars.

482
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:01,310
Gun acting like that, it's hateful, right?

483
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,410
No, Grandmother.

484
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:10,100
I hope that person will make it through well.

485
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,060
I want to help,

486
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,830
but there's nothing I can do to help him.

487
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:55,670
I believe the saying that if one confesses her love with this candy, it will be fulfilled.

488
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,120
No. I want to believe it.

489
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:12,550
CEO! CEO! CEO!

490
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:15,160
CEO, th-there's a big problem!

491
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,720
What's the matter this time?

492
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,640
Right now, malicious news articles about Madame...

493
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,190
They're spreading everywhere like a virus!

494
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:30,170
Becoming the Madame of a household product company with one night affair!

495
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,310
How can you tell me this now?!

496
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:37,880
I was going to tell you... but Se Ra...

497
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,190
Stop this article immediately.

498
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:41,410
What do we do about the rumors that have already spread?

499
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:44,180
Block them all. All of them!

500
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,640
Oh, hello. My granddaughter-in-law.

501
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,390
Hello. Yes.
-Hello.

502
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:07,180
She's my granddaughter-in-law.
- Ah, she's very pretty!

503
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,730
Hello!
- Ah, yes!

504
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,790
Chairwoman Wang, you came.

505
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:17,640
Of course, we sponsor this company.

506
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,540
This is my granddaughter-in-law.

507
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:24,120
She is the Madame of Jangin Chemicals and Gun's wife.

508
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,980
Hello, I am Kim Mi Young.

509
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,730
Ah, yes. You seem very kind. Congratulations on your wedding.

510
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,210
Thank you.

511
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:34,560
May I borrow the Chairwoman for a moment?

512
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,170
I have something to tell her.

513
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,280
Wait here.

514
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,300
Go on ahead.

515
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:49,160
I'm with a child so I can't drink alcohol.

516
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,110
You heard that rumor, right?

517
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:14,390
What rumor?
- Ah!

518
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:20,350
The rumor about Jangin Chemicals? The CEO must be too embarrassed to show up here today.

519
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:23,150
Chairman Wang brought the daughter-in-law here just a moment ago.

520
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,010
But that daughter-in-law is pretty shameless!

521
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,880
You have to be careful about those innocent looking girls.

522
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,180
She was a woman without much, I heard.

523
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:37,070
Those kinds of women are scarier because they have nothing but tenacity.

524
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:40,720
You are right.

525
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,420
I know, right?

526
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,340
Hello.

527
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,890
You remember me, right?

528
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,230
I'm Se Ra's friend, Soo Hyun!
- Yes.

529
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,430
What brings you here?

530
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:01,730
I'm guessing you are here as Gun oppa's secretary.

531
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:05,410
Yes. I wish you a good time.

532
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,990
Hold on a second.

533
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,860
Can you throw this away, too?

534
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,360
Yes.

535
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:19,190
Don't live like that. It's embarrassing as a woman.

536
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:29,660
Thank you.

537
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,450
This is typical of the upper class society.

538
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:36,660
You need to stay alert, Mi Young.

539
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,900
No. Should I call you Madame?

540
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,090
Thank you.

541
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,490
Have you been doing well?

542
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,280
Looking at your face, it seems there are some unspoken pains.

543
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,240
I haven't been doing particularly well either.

544
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,620
We both messed around on one night,

545
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,580
but someone became trash.

546
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,590
And someone became a Madame.

547
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,640
I'll be going.

548
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,220
Don't act so stuck up, Madame.

549
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:23,240
Did you forget that you were under me before?

550
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:38,030
Everyone, I'm going to introduce you a very special someone.

551
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:42,180
Jangin Chemicals' Madame, Kim Mi Young!

552
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,930
Can you introduce yourself?

553
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,910
This is the first time she attended this kind of event, so she is being shy.

554
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:59,990
You guys seem to be curious, so I will tell you.

555
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:03,310
Kim Mi Young. 29 years-old.

556
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:07,160
Former contract worker in general affairs at a law firm.

557
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:20,790
Hearing you all bustling right now, you must have heard the rumors.

558
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:26,200
That's right. Woman B from that rumor is her!

559
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,410
Since she ended up marrying a man who had a lover by having his baby,

560
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:37,070
she is literally the living Cinderella of our time.

561
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:40,170
So you're saying that the rumor is true?

562
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:43,860
Mi Young, they're asking if it's true.

563
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,990
Tell us clearly.

564
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,670
Is that correct?

565
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:50,310
Is it right? Right?

566
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,960
It's me... Gun.

567
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,960
Don't hesitate to hand me that microphone.

568
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,090
That's it.

569
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:23,490
Don't stand here and go over there.

570
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:28,790
Watch carefully.

571
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:39,000
Yes, I am the Lee Gun, the CEO of Jangin Chemicals.

572
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,640
Applause.

573
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,580
You can go ahead and clap your hands.

574
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:52,180
Alright. What everyone is curious about

575
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,140
is my relationship with that woman.

576
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,160
You guys are curious if we got married because of the baby,

577
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:04,780
and whether or not she really worked in general affairs as a contract worker for a law firm, right?

578
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,830
The answer is..

579
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,170
Correct. You guys are awesome.

580
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:18,080
You guys are amazing!

581
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:24,890
But there is one thing that nobody is aware of.

582
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:28,540
What would that be....that woman

583
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:32,730
is a very strange woman.

584
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:35,100
While living with her, I realized

585
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,500
she has a very odd reversed charm.

586
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,700
The more you see her, she becomes very beautiful.

587
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:46,580
It would've been boring if she was just pretty, but she's cute, adorable and even very kind!

588
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,640
Since I feel too bad about being the only one knowing that strange woman,

589
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:58,920
I want to tell you all here, personally.

590
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,080
Pay attention.

591
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:14,330
That woman... She's really not smart.

592
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:17,750
She's also not good at calculating.

593
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,820
That's because she was good at none of the school subjects when she was in school.

594
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:26,140
And she was the worst at math.

595
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:32,250
But that woman

596
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:39,040
knows how to treat a person with honesty.

597
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,420
And that woman

598
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,630
knows how to take care

599
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:53,290
of a person's hurt feelings.

600
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:56,110
And sympathize with them.

601
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:01,730
That's why, no matter how ordinary she is,

602
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:05,020
she is my very special and precious,

603
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:08,170
my lovely wife...

604
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,420
Kim Mi Young.

605
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:18,500
Yes, that Kim Mi Young.

606
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,250
I will introduce her to everyone now!

607
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,790
Applause.

608
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:41,970
Kim Mi Young, diamond gemstones

609
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:45,080
shouldn't hang out with these rocks.

610
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:50,250
Let's go.

611
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:54,940
Have a nice time and enjoy yourselves.

612
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,630
We're now leaving!

613
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,580
How's this music?

614
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,750
It's nice.

615
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:31,920
Do you dance well?

616
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,500
No, hardly.

617
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:38,230
I'm a good dancer.

618
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:46,540
For us to be dressed like this and to just go home,

619
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:50,000
isn't it bit of a shame? Right?

620
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,380
Should we have a sweet dance here together, Madame?

621
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:15,750
Put your hands here.

622
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:32,540
Are you embarrassed?

623
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:38,500
Kim Mi Young.
- Huh?

624
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:14,040
Wasn't our CEO really cool?

625
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,360
Our Madame is so beautiful, too.

626
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,510
Don't you agree Attorney Gong?

627
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:22,270
Yes, it's cool and beautiful.

628
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:25,420
It makes me wonder what I'm doing being an attorney.

629
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,830
You've been having a tough time because of me, haven't you.

630
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,830
It was more difficult for you than me.

631
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:47,670
I wasn't avoiding you because I didn't like you.

632
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,080
I would feel sorry until I'm ready.

633
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:58,380
So preparing myself to go back to you...

634
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,790
That's what it was.

635
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,710
Thank you.

636
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:08,100
For waiting for me.

637
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,420
And...

638
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,420
for being with me now.

639
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,280
The nicer he is to me,

640
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,680
the more afraid I become.

641
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,430
The nicer he is to me,

642
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:08,790
the more of an effort he makes for me,

643
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:11,380
I became afraid...

644
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:18,170
That I would grow to expect too much.

645
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:25,540
That I would mistakenly think that he likes me.

646
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,130
That promised day...

647
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,880
That I wouldn't be able to send that person away.
