1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,930
Open sesame!

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,330
Open perilla!

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,410
Please Buddha, open the door.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,820
Open, Snail.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,080
Open, Snail!

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,250
Open!

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,330
Snail.

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,860
Lee Gun,

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,450
why are you here?

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,950
Kim Mi Young,

11
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,180
why did you come out of my room?

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,560
This is my room.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,770
This is my room.

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,480
This is amazing.

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,520
How is this possible?

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,030
I rode too hard. I rode too hard.

17
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,690
Even so, how can I even dream like this?

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,270
Kim Mi Young...

19
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,000
Mi Young...

20
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,050
Kim Mi Young~

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,360
Seeing you in my dreams at least,

22
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,210
it's nice to see you.

23
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,620
♬ Goodbye my love  ♬

00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,230

Gun!

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,200
Look here!

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,520
Episode 14
♬ my heart ♬

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,990
♬ Oh you, I can’t have you, ♬

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:34,750
♬ I can’t touch you

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:41,680

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,890
♬ Goodbye my love ♬

40
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,050
My head hurts.

41
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,180
I feel like I'm dying.

42
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,140
Give me water.

43
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,400
Please give me some water.

44
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,610
I really feel like I'm going to die.

45
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,500
Ah, I just asked for some water.

46
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,360
What's this?

47
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,740
Ah, my head..

48
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,860
I'm letting you know just in case you don't remember.

49
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,570
I moved you into my room after you passed out in the hallway.

50
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,770
Please leave my room before I return this morning.

51
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,900
It would be nice if we didn't see each other again. Kim Mi Young.

52
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,740
Kim Mi Young?

53
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,990
Lee Gun.
- Kim Mi Young?

54
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,830
Kim Mi Young. Mi Young~

55
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,750
Then...

56
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,610
that wasn't a dream yesterday?

57
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,910
Now she doesn't even want to see my face.

58
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,520
Seeing you in my dreams at least..

59
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,130
It's nice to see you.

60
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,070
I didn't want to run into him even in my dreams.

61
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,190
She's no longer a post it.

62
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,370
She's super glue. Super glue.

63
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,760
Were you not able to sleep last night?

64
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,920
You must have been very nervous about the showing.

65
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,120
To be honest,

66
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,080
I have something to say to you.

67
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,530
Last night, by coincidence, Lee Gun...

68
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,250
Wait.

69
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,470
Let me ask you one thing.

70
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,070
The person you met by chance yesterday, is he still so important

71
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,230
that you need to tell me about him?

72
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,160
You knew already?

73
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,750
That's fine then.

74
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,780
Why is this bread so tasty.

75
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,990
Coffee's nutty, too. How is it to you?

76
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,830
It's really delicious to me also.

77
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,430
Oh yeah, did you contact that person who bought the drawing?

78
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,870
I was able to contact them but I wasn't able to get it canceled.

79
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,400
Have you been caught by a difficult person?
Shall I do it for you?

80
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,210
I'll do it.

81
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,260
It's a woman. She seemed like a nice person. I'll try again.

82
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,310
There aren't too many bad people in your mind.

83
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,510
Is that how it is?

84
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,530
Eat up.
- Yes.

85
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,960
It has been a while, CEO Lee Gun.

86
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,280
Long time, no see, Daniel Pitt.

87
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,460
I wanted to greet you earlier, but didn't because
I thought it might be uncomfortable for Ellie.

88
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,400
Ellie.

89
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,530
She looked very good.

90
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,800
Of course, for that to happen,

91
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,090
I'm aware that you, D. Pitt, had a lot to do with it.

92
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,020
I'm not doing that kind of role anymore.

93
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,650
The kind where I comfort her when you hurt her.

94
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,240
I've done it plenty of times.

95
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,780
Then you must be better at it.

96
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,030
The person who used to do it originally is usually best at it.

97
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,970
I'll let it slide this time believing that it was coincidental,

98
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,240
but if you appear in front of Ellie again then it becomes intentional.

99
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,820
There isn't any need to be so sensitive, Daniel.

100
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,600
I only

101
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,070
wanted to say one thing to you.

102
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,260
For watching over Mi Young so well,

103
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,170
thank you.

104
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,610
Do you think you still have the right to say that?

105
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,710
And let's get this straight, I'm not watching over her.

106
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,280
I'm by her because I like her and she's precious to me.

107
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,330
I feel at ease, hearing you say that.

108
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,660
I have an eye for people.

109
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,370
Then.. (I will take my leave).

110
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,910
Very, very good. Beautiful exhibition.

111
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,800
Thank you so much.

112
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,090
Kim Mi Young...

113
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,540
I sincerely congratulate you on your first exhibition.

114
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,180
You just need to move forward like that.

115
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,510
Slowly, slowly, step-by-step.

116
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,830
But I

117
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,360
liked seeing you.

118
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,200
Then...

119
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,350
I will look forward to your future work.

120
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,860
Between confidence and warmth, we met artist Ellie Kim.

121
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:33,160
Yong, this girl is really the same Kim Mi Young that used to live in our house?

122
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,240
Yeah, that's right. Even if I look here and there, it's her.

123
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,980
Sister-in law, I really missed you! Congratulations!

124
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,430
At this rate, she'll soon become very rich.

125
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,150
She'll be welcoming the gold!

126
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,520
Welcome the gold?

127
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,400
You must have meant "return home in glory."

128
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,000
You don't even know that at your age? Aigoo...

129
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,730
Supposedly, hearing goes with age.

130
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,380
Our Mother-in-law has bright ears and is very healthy

131
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,550
so you will not have a problem until you're 100.

132
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,300
What are you two looking at?

133
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,440
Grandmother, do you know who this is?

134
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,000
Who is it?

135
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,100
Is this Mi Young?

136
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,390
But why is Mi Young in here?

137
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,880
Aigoo, Mi Young!

138
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,960
She must have returned to Korea.

139
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,850
Was it really a business trip?

140
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,790
What? Is there such thing as a fake business trip?

141
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,210
I mean, it's not like you're in a factory.

142
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,930
What's the reason for you to sleep over a night?

143
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,990
You, by chance?
- By chance, what?

144
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:02,450
Did you cause some big trouble without your Grandmother knowing?

145
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,650
Hello, Madame Wang, what are you expecting?

146
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,910
What? Am I the kind to make trouble and scandals wherever I sleep outside?

147
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,770
Hello, Grandmother. Don't you think the conversation between a Grandmother and a Grandchild is too straight forward?

148
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,360
Hey, you rascal. Your grandmother is that desperate.

149
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,090
By chance, do you know?

150
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,520
What?

151
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,680
What?

152
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,570
Nothing, since you're tired just rest.

153
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,350
Hurry and rest.

154
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,310
Okay, I will.

155
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,490
What's the point of telling.

156
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,300
His heart is just going to hurt.

157
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,320
Good work.
- Good work.

158
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,790
Yes, go ahead and talk.

159
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,900
Huh? Really?

160
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,800
Really? That's right? You're certain, right?

161
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,800
Artist, I think we'll have to ship out this painting tomorrow.

162
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,610
Really?

163
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,660
Okay for now.

164
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,590
Daniel,

165
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,750
is there something wrong?

166
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,120
What is it?

167
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,610
I just got a call from Seoul. I think I really found my sister this time!

168
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,720
Everything matches!

169
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,350
Really?

170
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,280
I told you, you would for sure find her.

171
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,010
I'm supposed to meet her in Seoul tomorrow. Will you go with me?

172
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,030
Of course.

173
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,100
Finding his sister, that's really good.

174
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,140
Hello, I'm Lee Young Ja.

175
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,350
Is your body feeling better?

176
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,400
Yes, I think I got better thanks to you.

177
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,540
Then, it's a relief.

178
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,810
But, Miss Lee Young Ja,

179
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,940
have you thought about the favor I asked of you?

180
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,810
Ah.. That.. A little.. Not yet.

181
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,420
Tomorrow, we have to ship out the painting.

182
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,860
Can I go there myself?

183
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,060
I want to meet you face-to-face and talk.

184
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,830
That'll be a bit difficult.

185
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,040
On my face..

186
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,940
There are many things popping up on my face.

187
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,250
My face is very sensitive, so it's having a major breakout.

188
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,340
I can't even take a step outside my house right now because of my face.

189
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:48,860
You know, a woman's skin is her pride.

190
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,470
Oh, that's a big deal.

191
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,670
You must be very worried.

192
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,570
Have you tried tea tree?

193
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,800
Tea tree?

194
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,710
Tea tree oil, it's good for acne.

195
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,760
Oh, tea tree!

196
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:15,530
Actually, I've been pasting my face with that.

197
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,330
Then, it should get a little better.

198
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,100
The painting will be delivered like it should.

199
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,490
But please think about it again.

200
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,220
If you want, I can draw you a new one.

201
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,810
Well, that's not a bad offer.

202
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,030
I will think about it.

203
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,290
Do you possibly have a child?

204
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,520
A child?

205
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,400
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

206
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,520
Out of all the paintings, you chose the child painting.

207
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,050
Yes, I do.

208
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,680
A very pretty child.

209
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:31,370
If there's a chance, I would like to see your child, too.

210
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,610
If we could do that..

211
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,330
that would be really good.

212
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:50,770
Whenever, when your face gets better, please give me a call.

213
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,510
Okay, then.

214
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,240
Sleep tight.

215
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,290
CEO! How can you?!

216
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,080
Even without me knowing, you went on a thief business trip?

217
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,100
A thief, you say?

218
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,040
How dare you say thief to me?

219
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:07,360
Because you unexpectedly went on a rural business trip,

220
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,580
the chairwoman asked so much about it,

221
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,640
and yet I couldn't answer any of her questions, dropping meat broth (sweat).

222
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,870
Don't do things without telling me. It really makes me upset.

223
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:32,380
Secretary Tak and Dr. Octopus, why are you both at war?

224
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,860
Why are you both so obsessed with me? If you have time to do that, then go find a girlfriend.

225
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,800
How do I have time to find a girlfriend when I have a hard enough time taking care of you?

226
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,010
A girlfriend?

227
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,950
Wait...

228
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,260
Did you perhaps...

229
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,750
Possibly, you did, didn't you?

230
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,050
Going to the exhibition that I reported to you on last time?

231
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:58,380
Oh, wait, wait. Raise you head.

232
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,310
Then Madam...

233
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,620
I mean, did you meet Artist Ellie Kim?

234
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,490
Stop tracking down other people's personal lives and

235
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:12,520
I had something delivered to your mother's house around today,

236
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,100
so bring that to me.
- How secretive is this item to send it not to my house,
but to my mother's home?

237
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,350
Discontinue your interest in me, starting today.

238
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,660
Bring my stuff. Now.

239
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,410
I seem a little dumb today, don't I?

240
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,590
What do you mean like a dummy?

241
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,590
You're cute.
-Say something that suits me, considering I'm this big.

242
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,190
I've never seen it before, but that expression right now

243
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,740
must look like the younger you.

244
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,440
It's a good moment, so don't be afraid. You've waited so long for this.

245
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,060
Mi Young,

246
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,530
thank you so much for coming with me.

247
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,790
Oppa...

248
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,630
- Oppa, I missed you.
- Oppa.

249
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,870
I really missed you.

250
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,450
Oppa...

251
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,650
Mi Young...

252
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,100
Mi Young...

253
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,180
The DNA results are a 99% match and

254
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,890
she says the scar behind her neck is from her childhood.

255
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,280
Thank you very much.

256
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,930
It's times like this when I feel the importance of my work.

257
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,760
Congratulations to the two of you. Then...

258
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,610
Mi Young, it was hard, right?

259
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,240
I have so many things to say, Oppa.

260
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,510
Hello, but this person is..?

261
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,020
Ah, Kim Mi Young...

262
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,060
Her name is Ellie Kim, she's an artist who paints.

263
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,570
She's the closest person to me.

264
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,150
Hello. Kim Mi Young.

265
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,520
Yes, hello.

266
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:00,560
Mi Young, are you hungry? What do you want to eat? I will buy it for you.

267
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,890
Let's go.

268
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,550
No.

269
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,780
You both must have so many things to talk about.

270
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,030
Sincere congratulations to the both of you.
I'll be leaving first.

271
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,030
I will call you later.

272
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,360
Are you really going to be like this? Why can't you focus today?

273
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,840
It's really hot. Let us rest a little bit.

274
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,710
Teacher Kang, it's really difficult. I don't want to do it.

275
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,180
Seriously. Let us rest a little.

276
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,420
Are you all really going to not pull yourselves together?

277
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,470
Everyone take off your pointe shoes.

278
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,700
Wow! Look so delicious!

279
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,440
Cool!

280
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,850
Wow! I will eat it well.

281
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,540
Teacher, can we eat all of this?

282
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,660
Of course.

283
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,260
You should eat and die.

284
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,760
The sun will still rise tomorrow and one bowl of ice cream won't ruin your lives.

285
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,950
I can guarantee that fact. Okay?

286
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,480
Yes. I'm so happy this really seems like a dream.

287
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,670
Let's eat and die!
-Let's eat and die!

288
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,980
This is really delicious.

289
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,900
Why aren't you eating? Let's eat together.

290
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,930
I have something else I always eat.

291
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,510
Eat, eat, eat.
- Your ice cream is up.

292
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,610
Thank you.

293
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,910
If stone like Ahjussi

294
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,570
contacted me a little more first, I wouldn't need anything else.

295
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,170
This doesn't seem to suit our household.

296
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,200
Gun.

297
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,480
Mi Young,

298
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,610
did things go well?

299
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,950
It takes a lot of energy to play the brother role correctly.

300
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,930
You were drawing.

301
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,490
Is it mother and her baby?
- Yes.

302
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:07,640
The person who bought Le Soupir drawing has a child.

303
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,440
So I was going to draw something new and give it to her.

304
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,700
So you'll be getting that drawing back?

305
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,620
I have a feeling she will.

306
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,320
She seems like a nice person.

307
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,070
How was it with your sister today?

308
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,810
She must have wanted to do a lot of things with her brother. I got dragged around everywhere.

309
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,210
My body feels a little tired, but I feel great.

310
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:32,590
What's wrong with feeling a little tired after waiting your whole life.

311
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,930
I know.

312
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,820
Then you're eating with my sister for sure tomorrow.

313
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,760
Sounds good.
- Continue working and I'm going to look around.

314
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,440
You're going to keep watching?

315
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,350
Of course. Watching you draw is one of my joys.

316
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,090
I have the right to do that.

317
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,780
Yes, Teacher.

318
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,650
You're completely entitled to do so.

319
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:19,260
Wow, if our Dog Poopie would have been born, she would have looked like this.

320
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,500
Dog Poopie, hi.

321
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,780
This is what Mom must have thought.

322
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,850
Wait a moment.

323
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,110
Young Ja, I am returning back to France soon.

324
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,990
Has your face gotten better?

325
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,700
Going back? Going back already?

326
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,060
This is the first time being back after 3 years.

327
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,840
What's the point of coming back if you're barely staying?

328
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,010
She must be very busy.

329
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,720
What do I do?

330
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,990
Sit here.

331
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,850
Ah, it's okay.

332
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,330
Yes. Thank you.

333
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,800
How old is the child?

334
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,910
He's two years old.

335
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,400
Ah, he's so cute.

336
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,650
Yes.

337
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,450
I am Ellie.

338
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,670
A business meeting?

339
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:14,690
Our rival company has been focusing on getting new products out targeting women in their 20s for the past three months,

340
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,590
so our product sales are going down.

341
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,380
I already know all of that. So what's our plan?

342
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,030
CEO, according to our research,

343
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,640
young women strongly look at the product image.

344
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,350
So, even if the quality is very good,

345
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:33,140
if the visual effects are weak, then their desire to purchase

346
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,940
definitely drops, per research.

347
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,030
So, I propose launching an image ad campaign

348
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:44,060
with the artworks of women artists who understand
what women want.

349
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,310
Who are the finalists for the artists?

350
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,890
First, Artist Lee Bo Ra.

351
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,380
Second, Artist Jang Chae Rin.

352
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,770
Third, Artist Shin Su Ji.

353
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,680
And finally, coming from Paris...

354
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,570
Artist Ellie Kim!

355
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,890
She's now the big trend and rising star, Ellie Kim.

356
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:09,570
I strongly, strongly recommend her.

357
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,770
Who promoted that dragon?

358
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,220
You did.
-Oh, I did?

359
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,200
It can't be Ellie Kim.

360
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,910
The phenomenon that welcomes people without
verifying how they'll do domestically

361
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:32,130
only because they came from abroad...
Definitely, absolutely, not allowed!

362
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,170
Of course! (Such phenomenon) should be gone, of course.

363
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,480
So, I prepared this.

364
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,560
This file, yes, the verification file.

365
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,070
CEO, look at this.

366
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:46,430
Domestically, sweet opinions from critics...

367
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,380
It's all attached there.

368
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,380
You need to separate work from your personal life, CEO.

369
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,800
Nice!
- Freeze.

370
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,460
Yes.

371
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,620
We shouldn't meet again.

372
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,770
Why aren't you eating?

373
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,910
Are you on a diet?

374
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,390
I'm not!

375
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,410
Why would I do that?

376
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,130
I have dinner plans later.

377
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,100
There are not many days left for you to stay in Korea, right?

378
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,220
Yeah, time flies by so fast.

379
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,890
But still, you...

380
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:46,880
Do you still prefer France to here?

381
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,440
I heard you got offers from Korean companies.

382
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,680
Wow, you're really awesome, Mi Young.

383
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,350
Can't you just work in Korea?

384
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,670
Hamo, hamo.
What's the point of going all the way overseas and suffering?

385
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:08,520
When your family is here. I'm here, too.

386
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,050
For now, I want to stay in Paris a little longer.

387
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,690
And I have to study some more, too.

388
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,660
That's right. There's no rush.

389
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:22,180
Whatever people say, living with your mind at ease is the best.

390
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,530
Who? The handsome Daniel?

391
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,490
No.

392
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,960
Sister-in-law, you don't know how much I missed you.

393
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,710
I thought of you a lot, too.

394
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,500
Really?

395
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,430
You changed your name and you've become more beautiful, too.

396
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,200
Your whole body exudes confidence.

397
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,640
You've also become really awesome.

398
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,480
You're more mature and more confident.

399
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,050
As usual, whenever I meet you, I always gain strength.

400
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,140
Over here.
-Is someone coming over?

401
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:08,730
Uh, why are you...

402
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,650
You, Dragon.. are you spitting fire on me?

403
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:20,300
I wanted to officially introduce you to Artist Ellie Kim.

404
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
Brother-in-law...

405
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,880
I think she's the perfect artist for this project.

406
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,810
I don't think it's right that you eliminated her because you know her personally.

407
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,470
Project?

408
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,340
As part of an image marketing
in collaboration with female artists...

409
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,310
to capture the fading hearts of women.

410
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:39,280
Stop it.
- I'm sorry.

411
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,840
Well then, CEO and Artist Kim, I will take my leave so you can have a formal meeting.

412
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,680
Brother-in-law...

413
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:51,710
That brat doing useless things.

414
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,680
We meet again.

415
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,480
Yes.

416
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:12,140
The reason I was there that time was..

417
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,740
I think there was a misunderstanding.

418
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,300
It's not a misunderstanding.

419
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,490
Lee Gun, you were drunk and were banging on my door.

420
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:27,090
You were yelling and passed out in front of my door.

421
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:32,050
I could've acted like I didn't know you, but at one time...

422
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,090
"At one time..."

423
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:41,380
Yes, at one time.

424
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:47,370
Have you been doing well?

425
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,380
I've been doing great, as you can see.

426
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,350
Your style changed a lot.

427
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,850
You're healthy, right?

428
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,840
I'm healthy. Yeah, healthy. I'm healthy.

429
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,510
Then that's a relief.

430
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,660
I'll get going first.

431
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,120
Wait, Miss Kim Mi Young.

432
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,830
You're here, anyway.

433
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:25,230
I think at least explaining what kind of work it is, is basic respect.

434
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,960
That project..

435
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,730
Please go find another artist.

436
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,740
I think it would be hard for me.

437
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,820
Why?

438
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,660
I'm more expensive than you think.

439
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,560
That's not a problem at all. All I have is money as you know.

440
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,730
That's not a problem at all.

441
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:54,860
And.. I think it's best if we don't see each other in anyway.

442
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:03,150
Now, I'm not the Kim Mi Young you knew before.

443
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,450
Just like

444
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,190
you're not the same Lee Gun from the past.

445
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,760
Even if we can't do anything about our past,

446
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,670
at least from now on, let's not create
uncomfortable situations for both.

447
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,130
I think you misunderstood, Ms. Kim Mi Young,

448
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,160
I have no interest in you whatsoever. Not whatsoever.

449
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,760
Yeah, that one time.

450
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,130
I hoped you lived a better life.

451
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,480
Well right now, meeting each other and starting over again is..

452
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,300
Don't worry, don't worry at all.

453
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,520
Yeah, don't worry.

454
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,100
That's a relief.

455
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,660
Please don't ever change your mind.

456
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,680
Snail, you've changed a lot.

457
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,510
This isn't even sweet.

458
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,440
You did a good job, Kim Mi Young.

459
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,680
Good job.

460
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,300
You definitely said you'd split 6 to 4.

461
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,900
You can't say something else later.

462
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,960
Hey, hey. He's the executive director of that Biennale or whatever,

463
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,990
and he's like a prince in that field.

464
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,760
The more you get out of him, the larger your share will be.

465
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,440
Work hard.

466
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,490
So it depends on the performance, right?

467
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,570
Leave it to me.

468
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:39,520
Wow, since I'm with the two Mi Youngs I love the most,

469
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,920
I don't even have to eat and I'm full.

470
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,160
Oppa?

471
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,210
Actually, I have something to say.

472
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,690
What is it? Tell me.

473
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,610
I am getting married next month.

474
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,060
Married?

475
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,920
You're getting married?

476
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,670
Congratulations.

477
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,450
Yes.

478
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:10,910
As you know, I don't have any parents

479
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,750
and don't have any skills, so

480
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:17,520
I thought I would be sad on the wedding day.

481
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:24,850
Mi Young, from now on I'll take care of everything you need for the wedding.

482
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,520
I think I placed a burden on you.

483
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,820
What are you saying? You're my one and only little sister.

484
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,700
Don't worry about anything.

485
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,260
It's the chief..

486
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,830
Continue eating. I have to take this call.

487
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:55,340
Mi young.
- Yes, what?

488
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,490
Listen carefully to what I say.

489
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,510
What are you saying?

490
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,920
Strangely, I don't think you're the real Mi Young.

491
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,240
What did you say?!
- I saw you.

492
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,300
I saw you with the guy from the detective agency earlier.

493
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,980
That...

494
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,720
That person is the person who I'm marrying.

495
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,650
That's why I came with him. Did I do something wrong?
- But why did you, in front of Daniel,

496
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,230
act like you didn't know him?

497
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,950
I heard that a DNA test is possible with things like this.

498
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,360
Having the test redone might make you feel badly, but please understand.

499
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,020
That is...

500
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:44,710
Daniel has been desperately searching
for his sister for a very long time.

501
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:49,900
He's not someone who you can fool or hurt.

502
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:56,030
To me, he's a very special and thankful person.

503
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,740
So I won't let that happen.

504
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,500
This is funny.

505
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,450
I hear he's successful and makes a lot of money
because he got adopted into a rich family.

506
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:10,390
Since he wants to find his sister now that he's in good shape,
all I did was help him out.

507
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,230
What's so wrong with sharing some when we are both orphans?

508
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,320
It's would be better to hold a knife to him and ask him for money.

509
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,330
Do you know what's the worst thing in the world?

510
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:23,280
Using someone's sincerity.

511
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,760
This is something a person should never do to another person.

512
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,360
Who do you think you are to meddle?!

513
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,760
What is this...?

514
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,830
You must be shocked.

515
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,960
I really thought this was the last time.

516
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,110
I must have been blinded.

517
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,060
I feel so foolish.

518
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:37,430
No, why would the victim be stupid?

519
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:40,790
People who do that stuff are stupid.

520
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:47,660
Every time I came to Korea, I always came here.

521
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,940
If I sit here,

522
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,560
I thought I would meet my sister.

523
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,730
Oppa, if we go up high there, we can see where Mom and Dad are. Right?

524
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,860
Of course, we can see them.

525
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,430
Let's find Mom and Dad with Oppa.

526
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:13,500
Okay, sounds good.

527
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,860
Oppa, I want to eat ice cream.

528
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,660
Mi Young wants to eat ice cream?
- Mhm!

529
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:29,700
Sit here and don't move. Oppa will buy you ice cream.
- Okay.

530
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,280
Wait there!
- Okay!

531
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,140
Oh! There's ice cream here!

532
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,400
Oppa will buy ice cream,

533
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,690
so don't move and wait.

534
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,200
Okay, Oppa!

535
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:54,900
Sell a lot.

536
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,930
Give me only two ice creams.

537
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,600
Ice cream? Okay.

538
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,200
Mi Young!

539
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,090
Mi Young, where are you?

540
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:16,670
Mi Young!

541
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,070
Really,

542
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,410
I should have never left my sister alone.

543
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,850
It's my fault.

544
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,290
That is definitely not your fault.

545
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:52,170
Daniel, you were at an age where you deserved someone's love and care.

546
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,800
That little child who thought everything was his fault...

547
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,350
please forgive him now.

548
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,800
Thank you, Mi Young.

549
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:16,160
I'll be your younger sister for today.

550
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,690
Did you forget? My name is also Kim Mi Young.

551
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,480
Mi Young.

552
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:35,240
I want to stop now.

553
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:38,900
Finding my younger sister...

554
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,560
I want to stop now.

555
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,660
I just want to believe that she's living well somewhere,

556
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:56,220
and live my own life now.

557
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,370
Daniel...

558
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:05,080
I want to make a real family of my own.

559
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:29,360
I have something I need to tell you before I go to Paris.

560
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,830
Let's meet at the theater.

561
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,820
This is Lee Young Ja. My face has finally returned to normal.

562
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:52,200
Oh, really? That's a relief.

563
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,220
Tea tree oil is very effective.

564
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,660
All the pimples went away quickly.

565
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,360
I guess you had pimple troubles of your own.

566
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,710
But why aren't you sleeping yet?

567
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,970
To be honest, there's a concern.

568
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,550
A concern? If there's a concern, tell me.

569
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:17,170
I will listen to them all, as your number one fan.

570
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:25,130
I feel a little iffy about saying it to someone I don't know much.

571
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:29,680
It's actually easier to tell since you don't know me well.

572
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,470
And we're both women.

573
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:59,340
To tell you the truth, today a person

574
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:03,710
told me he wanted to make a family.

575
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:09,480
A family? What does that mean?

576
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:14,890
I think that person will confess (his love) to me pretty soon.

577
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:19,600
C- Confess? If he's confessing, that means...

578
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,200
Propose?

579
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,350
Yes.

580
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:29,410
Kim Mi-!

581
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:35,850
How was your heart when you first heard those words?

582
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:39,370
What's the feeling? The feel?

583
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:43,280
The last three years,

584
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,400
if I were to make another family with someone,

585
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,580
it would be with that person.

586
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,770
I did think that.

587
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:56,250
You thought? You thought, and?

588
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:59,380
But when I actually heard it,

589
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,330
my head was filled with many thoughts,

590
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,400
on what I should do.

591
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,860
The thing with making decisions

592
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:19,470
is that you should take as much time as you need to think things through.

593
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:22,460
Otherwise, people will take you lightly.

594
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:26,470
Is marriage a joke? No, it's not.

595
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:30,560
Right? So you need to think over your thoughts and worry about your worries.

596
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,300
You know cows, right? They need to digest their food over and over again.

597
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,360
You need to make your decisions like that.

598
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:40,610
So, what did you decide to do? The conclusion...
What did you decide to do?

599
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,980
I don't know why I'm even having this conversation with you.

600
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,490
I apologize for burdening you.

601
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:51,140
No, not at all!

602
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,880
You really don't need to apologize.

603
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,540
This is how you're supposed to use someone who's lived longer.

604
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:02,120
Are you older than me, by any chance?

605
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,520
Yes, I am. By a lot.

606
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,570
Being your number one fan,

607
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:12,350
would I not know about you?
I know everything about you.

608
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:14,550
Then...

609
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:18,270
can I call you unni?
*unni: older sister

610
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:20,080
Unni?

611
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,710
Unni?

612
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,200
Unni.

613
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:32,570
Unni.

614
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,040
Where have I heard this before?

615
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:39,060
How should I respond to this?

616
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,670
Hyung-nim,

617
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,090
what are you doing here?

618
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,690
Why aren't you sleeping, and scaring people like that?

619
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,520
What are you doing here?

620
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,630
Don't worry about it, and just go inside.

621
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:57,290
Hyung-nim, for our project,

622
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,260
can't we have Artist Ellie Kim somehow?

623
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,400
Dragon, won't you go inside before I tear your wings off
and make you a serpent?!

624
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,000
Freeze!

625
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:05,380
Freeze!

626
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,020
Freeze!

627
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,030
Dragon, you...

628
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:53,110
Thank you so much.

629
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,080
Thank you.

630
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,180
Thank you.

631
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:09,750
Thank you.

632
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:14,830
Thank you.
- Thank you.

633
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:19,440
I can't drink this because it's so pretty.

634
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,460
This is all I can do for everyone who's working so hard for me.

635
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,680
We're so touched that you even remember us individually.

636
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,100
I've never met someone so angelic like you
during the 10 years I spent in this field.

637
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,620
I agree.

638
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,530
Thank you.

639
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:35,160
Thank you.

640
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,110
Look! This really looks like me.

641
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,700
You haven't forgotten our date today, right?

642
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:48,130
Doori Little Theater at 8.

643
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,520
Ellie Kim

644
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,300
Hey,

645
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,400
why are you concerned over this?

646
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:05,190
You have no right to go close to this girl.

647
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:10,740
So don't text or call her. Don't do anything.

648
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,880
Just applaud for her happiness.

649
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,040
Yeah, for her to be happy.

650
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,590
Ellie Kim

651
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,470
I'm leaving Korea tomorrow.

652
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:33,080
I trust you will treasure that child (painting), and leave her in your care.

653
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,750
I'm sorry I couldn't see you before I left.

654
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,480
Always be healthy.

655
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,590
Are you really leaving like this??

656
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:51,010
Where are you right now?

657
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:59,480
I'm in front of Doori Little Theater right now.

658
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:14,900
I want to return your painting to you. Let's meet right now.

659
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,740
♬ My tears remember ♬

660
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:25,660
Thank you for yielding the painting to me.
♬ It fills up ♬

661
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:30,880
I thought I wouldn't be able to see you before I left.
♬ your seat again. I try erasing ♬

662
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:38,870
Please let me know when you arrive.
♬ but I can’t erase you. You've become ♬

663
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:46,020
♬ my everything ♬

664
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:55,290
♬ Oh you, I can’t see you, I can’t hear you ♬

665
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:58,630
♬ But I’m okay ♬

666
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:05,620
♬ Goodbyes are sad, my heart aches ♬

667
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:14,230
♬ But if you are happy, if you can smile, ♬

668
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:23,800
♬ Then I... I will miss you the more I erase you ♬

669
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:30,730
♬ I will shed more tears than today ♬

670
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:39,950
♬ Like fate, I won’t ever have anyone like you ♬

671
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,290
After losing his little sister, one lonely man

672
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:54,760
met a lonely woman who lost her child.

673
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:04,650
The two people began to share their loneliness with each other.

674
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:15,320
I think I'm pregnant.
- Excuse me.

675
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,810
Be strong!

676
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,610
Father..

677
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:23,430
Don't be afraid, and be strong.

678
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:41,240
Interestingly, it was hard to overcome alone,

679
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:49,480
but it wasn't hard at all when we were together.
♬ I will miss you the more I erase you ♬

680
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:56,420
♬ I will shed more tears than today ♬

681
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:03,060
Like that, the two people will never get tired until the end.
♬ Like fate, I won’t ever have anyone like you ♬

682
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:09,230
They will build a sturdy house, live together forever,
♬ Only you, only you ♬

683
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:20,370
and live happily ever after.
♬ As much as my tears, I hope you are happy ♬

684
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:27,470
♬ You will think of me at least once ♬

685
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:40,680
♬ That’s all I need, until the day we meet again ♬

686
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:47,870
♬ That’s all I need, until the day we meet again ♬

687
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:57,950
♬ I’ll wait, it’s only a momentary goodbye ♬

688
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:02,070
♬ Good bye, my love ♬

689
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,990
Mi Young,

690
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:19,900
can you become my real family?

691
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:42,330
♬ You came to me like a coincidence ♬

692
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:48,430
♬ And took my whole heart ♬

693
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:56,190
♬ Are you aware of my beating heart ♬

694
00:59:56,190 --> 01:00:00,410
What is your true purpose in wanting to work with my company?

695
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,800
By any chance, is it because of my wife?

696
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,530
It's because of Mi Young. I guess this worries you.

697
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:08,970
You should've done better before I crossed the line.

698
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,350
I think you're a little too late.

699
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:14,640
Can't we just stop?

700
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,740
It's not his Dog Poopie, but ours. How can I stop here?

701
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:24,360
It won't be easy. I'm skilled in discovering rough gemstones.

702
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,170
And Mi Young is the greatest gemstone.
