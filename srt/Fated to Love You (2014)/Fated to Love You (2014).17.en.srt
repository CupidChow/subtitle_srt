1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,310
I am your No. 1 fan,

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,180
Lee Young Ja.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,980
Episode 17

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,760
How can you do something like this?

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,700
For the past three years,

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,190
do you know with what heart I tried to forget you?

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,250
How can you play a joke like this on me?

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,190
What reason do you have to do this?

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,630
Do I need a fancy reason?

10
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,410
What did you say?

11
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,560
My ex-wife became a really famous painter,

12
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,950
I heard of the gallery opening, so I went there out of curiosity.

13
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,440
Even this painting, I liked it when I saw it.

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,840
That's why I bought it.

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,300
Then you suddenly called, and that's
when everything became complicated.

16
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,050
So why did you want something back when someone
already bought it? It's making both of us exhausted.

17
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,000
Seriously,

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,640
the more I get to know you, you really are something.

19
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:31,690
After playing me and making a fool out of me,
now you are saying that it's my fault?

20
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,310
Then,

21
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,210
what about the things you told me?

22
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,010
What about that heart that comforted and embraced me?

23
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,960
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,510
There was nothing I could do. I would be funny if I stepped in myself.

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,000
That's fake. It's fake. I made a mistake.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,790
I'm sorry. Sorry.

27
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,600
Do you know what kind of person Unnie Young Ja was to me?

28
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,850
"Ah! I've met someone who can understand what I feel."

29
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,650
"I've met someone who recognize the paintings I draw."

30
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,390
I was comforted that much. I was that much thankful.

31
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,650
Let's stop here. I get it. So say no more.

32
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,120
The only thing that I need to apologize to you for

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,620
was not saying that I was Lee Young Ja. That's it.

34
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:45,400
Truthfully, it wasn't easy to reveal that. You firmly believed in it.

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,220
It seems like you, Lee Gun, have become
the worst in the past three years.

36
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,900
Right.

37
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,390
Well, I can't do anything if you think like that.

38
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,750
Miss Kim Mi Young,

39
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,340
it's really pathetic.

40
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,230
How can it be that for the past three years until now
you still haven't changed one bit?

41
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,920
Like a fool, always getting deceived by people,

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,020
always believing them.

43
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,910
Just when will you fix that attitude of yours?

44
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,830
So, like a foolish bear...

45
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,640
you are here drawing pictures like this.

46
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,280
Get out!

47
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,980
Right now.

48
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,640
I will.

49
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,420
Before I go, I will give back this painting that you want so much.

50
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,570
I don't know how precious

51
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,220
and how meaningful this painting is to you,

52
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,230
but to me...

53
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,040
it's just one painting.

54
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,090
♬ My tears remember ♬

55
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,480
Get out.
(speaking informally)

56
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,620
♬ It fills up your place again ♬

57
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:21,950
♬ I try erasing, but I can’t erase you ♬

58
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:31,070
♬ You’ve become my everything ♬

59
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,970
♬ Oh you, I can’t see you, ♬

60
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,390
♬  I can’t hear you ♬

61
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:48,300
♬ But I’m okay. Goodbyes are sad, ♬

62
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,030
♬ my heart aches ♬

63
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,820
For the past three years,
♬ But if you are happy, ♬

64
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,790
do you know with what heart I tried to forget you?
♬ if you can smile, then I… ♬

65
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,570
That's why you should forget.

66
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,440
You foolish snail.

67
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,320
Just please forget me.

68
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,850
♬ I will shed more tears than today ♬

69
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:25,310
♬ Like fate, I hope you are happy ♬

70
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,440
♬ Good bye my love ♬

71
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:41,850
♬ My heart already knew ♬

72
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,110
♬ You’ve become my heart ♬

73
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:54,950
♬ Oh you, I can’t have you, I can’t touch you ♬

74
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:01,860
♬ But I’m okay. Endless pain, ♬

75
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,730
♬ tears shed again. But if you are happy, ♬

76
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:16,810
♬ if you can smile, then I… ♬

77
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:23,690
♬ I will miss you the more I erase you ♬

78
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:30,370
♬ I will shed more tears than today ♬

79
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,990
♬ That’s all I need, until the day we meet again ♬

80
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:43,980
♬ Only you, only you ♬

81
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:52,390
♬ I’ll wait, it’s only a momentary good bye ♬

82
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,380
♬ Good bye my love ♬

83
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,790
Three years ago, our Jangin Chemicals,

84
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,930
after making a contract with Macau's representative resort to supply amenities,

85
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,000
it has also been showing immense stable growth in China.

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,130
That's right. So to aggressively and strategically

87
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,280
advance into the Chinese market, with

88
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,270
an E-commerce site that has high market share in China,

89
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,630
we are planning to launch our company's premium line.

90
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,890
This is the site that made the final selection.

91
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,680
Based on the trust it has built so far,
it guarantees to sell only authentic products.

92
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,820
This is an extremely hot site in China!

93
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,750
That's right.

94
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,100
Just as how our CEO always insists on authentic products and

95
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,850
how our Jangin Chemical's slogan represents family and trust,

96
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,930
you can see this as a very fitting place.

97
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,410
CEO.

98
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,940
CEO!

99
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,690
So what you're saying, Secretary Tak, is

100
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,120
that equal to the level of our company,

101
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,760
all luxury items around the world, through that site,

102
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,350
advance into the Chinese market.

103
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,390
That's right. Also.

104
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,060
Worries about the delivery...

105
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,030
Throw those all away. And we can just cha, cha, cha together.

106
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,390
CEO, you also see it, right?

107
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,600
Wrapped in this beautiful package, it is scheduled to be shipped in a very safe manner.

108
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,140
The wrapping is really good. It looks elegant

109
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,520
and clean.

110
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,030
Matching this packaging,

111
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:40,220
develop our products into the premium line and...

112
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,780
To these consumers. To our customers.

113
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,500
Please put in an effort to safely deliver our Jangin's integrity.

114
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,960
Kang Se Ra

115
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,290
Miss Mi Young, what are you doing?

116
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,800
I'm sorry, Daniel.

117
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,370
The promise I made that I would stay in Korea

118
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:50,470
until the biennial ends, I don't think I'll be able to keep it.

119
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,110
I want to go back to Paris.

120
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,090
Is it that uncomfortable to be here?

121
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,990
Do you remember the person who bought the Le Soupir before?

122
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,670
Yes.

123
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,260
It was a woman and you said you got in contact with her.

124
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,760
It turned out that person was Lee Gun.

125
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,240
Huh?

126
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,240
I'm sorry, Daniel, for showing you this side of me.

127
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,550
Eat slowly. Why are you drinking so fast?

128
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,520
Today, the alcohol is just smoothly (sool sool) going in.

129
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,710
Is that why it's called alcohol (sool)?

130
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,450
Se Ra.
- Huh?

131
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,510
A few days ago, your mother came looking for me.

132
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,230
I heard about it. I'm sorry.

133
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,310
You're having a hard time, right?
Being in just a friendly relationship with me.

134
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,670
No.

135
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,300
Let's stop now. Being friends.

136
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,940
Gun...
-You should also throw away your lingering feelings.

137
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:23,010
Our Se Ra has to be happy, too, right?

138
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,450
Why are you like that all of a sudden?

139
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,970
Se Ra,

140
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,810
no matter how much one tries,

141
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,120
no matter how much one struggles,

142
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,340
what's not meant to be doesn't work, I realized.

143
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,890
What's not meant to be

144
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,290
is just not meant to be.

145
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,900
The first project was a huge success,

146
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,770
and there are many offers for the second project.

147
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,270
I'm sad that you're leaving all of a sudden. What should I do?

148
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,560
Because of me, there might be problems with the contract.

149
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,370
I will compensate you for that.

150
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,410
We can just make changes in the contract.

151
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,750
Even when you are in Paris, we are going to continue with our brand business.

152
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,930
Thank you for all your effort.

153
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,310
Right! I received a call that they want you to attend

154
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,960
the event for women advertisers.

155
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,990
You will attend, right?

156
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,480
The commercial that we collaborated with Jangin Chemicals received great attention from women.

157
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,890
I think it will be good as the last event before you go back to Paris. What do you think?

158
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,920
I will think about it.

159
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,950
Mi Young-!

160
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,660
Ellie Kim!

161
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,710
Ji Yeon!

162
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,010
Wow, Unnie! This is really great!

163
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,690
I've always known your talent from the beginning.

164
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,980
You've always been good at drawing.

165
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,520
But why are you going to Paris instead of staying here?

166
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,000
Just because it's more comfortable there.

167
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,540
Still, it can't be as comfortable as Korea, where you family lives.

168
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,650
That's probably right.

169
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,240
Now that you're really doing well,

170
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,380
I have to register you as our user.

171
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,110
I actually have a high percentage of success for re-married couples.

172
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,250
Thank you for emphasizing that this is my second marriage.

173
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,360
If you register,

174
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,970
and I match you with CEO Lee Gun, would it be weird?

175
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,610
What do you mean by that? CEO Lee Gun?

176
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,260
CEO Lee Gun is my VVIP customer.

177
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,220
Well, to be accurate, it was Chairwoman Wang who registered him.

178
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,010
She keeps on asking me to find a woman like you. She asks me to come once a week.

179
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,840
What do you mean that person is going on blind dates?

180
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,640
He probably has a girlfriend though.

181
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,810
What are you saying? Nothing!

182
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,920
He's been perfectly single for three years.

183
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,250
Right now, the Chairwoman is a bit

184
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,730
worried that maybe her grandson has something lacking.

185
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,090
You probably know about it.

186
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,840
How was it after confirming it?

187
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,220
Does he win during the day and lose at night?

188
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,090
Or does he lose during the day and win at night?

189
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,410
Ji Yeon.

190
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,930
By the way, are you sure that person is not with anyone?

191
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,090
What are you doing here?

192
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,880
Ah, it's quite hot today. Do you want to have some beer with me?

193
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,200
You must have been really thirsty for a drink.

194
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,220
Actually, I got rejected today.

195
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,560
Huh? Who did? Lee Gun?

196
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,090
Yes.

197
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,570
He said what's not meant to be will never be.

198
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,050
He said that even being friends is burdensome now.

199
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,270
It might be hard for you right now, but I think this is a good thing.

200
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:11,790
It would be better to stop liking someone who doesn't like you.

201
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,530
Those people are amazing.

202
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,950
He even lied to chase her away harshly three years ago,

203
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,750
but after seeing her again, he wavers again.

204
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,310
I stayed by his side waiting even though I know that he is sick.

205
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,800
It's all useless.

206
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,080
What do you mean by that? Sick?

207
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,140
What happened to Lee Gun three years ago?

208
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,350
What does that have to do with the two of them breaking up?

209
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,900
That family has a genetic disease.
Gun was diagnosed three years ago.

210
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:07,500
Knowing this, Gun purposely broke up with Kim Mi Young
so that it wouldn't be hard on her.

211
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,470
If she knew about this, do you think Kim Mi Young would still be by your side like she is now?

212
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:20,980
♬ I laugh like a fool ♬

213
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:29,440
♬ I keep thinking of you, ♬

214
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:38,680
♬  seems like coincidence ♬

215
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,970
♬ In case you see my heart, ♬

216
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:51,200
♬ I secretly look at you from far away ♬

217
00:17:53,580 --> 00:18:00,920
♬ I draw you out, then I erase you again ♬

218
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,320
♬ I stand in place and talk to myself again ♬

219
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,620
Dog Poopie!

220
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,080
You're doing well with Mom, right?

221
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:19,200
♬ When I hold out my hand and hug you tight ♬

222
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:32,080
♬ My heart wants you, you who is like destiny
I love you ♬

223
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,350
Ellie, thanks to you and this painting,

224
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,120
I, too, came to remember

225
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,350
the most beautiful and brightest moments in my life,

226
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,440
so I was really happy.

227
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,430
Even though I'm returning this painting to you,

228
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,680
I will remember you forever.

229
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,320
I will return this painting that you want so much.

230
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,530
Because, to me, it's just one painting.

231
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:22,530
♬ I think of you as I stop in place ♬

232
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,150
The most precious and shining moment in your life...

233
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,110
is it because it's your work, Ellie Kim?

234
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,540
It's great being under the same sky as you, Ellie Kim.

235
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,360
Do you have a child?

236
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,430
Yes, I do.

237
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,550
A really beautiful child.

238
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,860
In an empty space in your heart...

239
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,220
there's a girl I used to know.

240
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,300
In my eyes,

241
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,770
she is really, really...

242
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,790
Impossible.

243
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,770
How is it that this is all fake?

244
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,840
Mi Young!

245
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,220
Daniel.

246
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,420
Do you want to have a bet on who runs the fastest? The person who loses has to buy drinks.

247
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,830
That makes no sense.
- What do you mean "It makes no sense"?

248
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,260
Aigoo.

249
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,910
Aigoo, I'm so tired.

250
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,340
Wow. After I said that, you run after me as if it was a chase.

251
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,890
Thank you for buying me these shoes.

252
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,320
But after buying these shoes, I am seriously regretting my decision.
- Why?

253
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,740
I heard of a saying that if you buy someone shoes, they will run away.

254
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,580
After hearing that, I was thinking that maybe I shouldn't have bought them.

255
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,710
In the case that I suddenly lose my memory,

256
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:35,480
I will assign all of my authority as the CEO of Jangin Chemicals to Chairwoman Wang.

257
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,900
And I would like Chief Secretary Tak Goo Dae to assist Chairwoman Wang

258
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,820
and take on the responsibilities of a management specialist as the CEO.

259
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,350
As for my half brother Lee Yong, he will be promoted to become the Managing Director.

260
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,010
So that he will officially be able to learn to manage the company.

261
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,360
Even if I happen to suddenly faint,

262
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,480
and perhaps something does happen to go wrong,

263
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,970
all these truths must be hidden from Kim Mi Young.

264
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,010
Never, surely without Kim Mi Young knowing!

265
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:15,600
I would like you to execute the previously stated conditions.

266
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:23,320
After organizing the statements according to the recordings, these are the conditions of the will.

267
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,390
And I heard that you wanted to add another condition.

268
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:48,630
I purchased an atelier in France recently.

269
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,620
Is there a casual way to present this to that person?

270
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,040
You should stop writing these useless letters.

271
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:04,030
Why don't you just explain it to Mi Young?

272
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,950
I...

273
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,500
I don't have the right to do that.

274
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,430
To Mi Young, receiving this kind of will won't be touching.

275
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,240
Instead, she is a person who will be filled with guilt and sorrow.

276
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,350
I don't believe this is for Kim Mi Young.

277
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,940
Mr. CEO, Artist Ellie Kim has made a visit.

278
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,490
I will be leaving first.

279
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,250
Mi Young.

280
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,480
Everything has officially been completed.

281
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,280
For what reason did you visit me?

282
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:13,520
I am returning the payment you made for the painting.

283
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,700
Look here, Miss Ellie Kim. I have a lot of money.

284
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,440
I believe you have made a nonsensical walk here.

285
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:28,010
Since this event occurred on my behalf, I also included a penalty payment.

286
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,180
For both of us, the calculation...

287
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,430
It's good to do it accurately.

288
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,280
Why this?

289
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,670
The things written here... What I mean is...

290
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:04,310
Those are meaningless words that you have written

291
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:08,140
in order to pretend that you were Lee Young Ja, right?

292
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,030
Yes. Did I do something wrong?

293
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,660
I understand.

294
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,590
Ah, I am leaving for Paris tomorrow.

295
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,160
You're leaving earlier than previously planned.

296
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,240
I don't think Seoul and I match.

297
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,950
Well, that could be the case.

298
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,370
But last time,

299
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,850
the words you spoke about being happy that you were under the same sky as me...

300
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,080
Those were also words spoken by you, not Young Ja, right?

301
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,500
Those were lies that had no sincerity behind them, right?

302
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,120
Kim Mi Young, you are very strange today.

303
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,010
Why do you keep asking those useless questions?

304
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,710
Thinking back knowing that you were Young Ja,

305
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,910
there were so many things that were very strange.

306
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,430
Look here, Miss Ellie Kim,

307
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:12,520
I am a person that doesn't have time to chat with you right now.

308
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,720
Leave now.

309
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,570
It's very strange, right?
- What else is strange?

310
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,670
Why does it seem like you are always nervous around me?

311
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,300
Even after you have revealed that you have been Young Ja.

312
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,640
Aren't you going to leave?

313
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,570
Lawyer Hong.

314
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,610
Oh, Miss Mi Young.

315
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,360
I waited for you because it seemed like you were going to be out quickly.

316
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,460
You are returning to Paris?
- Yes.

317
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,070
In the contract you signed with your agency, you promised to stay in Seoul a bit longer.

318
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,220
Things happened that way.

319
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,990
Thankfully, the CEO was understanding.

320
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,550
Ah, I see.

321
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,650
Thank you for paying so much attention in regards to this contract, Lawyer Hong.

322
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:25,920
Ah, no. It's nothing... Between us.

323
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,250
Look.

324
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,180
Miss Mi Young.
- Yes?

325
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,040
With CEO Lee Gun...

326
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,280
do you have any thoughts of getting back with him?

327
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,800
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

328
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,970
Well... You both look good together.

329
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,990
I was wondering why you broke up.

330
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,790
Truthfully, I don't know why either.

331
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:57,350
Three years ago, why he had to push me away like that...

332
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,910
I don't know the reason either.

333
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,910
At that time,

334
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:07,420
I was having such a hard time I wasn't able to deeply think about it.

335
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,770
But now, I am a little...

336
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,780
I am starting to get curious about it.

337
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,160
Look, Miss Mi Young...

338
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,620
No, no, ah...

339
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,390
Do you have something you want to tell me?

340
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,830
No, I...

341
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:34,790
France, no... P-Paris. After you come back, I want to see you.

342
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:38,350
Yes, me too.

343
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,790
Um, everything is normal.

344
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,290
You are very healthy.

345
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,450
You have taken good care of your body, appropriate for your age.

346
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,860
Yes, I did my best at the company! And my dating life, faithfully!

347
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,220
Well, I am living with this attitude.

348
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,660
But Doctor, why are you suddenly looking after me as well?

349
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,780
I am your household's physician. And you are a descendant of the Lee Family.

350
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,780
So, of course, I must look after you.

351
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,950
Doctor, thank you very much.

352
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,940
But...

353
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:28,790
You, too, never know when the genetic disease will appear like your hyung-nim.

354
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,960
So don't be too careless.

355
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,950
And try your best like you have been doing.

356
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,850
Yes.

357
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,590
What?!

358
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,280
What do you mean by Hyung-nim's genetic disease?!

359
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,500
Chairman, something is weird with Gun.

360
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,670
I think that the genetic disease has progressed.
- Genetic disease?

361
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:52,000
Yong heard as he went to the physician for a health checkup.

362
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,350
I already knew about it.

363
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,670
But I didn't know that it would occur to Gun.

364
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,890
Mother in law... no...

365
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,930
If the old woman finds out about it, the shock will be tremendous. So, don't tell anyone and keep it to yourself.

366
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,230
Yes, of course.

367
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,850
I will not rashly reveal that information.

368
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:15,810
Why would I hastily reveal a weakness within our family? What good would that do for our family?

369
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,030
I'm sorry to contact you so suddenly.

370
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,670
I have something I wanted to tell you today.

371
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,390
Yes, go ahead.

372
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,810
Three years ago,

373
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,820
there was a time when we met just you and I, right?

374
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,840
There was.

375
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,480
Do you recall the documents I showed you?

376
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,280
He said he wanted to give you the baby and be done with you.

377
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,160
Of course.

378
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,370
How could I forget that?

379
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:09,060
Do you still believe that document was drafted by Gun?

380
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,870
Yes.

381
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,170
You've been mistaken, Kim Mi Young.

382
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,100
I...

383
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,230
I did it.

384
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,740
What do you mean?

385
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:26,540
I mistakenly believed that I could change Gun's mind if you left.

386
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,350
I created it all myself.

387
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,440
Se Ra.

388
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,800
I won't ask to be forgiven.

389
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,750
If something went wrong because of me,

390
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,670
I wanted to correct it now.

391
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,490
Also Gun is currently...

392
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,840
No, I'll stop now.

393
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,270
My pride won't let me go any further.

394
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:58,430
You unwind the twisted past your way.

395
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:02,580
This is all I can say.

396
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,390
Hello.

397
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,640
Please sit down over there.

398
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,560
I loved your commercial.
-Hello.

399
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,510
- Hello.
- Hello.

400
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,680
This is CEO Han.

401
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,870
Hello.

402
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,810
You are very popular!

403
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,220
You're here.

404
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,220
Hello, Artist Ellie Kim.

405
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,730
You're much more beautiful in person.

406
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,770
Ah! Hello.

407
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,870
But...

408
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,240
What?

409
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,690
Are you going to say I look a lot like someone else?

410
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,470
I've met some others that looked just like you in the past.

411
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,130
Of course, we should look identical.

412
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,830
We are triplets.

413
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,670
I'm the oldest. The big sister.

414
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:04,610
♪ I eat alone, and I alone...!
Ohhhh... ♪

415
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,560
I'm babbling again.
Ha, ha!

416
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,990
I'm sorry.

417
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,960
Thank you please look fondly on me.

418
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,270
I should be the one asking you.

419
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,320
You heard that we were going to have simple conversation?

420
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,700
Yes.

421
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,860
But I'm not very good at talking, so I don't know if it will be entertaining.

422
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,600
I'm in charge of babbling, so don't worry.

423
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,160
There is some time left. Should we have a cup of tea and wait?

424
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,980
Yes, let's do.

425
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,250
My dance move was just fine, right?

426
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,870
Yes!

427
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,800
Woman of the month, which was chosen by a panel of women advertisers.

428
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,470
We are talking with artist Ellie Kim.

429
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:55,320
The advertisement image that you've just seen with Jangin Chemical's collaboration..

430
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:02,660
It is being critically acclaimed that, "it has awoken the somber feminine sentiments with a touch of spring breeze!"

431
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:07,110
Shall we ask the artist a question?

432
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:11,830
"In every woman's heart lives a girl."

433
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:16,490
How did you come about this wondering concept?

434
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,320
That is...

435
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,880
That concept came from...

436
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:37,140
That concept actually wasn't my thought.

437
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,990
Someone else gave me the inspiration.

438
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,780
Inspiration?

439
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,880
Everyone, inspiration.

440
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,990
This word is like a treasure to us, advertisers! Don't you think?

441
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,240
Who was it?

442
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,900
Who was the person that gave you this wonderful inspiration?

443
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:59,710
There was a sister that I used to really like, trust and follow.

444
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:05,190
At first she bought the picture that I cherished the most.

445
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:09,150
I came to know her as a fan through this.

446
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:14,400
When things were rough or when I had fallen in a slump...

447
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,830
Always, in my perspective,

448
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:23,950
she listened to my words,

449
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:29,710
and warmly embraced me. She was someone that I am very thankful for.

450
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,000
It's not easy to meet someone so special.

451
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,990
Do you still stay in contact with her?

452
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:41,450
We suddenly lost contact so I don't know where she is right now.

453
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,050
However,

454
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,250
I really want to say thank you to her.

455
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,240
I don't know how it was for her, but

456
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,960
I was sincere.

457
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,530
Everyone. What are you doing?
Give her a round of applause.

458
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,020
Here.

459
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:33,160
How can you leave so abruptly after saying you'd be here for a while?

460
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,800
No matter how much I think about it,
I feel more comfortable over there than here.

461
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,700
You're emotionally comfortable there?

462
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,990
It was nice to see you so often,

463
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,860
but that time was too short.

464
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:58,260
Lettuce Wrap lady! Let's eat.

465
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:07,480
You're not suppose to come today. Why are you here so suddenly?

466
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,790
(mouths "get out")

467
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,260
What is it? So then what? Also?

468
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,080
So what? Then what?

469
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,100
So what then?

470
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,540
Mom.

471
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,890
Mom, set up a table for the guest.

472
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,290
How can you kick out a customer without feeding him?

473
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,230
Mi Young.

474
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,640
I'll go after I'm done eating.

475
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,240
I need to eat! Eat. Eat!

476
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,690
I enjoyed the meal, Lettuce Wrap Lady.

477
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,020
I really enjoyed it!

478
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:55,780
Also, let it be known that I won't be back again, so don't worry. Please convey my message.

479
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,130
Convey my words "don't worry, be happy."
Make sure you relay it!

480
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:08,310
I was going to say not to ever come back after eating that rice wrap for the last time anyway. Tell him that.

481
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:14,190
There is the freedom to dine anywhere in the Republic of Korea,

482
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:20,700
but that she was petty, petty, petty! Pass that on.

483
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:29,640
If I told him not to visit my mother, then he should at least pretend that he's making an effort. Tell him that.

484
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:39,190
I already repressed myself enough to the degree that I felt it was too much. Please tell her that.

485
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,030
Quiet! What are you both doing right now?

486
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,910
Are you training a mutt?!!

487
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,100
Both of you get out if you're done eating.

488
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,090
I'm not going to take obnoxious customers like you!

489
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,670
How can you talk like that to a customer?!

490
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,120
Lettuce Wrap Lady,

491
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,000
stay well.

492
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,490
Stay well.

493
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,600
Aigoo... Crazy punk.

494
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,890
What? Making it seem like he's never going to come back.

495
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:48,070
Mom, just stop letting him in.

496
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,990
It's good for neither of you.

497
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,620
Even though he's not fated for you,

498
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,540
don't hate him too much.

499
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,690
If you think about it, hating also means liking.

500
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:07,290
Tomorrow morning, I'll come to say farewell before I go to the airport.

501
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:21,730
Those two... they for sure have something...

502
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,310
Dog Poopie,

503
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:48,830
tomorrow.. Mom is leaving Korea tomorrow...

504
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:53,030
My Dog Poopie... Mom will...

505
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:58,760
become stronger, so you're

506
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,350
going to wait for me, right?

507
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,290
Our Dog Poopie...

508
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,610
I miss you a lot.

509
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,650
Dog Poopie,

510
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:27,270
Mom loves Dog Poopie a lot.

511
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,210
Dog Poopie,

512
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,830
your mom is leaving Korea again.

513
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:14,670
Dad was very greedy, so I'm getting punished right now.

514
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,840
Passport

515
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:57,180
This recorder has nothing to do with you, so don't press play.

516
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,380
This REALLY has nothing to do with you.

517
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,690
Even though if you press the middle button, it plays.

518
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:07,690
Don't ever press it. Please.

519
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:15,130
Suddenly, if I ever lose my memory,

520
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:21,140
I will assign all my authority as the CEO of the Jangin Chemicals
to Chairwoman Wang Bok Soon.

521
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:25,260
And as for Chief Secretary Tak, as the CEO,

522
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,650
he will help Chairwoman Wang and...

523
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:33,130
I want to make everything stated here hidden from Kim Mi Young.

524
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,110
Never, forever, hidden from Kim Mi Young,

525
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:40,060
I would like you to execute everything stated previously.

526
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:45,390
There mustn't be a disturbance in the operation of the Kim Mi Young foundation.

527
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:51,210
Also, celebrating Kim Mi Young's birthday every year, too.
Very meticulously!

528
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,870
Please check it.
- Yes.

529
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:57,740
You should stop writing these useless letters

530
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,980
and just tell Mi Young.

531
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,400
I... I... don't have the right to do that.

532
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,900
Mi Young.

533
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,930
Oh, Daniel
- What're you doing? We have to get going.

534
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,700
I was packing my bags.

535
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,430
Let's go.

536
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,810
Mi Young,

537
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:28,020
remember when I told you I regretted buying you those shoes?

538
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,900
You did.

539
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,050
Thinking about it...

540
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,640
I am the stupidest person in this world.

541
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,330
Even though I know I'll regret it,

542
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:50,250
I keep making the same mistakes to see you smile one more time.

543
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,120
What are you doing, Daniel.

544
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,370
If you leave like this, you're never going to forget him.

545
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:12,370
So just find out now, how he truly feels.

546
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:15,480
And what he's hiding from you.

547
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,710
Taking you to see him,

548
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,980
out of all the stupid things I've done,

549
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,050
I think this one is the best.

550
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,860
Sister-in-law left us hanging last time.

551
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,710
Is she going to be late again?

552
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:41,030
Ay.. there's a plane schedule. I think she'll come in a little bit.

553
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,900
No.

554
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,540
My prediction, I don't think she'll come.

555
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,850
Sister-in-law is good at these predictions.

556
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:53,650
Man, it feels ominous.

557
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,920
If Mi Young doesn't come...

558
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,250
The side dishes you packed for Mi Young,

559
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,480
can I take some to eat?

560
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,590
Stop the talking and just sit still and be quiet.

561
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:18,990
She probably has things to clear and finish some business.

562
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,780
Mom,

563
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:40,270
your grandchild, the name is Dog Poopie.

564
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:44,570
It's a little funny one. Mom,

565
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:48,930
today is just very bad...

566
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:52,760
The person I love most...

567
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,550
After you Mom.

568
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:00,590
The person I love most after Mom is...

569
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:03,520
going far away...

570
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,280
I couldn't even say bye and just sent her off coolly.

571
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,940
So, I, too, put everything down

572
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,550
and am planning to leave here.

573
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:22,800
If I stay here, then I will run into her someday.

574
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:28,260
If I run into her, then even though I know I shouldn't,

575
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:33,760
I'll be like a stray dog and go crazy for her.

576
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,910
But why did Dad do that?

577
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:47,550
I... can't even handle one woman.

578
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,760
This disgusting genetic disease,

579
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,470
I don't have the courage

580
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,030
to ask her to endure it with me.

581
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,440
How did he do that to two women?

582
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:09,850
The fact that his face is shameless is also a strength.

583
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,210
Stay well and have fun

584
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:19,290
with our Dog Poopie up there.

585
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,240
Until I go there.

586
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,560
He is going to be home, so just stand your ground.

587
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,510
If you call ahead of time, he can just avoid you.
So with an unexpected attack.

588
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,680
You can do it right?
- Daniel..

589
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,230
I'm sorry...

590
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:02,090
And thank you.

591
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:05,910
Ah.. Hurry up and go. If you stay longer, I'm going to want to keep you.

592
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:41,810
Yes...

593
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,950
I did well... I did well...

594
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:03,510
Aigoo, Mi Young. Welcome.
What brings you here without a phone call?

595
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:05,740
I apologize for coming so suddenly, Grandmother.

596
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,680
Oh no, don't be sorry.

597
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:12,590
Morning, night, or day, our Mi Young is always welcome.

598
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:14,380
Take a seat.

599
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:19,440
Grandma, Gun...

600
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,880
Oh Gun, he said he had somewhere to go and left this morning.

601
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,280
Huh?

602
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,870
Why are you trying to meet with Gun?

603
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,000
I have something to ask him.

604
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,520
Oh, what are you going to ask him? You can ask me.

605
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,970
I know everything about Gun, as you know.

606
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:41,050
Oh no, it's okay, Grandma. I think asking him personally is better.

607
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:44,020
Oh, okay, okay.

608
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:48,350
It's better for the two involved to solve problems between a woman and a man.

609
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:51,390
Ayew... In this house...

610
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:56,810
since Mi Young is here... it is just sparkling everywhere.

611
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:02,520
Grandmother, is it okay if I wait in his room?

612
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:08,190
There's no reason to say no. If you can't wait, then you can just live there, just live there.

613
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:32,320
Ddo dok ddo dok ddo dok ddo ddo ddo ddo dok!

614
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:52,300
Lookie. Rawr-dduk.

615
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,180
I feel something good coming.

616
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,460
Maybe things will work out between the two.

617
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,810
Ahh... Secretary Tak, why are you calling?

618
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:37,840
Ahh... Chairwoman, there's a big problem.

619
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,540
Why are you creating a fuss again?

620
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,730
CEO set up a press conference.

621
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:46,810
Even if I told him not to, he wouldn't listen to me
as if he's been bewitched.

622
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:48,540
What are you saying?

623
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,480
I should have reported to you earlier, but

624
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,020
will you turn on the television right now?

625
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,090
What is he saying?

626
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:00,520
It is now known that CEO Lee Gun has been diagnosed with a genetic disease..

627
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,780
There will be a big change to Jangin Chemicals' prospective successor.

628
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,970
There will be a press conference soon.

629
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:11,220
Now there are many reporters outside the company.

630
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:25,550
I'm Lee Gun.

631
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:28,200
If you are seeing this...

632
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,250
that means, because of your disgusting genetic disease,

633
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:34,060
you just let yourself go.

634
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,270
Amnesia.

635
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:40,370
If you want more details, ask Dr. Octopus and
he'll kindly shoot ink at you.

636
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:43,260
Now listen to what I say very carefully. It's very important.

637
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,030
Okay?

638
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:50,230
You... have a woman that you love.

639
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:54,920
Her name is Kim Mi Young and her hometown is Yeoul Island.

640
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,250
She is stupidly very nice.

641
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:04,530
She takes care of people that are in pain. She's a very nice and lovely woman.

642
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:07,780
So, how I met her...

643
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,450
You unexpectedly met her in Macau.

644
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:17,510
Like it was fate, you both made a beautiful child.

645
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:20,400
That child's name is Dog Poopie.

646
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:26,100
But... Dog Poopie is not with you now.

647
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:30,210
Because it went somewhere very far.

648
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:33,720
You never erased Dog Poopie from your mind.

649
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,020
Our Dog Poopie...

650
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,050
was right by Dad's side and never left

651
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:43,730
his side because he was having a hard time until recently.

652
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,580
Now... I have to let go...

653
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,480
I have to let go of Snail.

654
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,750
Forget?

655
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,840
Don't forget? Don't forget? Forget?

656
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:29,380
Hey, you know...

657
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,050
I was sitting at the table.

658
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:35,750
and looked at Snail's face and got a scoop of rice and ate it.

659
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:41,030
I looked at the ground and couldn't digest,
so I drank water and was coughing...

660
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,070
You know...

661
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,480
I really wanted to sit at the head of the table.

662
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,160
But, I won't be able to sit there forever.

663
00:57:56,110 --> 00:58:02,710
So how can I tell her to stay together?! How can I tell her not to go?! How can I tell her?!

664
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,890
Damn.

665
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:25,890
Dog Poopie's Dad,
-Like the past...
♬ My tears remember. It fills up your ♬

666
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:32,670
can you not stay with me by my side?
♬ seat again. I try erasing but I can’t ♬

667
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:36,850
I'm sorry.
♬ erase you ♬

668
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:45,950
Anyways, you gave up everything on our Dog Poopie.
♬ You’ve become my everything ♬

669
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:56,020
Even your feelings towards Dog Poopie..
♬ Oh you, I can’t see you, I can’t hear you ♬

670
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:59,410
♬ But I’m okay ♬

671
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:06,660
♬ Goodbyes are sad, my heart aches ♬

672
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:15,280
♬ But if you are happy, if you can smile, ♬

673
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,870
CEO of Jangin Chemicals,

674
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:31,650
I am Lee Gun.
♬ I will miss you the more I erase you
I will shed more tears than today ♬

675
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:38,220
♬ Like fate, I won’t ever have anyone like you ♬

676
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:45,200
~ Preview ~
♬ Only you, only you ♬

677
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:53,510
♬ As much as my tears, I hope you are happy ♬
- Look into my eyes and lie to me.

678
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:59,490
If you are confident that you can live without me, then this time I will really let you go.

679
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,860
Drag that woman out.

680
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:11,150
Even if it's a hard path, if I'm next to him, I think I will be able to pull through.
