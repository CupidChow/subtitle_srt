1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,960
Episode 2

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,750
Miss, fashion, your airport fashion.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,590
Your sunglasses are awesome.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,100
Ow, you are really late.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,390
I'm ready to depart.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,220
Yeah. I took care of the matter well.
How about you? Are you done with work?

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,350
That's good.

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,290
Let's eat a lot of yummy food and lazily roll around in bed all day long.

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,870
Ok. I'll be there soon.

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,040
Ok. I love you.

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,680
Miss Se Ra, when you arrive in Macau, make sure to listen to the President, please.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,910
President is pro..

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,230
He will be waiting in a professional manner.

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,180
I will.

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,080
Come after you get off the phone.

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,940
Hello?

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,170
Oh, Thomas. (The director)

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,680
Yeah. I'm in Korea.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,750
Of course, I was a little upset.

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,720
What?

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,730
We changed our minds, Se Ra.

22
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,930
We want you to be our prima ballerina as Odette.

23
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,020
Please hurry up and come back to New York as soon as possible.

24
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,540
I remember the first time we met.

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,930
When was that? That was 6 years ago. It was when we were totally young.

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,400
We've been seeing each other for a really a long time.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
You just realized that?

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,640
I'm only left with wrinkles on my face from waiting for you for so long. I don't even laugh.

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,850
Can you see? Can you see this?

30
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:01,480
I'm never going to let you go anywhere, ever... my love.

31
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,660
Your shoulders and back are really tense.

32
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,680
You must have had a lot of things to be nervous about.

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,170
Please do a good job.

34
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,670
I have a very important thing to do later.

35
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,820
An important event coming up.

36
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,870
We failed in our first try,

37
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,400
but we will definitely succeed in our second try.

38
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,880
Ouch... it hurts so less pressure.

39
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,640
Ha mu ha mu.

40
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,910
Hurry up.

41
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,300
Hurry, hurry.

42
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,520
No, no, no, no!

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,910
I told you, I have a very, very important thing to do.

44
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,400
I'm telling you, I have an important event coming up.

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,700
You can stop now.
-Stop, stop.

46
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,970
Stop.
- OUCH!

47
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,760
You've worked hard.

48
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,900
Drink?

49
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,000
Natural water.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,500
Thank you.

51
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,710
Drink up, drink up.

52
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,090
It's going in, it's going in.

53
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,010
Good~

54
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,230
Cool!
- Cool!
Cool~

55
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,020
It's awesome!
-It's awesome!

56
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,360
Awesome! Awesome!

57
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,370
You!

58
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,930
I'm Chinese. I'm Chinese. I have a mole. A mole.

59
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,500
You're mistaken. Mistaken.

60
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,620
Wait a minute.

61
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,550
What is this?

62
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,180
Aren't you President Park?

63
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,440
This is President Park!

64
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,820
Why are you here?

65
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,560
What are you doing right now, huh?

66
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,120
You should be content with buying the factory. Why did you fire the employees?

67
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,750
The majority of the people on Yeoul Island work at that soap factory.

68
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,970
Are you telling them to all starve to death?

69
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,250
Please save us islanders.

70
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,200
Please save us.

71
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,300
Look here, why would I give you back the factory I brought fairly?

72
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,960
Don't just sit here, instead go back to that factory quickly and get all those people out!

73
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,620
I'll go there in 2 weeks and I'm going to definitely close that factory down.

74
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,530
President! President, President!

75
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,150
Please, President, please!

76
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,560
Let go! Let go!

77
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,350
Look, even if you guys beg me like this;

78
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,080
just because you throw a tantrum, I'm not going to listen to you.

79
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,930
I'm not going to listen to you! Go now!

80
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,140
President... Go! No, President...

81
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,040
President!!!

82
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,930
President!!!

83
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,410
Wow, he fell.

84
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,780
The medicine must be working gradually.

85
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,150
Nobody can handle the stimulant from our island, you know that, right?

86
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,700
Oh. He fell again.

87
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,270
Oh no... there, there.

88
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,430
It's time to go to Se Ra.

89
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,610
Let's wake up!

90
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,320
Oh, wow...

91
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,790
He wouldn't even notice if anyone were to kidnap him.

92
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,330
I probably poured in twice the amount than the regular dose.

93
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,460
Hey, let's start our work.

94
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,610
Should we?

95
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,310
Awe~some.

96
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,700
Awe~some.

97
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,260
Oh my..

98
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,070
Aigoo. Hey, check this guy out.

99
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,500
It's indisputable!

100
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,610
Oh, what is this?

101
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,160
Awesome!

102
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,890
Scared me.

103
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,240
Okay, that's done. Let's go. Go, go.

104
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,520
Hey, quickly push it... push, push.

105
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,600
The exit...

106
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,800
That way? Oh, that way.

107
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,310
Hey, that way.

108
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,970
No, turn it around.

109
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,400
It's too hard.

110
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,320
This way.

111
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,750
Here's the key.

112
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,320
Slide the key.

113
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,340
What is this...

114
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,300
2006

115
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,680
2006... 2008... next, 2009.

116
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,990
What is this?

117
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,220
What is this? They're both 2006!

118
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,280
Father.

119
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,970
Honey.

120
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,550
Son.

121
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,010
This time, our 9th generation's only son, Gun.

122
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:27,450
Please help him so that he can surely succeed with his proposal.

123
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,410
So that the two of them leave but come back with three.

124
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,270
Please give him a hand.

125
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,020
Father, please understand that I spoke casually

126
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,100
so that I can speak to the group without having to go through trouble, okay?

127
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:51,080
A song about the first night after the marriage.

128
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,460
Last night, then really...

129
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,480
Did I really?

130
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,160
Oh. What should I do?

131
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,750
Oh, how am I supposed to act?

132
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,730
Let's stay like this for a little bit more.

133
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,020
Maybe it's because it's morning, but his voice sounds a bit different..

134
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,750
Lawyer Min must have worked out a lot.

135
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,860
I knew he had a warm heart,

136
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,300
but it's even nice and hard.

137
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,650
I'm sorry.

138
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,430
I fell asleep.

139
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,940
I didn't even know that you came.

140
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,670
I'm sorry.

141
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,080
No, I'm the one who's sorry for coming late.

142
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,070
When did you come?

143
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,470
We "came" together.

144
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,750
We came together?

145
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,340
Who are you?!
-Ah!!

146
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,290
Who are you?
-Who are you?

147
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,310
What are you doing here?

148
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,420
Jackpot!

149
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,320
What are you?! Aren't you going to turn that off?!

150
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,040
Our island's enemy, Jangin's President Lee Gun.

151
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,730
Hey, you started the fight first,

152
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,590
so don't ever resent us!

153
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,030
Were you surprised?

154
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,480
I'll introduce her properly.

155
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,660
This is our island's patriot.

156
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,870
Miss Kim!

157
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,280
What? Mi Young.

158
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,950
Why are you here?
-Who is she?

159
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,440
This is my sister-in-law.

160
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,460
Wait, wait, stay there!

161
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,130
Stay right there!

162
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,910
Run!

163
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,300
Stop right there!

164
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,060
Stop, stop right there!

165
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,350
Do you think I'll let this pass?

166
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,230
Open the door! Open the door!

167
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,340
What in the world did you do here?! Who are you?!

168
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,500
Why are you in our room?

169
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,950
What are you saying? What do you mean, "our" room?

170
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,700
Hurry, come out and talk! Aren't you going to come out?!

171
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,960
Manager, manager.

172
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,330
Hurry up and come. I'm not sure if she is a robber or a pervert,

173
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,100
but a strange woman has trespassed.

174
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,870
My girlfriend has disappeared!

175
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,070
These guys are really low, so call the police!

176
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,480
Hurry up and call them. You need to call them.

177
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,270
Stop right there.

178
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,140
Open the door! Who in the world are you?!

179
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,020
Se Ra. What did you do to my Se Ra?

180
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,750
I don't know who Se Ra is.

181
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,200
I'm totally out of it, too! I don't know either!

182
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,710
What is this situation? I'm going crazy.

183
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,580
Where are you Lawyer Min?

184
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,070
Open the door! Come out and talk!

185
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,010
Ok.

186
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,820
I'll come out.

187
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,900
Oh! Wait!

188
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,420
I caught you! You pervert!

189
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,240
Wait a minute, your face looks familiar.

190
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,080
Ring!

191
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,780
Dog!

192
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,960
What are you doing here... ?

193
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,270
So did you approach me intentionally from back then with a motive?

194
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,910
Is that why you tried so hard to find my ring for me?

195
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,560
What are you talking about?
I found it for you because I felt bad that you fell because of me.

196
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,710
Don't think abut lying and tell me everything!
What's your identity?

197
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,300
You're a "flower snake," aren't you?
- A "flower snake?"

198
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,650
I am not.
("flower snake": a woman who uses their looks to get what they want from men then leaves... usually illegal)

199
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,300
I'm just an ordinary woman who has nothing to do with such things.

200
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,400
Ordinary? Ordinary my ass.

201
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,320
How can an ordinary woman come into a strange man's room and uses her beauty to...

202
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,650
What were you planning? Why did you come in here?

203
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,680
I said, I'm not a "flower snake!"

204
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,970
Do you normally not trust other people's words?

205
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,640
You have to say something trustworthy to trust you!

206
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,440
Wait a minute, then I spent the night here with a woman like you... ?

207
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,780
What have I done with a woman like you here?

208
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,570
Excuse me...

209
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,670
I'm dumbfounded here, too.
- What did you do?

210
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,320
I'm going crazy.
-Stop with the act!

211
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,440
You think I wouldn't know that you and your brother-in-law planned this? I know it all!

212
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,720
How many times must I tell you that's not true?

213
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,020
I have no idea what's going on, just like you.

214
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,550
If you did anything to my Se Ra, then I'm...

215
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,450
then I'm going to kill you! Really!

216
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,990
Number 7. Number 7!

217
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,640
Number 7, stop. Open that please.

218
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,850
Stop!

219
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,870
That's them. It's those guys. Find them quickly.

220
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,850
Aigoo, that was surprising.

221
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,390
That was Mi Young, right?

222
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,980
Right!
- I didn't see wrong, right?

223
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,250
But what is your sister-in-law doing over there?

224
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,160
This stupid girl..

225
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,190
Oh, what is this? I had a text come in.

226
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,490
Room 2009 is missing?

227
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,260
What does that mean?
How could a room just disappear?

228
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,490
How should I know?

229
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,620
Over there!
-Run!

230
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,760
That's my sister-in-law.

231
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,490
Oh, hey. Let go.

232
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,390
Let go!

233
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,900
Get it, get it!

234
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,410
Let go!

235
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:08,550
Arirang~ Arirang~

236
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,810
Camera!

237
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:20,180
Get them!

238
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,430
Get them!

239
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,240
Get them! You can't go anywhere.

240
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,260
Hurry!

241
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:35,830
I'm continuously looking; but since it's an incident from so long ago, it's not that easy.

242
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:41,660
And we're not supposed to tell about adoptions.

243
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,850
So, it's hard to track her down.

244
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,240
I'm sorry for asking such a difficult favor.
- No need to be sorry.

245
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,590
If it's your business, Daniel, of course, I should help.

246
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,540
Our orphanage is this peaceful thanks to you.

247
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,900
It's nothing.

248
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,630
Ahjussi! Pass the ball please!

249
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,860
Pass us the ball!

250
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,120
If you find any clue, then give me a call.
I will come by often, too.

251
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,160
Okay.

252
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,280
Ahjussi? Come here!

253
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,300
Boss, Se Ra is right now

254
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,680
confirmed to be on a plane headed for New York.

255
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,610
I've committed a deadly sin. I should've sat down next to her on her flight...

256
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,300
I never thought she'd come back out after checking in...

257
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,880
Boss, I am so sorry.

258
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,750
I'm sorry.

259
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,390
Anyway, I understand.

260
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,740
New message

261
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,960
Gun...

262
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,440
First of all, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

263
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,940
I had sensed what this trip meant,

264
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,860
and what you were planning.

265
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,580
And when that moment comes, how happy and joyous would I be...

266
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,370
I felt my heart pounding and thought it was going to explode, just imagining it.

267
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:40,010
Even so, I am still returning to America.

268
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:47,540
My heart hurts so much when I think about how greatly disappointed you'll be.

269
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,170
But Gun,

270
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,440
I tried not to, but after not getting the role from the audition,

271
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,330
as I was going to Korea, I think my scars were really big.

272
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,630
That's how I honestly felt.

273
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:14,470
Please let me do ballet just once more.

274
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,800
I don't want to marry with this scar and the feeling of failure.

275
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,690
After doing my best and being on the stage, without any regrets or attachment,

276
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,260
I will return to you with confidence.

277
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,060
I'm sorry.

278
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,080
I love you.

279
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,520
Hey.

280
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,100
Honesty, how much were you supposed to get?

281
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:56,410
No matter how much you like money, how could you plan such a thing with your family?

282
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:00,300
It's nothing like that. I told you that it's not.

283
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,200
I really have no idea what's going on.

284
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,240
It was my first time seeing my brother-in-law in that room, too.

285
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,420
I told you not to put on act. Who's going to believe what you're saying right now?

286
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,630
It said 2006, so I went in thinking it was my room.

287
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,030
You'll know if you check.

288
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,040
But of all people, I was there.

289
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,670
Of all people, we met like that before. And this time, too, we meet like this.

290
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,150
You expect me to believe this kind of coincidence?!

291
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:37,550
I'm dumbfounded myself how something like this could have happened.

292
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,090
Please believe me.

293
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:46,550
Okay. Let's say I believe in what you're saying.

294
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,260
Even so, you've been abandoned.

295
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,940
They left you here alone and ran away to save their lives.

296
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:59,950
Whatever the reason is, the fact that you are abandoned by your family

297
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,010
won't change.

298
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,270
There must have been a reason.

299
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:14,390
My brother-in-law and that company president are good people.

300
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,110
You even did this ridiculous thing with those good people?

301
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,830
Hey, just tell me the truth.
You came in from the beginning, with me as a target.

302
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:29,370
Are you even a guest at this hotel?

303
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:34,030
President, it is true that this person is a guest of room 2006.

304
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,150
It has been confirmed.

305
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,210
Still,

306
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,790
I can't believe you until I see it with my own eyes.

307
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,720
Then you can go see it for yourself.

308
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,200
Instead of just being suspicious.

309
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,090
Follow me.

310
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,690
What is this? Huh?

311
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,970
Huh?! What is this?

312
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,680
And how are you saying you opened the door?

313
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,240
The door was open.

314
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,990
I inserted the card and pushed the door to open it, but it was open, I think.

315
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,320
You think?

316
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,960
Yes.

317
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,690
This was it?

318
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,680
Does this make any sense?

319
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,610
Everyone go back.

320
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,510
If there's any problem, give us a call again.

321
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,890
We'll be on standby for now.

322
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,100
How could this make sense?

323
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,850
How could this make sense?

324
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,180
Excuse me..

325
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,120
I'm sorry that this happened, but

326
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,570
my brother-in-law and that company president,

327
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,540
what will happen to them?

328
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,230
They can't go to jail.

329
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,770
Could you please not make it so?

330
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:45,970
Is this a time to worry about others when you look like that?

331
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,960
What am I doing here with a women like you?

332
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,970
Anyways, it's not over yet, so just keep that in mind.

333
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,470
Does it feel good?

334
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,110
Lover!

335
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,110
I think I'm doing well. It feels good here too, right?

336
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,780
There, there.
-Here?

337
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,630
This is where it needs to be loosened up.

338
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,010
Honey, you're here?

339
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:17,050
Is she the woman you told me about that only knows you?

340
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:21,470
It seems like she was enjoying herself with someone else till her dark circles became apparent.

341
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,390
How could you... ?

342
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:27,830
How could you... ?

343
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,480
Where are your shoes?

344
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,240
What have you been doing all night?

345
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,030
Come sit down.

346
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,580
You were surprised, weren't you?

347
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,740
We came here to have fun anyways.

348
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,850
Let's just think we both changed our partners.

349
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,770
If you look at it differently, it's more fun this way.

350
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,800
How could you do this with another woman?

351
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:58,240
I'm sorry. Calm down and don't get so worked up.

352
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,850
Honey, your taste really sucks.

353
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,200
How did you think of coming on a vacation with a woman like this?

354
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,830
Give me back the earrings.

355
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,380
It's mine.

356
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,500
Give it back to me, now.

357
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,990
Give me the earrings.

358
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,970
What is this?

359
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,660
Someone would think I stole the earrings.

360
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,250
It looks cheap anyways.

361
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,890
Just throw that away. Why are you being so pathetic, picking them up?

362
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,920
You shouldn't be doing this.

363
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,880
How could you... ?

364
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,420
Why are you crying? Making me feel bad.

365
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,400
Get out.

366
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,580
Get out of here.

367
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,210
This is a room reserved under my name!

368
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,780
Do you know how excited I was?

369
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,990
You don't know how much I liked you.

370
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:34,330
I think you've misunderstood.

371
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,280
You think I'm your boyfriend or something?

372
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,930
I was just being nice because you were innocent and cute. And now, you're all over me.

373
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,120
You're funny.

374
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,410
Don't delude yourself.

375
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,020
You're just a post-it girl, just like your nickname.

376
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,070
Someone that can be used when needed but that can be just thrown away when you no longer want it.

377
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,720
I'm a lawyer.

378
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,010
Do you think a lawyer would want to date a temporary employee?

379
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,230
How could a noble date with a commoner?

380
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,300
Does that make any sense?

381
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,000
Let's not do this... it's nasty and dirty.

382
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,360
Wear these.

383
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,610
Get up.

384
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,170
There is no need to talk to a thing like him.

385
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,550
Let's go.

386
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:36,150
Hey, what are you?

387
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,650
You're a noble?

388
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,200
You're just trash.

389
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,590
People like you are crazy butchers (lowest of the lowest) who can't even come close to a commoner.

390
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,430
Let's go.

391
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,970
Is that bastard crazy?

392
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,620
Why are you sitting there listening to all that?

393
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,610
Are you stupid?

394
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,260
This is mine.

395
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,960
So what is this?

396
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,710
Is it expensive?

397
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,170
It's mine.

398
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:26,690
This is mine.

399
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:31,240
Just because this is mine...

400
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:41,600
I was picked in a giveaway that I never won all my life...

401
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,340
I'll finally even travel.

402
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,180
Finally...

403
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,260
Luck comes to me, too.

404
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,170
Just, I...

405
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,480
I just wanted, with my whole heart, someone...

406
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,570
I only wanted to love someone with all my heart.

407
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,970
I really tried.

408
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,770
But...what on earth... what have I done wrong?

409
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,980
Why are you crying?

410
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,440
Why are you crying!? Who are you trying to please?!

411
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,340
It's just coming, so what am I suppose to do?!

412
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,240
Has your life ended?!

413
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,060
All the more, you should be more confident and live a cool life!

414
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,290
Seriously, the eyes you have for men...

415
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,230
Calling that a boyfriend!

416
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,180
If your eyes are bad then your brain should be good at least.

417
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,020
I...

418
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,740
really liked that person.

419
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,940
My nickname in the company is...

420
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,160
post-it.

421
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,270
But that guy,

422
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,290
he treated me differently.

423
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,980
I really liked him.

424
00:37:55,090 --> 00:38:00,150
That's why I anticipated this vacation so much.

425
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,830
I prepared so much.

426
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,800
This makes no sense.

427
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,800
This makes no sense!

428
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,860
Why?

429
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,980
Why are people who hurt us so fine?

430
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,240
Why are people who are hurt always the ones who are in so much pain

431
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,340
and become this miserable? Exactly why?

432
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,280
Follow me.
- Where?

433
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,820
From now on, you'll no longer be a post-it but will become a crazy glue.

434
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,880
So once you are removed, the jerk's skin will hurt like it's being ripped apart!

435
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,740
I'll show you how great you are.

436
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,280
Follow me.

437
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,860
Oh my!

438
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,630
What am I going to do? It is so difficult.

439
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,910
If it's this kind of a level, you have to pay us double.

440
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,490
I don't care if you want double, double double, don't worry about the money

441
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,280
and transform her from head to toe.

442
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,890
You need to transform her to the point where people will wonder if it is even possible.

443
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,540
Seriously, you need to change everything!

444
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,040
I think I look okay even now...

445
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,630
This is the worst part. Get rid of it first.

446
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,950
Use all the methods you can possibly use,

447
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,380
And completely change her! Transform her whole body!

448
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,200
Okay. Let's go
-Let's go.

449
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,010
Oh, wait..

450
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,840
Change everything!

451
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:21,230
I think I'm okay. I did dress up today.

452
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,590
♫Oh baby, I wanna be beside you♫

453
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,840
♫like a lie,♫

454
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,330
♫I'm crying because of you♫

455
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:36,020
♫Oh just wanna be with you, can you hear my heart♫

456
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:41,790
♫My love shines through the pain♫

457
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,310
Your eyes are big.

458
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,820
Put more eye shadow on her eye lids.

459
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,890
It's really difficult.

460
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:05,590
You are so short, it's hard to find a dress for you.

461
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,080
♫Love me♫

462
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,650
♫Tell me that you love me,♫

463
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:20,550
♫The love I'm saying right now♫

464
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,640
Once in a lifetime... the best work has been created.

465
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,970
If we changed her this much, wouldn't you say she's totally a different woman?

466
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,940
I know, right? I thought we were magicians or something.

467
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,800
I get it, so just show her to me.

468
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,570
I assume you prepared to pay double.

469
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:46,360
Okay.
-Ready? Go!

470
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,410
Well, it's not bad.

471
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,750
Have confidence.

472
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,100
From now on, you are the queen.

473
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,800
No one will be able to look down on you.

474
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:46,790
Act naturally, as if this is your house. Here.

475
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,690
Why don't you wipe the drool off your face?

476
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,920
What did he do to that country girl?

477
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,070
Call.
-Call.

478
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:27,050
Call.
-Call.

479
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,390
Flop.
(Means dealing of the first three face-up cards to the board)

480
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,080
Raise.
-Raise.

481
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:37,830
Fourth (street)
(Aka,"turn," means the fourth of five cards dealt to a community card board)

482
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,120
River.  *means the final card dealt in a poker hand

483
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,420
Raise.
- Raise.

484
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,850
Raise. Card open.

485
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,070
Jack, triple.

486
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,050
Seven one pair.
- Okay.

487
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:05,820
How many is this?

488
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:12,970
Instead of a cat like others, now that I found a new lucky goddess, I'm on a roll.

489
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:16,240
Here, give me some luck.

490
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,180
Will it be ok?

491
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,570
Don't worry, just trust me.

492
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,580
Oh, what is that? What's that?

493
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,900
I need to resist it.

494
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,160
Mi Young must be suffering so much right now.

495
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,750
We can't covet this food just to save our lives...

496
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,530
Loyalty!
- That's right.

497
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:58,430
Our sister-in-law... she's probably captured by that jerk and is probably suffering so much.

498
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,780
Aren't you nervous?
- Yeah...

499
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,840
This time I'm the getting the "feel." Just die. (Fold the card)

500
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,570
I can't do that as a man.

501
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,940
Call.

502
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,860
Card open.

503
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,670
You're nervous, huh?

504
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:46,870
Whoo!

505
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:50,540
How much is this? Babe, you know it's all because of my luck, right?

506
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,800
Of course, I know, the one who told me to die.

507
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,170
I'm sorry, but can I raise the pot? (raise the amount you can bet)

508
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,650
I have too many chips.

509
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,690
Also, I'm kind of getting bored.

510
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,250
Call.

511
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,490
Fold, raise.

512
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,790
Call.

513
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,990
Flop.

514
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,420
Raise.

515
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,460
Call.

516
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,990
Raise.

517
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,600
River.

518
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,270
Wish me some luck.

519
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:00,340
Ok.

520
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,710
Here you go.

521
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:18,620
All in. 
- Oh.. This is too much...

522
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,010
Full house with Aces.

523
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,030
There is no way I'm losing.

524
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:29,580
Even if you do that, I know it's all a bluff. I can see right through you.

525
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,440
There are three things a gambler needs to know.

526
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,390
First, patience to wait until it's your time.

527
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:44,820
Second, determination to follow though till the end.

528
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,310
Such a show off. What's the last one?

529
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,850
This one is...

530
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:52,560
I'll tell you after you become pitiful. I'll tell you after that.

531
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,280
Really?

532
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,840
Oh.. you are so scary.

533
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,450
But I guess I won't be hearing the third one.

534
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:03,180
Will this be enough?

535
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,080
All in.

536
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,340
Card open.

537
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,200
Ace. Full House.

538
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,710
Four of a kind of 8s. 
- Won, we won!!
-- Really?!?!

539
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:55,570
Oh my god!

540
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,030
I'm so relieved!!

541
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:00,260
I was so worried that
we were going to lose due to my bad luck!

542
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,120
I'm so relieved.

543
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,090
What are you going to do?
My money is in those chips too!

544
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:05,470
Hand over my money now!

545
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:08,820
What exactly are you good at?!
You weren't that great at night either..

546
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:13,390
Why are you changing your words?
You said you had a great time last night!

547
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,640
You said there was no other white horse like me!

548
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,040
White horse? Yeah, right..

549
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,370
You're not even a pony!

550
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,860
Number 3 for a gambler is...

551
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,060
the ability to recognize your Lady Luck.

552
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,690
Which is something you lacked.

553
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:40,660
No! I want a rematch.

554
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,160
You can't take these.

555
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,250
Just once. Just one more match.

556
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,880
How can you win and get up?!

557
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,190
Right here.

558
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:53,730
Don't be like this. You look low and dirty.
I thought you were from nobility..

559
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,280
Why are you being like this, Honey?
You shouldn't be like this to a fellow co-worker.

560
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,960
How are you going to see my face tomorrow at work?

561
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,420
One more match... Let's just play one more time.

562
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,850
Look here..

563
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:15,600
It seems like this was how much you started off with.
Right here, right now, in front of this lady,

564
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,470
if you get on your knees and sincerely apologize,

565
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,890
I will return your money to you.

566
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:24,760
Here...

567
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,250
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

568
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:40,360
I'm really reflecting on my mistakes.
You can see it on my face, right?

569
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,100
I'm sorry.

570
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:50,260
Get up now.

571
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,990
I'm so stupid, huh?

572
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:18,910
Even though you gave me a chance for revenge, I just gave up so easily.

573
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:22,570
So why do you forgive someone like that?

574
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,590
Because he's pitiful?

575
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,780
Watching him kneel in front of money...

576
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:37,910
Instead of him, I seemed pitiful.

577
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,140
It's true that he's a bad person.

578
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,140
But my feelings for him

579
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,390
were real.

580
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:51,210
My sincerity shouldn't become shabby, too...

581
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,370
You and I are similar.

582
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:09,800
I, as well, because Se Ra didn't come, I became alone.

583
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,450
I even prepared a proposal.

584
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:19,660
By chance, is your girlfriend's name Se Ra?

585
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,760
Se Ra..

586
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,330
I love you, Se Ra.

587
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:32,440
Will you

588
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:35,040
marry me?

589
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:38,600
If, if I propose and things go wrong,

590
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,310
it'll all because you you, because of your bad luck. Got it?

591
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,190
I'm really sorry.

592
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:52,170
Because of me.. your proposal didn't work out.

593
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:56,560
Like you said, I think it turned didn't work out because of my bad luck.

594
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,550
No, I just said that because I was mad at the time.

595
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:04,350
Do you really think it's because of you?

596
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,810
You know.. Those two men..

597
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:16,650
My brother-in-law and the company president..

598
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,560
what they did was bad,

599
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,430
but it was because they were desperate.

600
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:24,660
So can you just forgive them?

601
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,880
Fine.

602
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,510
It looks like we were both victims,

603
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,930
since one of us asked to forgive them,

604
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:37,320
why don't we go ahead and do that.

605
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,280
I'll tell the security not to turn them over to the police.

606
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,910
Thank you.

607
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:46,050
Oh right,

608
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:50,840
my name is Gun. Lee Gun. It's a single character.

609
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:57,200
My name is even ordinary and common..

610
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,900
Let's hear how common it is.

611
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:03,220
It's Kim Mi Young.
- Kim Mi Young?

612
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,730
What's wrong with Kim Mi Young?

613
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:08,810
There's always someone with the same name wherever I go.

614
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:12,350
There are 3 Kim Mi Youngs' at my office.

615
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,910
Across the nation, there are over 20,000 people.

616
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:22,480
Someone's name is "Mar" and "Kim" as their last.
So his name is "Kim Mar-ee". [seaweed rolls]

617
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,690
Please be confident!

618
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:32,830
Being that common only proves
how popular the name actually is.

619
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:39,540
At first, I thought you were a weird person,

620
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:43,260
but right now you're like a different person.

621
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:47,590
Ah!

622
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,760
Take it.

623
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:56,210
Hurry.

624
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,600
It's the chip that made you Lady Luck.

625
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,530
We can't always win the game of life, but

626
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:08,860
as long as you have that "chip,"

627
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:13,710
you will always have hope and the chance, so keep it well.

628
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:17,020
Thank you.

629
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,250
Ah!

630
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,250
This is my gift to you.

631
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,670
This is...the dog...saliva...

632
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:29,440
No. I bought another one.

633
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,320
This is a candy that helps to fulfill love.

634
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,800
I believe the words of people who say that if you confess with this candy, you succeed.

635
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,390
No, I want to believe.

636
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:48,490
People who like sweet things, are people who want to be happy.

637
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,630
Usually I don't believe in that...

638
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:54,500
Give it to me.

639
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,820
Thank you.

640
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,200
I'll get going.

641
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,060
Miss Kim Mi Young!

642
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:31,050
Last night's incident,

643
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,710
forget about it.

644
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,790
Of course.

645
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:44,310
We're not going to see each other again.

646
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,770
And it's not good for a person to be too nice.

647
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:53,070
Be confident...and don't get intimidated.

648
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:56,620
You know it?! To be resilient.

649
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,470
I'll try.

650
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:02,920
I'm going to go.
