1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,810
Now,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,430
I don't know who that person is anymore.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,980
Wha...

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,470
Father, I'm... I'm sorry. I'll be leaving.

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,810
Shall we check what kind of person he is?

6
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,330
Episode 7

7
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,880
What do you think you're doing?

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,480
You call yourself a Father, but to do this to someone else's woman.

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,800
- Are you sure she's your woman?
-What did you say?

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,240
If she's your woman, you shouldn't make her sad like this.

11
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,100
What's wrong? Did something happen?

12
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,460
Did someone bother you?

13
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,070
Yeah. I wonder what kind of jerk he is...

14
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,590
to make a nice girl like her cry.

15
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,720
What kind of person are you?

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,420
Are you a con man?

17
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,920
You laugh?

18
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,300
I'll leave first.

19
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,780
What's wrong? You need to tell me exactly so I'll know what the problem is.

20
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,860
I don't want to talk about anything. Let go.

21
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,560
I can't let go. The person who should be getting mad is me.

22
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,690
I clearly told you. While living with me, keep your class.

23
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,350
Class?

24
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,330
Being kind only in front of my face

25
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,860
while doing whatever you want behind my back. That kind of stuff?

26
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,800
Why are you suddenly saying this?

27
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,450
Lee Gun.

28
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,020
- What?
- What am I to you?

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,670
What kind of meaning do I have to you?

30
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,920
Mean... meaning?

31
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,880
Is that what this is all about?

32
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,160
Um, Kim Mi Young is the precious mother of my child.

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,390
Before the baby is born, you must be careful, physically and mentally,

34
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,820
avoid acting rashly,

35
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,650
and have a strong sense of responsibility and duty. That kind of precious woman.

36
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,560
A very precious woman.

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,160
Without the baby,

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,600
I don't have any meaning to you, do I?

39
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,310
When the day comes, I'll pack and leave and all we'll be is a contractor and contractee.

40
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,260
No more, no less. Right?

41
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,140
Why are you doing this to me today?

42
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,370
What is it that you want to confirm?

43
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,800
Forget it, then.

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,560
Don't mind me.

45
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,870
If you want to cry, just cry. There isn't any reason to hold back.

46
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,660
I don't know why tears keep falling.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,530
It is obvious that our relationship has no meaning,

48
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,590
What am I to think we did...

49
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,980
But Yeoul Island...

50
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:23,310
is the burial place of my father, who loved me the most.

51
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,290
All of my family is there, too.

52
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,150
I resent him.

53
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,620
I know I shouldn't be like this.

54
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,340
What should I do?

55
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,730
Teach me, Father.

56
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,010
I'm sorry, Mi Young.

57
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,040
- I can't.
- What?

58
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,450
In truth, I...

59
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,700
I'm not a priest.

60
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,590
Because you thought I was a priest,

61
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,160
and every time I met you, you were in a difficult situation, so...

62
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,560
I wanted to help you.

63
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,550
I didn't lie to you on purpose.

64
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,570
Truthfully, if I told you the truth, I thought you would be disappointed.

65
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:39,220
I kept pushing back when I would tell you, and it became today.

66
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,990
I'm really sorry.

67
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,290
What's wrong with the snail?

68
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,710
CEO! CEO, there's been a problem.

69
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,540
The breach of contract penalty fee for
the Yeoul Island Soap Factory.

70
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,200
The board has found out that you paid triple, and is planning on charging you for misappropriation.

71
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,570
Also, the shareholders general meeting includes the recent slump in sales

72
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,330
to organize a dismissal from your position.

73
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,900
We're going to turn the tides with the release of the new product. So don't worry.

74
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,940
Yes, of course, you're our CEO.
Since you've even recruited that famous Pitt,

75
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,310
we'll definitely hit the jackpot, right?

76
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,860
It seems you had a good talk with him today.

77
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,450
That front Pitt or back Pitt, whatever he is.
I couldn't even meet with him today.

78
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:35,320
Find out his contact and convince him to reschedule the meeting.

79
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,390
You went all the way there, what happened?

80
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,470
I know. Came all the way there, but why?!

81
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,340
Huh, who?

82
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,940
Nothing.

83
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,840
Ah, where are you going now?

84
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,790
I'm going to feed the snail, feed the snail.

85
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:59,030
♬ In the dark night sky ♬

86
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:06,620
♬  the twinkling stars color it in ♬

87
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,090
♬ The single star in my heart ♬

88
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:19,230
♬ draws out the hidden you ♬

89
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:26,540
♬  I don't know why ♬
♬ When the long night passes and sun shines ♬

90
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:32,200
♬  I hope my warmth from my fingertips reaches you ♬

91
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:38,850
♬ My everything, my destiny♬

92
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:45,240
♬ My heart keeps going out to you ♬

93
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,420
I'm sorry, Mom.
♬ When I open my eyes, let me hear it♬

94
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,700
We were a wrong encounter from the beginning.
♬ That you love me, Sweet melody ♬

95
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Where's our snail?

96
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,120
I bought something sweet.

97
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,930
Our snail has to eat.

98
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,100
Where'd she go?

99
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,260
Tada!

100
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:38,500
What are you doing? Why are you in runaway-wife-mode?

101
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,990
I'm planning on staying at Yeoul Island for a while.

102
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,270
Why Yeoul Island suddenly? It hasn't been long since you saw your mom.

103
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,060
I'm worried about Yeoul Island.

104
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,200
What an excuse.

105
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,390
Will Yeoul Island

106
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,600
go on vacation or something? Also, have you forgotten the contract?

107
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,030
We have to live as a married couple until the baby is born.

108
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,830
Don't you know? Did you forget?

109
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,020
There wasn't a condition that we had to be together all the time.

110
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,870
Why are you changing your character suddenly?

111
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,150
Did you get hit by lightning or something?

112
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,010
You told me to live as if I'm not here.

113
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,310
I'm doing just that.

114
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,960
Alright, fine. Wherever you go or don't go, I won't care.

115
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,610
Instead! The baby inside your tummy

116
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,330
is the 23rd generation of our Lee family.

117
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,690
The mother of that baby is you. So, act appropriately, not shamefully,

118
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,180
and make sure you act properly!

119
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,830
Lee Gun, you may think of me as shameful,

120
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,620
but I don't live shamefully in my conscience.

121
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,220
Do you? Okay, fine!

122
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,270
When we're together, just forget about living as a married couple. Altogether!

123
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,940
We... we are...

124
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,890
together only because of the baby.
Only that kind of relationship. Alright?

125
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,510
♬ From the day that you arrived♬

126
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,700
Mi Young!
♬ I had no idea you’d be my life♬

127
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,280
Are you going somewhere?

128
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,020
This is good. I was getting ready for this anyways.

129
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,180
Wait a moment.

130
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:44,980
Kim Mi Young, please forgive me. I'm sorry.
♬ I know there’s times when I am wrong♬

131
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:51,090
♬ And you know there’s times when I am right♬

132
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,960
Aigoo!

133
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,660
It's so good. It's so good.

134
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,230
Food tastes so much better since the snail is gone.

135
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,440
Just meet a frog, you snail.

136
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,400
I'm free!

137
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,210
It's so good.

138
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,230
It's good...

139
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,040
Celebration time!

140
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,810
Really...

141
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:33,470
Well, she left home. Of course, she shouldn't text me. If she does, she's a crazy woman.

142
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,790
How is my cafe? Isn't the atmosphere pretty good?

143
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,120
Yes.

144
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,240
You are still mad at me, right?

145
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,610
No.

146
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,560
I thought about it. I'm sorry.

147
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,920
You were not even a priest, but still listened to me.

148
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,420
And prayed for me.

149
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,370
Thank you.

150
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,320
That is the point that I wanted to emphasize.

151
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,480
You didn't eat dinner, right?

152
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,860
Eat here. I made pasta in my past.

153
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,680
Wait a moment.

154
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,060
Oh dear. Okay,
♬ Sometimes the way home♬

155
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,560
Since the snail isn't here, and I just ate a cake, I must exercise.
♬ Can be too long, I get tired along the way ♬

156
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,920
Since I'm happy, I must exercise.
♬ Can be too long, I get tired along the way ♬

157
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,830
♬  I fall asleep right when I open the door ♬

158
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,320
♬  When I wake, no one is there ♬

159
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,700
She didn't call.
♬ When I lay in the small bathtub ♬

160
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,480
I win! I win!
♬ A small snail appears and comes to me ♬

161
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,260
She's strong.
♬ With its small voice it whispers ♬

162
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,670
Snail!
♬ With its small voice it whispers ♬

163
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,340
She's probably called now, right?
♬ Someday in the far future ♬

164
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,330
What?
♬ Across the wide and round lands ♬

165
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,500
Call...
♬  I will go forever ♬

166
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,870
Call...

167
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,170
I didn't get a call.

168
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,190
Delete the selected item?

169
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,320
Well, she said she would follow the contract.

170
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,050
What's the problem?

171
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,170
I drew that. Isn't it really pretty?

172
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,740
Yes.

173
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,280
Who is it?

174
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,180
It's Kim Mi Young.

175
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,520
Who is it, really?

176
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,590
It's really Kim Mi Young.

177
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,930
She is my younger sister, and we were separated when we were little.

178
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,760
She has the same name as you.

179
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,700
After I was adopted to America, I lost contact with her.

180
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,320
I'm trying hard to find her right now.

181
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,680
I see.

182
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,670
I want to find her as soon as possible.

183
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,300
She was a kind girl, like you.

184
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,120
I'm worried that someone is bothering her somewhere,

185
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,980
or that she is living unhappily... I'm scared.

186
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,470
She has the same name as me, right?

187
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,580
Then she must be happy.

188
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,430
She will receive love

189
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,350
from a person that she loves,

190
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,080
and she will have people that are worrying for her.

191
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,710
Be strong!

192
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,110
The person that needs to be strong is you.

193
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,670
You came out to avoid him, because it was too difficult, right?

194
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,380
Let's start over.

195
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,300
How about sworn siblings?

196
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,490
No matter what hardships you go through, I will help you.

197
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,100
Like a real brother. Okay?

198
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,540
Then I'll tell you this with a brother's heart.

199
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,120
Go back home today.

200
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,460
No matter how bad your husband is,

201
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,360
if he doesn't know where you are, he must be worried.

202
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,580
♬ I like the bright sunlight.♬

203
00:16:54,630 --> 00:17:00,070
♬ Your smile spreads widely.♬

204
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:07,120
♬ I get the feeling of my heart fluttering ♬

205
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,300
♬ Like a fool, ♬

206
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,710
The house is so big.

207
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,220
♬ I draw you. And then I erase you.♬

208
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,970
Just as I thought, this isn't right.

209
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,290
Kim Mi Young!

210
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,470
If you were planning to come back anyway, are you happy that you made me worry?

211
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,440
I didn't even say goodbye to Grandmother. I just couldn't leave.

212
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,770
How about me?

213
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,180
How about me?

214
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,710
Do you know how worried I was?!

215
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,500
And the 23rd generation... Him.

216
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,130
The baby inside you.

217
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,750
I know that very well.

218
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:16,210
Let's talk tomorrow. Let's think about this tomorrow.

219
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,440
Because of me, you are worried, right?

220
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,650
Thank you.

221
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,680
While everyone else called me a post-it,

222
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,940
only you told me to become the Superglue Girl.

223
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,310
And to not feel discouraged.

224
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,430
You are the only one who told me that.

225
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,030
I will always remember you.

226
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,910
Why are you saying that?

227
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,900
Just... I wanted to say at least this.

228
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:09,400
♬ When I offer my hand and hold you tight,♬

229
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,740
♬ Even the twisted destiny will become love.♬

230
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:23,600
♬ I shout this. I just love you.♬

231
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:34,080
♬ My heart wants you. You are my destiny.♬

232
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,170
♬ I love you.♬

233

Jangin Chemicals

237
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,530
CEO! CEO! CEO!

238
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,930
I did it!

239
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,470
I've finally escorted that person.

240
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,490
Hard to see his face~~~ Hard to find in public~~~

241
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,890
That person who is difficult to meet, that person D.... Pitt.

242
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,960
He is soon going to arrive.

243
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,140
I told you not to go so overboard, that this kind of behavior is difficult for me.

244
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,810
You should act more prudently if it's something this important.

245
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,910
Freeze!

246
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,470
You came?

247
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,270
It's an honor.

248
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,810
You're D. Pitt?

249
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,460
Just call me Daniel.

250
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,690
We have finally met like this, CEO Lee Gun.

251
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:45,010
You've probably figured out that I'm a fake priest, so stop staring at me.

252
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,900
I don't like being stared at.

253
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,190
I knew there was some kind of scent about you in the beginning.

254
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:56,080
A foul scent. Eventually, you revealed that you're a conman.

255
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,410
Let's distinguish who is more of a jerk later.

256
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:03,260
Should we begin talking about business as we had promised for the purpose of this meeting?

257
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,890
The collaboration that my company has offered...

258
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,200
I heard you accepted.
- Well, you should know everything.

259
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,700
What would be your real reason for wanting to work with this company?

260
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,490
I really want to work here now.

261
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:28,320
I still find it really annoying.

262
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,120
Could it be because of my wife?

263
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,680
It's because of Mi Young.

264
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,070
Just a moment ago,

265
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,360
I said, "my wife," did you forget that?

266
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,140
Since you have never once treated Mi Young as your wife,

267
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,700
I forgot that she was your wife.

268
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,680
But... I guess it does bother you.

269
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,680
Just focus on your own work.

270
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,170
Don't be interested in my wife.

271
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,870
It won't be easy.

272
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:31,930
I am very good at finding gemstones that haven't been polished.

273
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:36,860
Also, Mi Young is the best gemstone.

274
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,420
Tada! This is my new job.

275
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,420
Are you like a visiting teacher who reads books to children?

276
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,710
I sell them, too. It's something around those lines.

277
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:04,680
If I read to them in this husky voice, they will develop a strong mind.

278
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,210
Ji Yeon, is this really what you like doing?

279
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,550
How many jobs that you like doing would there be?

280
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,430
As whatever becomes this and this becomes that, it'll probably get better.

281
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,650
I was going to buy this. Save me a set!

282
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,290
Don't strain yourself, but be sure to buy the whole set.

283
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,130
♬  This Friday ♬

284
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,520
You might as well ask your husband to read it to you.

285
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,810
I heard that babies hear their father's voices better because they have a low tone.

286
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,930
Really?

287
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,950
I should do that.

288
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,170
Let's eat the cold bean soup noodles.

289
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,880
Your wife must have gone somewhere.

290
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,270
I don't think housekeeping suits her.

291
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,520
Why would she do any housekeeping?

292
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,860
Treating her like a queen isn't even enough.

293
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,990
Are you dissing her because you don't realize how special our new granddaughter-in-law is?

294
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:10,070
Ms. Wang's soup is so sweet and nutty (serves you right)!

295
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,740
So nutty.

296
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,780
Why don't you get the chives kimchi quickly?

297
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,750
What's the matter, Gun? Does the bean broth taste yucky?

298
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,180
What is this smell? This smell?

299
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,890
What's wrong all of a sudden? Do you not feel well? Should we go to the hospital?

300
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,720
Why would I go to the hospital just because of this?

301
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,020
What are you doing? Quickly bring some cold water!

302
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,220
I'm home!
- Yes.

303
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,240
The refrigerator. The refrigerator door, could you do something about that?

304
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,250
Are you both having morning sickness?

305
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,380
You guys are really special.

306
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,460
Aigoo! We have an occasion to celebrate!

307
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,570
It's double morning sickness which only the match made in heaven goes through!

308
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:19,340
How can a man have morning sickness? I'm just not feeling very well.

309
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,030
I've heard that if you're sensitive to scents, you can't be anywhere near the refrigerator.

310
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,610
You guys will have to eat together in the room cozily now.

311
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:31,150
Eat a spoon and glance at your wife.
♬ My old man♬
♬ Why do you call?♬

312
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:35,050
♬ Did you see the pair of chicks?♬
♬ I did ♬
♬ How was it?♬

313
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:39,390
♬ Because my body is old♬
♬ I ate them to restore my health ♬

314
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:44,160
♬ Oh good, you did well♬
♬ Good, Good, you did well ♬

315
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,340
♬ That's your old man for you ♬

316
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:13,630
Ridiculous, how ridiculous. I'm at a loss for words!

317
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,600
Does this make any sense? For me to have morning sickness when I'm not even the one pregnant.

318
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,000
Is this the mystery of human body or what.
My body is not my body!

319
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:27,360
It probably isn't morning sickness. You'll be fine after a while.

320
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,450
But really,

321
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,050
Kim Mi Young...

322
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,270
is it really morning sickness that you have?

323
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:41,640
Yes, I believe that this is morning sickness.

324
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,230
Hold on a minute.

325
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,060
You'll be fine after you eat this for a little bit.

326
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,940
Eat up.

327
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,270
But...

328
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,500
really..

329
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,980
Yeoul Island,

330
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,500
are you going to go there?

331
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,130
Not right now, but eventually I'll have to go.

332
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:21,190
Anyway, it means you're not firmly set on it.

333
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,220
Unni!

334
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,670
It's freshly squeezed. Drink.

335
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,670
Why did you come to Seoul so suddenly?
- That's what I'm saying! It hasn't been long since the marriage.

336
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,160
He'll be working at the head office soon.

337
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,990
We wanted to find a house we could live in early on.

338
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,360
You're already looking for a house?

339
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,880
You can do that slowly.

340
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,330
After giving birth, I won't be able to move!

341
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,060
We need to find a house first.
- That's right.

342
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,480
We looked around a couple of places.

343
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,890
I don't know if it's because it is in Seoul, but it was really expensive.

344
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,840
You should start with the semi-basement houses. Dark and sticky...

345
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,710
I know it well since I've lived there.

346
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,780
But CEO...

347
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,620
No, thanks to Brother-in-law, we'll be able to live in Seoul.

348
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,690
Thank you!

349
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,620
Sis..

350
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,720
What amazing thing did I do anyway?

351
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,790
When it is ready, the head office will contact you. The head office.

352
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,400
Head office?

353
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,090
It's the first time that the wife's family has come.

354
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:57,470
What are you doing Granddaughter-in-law, your newlywed room...

355
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,150
You need to show them around!

356
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,620
Yes, let's see!

357
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,640
Can't you look later?

358
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,540
It will be dirty.
- Yes, it's dirty.

359
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,080
Then should I clean it up for you?

360
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,010
No, there is no need.

361
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,730
I will do it. I'll do it.

362
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,000
Hamo~ Hamo! Hamo (of course)!

363
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,200
Gun!

364
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,500
Wow.

365
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,580
Impressive!

366
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,390
What is this?

367
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,550
Is this a model home or something?

368
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,950
I told you to come in when I tell you to.

369
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:10,610
It's fine. You didn't have to clean. It already is.

370
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,310
I smell it here.

371
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,360
I smell it over there too.

372
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,500
Everywhere it smells...

373
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,960
What? What kind of smell is it? What kind of smell?

374
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,910
It's definitely!

375
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,320
There is a scent of money. It really is different.

376
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,000
It's the basics, the basics.

377
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,610
Take a picture of me.
-When will we ever get to live in a house like this.

378
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,590
One. One. Two!

379
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,060
You guys, too!

380
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,170
Yeah, you too.

381
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:45,390
One. Two.

382
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,470
We should send this to Mom.

383
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,220
One. Two.

384
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,980
If she sees this, she'll see you're living well and feel relieved.

385
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,500
One. Two.

386
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,020
We're happy. We're so happy.

387
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,080
We're really happy.

388
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,800
Our Mi Young met such a good husband, she's bursting with good luck.

389
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,320
Sister-in-law, later with your husband, we'll all ride the ferry together, right?

390
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,920
A double date? It would be so much fun!

391
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,470
Of course!
-Of course, he can't go. He is very busy.

392
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,160
He's extremely busy. He can't. Really busy.

393
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,580
I'm busy!

394
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,070
I had to be busy today out of all days.

395
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,360
I'm kinda busy, right? Yeah.

396
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,960
I'm busy. I'm busy.

397
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,750
The smell. It feels good smelling the fishy water smell,
even if it's not the ocean.

398
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,750
Hey Mi Ja,

399
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,850
is it alright for you to be wandering around like this?

400
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,210
I have such a handsome and sexy husband beside me,

401
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,110
what would I be afraid of?

402
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,850
Oh really?

403
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,230
This girl... Come here!

404
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,810
I love you!

405
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:04,180
It would have been nice if Brother-in-law Lee came along.

406
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,500
Let's not burden the busy guy.

407
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,980
We can have fun all on our own.

408
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,140
Okay, let's go! We can come together next time.

409
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,970
Let's go.

410
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,650
One. Two.

411
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,660
That's amazing.

412
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,820
Mi Ja, smile!

413
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,970
One. Two.

414
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,550
Let's go to that side.

415
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,800
Over there.

416
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,820
Sorry...
- Aiyoo, aiyoo.

417
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,290
Is that word a conditioned reflex?

418
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,330
How did you get here?

419
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,680
I finished my work early.

420
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:17,380
I wanted to get some fresh air and feed the seagulls.

421
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,060
This isn't the ocean, it's a river.

422
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,740
What are you thinking?

423
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,920
A woman with a husband goes around all by herself, looking pitiful.

424
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,000
It doesn't look good.

425
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,830
But we are just a married couple by contract.

426
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,880
You don't have to worry about me when other people are not around.

427
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,510
What are you talking about?

428
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,870
So you're saying, I should pretend to treat you nicely in front of them,

429
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:47,240
but when they turn back, mind my own business? Huh?

430
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,970
Look here. Do I look like a weird, two-faced guy?

431
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:55,620
Instead of talking nonsense,

432
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:01,440
while you're with me, you can lean on me.

433
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,780
My shoulders are broader than they appear. They are broad.

434
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:09,350
They are capable of supporting you at least.

435
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,590
Why are you looking at me like that?

436
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:20,090
I don't think I said anything wrong.

437
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,460
Just exactly, who is the real you?

438
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,220
What do you mean?
- I want to know who the real you is.

439
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,920
I have another side to me?

440
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,280
You said this last time, too, but this is me. What you see is what you get.

441
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,440
Why do you keep saying weird things?

442
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,380
So...

443
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,880
why did you sell the Yeoul Island Factory to a weird place?

444
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,350
That... You knew about it?

445
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:55,530
All my family members like you a lot.

446
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,140
Though you may not know it.

447
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:05,580
Since the Yeoul Island Factory is under your company, it's possible to do that.

448
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,800
I understand, but still...

449
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,940
But selling it to an industrial waste disposal company...
I really don't think that's right.

450
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,750
If that happens,

451
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,900
then Yeoul Island will be destroyed and the island people and...

452
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,960
My family...

453
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,630
Is that why you were like that?

454
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,490
I now understand.

455
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:44,040
Yes. In that case, it's understandable.

456
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,920
But I will explain it to you.

457
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,090
What happened was-

458
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:52,740
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

459
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,920
You sold the factory to who and how?!

460
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,730
That can't be. Brother-in-law, you didn't, did you?

461
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,570
You didn't, right?
- I did, but...

462
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,640
WHAT DID YOU SAY, YOU BASTARD?!

463
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,910
What did you say?! Who did you sell it to?!

464
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,400
Please calm down and listen to what I have to say.

465
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,780
How can you do this to Mi Young? No wonder her face didn't seem well and was acting strange.

466
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,180
That's not it. That's not it.

467
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,770
You're going to take a beating today!

468
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,860
Let go Unni!

469
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,620
Oh my hair, my hair....
-Let go of this! Let go!

470
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,420
Ah, it hurts!

471
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,760
You're going to hurt yourself. You're going to get hurt. I'm telling you.

472
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,420
My hair. My hair.

473
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,250
Unni! Wha-wha-what's wrong?

474
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,400
Let me stand up.

475
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,000
What's wrong?

476
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,830
Where does it hurt?

477
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,780
Where does it hurt?
- Aigo...

478
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,380
My hair. My hair. My hair!

479
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,370
My hair.

480
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,730
Careful. Careful. Have a seat.

481
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,260
My hair.

482
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,860
I'm dying.

483
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,180
I'm going to die first.
-I'm dying, too. I'm dying, too.

484
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,640
Mi Ja, let go. Let go.

485
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,270
I'll tell you everything. Let go of this.

486
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:22,460
Aigoo, poor Mom. What should I do?

487
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,190
Not knowing that her son-in-law sold the factory to such a scary place, she's just happy to be having a son!

488
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,790
Oh my.

489
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:33,950
Let go of this. He's going to go bald.

490
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,380
You're still taking this terrible guy's side?

491
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,030
I didn't sell it.

492
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,150
I didn't sell it. I'm telling you, I didn't sell it!

493
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,840
I didn't sell it.

494
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,570
Is that true?

495
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,960
You didn't sell it?
- That's right.

496
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,430
I didn't sell it, okay?

497
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,030
I didn't!

498
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,760
I'm finally saying it.

499
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,030
Ah, it's so hard. So hard.

500
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,140
Is that true?

501
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,990
Yes.

502
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,850
What happened was...

503
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,980
The... ah!

504
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,370
Doctor? Doctor?

505
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,980
Are you a doctor? No? Are you a doctor?

506
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,190
Are you a doctor? No? You, too?

507
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,510
Are you a doctor?!

508
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,600
Is there a doctor here?!

509
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,310
Doctor? Doctor?

510
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,390
Are you a doctor? Doctor?

511
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,120
Is there a doctor, or no?
Huh? No?

512
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,820
Darn it! This doesn't make sense.

513
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,960
In the movies if you ask if there is a doctor, someone always responds "yes."

514
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,570
There's no other option.
Indeed, Ms. Wang said this in the past.

515
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,870
Before there were obstetricians, everyone could deliver a baby.

516
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,060
Alright.

517
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,860
Slowly. Carefully, be careful.

518
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,440
He said they will be at the dock to meet the boat, but

519
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,540
there's still 20 minutes left until the boat arrives.

520
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,950
We have to do what we can.
Alright. We'll do our best.

521
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,730
Calm down.

522
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,120
I'm so scared. What am I going to do if anything goes wrong?

523
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,420
Nothing is going to go wrong. Don't say things like that, Mi Ja.

524
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,420
If you have to choose

525
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,710
between the baby and me,

526
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,230
choose the baby.

527
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:34,830
Don't say things like that. Nothing is going to go wrong.

528
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:40,760
If you let my baby be raised by another b*tch, I'm going to kill you.

529
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,990
Raise the kid yourself. I think I'm going to die like this.

530
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,070
She isn't going to die. Let her hand go.

531
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,760
Hold this for her. Hold it tight. Okay, okay.

532
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,920
Listen to me. Listen.

533
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,150
Be calm and listen to me. Do you feel pressure in your abdomen?

534
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,800
Do you feel like an odd pressure?

535
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,890
I think so.

536
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,390
When that feeling comes back, hold the tie tight.

537
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:08,890
Time it.

538
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,270
It came.

539
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,050
It comes every minute.

540
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,120
It is a minute. Then this is stage 3.

541
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:21,130
The 3rd stage means that the baby is starting to come out.

542
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:25,780
You only need to push a bit more. The breathing is the most important here.

543
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:29,600
Try breathing. Breathe out.

544
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,350
Breathe in a bit more. Breathe out.

545
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,770
A bit more.

546
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:39,400
Now, the baby will come soon.

547
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,370
Go down and see if you can see the baby's head.

548
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,840
What?

549
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:48,400
Go look for the head!
I'm telling you to look for the head!

550
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:53,280
Down. Down here!

551
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,890
Push gradually.

552
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,330
Oh, my.

553
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,460
Brother-in-law!

554
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,230
Mi Young, it's okay, it's okay!
Again, breathe.

555
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,360
One, two, three, push!

556
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,380
The baby is coming! Unni, push!

557
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:19,320
She said that the baby is coming. For the last time, one, two, three, push!

558
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,540
The baby is coming.

559
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,880
Awwww...

560
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,310
Brother-in-law, thank you so much.

561
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:36,500
It's nothing.

562
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,590
It's you who worked the hardest.

563
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,630
If it wasn't for Gun,

564
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,820
my sister wouldn't have been able to go through labor.

565
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,870
Well, I did everything.

566
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,940
Mother-in-law, this way.

567
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,800
Mi Ja, Mi Ja!

568
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,440
Good work. You did a good job. Let's see...

569
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,500
Awwww.

570
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,880
Looks just like you.

571
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,300
Mommy!

572
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,570
I'm so sorry, Mom!

573
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:14,040
You went through so much pain when you had us.

574
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,750
I'll be a good daughter.

575
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:21,920
You girl, now you are all grown up.

576
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,720
The next one is you,

577
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,780
so be prepared for it.

578
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,640
I'll be really good to you, too.

579
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,540
Aigoo!

580
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:37,870
I heard my son-in-law did all the work. Come here my son.

581
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:40,600
Mom.

582
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,190
Good job. Good job.

583
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,840
Oh, by the way Brother-in-law, thank you for making the community center.

584
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,790
That was nothing.

585
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:53,660
What's that? A community center?

586
00:43:54,610 --> 00:44:00,270
Oh, the land where the factory used to be, a community center is being built, so people are very excited.

587
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:04,720
That massaging machine, running machine, and the foot bath massage machine

588
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,520
are all in the center.
-How come I didn't know?

589
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,240
How would you know when you were in Seoul with your wife?

590
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,300
I did that. I did that.

591
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,790
Brother-in-law, want to hold the baby?

592
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,060
You are the person who saved Yeoul Island and helped me with labor.

593
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,740
Oh, but... I'm scared I might drop the baby.

594
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,020
Hold the baby. You will become a father soon.

595
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,910
You need practice holding the baby.

596
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:35,840
Carefully...

597
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,940
So small.

598
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,270
Kind of looks like ET.

599
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:56,510
Which star did you come from? Which star?

600
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,910
Do you need something?

601
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,910
Tonight, just sleep on the bed. I'll sleep here.

602
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,150
This is my spot.

603
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:05,650
You really don't listen, do you? You are actually quite stubborn.

604
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,590
I'm used to it, so it's ok.

605
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:13,450
You say that you can't say no, but you always say no to me.

606
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,640
Just sleep in the bed tonight!

607
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:18,150
Sleep on the bed.

608
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,490
You need to sleep on the bed.

609
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,680
Go sleep. You need to sleep on the bed.

610
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,410
Need to sleep. Good night.

611
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,250
Good night.

612
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,670
Ugh, this is so uncomfortable.

613
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,290
How did she sleep on this?

614
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:26,580
Ugh, I can't make myself comfortable in any position.

615
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,220
Thank you very much for today.

616
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,260
I'm Lee Gun.

617
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,570
That is the basics.

618
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:05,190
And from now on, I'll be really careful

619
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:09,820
not to be a nuisance to you.

620
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:20,950
When the time comes, like a post-it, without any residue,

621
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:25,180
I'll leave according to the contract.

622
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,720
Don't worry.

623
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,360
CEO.

624
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,720
CEO?

625
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,000
Chief Secretary Tak.
- Yes.

626
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,190
Next week,

627
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:00,130
look for a plane to New York.

628
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,040
Why?

629
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,270
Are you finally going to confront her?

630
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:08,310
Living like this,

631
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,450
I don't think it is good for either Se Ra or Mi Young.

632
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,040
I'll need to go see Se Ra

633
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,640
and tell her clearly.

634
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,410
Find a plane for me.

635
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:26,620
Yes. I'll do it.

636
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:02,670
What is this sound?

637
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:10,880
What the-

638
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,630
If you give me one piece of dduk (rice cake), I won't eat you.

639
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,190
Save me!

640
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,390
Save me!

641
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:52,260
What are you doing right now?

642
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:57,760
This late at night, with your messy hair, do you want to see someone faint?

643
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,760
You weren't sleeping?

644
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:04,180
How am I supposed to sleep when there are ghost noises?!

645
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,650
What is this?

646
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:08,840
It's nothing.
- What nothing, there is something.

647
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,630
Let me see.

648
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:15,720
Give it to me, what is this?

649
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,550
The Sun and the Moon (Korean children's folktale)

650
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,550
These... so soon?

651
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:23,650
It's good to read to the baby inside, I heard.

652
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,090
The baby feels more relaxed, too.

653
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,220
But why would you read such a frightening book?

654
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,240
There are many books that are sweet and cute.

655
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,840
But.. I'm showing my kind gesture, so..

656
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,690
Dad is reading it for you.

657
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,480
Anyway, I will continue the story.

658
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:51,840
"So the tiger received the rice cake (dduk)."

659
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:57,340
"Ddu-duk, Ddu-duk, DDududududuk!"

660
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:01,840
"The tiger was drooling and was getting ready to lunge... Rawr... Dduk!"

661
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:09,230
"Somewhere in the distance he heard that sound again. Ddu-duk, Ddu-duk, Ddu-duk. DDududududuk!"

662
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:12,240
"The tiger looked at it and went..."

663
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,590
"Then appeared again. "

664
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,940
In my opinion, the timing was off for the tiger.

665
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:25,180
The tiger roared again going, "Rawr, dduk! Rawr, dduk!" and then re-appeared.

666
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:29,160
"If you give me a rice cake, I won't eat you."

667
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:35,250
♬ I don’t know why. The more I erase you with tears♬

668
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:41,550
♬ The clearer you get♬

669
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:44,050
♬ Don’t go away ♬

670
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:48,930
♬ When the long night passes and sun shines ♬

671
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:54,630
♬ I hope my warmth from my fingertips reaches you ♬

672
00:52:54,630 --> 00:53:01,270
♬ My everything, my destiny ♬

673
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:07,720
♬ My heart keeps going to you♬

674
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:14,180
♬ When I open my eyes, let me hear it♬

675
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,470
♬ Let me hear you saying I love you ♬

676
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:19,380
♬ Sweet melody♬

677
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,220
Do you have something to say?

678
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,430
I'm not telling you to live like a Post-it.

679
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,110
While you're with me, becoming a trivial,

680
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:44,680
insignificant person,
that's not what I mean.

681
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:51,470
Mi Young, you're superglue.

682
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,730
Did you forget?

683
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,480
Gun...

684
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,160
I will go now.

685
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,710
Good night.

686
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,560
Sleep well.

687
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:17,250
Oh my!
- Oh, my back! I think my back is broken in half!

688
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,970
Does it hurt somewhere?

689
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:22,040
I think I strained myself too much when I wasn't even the one giving birth.

690
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,440
Okay, just like this. Gently, gently, careful!

691
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,330
Gentle, Gently
- Careful, careful.

692
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:29,130
What to do? What to do?

693
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,010
Just a bit more.

694
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:35,010
I can't, I can't go up there.

695
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:41,660
See, I told you I would sleep on the sofa.

696
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:45,340
Don't do that and sleep on the bed. I will sleep on the sofa.

697
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,510
Sleep well.

698
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,530
This stupid of a woman...!

699
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:57,560
Are you thinking or not? A pregnant woman should sleep comfortably.

700
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,380
You're uncomfortable as well though...

701
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,090
Then let's do this, since there is no choice.

702
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:06,450
What?

703
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:11,250
Making it fair, and don't take this the wrong way.

704
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:19,030
In this same bed, together, let's sleep, sleeping, together...

705
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:20,660
sleeping.

706
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,180
What?

707
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,340
Why are you so surprised?

708
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,930
What kind of weird thoughts are you thinking of?

709
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:29,940
No, no. It's...

710
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:34,630
It's not that, suddenly going all, together, sleeping...

711
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:38,840
We have to share this room until the baby is born anyway.

712
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,340
Are we going to continue staying separate and uncomfortable?

713
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,470
Let's just sleep together on the bed, okay?

714
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:48,510
I won't touch a single hair on you. Don't touch.

715
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:51,260
Oh, do you have some weird feelings about me?

716
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,470
No, not at all.

717
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,300
I also don't have any at all. None at all.

718
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,430
Then we can sleep here together, like a couple of objects.

719
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:05,930
Yes, like objects.

720
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,630
No problem.

721
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:15,510
Then the first person to leave the bed and go to the sofa,

722
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:18,800
or the person who falls off the bed and sleeps on the ground,

723
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,840
has feelings for the other person. What do you think?

724
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:27,770
There's something going on , you know.
- Yes.

725
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,090
Let's sleep.
- Good night.
- Sleep well.

726
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:38,680
Sleep well.

727
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,920
How comfortable. We are objects.
- Yes.

728
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,620
We are objects! Objects.

729
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,760
This is comfortable.

730
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,490
Yes, it's very, very comfortable.

731
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:55,650
This is reeeeeeee....

732
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,430
...eally comfortable!

733
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:07,690
Oh, my back.
- Oh, mine too.

734
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,080
I'm only an object.

735
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,630
An object.

736
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:22,010
An object...

737
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,930
This isn't nervousness,

738
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:37,050
it's discomfort.

739
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,220
Discomfort.

740
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:44,840
I'm not an object.

741
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,400
I'm not an object.

742
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,550
I am an object.

743
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,590
I'm not an object.

744
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,530
I'm an object.

745
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:55,680
I'm not an object..

746
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:20,840
I... think I'd better sleep on the sofa.

747
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,260
Good night.
