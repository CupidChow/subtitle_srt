♬ Dream when you're feeling blue♬

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:25,500
♬ Dream, that's the thing to do ♬

00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:35,980
♬ Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air ♬

♬ You'll find your share of ♬

5
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,360
♬ memories there♬

6
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,740
Cool guy, your name is Dad.

7
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,950
The body shampoo made for you, Papa Baby.

8
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,570
Cut!

9
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,930
You're going to say okay to this? You should do more.

10
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,110
Hey, just go with it when you should.

11
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,260
Since when were you such a perfectionist?

12
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,410
Okay! Great job, guys!

13
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,950
Good work!

14
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,530
See you later, Jae Min.

15
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,170
Wait a minute!

16
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,360
♬  I was born into a poor family ♬

17
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,300
♬ We could even barely afford to eat out ♬

18
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,350
♬ When mother hadn't come back home from work♬

19
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,530
♬ I always cooked ramyun to eat alone...♬

20
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,830
g.o.d (Korean pop band)... fan.

21
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,290
Nice to meet you.

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,970
It's been a while.

23
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,880
Yes, it has been a while.

24
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,950
Ah, Park Joon Hyung,

25
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,270
you don't hold a baby like that.

26
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,930
Take a good look. Come here, come here, come here.

27
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,760
Okay, take a look.

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,210
You have to think like this is your house, and just naturally...

29
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,310
The baby's head can fall back,

30
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,880
so for safety you put your left hand over their stomach.

31
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,660
But the most important point in this situation

32
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,680
is that pressure can go to the baby's back when it slants.
When that happens,

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,810
you spread your fingers out widely.

34
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,570
So wrap your hands like this and the baby can lay comfortably.

35
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,720
Then you can be called a dad.

36
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,640
But who are you?
- Oh, me?

37
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,660
Lee Gun. "You" is Lee Gun.

38
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,930
CEO Lee Gun!

39
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,330
Hello..
- Aigoo.. A g.o.d member doesn't have to do that.

40
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,520
I am a fan, too.

41
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,990
Oh yeah, wasssup!

42
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,000
Our Jae Min seems to be tired, so

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,120
rest periodically while shooting.

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,980
Here you go...

45
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,170
Go to mommy.

46
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,640
But then the shooting will take longer...

47
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,220
Ye..yes, we'll do that.
- You will.

48
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,160
Department Head Lee, stay behind and wrap it up well.

49
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,750
Seriously...
You came, CEO!

50
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,510
You didn't possibly make a breach of contract,
or those kinds of things this time, right?

51
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,320
Chief Secretary Tak , don't overdo it. In those 3 years,

52
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,170
I didn't even say the "wee" of weeyakgeum.
(meaning the first sound of Penalty)

53
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,510
Yes, during the last 3 years,

54
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,280
you were the best example, the best. Watch your feet.

55
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,940
But you know, we are already 30 minutes late for your Dr. Octopus appointment. He's very angry.

56
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,950
Even if Dr. Octopus brings out his legs, he's only going to spray his ink.

57
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,680
We can just buy him something sweet to not spray his ink.

58
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,930
The sigh (yearning)

59
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,290
All of the pieces at this exhibit are nice, but I personally like this one the best.

60
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,850
What part about it?

61
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,610
Overall, the feel of the painting is just good.

62
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,710
More than that, it's the only work of artist Ellie Kim that's of a child,

63
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,060
so it catches the eye.

64
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,020
This is most likely the work that Ellie Kim treasures the most.

65
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,900
You are working so hard. Have some coffee everyone.

66
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,660
Thank you.

67
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,570
Thank you.

68
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,300
But when will the artist arrive?

69
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,110
I always wondered what the artist that drew these warm paintings reminding of a little girl would be like.

70
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,710
I'm very curious.

71
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,090
Thank you.

72
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,080
Here's the person that everyone's so curious about.

73
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,840
Greet the staff members.

74
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,460
Hello, I'm Artist Ellie Kim.

75
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,790
You can just call me Elli. Please look after me.

76
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,220
Clap.

77
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,780
Oh, it's sweet.

78
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,580
But are you going to keep

79
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,290
being late to our appointments?

80
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:07,380
Do you know who I see the most, other than Madame Wang and Secretary Tak?

81
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,640
Who is it?
- You, Dr. Octopus!

82
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,340
So stop giving me those sticky-sticky eye stares.

83
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,710
I'm telling you others will misunderstand.
- If you hate it that much,

84
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,220
then find a lover whom you can see more frequently than me.

85
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,930
Stop spraying your ink

86
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,460
and tell me about the result of the test I got last time.

87
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,260
It's clean, which is a relief.

88
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,770
I think it's in remission since then.

89
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,890
To prevent it from sticking its head out...

90
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,890
let's try it this way.

91
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,200
That's fine then.

92
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,170
And now...

93
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,990
has your stress about getting the disease diminished?
- Everyone dies once anyway,

94
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,590
the only difference is when that moment comes.

95
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,120
CEO Lee, you've become pretty cool.

96
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,460
Anyway, the Chairwoman

97
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,120
doesn't tell you to go on marriage dates?

98
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,460
The way they look...

99
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,360
they're all alike.

100
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,530
Of course, Chairwoman! It was hard for me to even find and choose these girls.

101
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,220
Seoul University. Seoul University.

102
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,520
President's daughter, Chairman's daughter, CEO...

103
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,940
Hey, Ji Yeon,

104
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,770
are there only girls with this kind of CV?

105
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,670
I tried to choose the best of the best...

106
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,100
What kind of qualities are you looking for to meet your standards, Ms. Chairwoman?

107
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,820
I don't need the degrees or wealth, any of those things.

108
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,410
I am very proud that Yeoul Island is my hometown.

109
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,220
They need to be proud of where they come from.

110
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,190
I hope he can endure it well.

111
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,520
Instead of caring only about herself,

112
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,050
thinking of others first.

113
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,500
Thank you, Grandma.

114
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,800
Someone that lives saying I'm sorry and thank you,

115
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,990
is there no woman like that?

116
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,080
Then, how about just bringing Mi Young unni back?

117
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,880
Of course, I have a conscience, too.

118
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,880
How could I expect that kind of perfect girl again?

119
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,040
Should I just send him away on a trip or something?

120
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,760
If our Gunnie has a thing at a hotel,

121
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,070
then for sure it will be fast and exact.

122
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,730
Like the situation in Macau, that's a good idea.

123
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,130
Should I plan something? Where should we choose?

124
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,450
Bali? Bangkok?

125
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,180
It's dangerous if you drive with only one hand.

126
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,990
Oh yeah? Alrighty then.

127
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,450
How would I disobey your order?
I'll drive with two hands.

128
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,940
You're tired because we're driving straight to Seoul, right?

129
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,960
Should I just cancel today's meeting?

130
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,540
No.

131
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,270
To open the show, the people were a great help. Of course, I should go meet them personally.

132
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:43,770
I haven't seen my Mom's face in a long time, so it's good.

133
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,560
I'm reporter Daniel Pitt from a Paris newspaper. Artist Ellie Kim,

134
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,310
how do you feel about returning to Korea after three years?

135
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,840
I thought that a lot would have changed.

136
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,910
But I can't really tell now that I'm actually here.
It kind of feels the same, too.

137
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,220
Eh... It's not the same, Ms. Artist.

138
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,710
Now, I'm next to you.

139
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,130
Right? Look forward.

140
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,200
Let's go eat something.

141
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,960
Ddeokbokki (spicy rice cake)!

142
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,220
Are you buying us other things, too?

143
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,070
Ddeokbokki!

144
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,450
Daebak, your boyfriend is here again!

145
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,860
Your boyfriend is totally my type!

146
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,850
He's so handsome!

147
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,190
Students, don't pay attention to your teacher's private life and do your own things.

148
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,140
Teacher! Food!

149
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,520
Since your student's performances are over, you must be not as busy.

150
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,830
I'm going to properly enjoy the rest of the vacation.

151
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,820
What is that?
- This?

152
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,900
The students that graduated last year came to see the performance and gave this to me.

153
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,890
They used to be the members of Kang-Love-Kids.
What's Kang-Love-Kids?

154
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:19,370
Kids who Love Teacher Kang.

155
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,200
I never knew that you would be so suitable as a teacher.

156
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,570
Se Ra, quitting ballet,

157
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,000
you don't regret it?
- Why would I do that?

158
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,210
How is it?
- It's pretty. They have good taste.

159
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,480
Wow, people with no students should basically die.

160
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,770
Are you going to stay still?

161
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,780
I shouldn't stay still. I will be scolded.

162
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,590
I will put it on for you.

163
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,960
Come over here.

164
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,060
Here.

165
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,930
Why? Is something wrong?
- Eh?

166
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,770
No.

167
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,180
I should've come visited you, but I have
quite a few things to take care of in Seoul.

168
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,320
Thank you for coming here.

169
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,070
And I thank you again for agreeing to do the exhibit.

170
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,120
I'm not ready to do these things yet,

171
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,240
and I feel uneasy about doing an exhibit first.

172
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,290
What are you saying? You should now collaborate with us

173
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,240
and engage in more activities as an artist domestically.

174
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,350
Thank you for liking my work.

175
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,170
Artist Ellie Kim is so humble compared to her skill.

176
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,340
By the way, I heard you became the director at Se Jong Biennale.

177
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,910
Everyone is looking forward to it.

178
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,290
Anyway, when are you two getting married?

179
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,870
What?

180
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,100
I would be sent to jail if I were to ask such a private question in France, right? It's just you look so good together.

181
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,380
I'm hinting at her to figure out my feelings.

182
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,960
CEO Lee Gun,

183
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,210
what are you doing this weekend? Shall we watch a movie?

184
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,230
What should I do? I have something to do this weekend.

185
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,490
Really? What is it?

186
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,910
It's just personal stuff.

187
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,990
Let's see it next time.

188
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,990
This poor solo

189
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,570
will just watch TV at home, alone.

190
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,780
Teacher Kang Se Ra, why are you a pitiful solo?

191
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,830
You have men standing in a line. You can just pick up one of them.

192
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:24,470
If a man that is cooler than you comes out, I'm not going to be a solo anymore.

193
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,870
Stop talking about me and you should date, too.

194
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,830
You probably forgot how to hold hands, too.

195
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,180
Aigoo, Kang Se Ra, I'm a stone nowadays. A stone.

196
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,430
It's hard to play with an ex-boyfriend that's become a stone.

197
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,200
I get it, I'm going.

198
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,560
Go on.
- Go.

199
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,970
That stone is still the coolest guy in this world to me.

200
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,850
What do I do?

201
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,110
Why are you closing so early today?

202
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,040
Aigoo, we have to rest too!

203
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,310
If we get sick from working so hard, we can't even open the store.

204
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,040
Go home carefully.

205
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,830
Take care.

206
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,070
Work hard!

207
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,700
Hey! You guys should go in now.

208
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,970
I will clean up the store.

209
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,790
I hope that everyday is like today.

210
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,590
Hamo-hamo!

211
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,890
There isn't anything to clean up. Just come home with us.

212
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,660
Aigoo, it's fine. We are together the whole day anyways. I'm sick of you.

213
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,750
Hey, hurry up and go home!

214
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,650
Quickly, go in!

215
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,290
Let's go!

216
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,520
Lettuce wrap rice!

217
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,000
Lettuce wrap anchovy!

218
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,380
It's me, Gun.

219
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,480
Why are there no customers every time I come here?

220
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,610
It's so strange.

221
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,530
You are the only man that would come here so late to eat.

222
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,200
Like collecting interest.

223
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,170
Why do you come so often? This food is not even amazing.

224
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:49,180
Aiyoo, that's what I mean. Ruining a man's taste like that.

225
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,160
But what do you put in here?

226
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,840
Are you putting medicine in it? You're putting medicine in it, right?

227
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,640
Shut your mouth and go sit down.
- Alright.

228
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,740
Lettuce wrap rice!

229
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:07,360
Wow, this is it.

230
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,800
So delicious.

231
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,300
I can eat 10 more bowls of rice with this.

232
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,550
You have a beggar inside?

233
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,510
Look at the way you eat! Why can't you eat coolly?

234
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,530
Your temper, really!

235
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,770
People don't even bother dogs when they eat. Dogs!

236
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,390
That's why you don't have any customers!

237
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,930
Talking back to an elder!

238
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,350
Anyway, Lettuce Wrap Rice Lady,

239
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,260
how is the shampoo I gave you before? It's pretty good, huh?

240
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,290
All shampoos are similar.

241
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:51,990
But I guess my hair became softer... And the smell is unique.

242
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,210
No! You look like you became ten years younger!

243
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,540
You look like a lettuce wrap rice girl.

244
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,630
There are many soft shampoos,

245
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,960
I have some in my car, so I will give it to you later.

246
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,070
Anyways, give me some more broth! What is wrong with the service?

247
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,970
Are you going to spend the whole night here?
Aren't you going to finish eating and get up?

248
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:14,160
How much does this broth cost? I will pay double. Just give me some more.

249
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,230
Double double!
- Okay, give it quickly.

250
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:23,140
I can dump rice in it, right? It tastes the best that way.

251
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,730
Here, just go.

252
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,850
Really! I didn't even digest the food yet!

253
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,400
You've been eating for hours!

254
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,430
Just go!

255
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,770
How much?

256
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,560
Stop fooling around. Brandishing money in front of me?

257
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,760
Go now!

258
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,470
Do you want me to drop you off?
- Just go!

259
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,000
You can just ride in it.

260
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,600
Is my ankle broken? My house is only a few steps away.

261
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,430
Just go. I can only go home if you go.

262
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,440
Okay, okay! I just asked. Can't I even ask?

263
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,150
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

264
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,440
Are you really not getting in?

265
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,640
I'm really leaving.

266
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,410
I ate well today.

267
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,640
Aigoo, that stubborn guy. Aigoo, pitiful rascal.

268
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,230
He can't ask me the things he really wants to ask.

269
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,100
Mom.

270
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,190
Oh! Is this Mi Young?
Aigoo, my daughter, Mi Young. How long has it been?

271
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,700
Mom, I missed you so much.

272
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,800
You must have been so busy since you just got here. How did you find time to come here?

273
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,030
No matter how busy I am
I have to come visit you.

274
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,990
I really missed you. My mom.

275
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,520
Braided Hair (hair product)

276
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,120
Forgot to take this to the kids.

277
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,620
Here.

278
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,790
She doesn't look like my sister-in-law at all.

279
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,200
I wouldn't even recognize her if she walked past
me on the streets.

280
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,410
Brother-in-law.

281
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,920
Hello, handsome Daniel.

282
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,780
Have you grabbed her heart, in all that time?

283
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:31,340
Unnie, why are doing this?
Making him feel embarrassed.

284
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,780
This is how she is.

285
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,360
She uses embarrassment as an excuse and doesn't show any affection. This even after going to Paris with me.

286
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,420
Mi Young can't normally show her feelings well
even if she likes something.

287
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,570
Wait, we planned to all go to the showing together.

288
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,410
That would be good if you came. I have to be there tomorrow as well.

289
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,160
Wow, you're really busy!

290
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,640
Who'd have thought that you'd be this successful.

291
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,600
That guy Lee Gun would never even in his dreams think you'd end up like this.

292
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,220
Don't talk nonsense and eat!

293
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,090
Daniel, eat some of it, too.

294
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,420
Yes..
And please just talk comfortable, Mother.

295
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,350
Mot... mother?

296
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:24,150
I will when the time comes.

297
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:42,690
♬ I like the dazzling sunlight ♬

298
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:48,140
♬ your smile spreads♬

299
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,980
♬ My heart is rushing, I laugh like a fool ♬

300
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,210
Is this some sort of snail collection?

301
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,250
♬  I laugh like a fool ♬

302
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,390
This is the last notice, Lee Gun!

303
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,040
Go out on a blind date this weekend or

304
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,920
cross the line with a girl you meet by chance, like before.

305
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,950
No matter what, just get married

306
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,890
before this grandma dies.

307
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,850
♬ I draw you out then I erase you again ♬

308
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,770
♬ I erase you again ♬

309
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,040
Our snail is impressive,

310
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,190
very impressive.

311
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,960
Dog Poopie, mom's pretty cool, right?

312
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:59,830
♬ When I hold out my hand and hug you tight ♬

313
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:06,120
♬ The missed destiny will become love ♬

314
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:13,930
♬ I shout out loud, I only love you ♬

315
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:22,470
♬ My heart wants you, you who is like destiny ♬

316
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,560
♬ I love you ♬

317
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,150
Did you see all the pictures that I left?

318
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,080
Which one of them are you going to meet?

319
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,800
I'm not going to go see them.

320
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,770
If you don't, then are you going to make a mistake like last time?

321
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,370
Madame Wang...
- This punk!!

322
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:51,330
Did you forget that you are the Lee family's 22nd eldest son?

323
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,580
Hey, Dragon.

324
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,520
Hurry and get married.

325
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,150
Me?

326
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:02,800
Oh my god, what are you saying? Are you going to give our Yong the eldest son position or something?

327
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,120
What are you talking about? We have better things to talk about.

328
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,460
Does that make any sense?

329
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,160
Grandmother, I'll be leaving for a business trip today.

330
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,550
It will take a day or two.

331
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,430
Eat!

332
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,090
Why don't you at least create an accident.

333
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,550
I don't think Gun is interested in having a child anymore.

334
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,130
He told Yong to hurry and get married.

335
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:40,040
But being a department head, there's no way
he's going to be able to marry into an influential family.

336
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,010
Hey! I worked really hard

337
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,420
to barely make him a department head.

338
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,020
And what, Chief? Vice president?

339
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,470
Do you think he qualifies to hold those positions?

340
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,140
That's very upsetting.

341
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,420
How long ago was it when you brought him over promising to make him CEO? You made him only Dept. Head and now you brag?

342
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,530
We almost got there, but

343
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,780
Gun, during these last 3 years, has been only working

344
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:10,740
raising the company to a level that leaves the board speechless.

345
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,690
Anyways, the most important thing is marriage and having a son.

346
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:19,000
Now if Yong marries into some rich family and has a son...

347
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,190
Then, half of the work will be done.

348
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:27,090
Yong, let's work harder.

349
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,160
Gun, you are so done now.

350
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,320
I reserved as Lee Gun.

351
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,550
Oh yes, the reservation is confirmed.

352
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,170
It's Room 2006, right?

353
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,860
Oh, what should we do? It's Room 2009.

354
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,600
I clearly remember calling up and asking
to be put down for Room 2006.

355
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,320
What should I do? There must have been a mistake. I'm sorry.

356
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,380
No need to be sorry, just change it to Room 2006.

357
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,240
I'm really sorry, but for Room 2006, someone already

358
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,080
has checked into.

359
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,430
Does this make sense?!

360
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,150
Of all rooms, why Room 2006?

361
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,310
Daniel

362
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:53,250
Yes, it's me. I just arrived.

363
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:57,090
I'm going to just unpack my stuff and head straight to the exhibition.

364
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,510
Yeah.

365
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:55,490
This exhibition is meaningful as it is Ellie Kim's first exhibition in her home country.

366
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:58,280
For the success of Ellie Kim's exhibition,

367
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,550
we will have the cutting ceremony.

368
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,910
Alright, everybody please get ready. We'll start now..

369
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,180
1, 2, 3...

370
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,700
Your popularity is rising very rapidly for being recognized in Paris first.

371
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,020
Is there a message that you want to put through
with your paintings?

372
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:35,310
At least the moments that someone looks at my work...

373
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:41,590
especially women who are having a hard time.
I hope that it can make them happy and smile.

374
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,220
A happy and confident woman,

375
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,850
and I want to continue to portray a woman receiving love as well.

376
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,790
You started your career as an artist at a relatively old age,

377
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,330
was there a special starting factor?

378
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,670
Once I went through a painful time.

379
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,950
Back then,

380
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,770
there was someone who encouraged me to paint.

381
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:14,880
Like what that person said, painting helped a lot in healing my heart.

382
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,400
This question is rather personal, but...

383
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,420
is there anyone you're dating and will you be getting married anytime soon?

384
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,200
Well...

385
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,180
Can I keep it a secret?

386
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,230
Yes, it's fine.

387
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,780
Thank you.

388
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,520
Hey, can I really go? Huh?

389
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,770
Hey, why not?

390
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:57,060
We're only going so we can enjoy the arts.

391
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,440
We are just going to take a look at the exhibit.

392
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,460
Just look at the paintings and come back, okay, you idiot?

393
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,090
But still, what if you went, and

394
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:10,350
tha-that, you know, if you run into her,
what are you going to say?

395
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,260
Do you have a plan?

396
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,570
I'm Gunnie, the only son on the 9th generation.

397
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:18,130
Would I go without a plan?

398
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,270
Idiot. Listen carefully.

399
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,310
That's right. You're Gun.

400
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,680
What do I do? What do I do if we meet? Tell me!

401
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,020
Well, you went, and met her.

402
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,570
Then just naturally walk up to her.

403
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,970
Greet her and tell her it's been a long time.

404
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,810
That it's nice to see her again. Ask her if she's been well.

405
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,230
Is that it? Is that really all you will say?!

406
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:42,250
So then, mm.. I can just say I came to see the paintings.

407
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,810
I should go to Seoul.

408
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,300
Are you confident?

409
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,370
I'm really going now.

410
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,640
I should go.

411
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,050
Ellie Kim's eternal fan - Daniel

412
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,500
Daniel?

413
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:08,330
This is 114 (directory service), right? Get me the biggest flower shop in the country.

414
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,970
Good job. Here.

415
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,360
Whenever and wherever, your number 1 fan

416
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,700
You see?

417
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,480
I'm not just any fan... I'm No. 1 fan.

418
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,580
Number one!

419
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,320
Today's heroine Artist...

420
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,630
Daniel, that gigolo oppa, even in Paris,

421
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,240
must've done his role as a oppa gigolo.

422
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,570
Still, I'm very thankful that he took care of our Mi Young.

423
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,350
Even in the future, continue to act as a gigolo oppa, just as that.

424
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,650
Daniel, the oppa gigolo.

425
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,230
What's with the big smile?!

426
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,100
Yes. Thank you.

427
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:11,130
Hey! Hey! Hey!

428
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,530
I already knew

429
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:24,570
the moment she made our Dog Poopie and Gun cup.

430
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,490
The Sigh (yearning)

431
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,120
Excuse me.

432
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,200
This painting...

433
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,050
Do you like this painting?
-Yes.

434
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,220
I like it very much.

435
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,540
It's Ellie Kim's only child drawing.

436
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:03,060
She said it is the artwork that is most precious to her.

437
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,010
I want to buy this right now.

438
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,890
Ah, yes.

439
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,290
Then if you'll leave your address, after I've received confirmation from the artist,

440
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:20,020
I'll have it delivered to you after the exhibition.

441
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,560
Do you not understand what I'm saying?

442
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,440
Is it difficult? I want to buy this right now and take it away.

443
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,210
Wrap it up right now!

444
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,950
Mom.

445
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:43,220
Mi Young!
- Sister-in-law!

446
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,910
You all came!

447
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,020
You didn't get lost?

448
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,050
Why would we get lost? All we have to do is get in the car.

449
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:53,580
Daniel, you're going through a hard time because
of my Mi Young, aren't you?

450
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,660
No..

451
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,220
And Mother, instead of calling me "Teacher,"
please call me by my name.

452
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,520
You can call me Niel! Or something like that.

453
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,370
N-N-N-Niel?

454
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:06,690
Oh well, I will... eventually...

455
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,210
I brought Dae Chul to show him his auntie's paintings.

456
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,600
My nephew came, too!

457
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,970
Careful, he's heavy.

458
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,350
Let's hurry up and go! We have to see her paintings!

459
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,770
Where did you say the exhibition was at?

460
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,500
Oh my goodness!

461
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,520
Aigoo, hey.

462
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,410
Oh, are you saying

463
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,090
our Mi Young really drew all these?

464
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:35,800
Oh my, my daughter is amazing!

465
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,760
What do you mean, amazing?

466
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,050
I was lucky to have met good people.

467
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,410
Niel? Ah.. well...

468
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:47,330
Teacher Daniel, you have no idea how thankful I am

469
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,910
for allowing my Mi Young to live this lavishly.

470
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,050
I am so thankful.

471
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,070
It's nothing, Mother.

472
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,550
I'm even more thankful.

473
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:58,800
Seeing Mi Young's artwork evolve everyday is so much fun.

474
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,450
Oh, who is this? Is it me?

475
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,480
Oh, it's so pretty!

476
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,070
Aigo, what are all these...

477
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,960
Hey, come over here and look at this.

478
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,760
Honey, come over here!

479
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,930
This looks like Mi Young.

480
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:19,220
Daniel, has that painting been sold?

481
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,460
What? How is it already sold?

482
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,650
After you both left, there was a customer who liked it so much.

483
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,490
He said that he must buy it immediately no matter what,

484
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:34,620
and said he wanted to take it right away, but I barely stopped him and just put a sold sticker on it.

485
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,170
Is there a problem?

486
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:41,230
To be honest, this painting is not for sale.

487
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,230
I didn't even think that someone would buy it so quickly.

488
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,310
What do we do?

489
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,410
He already made the payment, too.

490
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,780
He left his contact information, right?
-Yes.

491
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,330
I will call him and ask him if he can cancel the purchase.

492
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:57,550
No, I think it would be better if I personally asked him. Please give me his contact information.

493
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,640
Lee Young Ja
010-9136-0104

494
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,550
Hello?

495
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:33,520
Hello, is this the one who bought the painting,

496
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,810
Lee Young Ja's phone?

497
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,930
No. I'm Lee...

498
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,510
Kim Mi Young.

499
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,030
Hello?

500
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:46,220
So, are you not Lee Young Ja?

501
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,150
Just a second.

502
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,400
Lee Young Ja!

503
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,760
Yes, hello?

504
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,930
I can't talk in the phone right now

505
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:02,260
so I will send you a text message later. Bye.

506
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,160
Lee Young...

507
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,830
I am Lee Young Ja. What's the matter?

508
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:32,520
Hello. You bought my artwork today, right?

509
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,420
I am Elli Kim, the artist.

510
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:40,240
First of all, thank you for liking and purchasing my artwork.

511
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,690
However, I'm very sorry but that artwork you purchased today,

512
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,390
is it possible for you to cancel it?

513
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,400
And why is that?

514
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,500
It's an artwork that I didn't plan on selling.

515
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,560
I'm very sorry, but please cancel the order.

516
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:03,150
That would be a problem then. I like that painting a lot.

517
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:08,560
I'll give you another drawing of your liking in exchange.

518
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,940
♬ I hope my warmth from my fingertips reaches you ♬

519
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,680
No. I want to have that painting.
♬ My everything, my destiny ♬

520
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,380
Can you still not accept a phone call?

521
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,390
I want to personally talk to you on the phone.

522
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:38,300
I can't talk on the phone right now.

523
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,030
I got a cold and my voice doesn't come out.

524
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,690
Is it possible for us to meet?

525
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,210
I will go to where you are.

526
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,130
Well, meeting right away would be a bit...

527
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,910
Please give it a second thought. Please give me a favor.

528
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,820
I'll be at the bar on the first floor of Baus Hotel.

529
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,010
We can meet there

530
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:05,850
or you can call me and I'll immediately go to you.

531
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,040
I will contact you again later.

532
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,260
Did you wait for a long time?

533
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,920
No. I just came. Let's go.

534
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:00,270
Yes, Chairman Kim, I wanted to see your face before I leave,

535
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,570
but tonight's dinner is going to be difficult. I'll see you next time.

536
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,730
You're mother contacted me personally.

537
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,320
Being the second son of Jangin Chemicals,

538
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,670
you became a department head at a young age, I heard.

539
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,090
Is there anything much about being a department head?

540
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,940
As time goes by, a department head becomes a vice president,

541
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,860
and a vice president becomes president, things like that happen.

542
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:31,470
Does that mean that you could become the successor to Jangin Chemicals someday?

543
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,190
Does my story become like that?

544
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:37,330
Thinking of marriage, what kind of woman are you looking for?

545
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,290
A woman who is small and weak, but

546
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:44,890
makes me want to lean on her constantly?

547
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,820
Eat it with kimchi, too.

548
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,560
Bright eyes covered with round glasses, you can just see straight through the woman.

549
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,690
Then I will be by your side in the future, too.
Since we're family now.

550
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,500
Even if she talks calmly like a whisper,

551
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,910
she makes the heart echo.

552
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,260
Hey!

553
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,840
Noona!

554
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,360
Who?
-Yong.

555
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,640
I'll kill you with my hands today.

556
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,380
You even stole my lips!

557
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:23,020
Let go of my hand!

558
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:28,440
This isn't just any hand. This is connected to my mother's happiness and our family's destiny.

559
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,700
This isn't a light situation where you can just interfere like that!

560
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,760
I don't know anything about destiny, but

561
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,380
the only thing I know is...

562
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,390
you,

563
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:44,360
that I love you, Yong, like crazy.

564
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,500
Noona...

565
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,300
Today is only the first day, but all of you have worked so hard.

566
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,250
More than anything, thank you for preparing it so perfectly.

567
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,200
Enjoy tonight to your heart's content

568
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,490
and we'll work hard again tomorrow.

569
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:22,110
Okay! Applause!

570
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:26,670
Thank you! You've worked hard!

571
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:42,510
Argh, she was with that Daniel, gigolo bastard, this whole time?!

572
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,500
Gigolo bastard.

573
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:49,950
Let's congratulate our Ellie Kim's successful debut in the country.

574
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:54,260
Cheers!
-Cheers!

575
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,470
What should I do?
-Love shot! Love shot!

576
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,650
Love shot?
-Love shot! Love shot!

577
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:06,920
Love shot! Love shot! Love shot! Love shot!

578
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,110
Love shot! Love shot! Love shot! Love shot!

579
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:34,890
You drink pretty well.

580
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:37,470
When did you learn to drink?

581
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,780
Drink just a little.

582
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,680
Gi-give me something with a higher alcohol percentage.
Give me a bottle.

583
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,740
You two look so good together.

584
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,230
Looking at you, you kind of look similar, too.

585
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:57,690
Really? We're kind of similar, right?

586
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:00,730
We hear that from time to time.

587
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:03,370
What do you mean they look similar?

588
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:06,510
Wear glasses or get Lasik, you gigolo bastard.

589
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,940
My snail took off her eyeglasses.

590
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:16,840
Aigoo, so pretty.

591
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,630
When are the two of you getting married?

592
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,300
When should we?

593
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,010
Well, I'm not sure.

594
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,960
Is the marriage the completion of life?
You can just live alone, right?

595
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,590
You come alone and you go alone, too. Isn't that right?

596
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,970
My way?

597
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,260
Right?

598
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:54,750
That's just temporary. One time thing.
Say something.

599
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:58,860
How long did it take you to kiss after you got together?
I'm curious.

600
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:02,840
We're curious. Please tell us.

601
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:17,790
Hello! I am Jang Hyuk! I'm happy to be in China.

602
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:21,830
Are you ready? Good! Good!

603
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,930
Our first kiss...

604
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,530
We haven't done it though.

605
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:40,840
Liar.

606
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:48,350
Since nobody believes us, should we just do it here? To celebrate the opening of the exhibition?

607
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,070
Why do you keep on joking?

608
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,090
I'm not joking though.

609
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:57,170
Then, do you mean it?

610
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,190
No way!

611
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,820
Why doesn't it make sense?

612
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,410
Why do you think it doesn't make sense?

613
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:13,300
Kiss.. kiss .. kiss!

614
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,310
Those things, why are they making them kiss?

615
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:20,380
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

616
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,480
Getting closer, and closer!

617
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,870
Did you think I'd have our first kiss in a place like this?

618
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:09,460
For who's pleasure?

619
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,620
Come on.

620
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:15,460
Here, here, let's drink.

621
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,530
Cheers.

622
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,700
It's me, Lee Young Ja, in regards to the painting.

623
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,250
please meet at the Sejong-si Luna Park. Right now, right now.

624
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:38,530
Daniel, sorry, I have to go somewhere, urgently.

625
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,190
Where?

626
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:43,160
I'll tell you later.

627
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,100
Ms. Lee Young Ja!

628
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:00,190
Are you Lee Young Ja by any chance?

629
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,130
No.
- Sorry...

630
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,760
Miss Lee Young Ja?

631
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,030
Are you Lee Young Ja... no.

632
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,700
Young J...

633
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,520
Have you arrived?

634
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:16,750
Yes, have you not arrived yet?

635
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:22,500
Sorry, I was about to head out,

636
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,930
but my fever is too high so

637
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:28,810
I don't think I can meet today.

638
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:34,410
Ah, well you can't help it.

639
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:37,170
Since health comes first.

640
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:41,690
Contact me again when you can meet me.

641
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:50,860
I have one thing that I'm curious about.

642
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,290
Yes, what is it?

643
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:56,860
That painting..

644
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,930
Mi Young...

645
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:03,420
No.. To you, Ellie Kim,

646
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,790
what kind of painting is it for you to be so unwilling to sell it?

647
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:12,610
It's my first real artwork,

648
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:16,970
and more importantly, it's not an artwork, but my family

649
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:19,290
and my other self.

650
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,280
Family?

651
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:24,520
Other self?

652
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:29,620
During my whole life,

653
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,840
something I never want to forget. It's also a memory

654
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,970
that shines like a jewel.

655
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:43,000
The most precious and bright moment in your life..

656
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,960
that moment..

657
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,250
isn't it right now?

658
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:52,570
Even though it's nice right now,

659
00:54:54,390 --> 00:55:00,100
but still, I can't compare it with the memory.

660
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,820
What am I talking about with a customer.

661
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:19,730
I'm saying the strangest things with a person I just met.

662
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:24,010
Please contact me when you feel better.

663
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:26,380
Please.

664
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:45,340
Thank you.
Okay.

665
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,500
During my whole life...

666
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,240
something I never want to forget

667
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,660
It's also a memory that shines like a gem.

668
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,750
A memory that shines like a gem?

669
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:23,490
Our snail hasn't changed at all.

670
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,300
The only things I gave you were

671
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,940
all big wounds.

672
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,590
Memories like a gem?

673
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,530
Who is it?

674
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:49,770
Who is it!?

675
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,370
My room is Room 2006, so why isn't it opening?

676
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:57,580
I'm always in room 2006. Whenever I reserve a room, I'm ALWAYS room 2006!

677
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,280
What's the problem?

678
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,540
What's the problem then?!

679
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,320
Open the door!!

680
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,960
The door isn't opening!!

681
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,070
Hello! This is Room 2006.

682
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:19,140
Someone weird keeps banging on the door and shouting..
- Please open the door!

683
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:22,920
Please come quickly. I don't even know what he's saying!

684
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,210
Why isn't the door opening, why?!

685
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:31,060
Manager!!!

686
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:34,940
Who is it?! Who are you?
Manager!! The room isn't opening!

687
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:37,580
What is he saying?

688
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,480
Please open the door!!!

689
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,850
Open sesame!

690
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:59,300
Open, perilla!

691
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:03,390
My room is 2006 though..!!

692
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:05,720
Why won't it open?

693
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,730
Open snail!!

694
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:13,920
Open! Snail!

695
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,630
Lee Gun?

696
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,340
Why are you here?

697
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,820
Oh! Kim Mi Young?

698
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:34,040
Why are you coming out of my room?

699
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,360
This is my room.

700
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,660
No, it's my room.

701
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:43,690
♬ Goodbye, my love ♬

702
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:48,640
♬ My heart already knew ♬

703
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:55,590
♬ This feeling of loneliness that’s about to explode ♬

704
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,870
Preview
♬ I try to hide it ♬

705
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:01,690
She doesn't even want to see my face.
♬ but I can’t hide it ♬

706
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:03,960
I think I really found my sister this time.
♬ You’ve become♬

707
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,700
If our Dog Poopie had been born she would have looked like this.
♬ my heart ♬

708
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:10,790
She's the most talked-about as of late, Artist Ellie Kim!
♬ Oh you,♬

709
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:13,070
Elli Kim is definitely a no!

710
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:15,440
Absolutely!
♬ I can’t have you, ♬

711
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,630
I'm leaving Korea.
♬ I can’t touch you ♬

712
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:22,800
And I don't want to ever see you again.
♬ But I’m okay ♬
