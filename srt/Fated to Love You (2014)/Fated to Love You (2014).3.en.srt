1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,250
Episode 3

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,870
It's all going to wrinkle.

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,430
Unni!

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,150
Again?

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,800
People will think you are a parcel delivery employee if you just put on a helmet.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,180
It's on the way anyway.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,640
Then just don't go, or take away that "anyway."

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,790
Don't do one of the two, please!

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,510
Not everyone can live perfectly.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,920
There should be people like me, too.

11
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,910
What's going on that everyone is all outside, making a fuss?
Like gangsters.

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,420
You came, President Lee Gun.

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,260
It is an honor that you'll be working with our Daehyung Law Firm.

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,000
There is no other reason for changing law firms.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,180
Please handle this case without any disputes.

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,610
Yes. Let's go in.

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,470
What? What's wrong?

18
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,410
Do you know that man?

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,480
No, no.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,780
Here... everyone, Grandmas, Grandpas,

21
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,270
Aunts, Uncles, and all the sisters and brothers...

22
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,930
the enemies of our island have just arrived. Can you see them?

23
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,760
Yeah! Go away!

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,410
When those jerks arrive, so that they can't set foot on our island,

25
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,220
let's block them!

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,750
That Island keeps causing problems.

27
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,910
I need to go through the reorganization procedure,

28
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,180
because I couldn't even go near the factory. I couldn't even come up with an estimate.

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,070
What kind of situation is this?

30
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,870
This is why you need people like us.

31
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,850
Is this the document from that time?

32
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,340
I will look through it.

33
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,780
Miss Kim Mi Young!

34
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,590
The one with sugar, here.

35
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,370
Please drink.

36
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,080
Yes. And about branching out to China.

37
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,090
If you entrust your consultation with our law firm,

38
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,850
we have the right person who'll be perfect.

39
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,570
Well, if you introduce the person to me, I'll look into it.

40
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,470
Ah, come in and sit down.

41
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,430
This person is Jangin Chemical's Ceo Lee Gun.

42
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,170
And this is-

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,150
Hello, I'm Min Byung Chun.

44
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,060
I have an appointment, so I'll have to get up soon.

45
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,350
And regarding branching out to China, I'll think a bit more about it.

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,850
CEO?

47
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,550
She said she worked at the same company as that trash.

48
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,780
Mi Young, get this done by 12 o'clock.

49
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,500
Yes.

50
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,470
Unni,

51
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,020
give me one of those.

52
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,530
My stomach is killing me.

53
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,770
This damn magic... (referring to her period)

54
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,010
isn't there some sort of magic that can make it come only once a year?

55
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,720
Since the lady he was going to marry ran off to America,

56
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,060
you can't even tell us to wait any longer.

57
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,250
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,150
An apology is not enough!

59
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,740
Because the lady ran off, and our Jangin stock have dropped by 20% as well,

60
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,990
so everyone is very concerned.

61
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,430
We will bring

62
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,780
Lee Yong.

63
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,220
By Lee Yong, you mean...

64
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,710
You can not do that! The son of a concubine?

65
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,350
The grandson of the head family is still alive!

66
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,220
Even if he is alive, it's something we can't be at ease about.

67
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,540
Are you saying this because you don't know

68
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,680
the fact that all the men in the head family have died in their 30's?

69
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,850
Even though he is the son of a concubine,

70
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,480
a bloodline is bloodline.

71
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,810
If he doesn't get married within this year or if we can't see a descendant by next year,

72
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,240
he will have to give up his place as the grandson of the head family.

73
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,300
Come on in!

74
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,550
Hello, Hyungnim and Grandmother.

75
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,810
I, Lee Yong, greet you for the first time in 22 years.

76
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,360
Please take good care of me from now on.

77
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,690
Mother-in-law, have you been well?

78
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,990
It's been a long time, please accept your daughter-in-law's greetings.

79
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,730
Have you been well, Gun?

80
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,180
You've grown up so much since I last saw you! Did you miss your aunt?

81
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,480
Why are you fussing so much? No one's watching.

82
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,620
Just sit down.

83
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,700
I must be the only one happy to see you.

84
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,320
Since he died, we haven't met even once.

85
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,490
I missed you so much.

86
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,290
I did miss you,

87
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,490
so much that I would spring up in my sleep.

88
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,690
I'm telling you to be sure but it's exactly for a year.

89
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,570
Within that time, if my Gun gets

90
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,670
married and has a descendant,

91
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,960
they will have to leave immediately.

92
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,130
Since children in this family have always been so scarce,

93
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,490
you should quickly get it done and add something to this family.

94
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,760
Of course, even though he is lazy in other ways, he is very diligent in that area.

95
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,420
Give him a position at our Jangin, too.

96
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,740
Even a job?

97
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,720
I didn't even think of that yet.

98
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,830
Thank you.

99
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,550
Self-diagnosing Pregnancy Test

100
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,750
Yes Yes

101
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,700
Submit.

102
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,490
It can't be.

103
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,020
It's probably not it. It has to be no.

104
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,460
Why do you keep avoiding me?

105
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,080
I'm not avoiding you.

106
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,570
Why didn't you tell me that the person from the casino is the CEO of Jangin Chemicals?

107
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,880
Do you still keep in touch with him?

108
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,530
We don't keep in touch.

109
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,470
We just happened to be together that night.

110
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,990
Then it was a one-nighter? With your personality?

111
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,860
Want me to find out his number?

112
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,300
Meet him,

113
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,860
and help me out, too.

114
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,020
Jangin is planning on branching out to China this time,

115
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,640
and I might become their in-house lawyer.

116
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,590
Can't you do me a favor? Huh?

117
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,170
I'm not close with him.

118
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,900
He is just a grateful person who helped me.

119
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,900
I usually can't refuse, but I really can't do you this favor.

120
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,910
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,710
Then you don't have to do something that you'll be sorry for.

122
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,880
Is it hard to do what you already did once? You put up a pretense all this time, acting innocent,

123
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,060
but you already got caught by me that you're lying.

124
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,400
What are you doing? Let me go.

125
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,900
How did you seduce Jangin Chemicals' CEO? It's really fascinating.

126
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,720
What's there to see in a woman who's as average as you?

127
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,180
Do you have some back up? You must be okay with not working at the company?

128
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,960
Can I spread a rumor saying that you did all sorts of things to seduce Jangin Chemical's CEO?!

129
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,880
You know that you're finished at the company if a rumor about a man spreads-

130
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,280
It's me, Gun.

131
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,500
Does it hurt?

132
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,170
Please spread the rumors.

133
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,630
That I'm trying to seduce Miss Kim Mi Young, but no matter what I do, because she won't fall for it, that I'm about to die.

134
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,070
Trash overseas is also trash here, too.

135
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,660
Even that dirty and indecent spirit is still the same, huh?

136
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,910
I will entrust consultation regarding branching out to China with this law firm.

137
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,660
But under one condition.

138
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,580
This trash...

139
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,230
fire him.

140
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,290
Miss Kim Mi Young.

141
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,830
Hello.

142
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,200
Let's go.

143
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,510
Thanks for saving me back there.

144
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,530
You were living like that all this time?

145
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,680
After I transformed you into a Bond Girl...

146
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,710
Sorry.

147
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,460
But why do you keep touching your belly?

148
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,720
Is that a potbelly?

149
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,870
It's a potbelly, right?

150
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,810
Yes. Yes!

151
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes, it's a potbelly.

152
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,200
This is what you call a potbelly. How did you know?

153
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,490
Although my frame is petite, my growth of a potbelly was particularly different than others.

154
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,380
You're very keen. Potbelly.

155
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,350
Dad!

156
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,430
Dad!

157
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,540
Stay quiet! Who are you calling Dad?

158
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,250
Dad!

159
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,470
Shh! Be quiet.

160
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,110
Dad!
- Dad?

161
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,300
Dad!

162
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,400
This! This isn't a potbelly?

163
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,720
It's a potbelly.

164
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,900
It moved! There's a child in here!
- What do you mean it moved? Where?

165
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,510
This is my baby, isn't it? I'm right!

166
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,210
Then I'm becoming a dad?
-No, it's not your baby.

167
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,590
Mi Young, please have this baby. You have to have it! Really!

168
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,720
It's Dad, you rascal. Dad!
-Dad!

169
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:34,840
Please congratulate us! Our Kim Mi Young is having a baby!

170
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,370
Why are you suddenly like that?

171
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,990
Is something wrong?

172
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,750
It's nothing.

173
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:54,700
Oh yeah. Are you seeing Se Ra again?

174
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,000
Yes.

175
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,450
Yeah.

176
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:06,120
That's good. I thought it would be like that.

177
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,430
That's good.

178
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,090
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

179
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:29,070
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

180
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,160
Oh, it's Ji Woo!

181
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,910
Do it fast. Or it won't be fun.

182
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,080
One, Two, Three, Four,

183
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,410
Five, Six, Seven, Eight,

184
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,110
Nine...

185
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,740
Ready or not, here I come.

186
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,990
Priest.

187
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,520
Can I confess my sins even if I'm not a believer?

188
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,560
Uh...well, you still sin even though you're not a believer.

189
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,930
I'm not a believer, so

190
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,940
I don't exactly know how to do a confession. Will that be okay?

191
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,520
Uh. Actually,

192
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,480
I don't really know either.

193
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,230
You are an amusing priest.

194
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,550
Instead of doing it right now, it'll be okay to do it later.

195
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,300
Priest, I...

196
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:06,170
I... I think I'm pregnant.

197
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,660
I think so... Although, I might not be...

198
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,050
I'm pretty sure I am.

199
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,380
To be honest, I'm scared.

200
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,150
I'm afraid of having the baby,

201
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,300
and to think of an abortion,

202
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,450
I feel really sad.

203
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:41,130
I'm scared that people like my mom, sister, and colleagues will find out.

204
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,760
Does the baby's father know this, too?

205
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,790
No.

206
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,630
It's that...

207
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,090
He already has a girl he loves.

208
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,960
He would just feel distressed if I tell him.

209
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,150
He has been hurt enough

210
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,500
because of sleeping with me.

211
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,160
It's okay for me to have a hard time alone. I don't want to do that to him, too.

212
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,740
Then go and buy a pregnancy test at the pharmacy straight from here.

213
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,560
After you find out if you are pregnant or not, make sure to discuss it with the baby's father.

214
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,990
Do I really have to discuss it with him?

215
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,780
Of course. He is the baby's father. You have the duty and the right to do so.

216
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,850
Even if it is hard and you don't want to, you have to do it. Okay?

217
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,530
Okay.

218
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,900
There are long, round, plate-shaped, and paper-made pregnancy tests.

219
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,010
Recently, there are electronic ones, too-

220
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:54,640
Priest, I think you know too well.

221
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,650
Sister, this is common sense.

222
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,420
Thank you Priest, for listening to me.

223
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,000
Hey!

224
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,550
Cheer up!

225
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,870
Bye.

226
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,680
I came here because I heard that you were in the CEO's room.

227
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,480
Don't call me Hyungnim at the company.

228
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,840
Call me CEO, you unmannerly bastard.

229
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,670
Ah... yes, Hyungnim...

230
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,860
CEO.

231
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,040
If you go to the public relations department, they will give you an assistant manager's desk, so start working today.

232
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,580
An assistant manager?

233
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,850
Why? It's not to your liking?

234
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,260
It's not that.

235
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,500
It's not that, but I'm not very familiar with how the company works yet...

236
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,710
Not very familiar?

237
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,850
Not. You don't know anything!

238
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,240
Yes, I don't know anything.

239
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,090
Just because I'm the CEO's brother, getting special treatment. I don't like that either.

240
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,520
I have never acknowledged you as my younger brother.

241
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,840
So, there won't be any special treatment.

242
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,690
Oh, that's right, a package came for you.

243
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,640
It's Park Kyung Chul from Yeoul Island.

244
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,530
Yeoul Island's President Park.

245
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,760
Assistant Manager Min? Leave now.

246
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,280
Why are you putting your feet on the desk.

247
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,390
We got you.

248
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,970
What is this?!

249
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,850
Jangin Chemical's CEO from Seoul.

250
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,440
Huh? What is this?

251
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,910
And this is Miss Kim!

252
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,370
This lady is...

253
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:34,770
Even though it's been blurred out, it's not Lady Se Ra...

254
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,230
I don't think it's her...Oh!

255
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,950
Chief Park.

256
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,320
Yes!

257
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,860
What is Lawyer Hong's law firm number?

258
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,620
As soon as I came out of that room, I took out the memory chip.

259
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,630
Isn't it perfect?

260
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,950
Then, you dropping it in the water was fake?

261
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,930
Hamo Hamo. (Of course, in dialect)
-Wow, President Park!

262
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,070
That was the best plan in the world.

263
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,300
You are better than I thought.

264
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,060
Hamo Hamo!
-Hamo Hamo!

265
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:13,650
But because your sister-in-law's face was in it, I couldn't even tell anyone.

266
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:18,010
I, for a whole month, painstakingly erased her face, bit by bit.

267
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,900
Lost all my strength. Lost it.

268
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,340
You've suffered a lot.

269
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,680
What are you freaking doing out here, when the restaurant is empty?

270
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,700
We're comfortable here.

271
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,460
Anyway, this is so delicious that you wouldn't even know if both of you dropped dead while eating, right?

272
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,050
You're right, Mother-in-law. This is really delicious!

273
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,510
It's tasty, right?

274
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,920
Then, eat it deliciously and you can both drop dead.

275
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,370
A customer that should have come isn't even coming...

276
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:50,160
Did you see? The day my mother-in-law finds out, my sister-in-law is a dead person.

277
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,200
I don't have a mouth.
-Yes.

278
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,090
Hello.

279
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,830
USB.

280
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,230
Call the CEO's Secretary, hurry.

281
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,120
Hello.

282
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,470
They are not picking up?
-What do you mean they are not picking up?

283
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,260
CEO? Whew, wait...

284
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,400
I'm the person who ran up from the stairs.

285
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,010
Safe!

286
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,690
Does this make sense?

287
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,260
I even forgave them for doing something so low.

288
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,660
How can he stab someone's back in this manner?

289
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,920
Illegal protest, threats... I'm going to stick all of them in jail!

290
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,930
Feed them beans with rice (prison), receive compensation for damages... I'm going to stick all of them in! All of them!

291
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,410
But, who is this woman?

292
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,080
I don't really know. It's my first time seeing her.

293
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:06,700
That's right. That Kim Mi Young took vacation days, so she isn't here.

294
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,190
Why are you telling me? Did I ask?

295
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,710
Ah, yes.

296
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,990
But this woman, did they put her in the room?

297
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,220
I don't know, I don't know!
How many times do I have to tell you?!

298
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,500
If we commission a professional, we can probably undo the woman's face.

299
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,220
To tell you the truth, we can win the trial and put them in prison.

300
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,980
We have grounds for damage compensation.

301
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,780
However, you'll lose more than what you'll gain.

302
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,440
Nowadays, if it goes on the internet and it becomes a hit,

303
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,850
we won't be able to handle the situation.

304
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,830
I can just laugh.

305
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,130
Tyranny of the alpha... don't you think you'll hear that?

306
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,990
Wait. He's the one who's legally at fault. Why should I be the one criticized?

307
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,980
These people have abandoned all reason!

308
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,290
Those people are desperate.

309
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:01,040
Because their life is on the line, the reason gets lost.

310
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,350
Does this make sense?!

311
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,050
Just do what I say.

312
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:08,210
If the lawsuit progresses, I'll get an attorney fee, so it'll be good for me.

313
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,100
It's for the sake of Jangin Chemical.

314
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,330
Go to Yeoul Island and meet with the representatives.
Both sides should compromise.

315
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:18,140
That will benefit you.

316
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,530
Must tell Mother.

317
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,460
Not tell her.

318
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,880
Must tell her.
No, yes, no yes, no...yes, no

319
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,140
yes, no...yes.

320
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,660
No.

321
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:05,630
If Mom knows this truth, she's going to break both of my legs.

322
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,240
Mi Young!

323
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,330
It is Mi Young!

324
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,560
I heard you are working in Seoul, but you must have come to see your mom, right?

325
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,790
Yes, I took some vacation days off and came down.

326
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,040
Then, tell your mom to make you lots of delicious foods!

327
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,620
Have fun then go back, okay?!

328
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,180
Yes.

329
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,580
But I should still tell Mom?

330
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,490
Mom!

331
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,060
Where are you looking? Right here, here!

332
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,070
Straight ahead!

333
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,550
Wench, you should have at least told me you were coming.

334
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,120
Should I find out by a phone call from Chang Gyu's mom?

335
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,350
What did you come here for?

336
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,170
Mom... Mom, I...

337
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,080
I...

338
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,100
Are you crying right now?

339
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,730
Why are you crying?

340
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,570
Why? Did something happen?

341
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:51,270
No, it's just, I'm happy to see you!

342
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,400
Aigoo wench, you're being so particular...

343
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,890
People will think you're crying because you got rejected by a man.

344
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,460
Quickly run over here.

345
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,260
Mom!

346
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,650
Aigoo, aigoo.

347
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,050
Are you happy?

348
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,570
How have you been?

349
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,920
Ah!

350
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,860
How could you eat so well?

351
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,020
You are eating similar to me.

352
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:30,520
Let's just say I eat well since I'm pregnant.
Wow, you eat well.

353
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,650
Because Mom's food is the best in this world.

354
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,420
You're right. You know I have killer hands for cooking.

355
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,790
Aigoo, if you get it with that hand, then it's just right to die today.

356
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,950
Oh yeah. If you went to Macao, you should brag.

357
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,260
Why are you so quiet?

358
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:55,250
There are a lot of cool men there, right?

359
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:59,510
Your sister has been on this island for over 40 years looking at the same men,

360
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,390
my eyes haven't gotten upgraded.

361
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:07,770
Look, look. My eyes are simmering... simmering out of boredom!

362
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:12,050
Why are you taking out a year?
You were married and went to live in Seoul for a year.

363
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:17,170
I would be happy even if I have to see my honey for ten thousand years!

364
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,340
Stop it!

365
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,840
And if you're married, you should stay at your house.

366
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,170
Why are you always here lounging around, eating our food?! What about your husband?

367
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:30,660
He said that he has to talk with President Park all night due to the problems with the factory.

368
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,830
I'm going to sleep in Unni's room tonight.

369
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,680
Also, Mom! How much do I eat anyway?!

370
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,660
You can't mistreat a pregnant lady like this!

371
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:49,030
Mom, I'm going to sleep with you in your room tonight.

372
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,990
I have something to tell you, too.

373
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,910
With me?

374
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,080
Aigoo. It's best not to sleep with her if you can.

375
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,830
Boss!

376
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,760
Boss!

377
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,370
Boss! Are you okay?

378
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,830
Blood! It's bleeding!

379
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,300
Nose bleed! (sounds like coffee)

380
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,350
I've put a lot of syrup in it.

381
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:37,950
You used to drink only black.
Why do you keep asking for sweets lately?

382
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,790
My nose is bleeding! Nose bleed! Give me napkins!

383
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,730
Napkin...

384
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,770
Napkin.

385
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,040
Se Ra

386
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,220
It's Lady Se Ra.

387
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,000
Just bring me some napkins.

388
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:05,320
Prepare for Act 2.

389
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,270
Se Ra?

390
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,730
Okay. I'll be right there.

391
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,170
Okay.

392
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,500
Oppa, it's me.

393
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,110
Are you still really mad at me?

394
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,270
Are you doing well?

395
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:32,420
I know you're doing this to punish me.
I'll receive the punishment.

396
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,740
In return, don't be sad by yourself.

397
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:40,650
Just like you've waited for me, I can wait, too.

398
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:47,530
But can't I listen to your voice just once?

399
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,980
I'm sorry.

400
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,990
How tired must my mom have been to start snoring right when she lies down?

401
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,240
Mom, I'm really sorry for being a pathetic daughter.

402
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,560
When I've never been someone you can brag about,

403
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,640
I go around causing trouble like this, like a fool.

404
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,400
Mom,

405
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,200
no matter what I say,

406
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,360
don't get too shocked.

407
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:12,060
Mother of 3 Daughters Restaurant

408
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,060
Unni! What are you doing there and not sleeping?

409
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,970
I'm exercising under the moon.
(Something people laugh at in Korea)

410
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,960
Are you not sleepy either?

411
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:30,850
What did I tell you? You can't sleep with Mom, can you?

412
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,160
Is it that good?

413
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,030
Didn't you just stretch to digest your food?

414
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,790
Since I've digested it, it's now time to eat.

415
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,260
You want a bite?

416
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,160
I'm good. Have it all to yourself.

417
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,100
Watching you eat earlier, you eat just as much as I do.

418
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:03,480
But how did you know you were pregnant?

419
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,250
Pregnancy test?

420
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:11,690
But you know, that's not really that accurate.

421
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,800
When I first used it, it said I wasn't pregnant.

422
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Once I did it again, at that time, it came out accurately.

423
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,300
Really?

424
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,480
You have to do it with the first urine of the morning.

425
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,820
That's when the hCG pregnancy hormone is the highest.

426
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,250
So it's the most accurate.

427
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,210
But why do you ask?

428
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,870
My friend asked. Eat some more.

429
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,620
Maybe it's because it's an island.
The morning breeze feels cool.

430
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,600
The air is refreshing, too.

431
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,800
Refreshing? It's frustrating because of the salty smell.

432
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,160
CEO, since you came to negotiate anyways,

433
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,320
Yeoul Island is famous for it's anchovy lettuce wrap, so make sure to add that in when you're negotiating.

434
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,740
It'll be a favorable negotiation.

435
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:09,790
Am I crazy? I'm already annoyed with having to deal with people, I ought to just stick them in jail right now!

436
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:13,300
What anchovy lettuce wrap? I'm going to take revenge on them, short and brief. (sounds like lettuce wrap)

437
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,380
I'm going to take revenge!

438
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,960
Lettuce wrap.

439
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:24,250
Are you okay?

440
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,880
Wench, why are you so surprised between family?

441
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,750
Why does the door open like this?

442
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,270
We have to fix it soon.

443
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,680
Hey, what is that thing your hiding behind you?

444
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,510
What? It's nothing.

445
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,350
Why are you hiding it if it's nothing?

446
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:05,170
You... It's the same face your sister makes when she is caught eating.

447
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,620
Mom.

448
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,470
Actually, I have something to tell you.

449
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:16,120
Because you might be too shocked...

450
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,560
What is this?

451
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,360
There are two lines. That means you're pregnant.

452
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,270
What? Pregnant?

453
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,110
Who?
-Pregnant? Who?

454
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,270
Is that why you asked me about the pregnancy test last night?

455
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:52,060
It's not your friend, but you, right? It's you who's pregnant, aren't you?

456
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,630
Is what Mi Ja saying true? It's not, right?

457
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,200
I heard wrong, didn't I?

458
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,090
Mom, I was going to tell you right as soon as I came, but-

459
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,120
Mom.
-You wench!

460
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,310
Mom, stop it!

461
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:11,560
You're going to hurt her!

462
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,060
Say it. Who is it? The one who made you like this?

463
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,310
I really don't know who it is.

464
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:21,060
Oh yeah? Then get hit with this until you know.

465
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,790
Mom! I'm sorry.

466
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,740
Did you go to Seoul to recklessly roll your body around like that? (sleep around)

467
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,160
If you don't say it right now, who the baby's dad is,

468
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,190
you're really going to die in my hands!

469
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,420
He's dead.
-What? He's dead?

470
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,140
Yeah.

471
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,280
No, he couldn't be dead.

472
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,980
If he was, you couldn't have eaten the lettuce wrap so deliciously!

473
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,330
It's positive he's not dead.

474
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,460
Oh, right!

475
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,940
You went to Macau with a man, didn't you?

476
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,220
Mom, that's right! The man she went to Macau with is the culprit!

477
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,880
It's not that man!

478
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,560
It's a man I don't know.

479
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,250
Then, it was a one-night stand?

480
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,400
What stand? Are you talking about that thing you pull to turn on the light?

481
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,600
After turning the "stand' (lights) off, you sleep together for one night, the next day, you act like you don't know each other

482
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,160
by saying "When have we met?" As you end with 'bye bye.' There's something sad like that.

483
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,350
Aigoo! I can't believe you would be first in doing a one-night stand that I wanted to do so much.

484
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,240
Be quiet.

485
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,870
You! Bring that "stand" bastard right now!

486
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,190
Mom, it's the truth. I don't know who he is.

487
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,050
Oh my...

488
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,020
You slept with him without even knowing who he was?

489
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,990
Actually...

490
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,010
Kneel!

491
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,870
Actually,

492
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:50,040
I went into the wrong room... unknowingly, well, I...

493
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,600
It's all my fault!

494
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,820
Aigoo... aigoo, this retarded idiot!

495
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,490
You get fooled by some bastard and after sleeping with him,

496
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,230
are you protecting him right now?!

497
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,840
Imagine how much she fell for him to do this.
-Oh crap. What's happening here?

498
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,060
You idiot, idiot! You put in too much stimulant!

499
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,720
You get up right now! Let's go to Seoul!

500
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,920
Mom! Mom...

501
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,380
That man has a woman he likes.

502
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,830
How can I break up their relationship?

503
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,840
You have a huge advantage!

504
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,000
When you have a baby inside your stomach, what's there to be scared of?

505
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,490
Aigoo! Aigoo, my rotten fate!

506
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:31,190
There are 4 women in the household, but 3 of us don't have a mate! Why is it so crappy?

507
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,680
Let's all just jump into the ocean and die together!

508
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,870
Let's go. Let's just die.
-I'm sorry.

509
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,830
What's the point of living?
-Mom!

510
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:42,190
Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law!

511
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,840
I...

512
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,410
I know... who the baby's dad is.

513
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,410
Yeoul Soap Factory

514
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,720
Here.

515
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,820
First of all, the reason why I came here

516
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,000
is not because I am afraid of the threat.

517
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,570
Even more so, I'm not here to fight these people back

518
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:16,130
who engage in these illegal behaviors.

519
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,020
He couldn't hold back just a little longer and said he'd come back after seeing his wife...

520
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,870
why is Mr. Choi not coming?

521
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:29,510
After stopping and thinking about it for a while...

522
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:35,990
Maybe... reeeaaallllyyyy just maybe, I thought I have progressed the work too unilaterally, so

523
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,660
I found myself coming this way.

524
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,220
Then let's now move to a different place,

525
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:46,090
and try to talk frankly in our own perspectives.

526
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:50,090
That was a great speech.

527
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:55,220
Talk about the anchovy lettuce wrap… lettuce wrap with anchovies. (It comes with lettuce, rice, and seasoned anchovies)

528
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:00,580
Ah, also, I heard that the most famous and delicious dish on this island is

529
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,480
lettuce wrap anchovy!
(he's saying it backwards)

530
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,910
I like it, too! Lettuce wrap anchovy!

531
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:08,270
Lettuce wrap anchovy, I really like it!

532
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,890
Really?
-Yes, I like it.

533
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:13,290
Wow, how did you know!? In Yeoul Island, it's anchovy lettuce wrap-

534
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:18,190
No-no-no, it's lettuce wrap anchovy!

535
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,600
Lettuce wrap anchovy!

536
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,940
Lettuce wrap anchovy!

537
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,220
It's this way, this way!

538
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:31,720
In our island, we call even the Ahjumma at the restaurant, "Mother."

539
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,710
"Mother, anchovy-" no-no,

540
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:37,250
"Please give me lettuce wrap anchovy, please!" Then you'll get an enormous amount of food.

541
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:42,680
Your tongue has to gather up in an "S" shape, and say, "Mo~ther." Try it. "Mo~ther."

542
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,770
Mother.
-Aigoo! That's awkward. "Mo~ther".

543
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:51,600
Mo~ther.
-Aigoo! You're good.

544
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,760
Mo~ther.

545
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,880
Mo~ther!
-That was good!

546
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,170
Mo~ther! That was good!

547
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:03,010
Lettuce wrap anchovy!

548
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:05,950
Lettuce, lettuce, lettuce wrap anchovy!

549
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,330
Mom! Mom!

550
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,390
Are you really not going to follow me?

551
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:13,100
Do you think I will let that bastard be just because you won't budge from here?

552
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,440
I told you, it's not that person's fault.

553
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,190
Come here!
-Mom!

554
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,690
We're here. We've arrived.

555
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,730
She's our mother and the restaurant ahjumma!

556
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,850
Mother, Mother.
-Mother?

557
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,720
Mo~ther!

558
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:37,740
Please give me a l~ot of lettuce wrap!

559
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,260
Oh, wait, wait.

560
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,430
Kim Mi Young... Kim Mi Young, what are you doing here?

561
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,150
Kim Mi Young...

562
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,480
Why are you here?

563
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,180
Mother-in-law! It's... it's that person!

564
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,370
That... Dding hao, dding hao!

565
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,840
Ah, oh yeah, this is Yeoul Island! Right, right.

566
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,510
What?

567
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:11,850
Lettuce wrap!? You should be the one wrapped and eaten!

568
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,200
Who are you asking to give you a lettuce wrap!?

569
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,370
Eat this instead!

570
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,990
No, Ahjumma! Why? Why are you hitting me?

571
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,240
I'm doing it to you! Then who else would I do it to?

572
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,580
You were the one who played around with my daughter!

573
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,300
Mom, you can't do this! Don't do this!

574
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,610
Just hit me instead.

575
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:40,210
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

576
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,670
No, no.

577
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,840
Ahjumma, Ahjumma, I don't know what's going on but let's use words... words.

578
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,580
What? After doing something that makes no sense, you want to talk it about?

579
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:55,550
Are you doing this because you don't know what you've done to my daughter?!

580
00:44:55,550 --> 00:45:00,040
Wait! Wait! Ma'am!

581
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,480
Ma'am, I know about that incident. But

582
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,450
instead of violence, using words-

583
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,320
What? You know?

584
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,650
Are you acting like this even though you know?

585
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,780
This bastard! You should die in crap water!

586
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,600
Ah! Ah! It was by mistake! It was like that. It was a mistake!

587
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,420
Right! Of course, it was a mistake!

588
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:32,150
Mom, I already told you this person did nothing wrong.

589
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:36,890
You, because you did the "stand" with my daughter...

590
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:41,820
Mom, one-night stand!

591
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,300
With my daughter, because you did that "stand",

592
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,390
my daughter is now-
-Mom!

593
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:53,310
Please do me a favor. Don't say it. I'll... I'll just take care of it.

594
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,830
This person did nothing wrong.

595
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:57,530
It all happened because of my mistake.

596
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:02,150
Whenever I was having a hard time, this person helped, encouraged, and protected me. Mom!

597
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:05,190
Is this the result of protecting you?

598
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,820
Because of you, my daughter is now pre-

599
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,360
Mom!

600
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,940
I will say it instead. Let me tell him, please?

601
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,010
You say it. Now!

602
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,900
Now.

603
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,460
The thing is... I... your...

604
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,990
You're what? Just say it comfortably. It's okay.

605
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:42,780
As if this is your house, I'm okay because I can accept it.
So tell me.

606
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,600
Your...
-"Your" what?

607
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,770
Ah... "your" what? "Your" what?!

608
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:52,190
I'm pregnant with your child.

609
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,290
What is she saying right now?

610
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,340
Isn't that something good?

611
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,990
It's your child though.

612
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,120
It's my child then, right?

613
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:08,320
Baby... baby...

614
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,050
My...my...

615
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:13,230
WHOA!!

616
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:17,020
I'm sorry. What to do... I'm sorry.

617
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,840
Why are you sorry? You retarded idiot!
This is why I have to step up!

618
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,590
I understand how you feel, but

619
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,270
right now, we're in the middle of negotiations.

620
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,300
The CEO has to be here to keep moving forward.

621
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,860
Wait a second! Wait!

622
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,450
Move.

623
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,390
Mother-in-law,

624
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:42,420
you know that this situation is really important to the people of our island.

625
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,880
I'm right, aren't I?

626
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,080
Aigoo!

627
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,220
Do you need to be beaten with a stick!

628
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,850
You can negotiate later,

629
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:52,920
but this matter has your sister-in-law's life on the line!

630
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,090
What kind of brother-in-law are you!? You understand!?

631
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,830
Of course, of course! You're right!

632
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:02,380
I know we were desperately waiting for a negotiation,

633
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,080
but right now, it seems best if we back out. Let's go.

634
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:10,000
Let's go. Let's go.

635
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,830
You! Your name is Gun, right?

636
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:17,500
Yes.

637
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,060
I'm the grandson of the head family... what generation am I?

638
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,670
9th generation.

639
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,940
Yes, it's Gun.

640
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,600
All right, Lee Gun!

641
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,780
We still have a lot to talk about, right?

642
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,420
Yes. That's right. We do have a lot to talk about.

643
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,720
Follow me.

644
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,530
Mother!
-Ma'am!

645
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,790
What is a one-night stand?

646
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,130
Hurry up and order the food.

647
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:41,080
Ah, stand...

648
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,160
Can you talk right now?
-Yes, it's okay. Please continue.

649
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,950
As expected, the basic personal data matches up.

650
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:59,150
As of right now, the probability of this person being your sister is the highest.

651
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:03,140
You just have to wait for the results of the DNA test.

652
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,920
For how long?

653
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:10,910
I can't wait till then. I will go there tomorrow.

654
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:15,440
No, I'll go to Tonghyung and meet her in person.

655
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:29,410
What is this?

656
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:31,570
What will this be?

657
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:34,160
Ah, it won't be good if you get too excited and scream.

658
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,840
What is it?

659
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:37,810
Tada!

660
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,370
Oh my! What is this?

661
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:42,470
This is Da Wan's work! (a famous potter)

662
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,620
How did you get this?

663
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,610
I spent some money in order to see you this happy.

664
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,590
How could you...

665
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:52,930
as if you came in and out of my heart!

666
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:56,060
Oh my world.

667
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,150
How could I not love you?

668
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,930
Aigoo.

669
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,860
Do you like it?

670
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,960
Yes, I love it.

671
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,840
Who is he?

672
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,410
That handsome person I see.

673
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,280
Mom, Mom!

674
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:16,030
There is a visitor. Even by a glance, his looks are about the same level as mine.

675
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:18,710
He is tall too. Do you know who he is?

676
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,130
Name: Daniel Pitt
Age: 32

677
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,530
A global designer who's being called the second Philippe Starck in the industry.

678
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:31,400
Never tells outsiders about coming into Korea, and refrains from public events.

679
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,360
He has revived a dead company with his designs.

680
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,440
He is friends with Mother, overtaking the age difference.

681
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,780
His spec is grand and impressive.

682
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,050
However, he's not someone who should be first on the blacklist yet.

683
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:47,390
Here, a nuclear weapon that will blow this whole household.

684
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:50,570
It'll look cool if the hero holds onto it.

685
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,120
Are you sure that you really didn't know?

686
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,710
Huh? You're not making excuses.

687
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:03,060
I'm not that kind of person.

688
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:07,080
I've really never made excuses since being born.

689
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,460
I just didn't know that she was pregnant.

690
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,000
Mom, I told you that I didn't tell him.

691
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,750
Why do you keep doing this, putting him in a difficult spot?

692
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,290
Since you've said that you are not going to back out,

693
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:30,060
shouldn't your family members

694
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:33,050
know this fact now, right?

695
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,680
Call your family in front of my eyes right now.

696
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,130
You can't.

697
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:42,030
Why aren't you calling them?

698
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:46,550
Mom, can't we take care of it on our own?

699
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:47,820
I think that that will be better.

700
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,750
I don't think so.

701
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,550
Do you think that I don't know you?

702
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:54,550
You are probably just going to say "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

703
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,330
You'll say that a hundred times and end it.

704
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,830
You.

705
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:04,320
Hold on, CEO!

706
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:09,300
Won't she receive less of a shock if I call first?

707
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,220
I'm sorry.

708
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:16,260
If I went to the right room, this wouldn't have happened.

709
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,600
It already happened.

710
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,790
Do you think you being like this will do any good?

711
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,490
I have a responsibility, too,

712
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:34,270
so I will take care of it.

713
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,150
If Chairwoman finds out, she will be shocked.

714
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,680
What is this?

715
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,500
Who are you?

716
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,880
Our island's enemy, CEO of Jangin Chemical.

717
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,490
Hey, what are you doing?

718
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:02,250
How can this be? This makes no sense.

719
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:05,370
How can the grandson of our family do this?

720
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:08,570
How is he going to meet our ancestors?

721
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:10,830
I just can't watch this.

722
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:16,300
Who is that girl? I don't think she's Se Ra.

723
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:24,380
After looking at the thickness of her wrist and ankles, and the condition of her hair,

724
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:28,550
she seems to be about 160 cm and weighs about 45 kg.

725
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,610
She seems to be a woman with very ordinary looks.

726
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:36,130
That's amazing. You are the best at this kind of thing.

727
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,820
Turn it off right now!

728
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:44,490
Grandmother, talking to those two directly first,

729
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,950
seems to be the right order to figure out the truth.

730
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:50,420
Right?

731
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:53,850
Giving Gun a call right now is the right thing to do, right?

732
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,020
Where is my cellphone?

733
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:02,930
Is it Gun? Where are you right now?

734
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:05,200
Come see your grandmother right now.

735
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,570
Grandmother, it's going to be difficult to go see you right now.

736
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,180
The place I'm at is-

737
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:18,070
Hello. Is this Gun's grandmother?

738
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:22,430
I am Kim Mi Young's mother.

739
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:26,490
Who is that?

740
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,790
Kim Mi Young,

741
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,230
is the name of my valuable daughter whom your grandson impregnated.

742
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:37,450
What?

743
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,090
Did you just say "pregnant?"

744
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:45,910
Yes. There is no denying it. She is pregnant.

745
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,650
How can this happen?

746
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:50,090
So the baby inside of your daughter's stomach

747
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:55,240
is the baby or my grandson for sure?

748
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,260
Did you just say "for sure?"

749
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:02,840
Are you saying I'd do this with my daughter when I'm not sure?

750
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,690
What? Are you planning to back out?

751
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:09,600
What do you mean "back out"?

752
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,030
Our household's specialty is taking responsibility.

753
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,220
I will go there right now.

754
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:18,550
But where is that?

755
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:21,230
Yeoul Island. You can take a boat to get here.

756
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:24,160
Mom, there probably won't be anymore boats coming in today.

757
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,830
Oh my. Today won't do.

758
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,530
The boat comes here two times a day,

759
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,280
but the last boat just left.

760
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:37,610
I will tightly hold on to your grandson and my daughter so they can't run away,

761
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,200
so as soon as the day brightens, you can come here.

762
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,240
As soon as the sun rises,

763
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,810
I will no matter what, no matter what runs over there...

764
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:50,320
So please, I ask you to take care of my grandson so nothing happens to him.

765
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,940
Aigoo, of course!

766
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,290
Do you perhaps think

767
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:58,860
I'd do something to your grandson?

768
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,740
Aigoo!

769
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:04,160
Why are you like this, Grandmother? What happened?

770
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:08,060
She's pregnant.

771
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,460
Pregnant?

772
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,550
This pregnant?

773
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,260
This rascal!

774
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,610
After doing this, how can he not tell me?

775
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,650
Daniel! Daniel!

776
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:28,580
My Gun, my Gun...

777
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:32,470
He is letting me see my great-grandchild, which I have been waiting for.

778
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,080
What are you doing? Follow me.

779
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:51,120
Chief Park!

780
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,860
Chief Park!

781
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,420
Here, you two can sleep here.

782
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,930
No way! No way!

783
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:19,640
How can we sleep together? And in this kind of place at that.

784
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,950
No, no.

785
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:24,990
Mom, we have Unni's room and your room.

786
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:27,340
I can sleep here,

787
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,830
but he is a guest, after all.

788
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,870
Yes, I'm a guest.

789
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:35,470
Aigoo, guest, my ass.

790
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,540
You are a thief who stole the soap factory and my daughter.

791
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,720
Go in already.

792
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,150
No, I can't.

793
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,710
How can I sleep here? It is smelly and dirty.

794
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,000
Where? It smells fresh.

795
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,470
It's homey and nice.

796
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,560
Ow!

797
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,160
Come in.
-I can't sleep here!

798
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,990
I can't sleep here!

799
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,990
What is happening?

800
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:05,160
What is this sound?

801
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,890
She locked the door!

802
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:09,810
Why is she locking the door? Are we prisoners?

803
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,860
Open the door!

804
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,780
Open!

805
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,580
Ahjumma, just hit me like earlier instead.

806
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,560
Please open the door!

807
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,530
Fated to Love You
~ Preview ~

808
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:37,420
I think that we should go to the hospital tomorrow.

809
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:41,040
I made a selfish decision, but I hope that you'd follow me.

810
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,680
You are asking to give my Mi Young as a surrogate, aren't you?

811
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,210
How dare you act like a rude chaebol?

812
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,320
You need to be in love to marry.

813
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,200
You cruel rascal!

814
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,630
They're all the same.

815
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:56,100
So will you pray with me?

816
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,740
If we met under nice circumstances,

817
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,530
I'm sure we would call this "fate".

818
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,810
I got married.

819
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:08,750
I got married!
