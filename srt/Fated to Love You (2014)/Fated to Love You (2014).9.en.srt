1
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,660
The nicer he is to me,

2
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,510
the more afraid I become.

3
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,690
The nicer he is to me,

4
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,130
the more of an effort he makes for me.

5
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,550
I became afraid...

6
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,450
That I would grow to expect too much.

7
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,320
That I would mistakenly think that he likes me.

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,810
Divorce Settlement

9
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,550
That on the promised day...

10
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,690
I wouldn't be able to send him away.

11
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,170
Episode 9

12
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,620
Are you asleep?

13
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,580
Earlier.. the reason for what I did..

14
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,390
To tell the truth,

15
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,310
Kim Mi Young, I was about to wipe away your tears.

16
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:18,710
But when I see a lady crying, I tend to feel a little intoxicated, so..

17
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:23,200
I understand, what you are trying to say.

18
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,350
I think this is a relief.

19
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,480
And you seem to understand what I'm saying, and...

20
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,710
Good night.
- Yes, sleep tight.

21
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,110
♬ When then twinkling stars color in the dark night sky ♬

22
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:02,610
♬ I draw out the one star in my heart, the hidden you ♬

23
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:09,000
♬ I draw out the one star in my heart,  ♬

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,110
♬ The hidden you ♬

25
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:22,570
♬ I don’t know why♬
♬ The more I erase you with tears♬

26
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:28,140
♬ The clearer you get♬

27
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:35,450
♬ Don’t go away♬
♬ When the long night passes and sun shines♬

28
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:41,010
♬ I hope my warmth from my fingertips reaches you ♬

29
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:47,660
♬ My everything, my destiny♬

30
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,990
♬ My heart keeps going to you♬

31
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,510
Would it be...

32
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,680
♬ When I open my eyes, let me hear it ♬

33
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,030
okay to desire you?

34
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,110
♬ Sweet Melody ♬

35
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,810
Have a safe trip.

36
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,680
What's wrong?

37
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,360
No, well...

38
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,620
That...

39
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,860
Do I have something on my face?

40
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,260
Our Mi Young, if I think about it,

41
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,160
doesn't seem to be able to catch onto things.

42
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,920
Well, that is charming, I suppose.

43
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,780
Yeah. I'll come back.

44
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,490
What's happening?

45
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,740
You see...

46
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,580
if it's okay, today at lunch time,

47
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,100
I'll come by the office, so we can eat together.

48
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,970
For real? Are you serious?

49
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,120
Today is very exciting and I love it!

50
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,710
I'll come back.

51
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,060
Good bye.

52
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,390
At 12 o'clock, 12 o'clock.

53
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,720
Come back safely.

54
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,310
Why are you here all of the sudden in this mood?

55
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,620
I... No, it can't be, right?

56
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,370
What can't it be so suddenly?
- My illness..

57
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,730
it'll never actually develop in me, right?

58
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,200
How can I guarantee that?!
We'll just have to wait and see.

59
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,820
This octopus quackery doctor!
Are you shooting dark ink at me right now?!

60
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,720
Anyway, Dr. Octopus...

61
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,470
I have to...

62
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,630
live for at least 20 more years. 20 years.

63
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,300
As long as you don't develop it until the age of 40,

64
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,370
you could easily live another 20 years.
No, even 50 more years, why not?

65
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,970
But, why 20 years out of all number of years?

66
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,640
Our Dog Poopie (the baby)...

67
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,510
I think I should protect it for at least 20 years.

68
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,330
In 20 years, our "Poopie" will become an adult and be independent.

69
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,410
Therefore, I won't worry as much.

70
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,030
When you think about the baby being born...

71
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,040
are you being like this because you're worried?

72
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,470
Ah! Leave and do your work!

73
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,920
JANGIN CHEMICALS
COLLABORATING WITH INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER D. PITT

74
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,710
Look into the camera!

75
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,860
Everything looks good!

76
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,450
Get closer please!

77
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,850
Oh, do you really want that? You want that? Okay.

78
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,340
Look this way, please.

79
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,630
Look over here!

80
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,830
We are close. We are very friendly. Very close.

81
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,270
Fighting!

82
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,130
Strength!

83
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,950
Now is the real beginning.
You must feel a bit nervous.

84
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,340
I'm the type to do better when I'm nervous.

85
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,030
I am really curious.

86
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,220
On when your confidence will come to a halt.

87
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,360
It'll only be beneficial to Jangin Chemicals for me to continue with my arrogant confidence.

88
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,760
Yes, you've got the passing score! How you're displaying your dedication and devotion for our company.

89
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,520
I really love it.

90
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,330
I'm very eager to give you a passing score, too.

91
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,200
As Mi Young's husband, you know.

92
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,300
I will take care of that. Don't worry about it.

93
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,580
A different pose please.
- More poses?

94
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,470
Is this type of pose okay?

95
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,380
Look this way please!

96
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,020
Look down a little, too.

97
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,300
Before our next shareholders' meeting, that sly, foxy punk has gained something that's issue worthy!

98
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,960
He blasted the dismissal resolution with one powerful stroke!

99
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,490
Do you think this will make me give up?

100
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,650
We'll wait and see...

101
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,320
This... did you- did you really make all this?

102
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,630
Wow, this is me, Gun.

103
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,520
And this is our sweet Mi Young.

104
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,580
This is for you to eat, and I can eat this.

105
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,700
Can't we change them and eat?

106
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,460
Why?
- Well, you know, it's a little weird to bite off my own face,

107
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,990
and it's kind of scary, too.

108
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,840
I'll just eat you.

109
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,070
Isn't that weirder?

110
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,180
Ah, what are you imagining? You must have imagined something that's weird, huh?!

111
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,840
No, it's mine though...

112
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,760
The lunch, lunch.

113
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,130
Yes, then eat this, and I'll eat this.

114
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,560
I'm going to eat this then, okay?

115
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,530
I guess I should eat

116
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,980
your sharp and sweet nose first.

117
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,370
Try the sweet nose first...

118
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,100
Oh, it's sweet. It's so sweet!

119
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,960
I'll eat the lips.

120
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,160
I'll just eat a bite.

121
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,700
Oh, it's delicious.

122
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,670
It's really delicious.

123
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,430
But Mi Young...

124
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,020
But...

125
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,820
It's really weird.

126
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,150
What is?

127
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,200
Do you know that TV show?

128
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,130
The one about how your children change?

129
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,100
You look like the main character of that.

130
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,840
You told me to change ever since.

131
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,340
I'm not going to be a "post-it" gal, now.

132
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm going to live as brave Poopie's mom instead.

133
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,590
As Poopie's mom?

134
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:33,960
But if you only live as Poopie's mom, then are you not going to live as a Bond girl?

135
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,810
You can't not live like a Bond girl.

136
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,220
Eat now.
- Yes.

137
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,480
Eat!

138
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,960
My goodness.

139
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,300
Set the tables fast!

140
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,140
Ma'am, where should I put this?

141
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,950
Oh, please put them in the kitchen.

142
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,970
Yes.

143
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,550
Mom!

144
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,750
Aigoo, look who is here! Mi Young, you came?

145
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,700
Welcome!

146
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,260
When did you prepare all of this?

147
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,840
It's great, right?
- Yes.

148
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,230
Drink this cold drink.

149
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,170
Mom, the shop looks really awesome.

150
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,110
But, did you have the money to buy such a good shop like this?

151
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,190
Our fate was probably to run this store.

152
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,790
Your brother-in-law found this place which was out for a really cheap price.

153
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,350
I am really amazed, too.

154
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,850
You're right. It is weird.

155
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,370
But Mom...

156
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,520
Are you alright?

157
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,720
Since leaving Yeoul Island, are you ok?

158
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,670
Why wouldn't I be?

159
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:57,710
Still, I like it better with the family living close like this.

160
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,360
I'll see my son's face often, too.

161
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,420
Do you really feel like he is your son?

162
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,380
Isn't he a little bit weird? His laugh, too.

163
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,100
To tell you the truth, like you said, in the beginning...

164
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,690
I thought he was a weird brat.

165
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,490
But the more I look at him, he is a sincere person.

166
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,760
Thank you.

167
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,620
He is nice and he has a warm heart, too.

168
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,500
Yes.

169
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,480
Aigoo, speaking of the devil!

170
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,320
He came just as we were talking about him.

171
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:54,770
♫ Oh, baby, I love you, Yes I do.
Just like a lie, I.. ♫

172
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,460
♫ Because of you, I cry and laugh. ♫

173
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,060
♫ I just wanna be with you.
Can you hear my heart? ♫

174
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:08,260
♫ Blossoming from my aching heart,
My only love. ♫

175
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,090
You can't hold heavy things. It's dangerous.

176
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,960
Huh? Chief Secretary Tak!

177
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,690
CEO!

178
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,330
When did you come?
- I came a while ago.

179
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,970
I waited for you for a long time!

180
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,160
Really?
- My goodness.

181
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,730
Mi Young, living in Seoul like this, I get to see you guys often.

182
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,560
That's what I'm saying. We need to see each other often.

183
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,170
Since you're here, enjoy the anchovy lettuce wrap immensely!

184
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,340
Alright, I got it.

185
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,560
Go and clean up fast.
- Alright! Alright!

186
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,740
Just give me that!

187
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,560
No, no!
- Are you really going to do this?

188
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,450
Why are you talking in Seoul accent all of a sudden?

189
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:42,100
If you go to Rome, you follow Roman rules. If you go to Seoul, you talk in Seoul accent.

190
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,590
Your sister is originally a Seoul type, you know.

191
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,140
Lettuce wrap anchovy and...

192
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,350
three rice bowls.

193
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,260
Okay. Wow, this is really hot!

194
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,130
Give it to me. Okay, I'm going.

195
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,680
Just a second.
- Why?

196
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,650
Oh, the sweat. It feels good.

197
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,640
It's tough, right?
- What is?

198
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,900
I'm going to go crazy.

199
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,990
What are you two doing?

200
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,530
Are you two dating and not working?
- I was going to go before because a customer was calling.

201
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,900
I go running when a customer calls!

202
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,450
I go running!

203
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,130
Girl, you are truly blessed.

204
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,060
Where is a husband like that nowadays?

205
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,510
He is a person I have to be really thankful for.

206
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,700
Aigoo, your smile is hanging from ear to ear. Get working now.

207
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,020
Let's see.

208
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,760
Stick our Poopie's picture first and...

209
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,660
paste this on, too.

210
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,810
Hi, Dog Poopie.

211
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,800
It's the first time we are saying our hellos, right?

212
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,030
Did you have a good time today, too?

213
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:12,400
Your mom had a really good time at your grandma's shop.

214
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,920
Also, it was even better because your dad was there with me.

215
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,480
Your dad and your mom are slowly becoming...

216
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,240
We're becoming a real family now... it feels.

217
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,720
Who is it?

218
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,600
Mom.

219
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,180
What is this?

220
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,160
Along with new articles on the collab, in order to advertise, too...

221
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,510
I prepared a photo shoot for you and Daniel Pitt together.

222
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,400
Is this a notice?

223
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,370
Just as you please?

224
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,460
And also...

225
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,050
Jangin Chemicals' Madame...

226
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,350
Why is she here?

227
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,830
Chairwoman Wang gave the orders for that.

228
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:03,210
She said that it would help improve the company's image
if the Madam also participated in the photo shoot.

229
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,980
Grandma does unnecessary things.

230
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,000
That, Daniel jerk, can't you take him out?

231
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,440
Daniel is the main person in the event, so we can't take him out.

232
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,670
He has to advertise the new products as well.

233
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,640
I can't just pay the penalty fee and take the whole thing back.
I'm stuck, I'm stuck.

234
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,400
Penalty fee?

235
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,200
Please don't even bring that up, my liver trembles every time you say that.

236
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,020
Alright, I got it.

237
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,800
Hey, where is the location of this.

238
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,300
Please be sweet and look at the camera.

239
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,510
Unni, smile!
- Could you put your arm on her?

240
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,710
Your left hand, yes. Alright, smile!

241
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,330
CEO, smile!
- Smile!

242
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,980
Yes, it's good.

243
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,490
Oh, you're so pretty!

244
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,310
My goodness, he hugged her too much!

245
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,140
Yes.

246
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,020
The expression is so reassuring.

247
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,330
We did good.

248
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,940
Please hold her a bit tighter. More happily..

249
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,520
Uh.. but...

250
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,130
Who is that baby face?

251
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,510
Counselor Jeon Ji Yeon

252
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:23,500
As you live, you sometimes need a life consultation.

253
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,780
Use me.

254
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,950
The more personal the content is, the better.

255
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,580
Like that.

256
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,100
Okay, shy expression.

257
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,850
Look at me.

258
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,700
Look at the camera.

259
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,970
Okay, that's good.

260
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,070
Jesus. Why is the water so good?
[meaning there are many good looking people]

261
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:52,340
How could the guest be late and arrive after the CEO?
You're tardy!

262
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,600
The thought of taking pictures with Mi Young made
my heart flutter so much that I couldn't sleep.

263
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,680
I overslept. I'm sorry.

264
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,710
You're also good at telling jokes!

265
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,710
You don't need to react to him talking rubbish.

266
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,950
Close it. Close, mouth. Close your mouth.

267
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,640
Let's hurry and take the picture and go.

268
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,680
Let's do this quickly! What? Like this?

269
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,960
We are going to shoot now. Get ready.

270
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,500
Don't be nervous and come closer.

271
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,040
♫You are my girl. Oh, my sunshine.♫

272
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,320

293
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,200
Ji Yeon!
-Oh, Unnie!

294
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,550
Good job! Good job!

295
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,920
Oh, so pretty!

296
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,970
Oh, you did well on taking those.

297
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,080
Hello?

298
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,880
Yes, that's right. Who... ?

299
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,770
I have to go back to the office,

300
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,120
but I'll give you a ride before I go.

301
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,600
You must be busy, so just go straight to the office.
I'll go home on my own.

302
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,130
No, it's okay.

303
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,750
Mi Young, you can just get in my car. I'm going to the cafe anyway.

304
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,950
What are you saying right now?

305
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,510
Why would you give this person a ride?

306
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,280
A neighborhood Oppa is taking her back to the neighborhood.

307
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,810
Are you being mindful of that, too?

308
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,450
Mi Young, let's go. I'll give you a ride.

309
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,500
Look, Gun.

310
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:16,690
Today, I'll go in Daniel's car. I think that will be better.

311
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,650
What was that?

312
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,750
He said he's going to the cafe. It's on the way so I'll go with that.

313
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,440
Then, can you do me the favor?

314
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,690
Yes, of course.

315
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,780
See you next time.

316
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,430
There's something going on, right?

317
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,150
No.

318
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,850
Actually, I need to go somewhere.

319
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,940
Where are you going? I'll take you there.

320
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,830
Then, can you please take me to Gangnam?

321
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,060
If I ask you more, it will be hard on you, right?

322
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,640
Yes.

323
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,390
A little.

324
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,990
Yes. Okay.

325
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,930
I won't ask and will just take you there.

326
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,200
You can rest. You must be tired.

327
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,520
Thank you.

328
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,530
Because I asked you to meet me all of a sudden,

329
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,510
you must be quite shocked.

330
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,600
A little.

331
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,340
Still, it's okay. I also wanted to meet you at least once.

332
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,730
I have something I have to ask,

333
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,090
so I wanted to meet you.

334
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,400
Kim Mi Young,

335
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,060
by any chance, do you love Gun?

336
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,200
That... Why... ?

337
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,100
The last time we met, Gun told me

338
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,360
that he's responsible for you.

339
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,440
Because you are the mother of his child,
he has to stay by your side.

340
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,630
I, also, know about that part.

341
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:02,310
I didn't know about it then but after time passed and giving it some thought,

342
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,720
I still don't understand.

343
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,250
Becoming a married couple based on

344
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,780
responsibility for the baby...

345
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,400
what's the meaning behind that,

346
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:20,350
when there's no love involved?

347
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,580
Is it okay for you to live like that?

348
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,240
I'd be so upset and miserable.

349
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,100
In that,

350
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,050
Gun would probably feel the same.

351
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,380
I hope Gun wouldn't know about you meeting me today.

352
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,180
Yes. I won't tell him.

353
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,900
Are you okay?

354
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,900
I'm sorry.

355
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,160
Who is that person?

356
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,360
Mi Young, are you okay?

357
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,600
I'm fine.

358
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,900
You haven't left yet?

359
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,530
There's something going on, right?

360
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,340
Mom...

361
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,870
Mom...

362
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,660
Does it hurt?

363
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,040
It's almost time for your flight, but what are you doing here?

364
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,960
When will you come to your senses?

365
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,890
Don't you know how much effort was put into getting the top position?

366
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,780
Why did you go there? You couldn't expect to hear anything nice.

367
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,570
I thought I had to meet her at least once.

368
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,900
I also have things to apologize for.

369
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,450
I think I have to go home now.

370
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,370
It would be harder on you to go home now
and look at Gun's face.

371
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,520
Again, you'll just stay silent and suffer alone.

372
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,900
You are always the one suffering more until there's conclusion.

373
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,320
Why are you so angry?

374
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,390
I don't know why, but I keep on getting angry.

375
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:13,290
It's just... Lee Gun who always puts you in that situation...

376
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,430
I'm also angry at Lee Gun.

377
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,910
I'm also angry at myself for just looking
because there's nothing I can do.

378
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,890
Don't be like that.

379
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,490
No one is at fault.

380
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,770
Anyway, I'll calm down and make something to eat.

381
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,810
You can take a rest during that time.

382
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,510
You also have to eat what I make before you go.

383
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,570
If you won't listen to me this time, I will be really mad.

384
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,740
♬ When then twinkling stars ♬

385
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:50,200
♬ color in the dark night sky♬

386
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,100
♬ I draw out the one star in my heart, ♬

387
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:02,810
♬ I draw out the one star in my heart, the hidden you♬

388
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:12,550
♬ I don’t know why. The more I erase you with tears♬

389
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,610
♬ The clearer you get♬
Why do you keep trying to go down the difficult path?

390
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,250
I don't want to see you get hurt anymore.

391
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,140
♬ Don’t go away. When the long night passes and sun shines♬

392
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,810
♬ I hope my warmth from my fingertips reaches you♬

393
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:32,600
♬ My everything,♬
Mi Young! I'm home!

394
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,810
Snail!

395
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,080
Snail!

396
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,620
♬ When I open my eyes, ♬
Snail!

397
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,650
♬ let me hear it♬

398
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,750
♬ Let me hear you saying I love you. Sweet melody♬

399
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,780
Are you hiding? Kim Mi Young!

400
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,630
Kim Mi Young!

401
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,110
The person you have called is not available.

402
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,780
Where in the world did she go?

403
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,600
She couldn't possibly still be with that gigolo bastard...

404
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,330
Madam, why don't you raise a neighborhood oppa?

405
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:45,090
Of all oppas, a neighborhood oppa is the best kind!

406
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,670
You...
- Neighborhood Oppa!

407
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,830
Neighborhood Oppa! Surrounding Oppa!

408
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,340
All the Oppas she knows, I have to get rid of them all!

409
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,020
Gotta get rid of them all!

410
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,310
Isn't this Dog Poopie?

411
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:56,870
Becoming a married couple to take care of a baby...

412
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,580
what meaning does that have

413
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,830
when love doesn't exist?

414
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:10,340
Are you okay with living like that?

415
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:15,210
I would be so upset and miserable.

416
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:22,020
Gun would probably feel the same way.

417
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,130
I'm home.

418
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,660
What do you think you are doing?

419
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,120
Do you know what time it is? Are you doing this to see me lose my mind?

420
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,120
After you just left like that, what on earth are you doing out there?!

421
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,140
What did you do?! Why did you do that?! Huh?!

422
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,230
No...

423
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,330
Wha- What are you doing?

424
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,080
Are- Are you trying to act cute?

425
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,460
I- I'm still mad!

426
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,660
I'm sorry.

427
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,560
There was something I had to do.

428
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,770
From now on I won't make you all worried.

429
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,890
You're...

430
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,790
making me speechless...

431
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:33,980
So I can't even speak. I can't- I can't just let you slide like this.

432
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:44,850
If you look over here, this is where we organize and separate the ingredients.

433
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:49,350
Where we utilize and test the herbal properties.

434
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,430
And if you'll look here,

435
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,960
we are using traditional methods to produce our products.

436
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,000
In one word, we are a company with that much tradition.

437
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,650
Yes, well, is there anything else you want to emphasize?

438
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,870
Most people react like you.

439
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,130
It's edible.

440
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,310
I'm full.

441
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,520
With the stylish sense of Mr. Daniel Pitt,

442
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,140
and to encompass 'grand artistry mindset' of Jangin Chemicals,

443
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,390
we think some new art works will be created.

444
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,460
They can't just be any ordinary works.

445
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,950
It must be of a great magnitude of artistry.

446
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:54,580
Don't you think, D. Pitt?

447
00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:00,050
You can look forward to it, as you will definitely see what a name's worth means.

448
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:25,200
To see the actual production site and to verify the ingredients..

449
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,600
Anyway, it's quite nice.

450
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,750
Professionally, it's a two way street.
Because I love good communication.

451
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,910
Yet, personally speaking, it's a one way street.

452
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,890
I just really don't like you.

453
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:40,710
Everything you, CEO Lee Gun, do personally,

454
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,310
I also dislike.

455
00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:00,870
We were going to have to deal with our issues sooner or later, I guess it is today.

456
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:08,640
There is a line between a person to person relationship that must never be trespassed.

457
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,280
Between you and my wife,

458
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,170
I would like you to draw a clear line.

459
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:21,570
What to do? I think I've already stepped on the line.

460
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,280
You can lose your leg if you step over the line.

461
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,990
Then you should have done better before I stepped on that line.

462
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,900
I think you're a bit too late now.

463
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,860
Oh.

464
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,550
Do you think so?

465
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,110
You're strong.

466
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,990
CEO!

467
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:32,750
Our company will sponsor an auction to support human cultural assets this year as well.

468
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,570
You are going to donate something, too, right?

469
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,610
It's for a good cause, so I will.

470
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,230
Will the Madame also do it?

471
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,500
There's no need for that, I can do it for both of us.

472
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,670
I understand.
-Oh, and Secretary Tak,

473
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,480
Lawyer Hong will be here at 2 o'clock.

474
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,850
12 o'clock!

475
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,450
Our snail is going to bring some yummy food! Yummy food!

476
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,980
Yummy food!

477
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,330
Yummy food!

478
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,730
It's not Mi Young today.

479
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,520
I was a bit busy today.

480
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,710
Tomorrow, I will be sure to pack Gun.

481
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,330
You don't need to pack lunch tomorrow.
For tomorrow, let's go somewhere together.

482
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:29,420
Where to?
- There's an annual company event.

483
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,720
It'll be nice if you could come as well.

484
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,640
When it ends, I will take you to dinner at a nice and sweet place.

485
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,790
And I have something to give you.

486
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,160
Eat.
-Yes.

487
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,700
Lawyer Hong.

488
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,200
Mi Young.

489
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:58,620
What was it that you wanted to tell me?

490
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,080
Honestly, I shouldn't be doing this as a lawyer,

491
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,820
but I'm worried about you, Mi Young.

492
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,480
What is it that you wanted to tell me?

493
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,630
You know I'm aware that

494
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:15,080
a divorce agreement between you and CEO Lee Gun exists.

495
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,800
Ah, yes.

496
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,390
CEO Lee Gun called me, saying

497
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:25,240
he wants to revise the divorce agreement.

498
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,690
Is that so?

499
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:36,460
I thought since you two were so good to each other that the divorce would not have to happen.

500
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,640
Well, that is how our relationship started, anyway.

501
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,860
I'm fine.

502
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,080
Thank you for worrying about me.

503
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,930
You're ready, right?

504
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,100
If, by any chance, at least now,

505
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,070
you'd like to change your mind...

506
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,260
Don't talk nonsense and just write it up.

507
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,360
I wouldn't have called you otherwise.

508
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,770
Yes, I understand. We will begin now.

509
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,620
First.

510
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,550
First...

511
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,340
Se Ra!

512
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,060
What are you doing?

513
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,170
Yes.

514
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,310
You know our company is holding an auction tomorrow, right?

515
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,550
Yes, I heard.

516
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,600
What are you donating?

517
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,350
I'm not sure. I haven't...

518
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,270
I don't even know what kind of item I should donate.

519
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:43,790
What it could be, extremely expensive...

520
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:52,480
What is this? Dog Poopie?

521
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,730
It's our baby.

522
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,580
Dog Poopie is the baby's fetus name.

523
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,710
There's poop in the name. Did Gun agree to it?

524
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,080
Yes..

525
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,230
If you keep saying it, it's actually quite cute.

526
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,560
As if to say it isn't your baby.

527
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,830
Gun would probably get something expensive.
No need for both of you to donate.

528
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,580
You don't have to do that.

529
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,000
Okay, I won't.

530
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,550
Have a rest.

531
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,090
Mi Young, don't worry too much.

532
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:36,170
It should be okay for you to sign the agreement right away
if CEO Lee asks you for divorce.

533
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:40,650
CEO Lee will tell you the details. Cheer up!

534
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,120
You shouldn't have done that. No matter how much you needed the money for the restaurant.

535
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,060
How could you just accept that money!

536
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,250
Even though Son-in-law Lee is as great as he is.

537
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,440
Well... that...

538
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,880
He's a son, not just a son-in-law.

539
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,070
What's so wrong with receiving some money, Mother-in-law?

540
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,240
This punk. Is it just a few dollars?

541
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,660
How can you say that?!

542
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,210
Mom, stop it.

543
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,730
What's so wrong about getting favors from the rich son-in-law?

544
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,800
What was that about?

545
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,390
So, to set up this restaurant, you received money from him?

546
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,340
That's what they say. I am also very upset..

547
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,440
How embarrassing is this!

548
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,200
To be blunt,

549
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,680
your son-in-law is a chaebol and all he has is money.

550
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,090
What could be so bad about that?

551
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,420
He's living a good life with Sister-in-law now.

552
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,370
What's the big deal about getting some money?

553
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,390
Don't you think, Sister-in-law?

554
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:33,270
No.

555
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,750
It isn't right!

556
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,840
How could you accept such things from him?!

557
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,860
There's nothing more for me to receive from him.

558
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:47,140
No, I shouldn't receive anything!

559
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,320
How could you take that big money from him.
What am I supposed to do?

560
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,560
Hey, hey. Don't be so riled up.

561
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,170
Here, here. Have a seat.

562
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,240
Calm down.

563
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,860
Hey, is there something wrong?

564
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,660
Mom.

565
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:11,880
Mom, what should I do?

566
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,280
Okay, Okay, what's wrong?

567
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,720
Mom.

568
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,500
Mi Young.

569
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,060
Mi Young.
-Yes?

570
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,160
Is there anything you need?

571
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,660
You are going to the auction today, right?

572
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,840
But I think it'd be better if I don't go.

573
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:03,250
Nonsense. You're a daughter-in-law in this house, of course, you should be there.

574
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,710
Are you not attending?

575
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:09,410
Now, I can just put out the stuff and just rest here.

576
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:13,190
You're attending it in place of me as the Madam of this family.

577
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,760
Get ready now, okay?

578
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,830
Yes, Grandmother.

579
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,880
Are you wondering why I'm here?

580
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,770
I got invited because I'm a world renowned designer.

581
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:10,580
But where's your escort?

582
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,710
It's okay if I don't have one.

583
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,450
What's that look on your face? Is there something wrong?

584
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:25,200
No. Nothing.

585
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,480
Here. I will be your escort today.

586
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,770
I'm fine by myself.

587
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:33,040
Do you really want to stand out alone that badly?

588
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,410
When everyone's going like this?

589
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,660
Let's go.

590
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:51,840
This company, for the past 20 years, has continually supported traditional artists.

591
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,600
Furthermore, we have partnered with the Cultural Heritage Administration to protect human cultural assets

592
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,700
and decided to launch a culture foundation.

593
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,970
Then, for those who have made this fine event possible,

594
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,480
we'll have to meet the CEO couple.

595
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,660
Everyone, let's give a round of applause

596
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:10,570
to CEO Lee Gun and Madame Kim Mi Young.

597
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:23,420
Then we will officially start the auction; the first is

598
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:26,060
the item which Jewelry designer Jang Yoo Hyun has donated.

599
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:29,300
This piece is called the " Tears of Maldives," which consists of sapphires.

600
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,440
The initial bidding is 1 million won ($1,000 USD).

601
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,410
1 million won.

602
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,990
We have 1 million won.

603
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,990
1.2 million.

604
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:35,920
1.3 million.

605
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,210
We have 1.3 million now.

606
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,630
What are you going to do? You don't know anything.
-2 million won.

607
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,080
We have 3 million won. It's going up.

608
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,680
Anyone over 3 million?

609
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,290
We have 3.5 million now.
- 4 million!

610
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:54,970
We have 4 million.

611
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:57,220
Anyone over 4 million?

612
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,410
One, Two, Three!

613
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:02,810
It has been sold.

614
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,030
Then what will come out next?

615
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:13,170
Now we will see the auction item donated by

616
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:17,390
Jangin Chemicals' Madam Kim Mi Young.

617
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,880
You donated an item to this auction?

618
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,460
No, I didn't.

619
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,280
That...

620
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,270
The item is called Dog Poopie cup.

621
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:37,210
It's not visible from afar,

622
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:42,260
but the cup has Dog Poopie written on it.

623
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,230
Is that our Dog Poopie?

624
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,880
What to do... about Dog Poopie?

625
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:55,480
The starting price is 10,000 won ($10).

626
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,950
Why would she auction that?

627
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,470
I auctioned it.

628
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,160
You did?

629
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,190
You did well!

630
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:13,620
Then we'll start with 10,000 won. Let's start.

631
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:21,590
I don't know why that 'dog poopie' cup is there.

632
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,150
One second...

633
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,350
1,000,000 won!

634
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,980
1,000,000 won?

635
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,930
Daniel!
-Is 1,000,000 won right?

636
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:09,900
Hello. I'm designer Daniel Pitt. Nice to meet you.

637
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:17,510
The drawing on that cup might not look like it's much, right?

638
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:24,860
But when I, Daniel Pitt, look at it, I see a really refreshing charm.

639
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:30,750
Like how an attractive actor that has no charm isn't much to look at.

640
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:36,070
But then, even if it isn't too pretty, an actor who is very charming is much more liked.

641
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:43,950
It's similar for an artwork. An artwork that moves people's hearts like this one, is the one truly worth it.

642
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,990
Please continue.

643
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:56,380
Yes, after listening to that explanation, I now see it in a different light.

644
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:15,370
That was a really great speech.

645
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:21,550
People who can discern the true worth of an artwork seem to have similar eyes.

646
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:25,310
Personally, I know the artist who drew that picture.

647
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:29,810
That person is very considerate, meticulous,

648
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,510
altruistic, and a very kind person.

649
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:39,200
As you look at the work, you can see the creator's feelings in the work.

650
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,710
In that sense,

651
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,710
I'll start with 3,000,000 won.

652
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,780
3,000,000 won?!

653
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,990
Ok, let's start with 3,000,000 won.

654
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:57,190
How surprising, it was initially at 10,000 won
and now it's at 3,000,000 won.

655
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:02,230
Is there no one else?
-3,500,000 won!
-3,800,000 won!

656
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:04,390
3,800,000 won!

657
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,840
Did she cover it with gold or something?

658
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,790
It's going up to 4,000,000 won.
-5,000,000!

659
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:14,320
There was a 5,000,000 won! 5,000,000 won!

660
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,300
Could there be anyone else?

661
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,300
7,000,000!
- 7,000,000!

662
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,730
7,000,000 won. Is there anyone else?

663
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:25,000
8,000,000!

664
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,030
9,000,000!
-It even went up to 9,000,000! That was a shock.

665
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:30,720
Can't you just please stop?

666
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,560
That's not just any dog poopie, but our Dog Poopie.

667
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,370
How can I stop here? I will definitely take our Dog Poopie back.

668
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:39,800
10,000,000 won!

669
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,240
10,000,000 won? There was a 10,000,000 won.

670
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:49,660
Wow! Is there anyone else? If not, the winning bid will be...

671
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:54,930
30,000,000 won.
-30,000,000 won!

672
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:59,260
We have 30,000,000 won bid for this Dog Poopie cup!

673
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:04,200
Everyone, that was a 30,000,000 won! Is there no more?

674
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,630
One! Two! Three!

675
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:12,690
It's been sold at 30,000,000 won!

676
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,490
Why are you like that?

677
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,330
What's with your face?

678
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:56,180
I felt stupid.

679
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,090
Stupid?

680
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:03,100
Because you almost lost that Dog Poopie cup?

681
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:07,300
Why is that your fault? It's that punk's fault for taking it.

682
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:12,200
I'm going to catch that punk and get things straight.
You're okay now, right?

683
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:16,610
That was the first time

684
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:20,890
that I wanted to become greedy.

685
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,310
Gun,

686
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:27,550
you keep on being good to me that I unknowingly

687
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:30,500
started to be greedy.

688
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:38,550
As we live like this,

689
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:42,190
with Dog Poopie, beside you

690
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:44,870
I may be able to stay.

691
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,900
So...

692
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:51,650
like other people,

693
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:55,700
maybe I can dream of an ordinary happiness.

694
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,620
Just like that,

695
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,750
I started dreaming of an impossible dream on my own.

696
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,410
But now I know it for sure,

697
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,770
I am merely one who inserted herself into your life,

698
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:21,660
much like an uninvited guest.

699
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,390
Only making trouble.

700
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,160
Lee Gun.

701
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,860
Now, us...

702
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,880
let's stop.

703
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,640
I think the right thing to do now is to stop.

704
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,390
Kim Mi Young..

705
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:18,410
Kim Mi Young, since when did you become such a selfish person?

706
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:25,660
Huh?
-Since when did you become a person who only says
what she wants regardless of how others feel?

707
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:35,460
What about me?

708
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:40,460
What about my heart?

709
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:46,120
The more you tell me not to care, the more I care.

710
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,370
If I can't see you, my heart gets uncomfortable.

711
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:56,500
When you smile, when you cry... What about my heart that cries and laughs along with you??

712
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:00,820
Don't you get what I'm trying to say?

713
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,570
No...

714
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,790
But...

715
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:11,050
you always make me confused.

716
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,220
Because you are always so nice to me,

717
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,550
the fact the we have to break up,

718
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:20,200
I keep on forgetting.

719
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,080
I'm scared.

720
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,990
As it continues,

721
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:39,610
I won't want to leave you, when the time comes.

722
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,300
That if it isn't you then there won't be anyone else...

723
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,970
Then, I...

724
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:53,800
Since I can't be like that...

725
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,540
♬ I draw you. ♬

726
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:01,220
♬ And then I erase you.♬

727
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:10,520
♬ Standing there, I speak to myself again.♬

728
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,830
♬ When I offer my hands ♬

729
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:19,550
♬ and hold you tight,♬

730
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:23,010
♬ Even the twisted destiny will become love.♬
