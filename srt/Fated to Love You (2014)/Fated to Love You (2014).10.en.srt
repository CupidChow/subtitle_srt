1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,530
I'm scared.

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:17,180
As it continues, I won't want to leave you when the time comes.

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,520
♬ I like the bright sunlight.♬

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,620
That if it's not you, then there won't be anyone else...

5
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,340
♬Your smile spreads widely.♬

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,770
Then, I... Since I can't be like that...

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:36,140
♬ I get the feeling of my heart fluttering ♬

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,640
♬ Like a fool, I smile. ♬

9
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,910
♬ I keep remembering you.♬

10
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,640
♬You, who seemed just like a coincidence.♬

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,390
♬So that I wouldn't reveal my heart,♬

12
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:12,120
♬I just watch you from afar.♬

13
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,840
In this world...

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,170
♬Then I just erase you.♬

15
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,210
there isn't a thing that can't be done in this world.
♬I just stand there,♬

16
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,350
♬And talk to myself.♬

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,780
♬When I offer my hand and hold you tight,♬

18
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:47,110
♬ Even the twisted destiny will become love.♬

19
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:54,890
♬ I shout this. I just love you.♬

20
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:02,180
♬ My heart wants you. You are my destiny.♬

21
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:18,140
♬ I love you. I just love you. My heart wants you.♬

22
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,970
Episode 10

23
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,800
♬You are my destiny.♬

24
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,490
♬ I love you.♬

25
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,830
Aren't you going to compliment me?

26
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,920
On what?

27
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,050
I mean, I did get you back Dog Poopie.

28
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,020
By saying "30 million won!"...Did you already forget?

29
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,220
Thank you.

30
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,040
Gun, you are the best.

31
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,210
You are also the best.

32
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,740
I think the snail has now fully returned again.

33
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,190
My wife...

34
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,250
Kim Mi Young.

35
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,090
Let's go.

36
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,850
Let's go eat something delicious.

37
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,080
Before our Dog Poopie becomes hungry. Come on!

38
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,660
Let's go.

39
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,400
Dog Poopie.

40
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,500
Dog Poopie.

41
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,130
I have to get cold!

42
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,550
I have to get cold!

43
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,540
That punk is coming out!

44
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,980
Get your act together. That punk is going to appear.

45
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,850
I have to get cold!!!

46
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,300
What's the matter, this early in the morning?

47
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,050
Doctor, inside of me,

48
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,560
there's another me.

49
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,860
He is very wild,

50
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,390
and constantly destroys things.

51
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,460
Rawr!

52
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,660
He almost came out again.

53
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,540
What are the exact symptoms?

54
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,220
The snail is sexy. The snail is sweet.

55
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,750
The snail is... ?
- I kissed the snail.

56
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,300
Ever since, whenever I see the snail, I burn up.

57
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,560
Save me!

58
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,530
A chaste woman for three years!

59
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,370
Hit me!

60
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,660
The snail is in here!

61
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,990
It is hard for a normal man to love a snail,

62
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,810
but desiring someone you like is natural.

63
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,460
When the snail compliments me, I get all flustered and my heart flutters,

64
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,880
and I want to have it so much that with my whole body...

65
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,520
I can't control it.

66
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,830
Does your body move on its own and reacts to it constantly?

67
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:17,760
Then, the only way is to calmly
control yourself.

68
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,130
Is there a way doctor?
What should I do?
(Bibles on the desk)

69
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,420
The Bible

70
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,120
CEO!

71
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,910
CEO! CEO!
Something big happened!

72
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,150
What now? I'm already nervous enough
that something might happen again.

73
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,590
Everywhere, there are articles about
the love story between you and Madame.

74
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,510
At this rate, you might really become the
national couple.

75
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,890
What is this?!

76
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,330
Hey slug...

77
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,660
Come over here. Right now!

78
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,830
You... Is this all your doing?

79
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,540
I did it, but the reporters...

80
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,560
Good job!

81
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,260
Very well done!

82
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,740
Did you just compliment me?

83
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,140
I thought you were just sluggish...

84
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,400
Just keep doing what you just did. You just have to be like this.

85
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,350
Thank you!

86
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,880
CEO, what about me? I made the meeting with Daniel successful

87
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,190
and I am managing the collaboration with
Daniel perfectly well.

88
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,050
That annoying Daniel... That gigolo bastard!

89
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,190
Look over here. Are you a kid? Are you a puppy? Do I have to compliment you every day?

90
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,290
How dare you whimper? Get out!

91
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,590
Aren't you being a little too much?

92
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,120
They say that even whales, when complimented, can dance well (Korean proverb).

93
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,380
Okay, okay. You did good. Show me your dance.

94
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,180
Like this? Like this, or

95
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,160
like this?
- Freeze!

96
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,680
I did well, didn't I?!

97
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,590
A piece of luck came into Jangin Chemicals!
A piece of luck came in, a piece of luck.

98
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,500
Yes.

99
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,930
Which one looks good?
- Didn't this picture come out well?
- Yes, it did.

100
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,930
This is worth 30 million won? Does that even make sense?

101
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,290
Then a picture of my face would be worth at least
a hundred million (about 100,000 USD).

102
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,750
Really, what can I do to see the end of these two?

103
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,730
Ah, there it is.

104
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,280
What is this place?

105
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,990
I didn't know there was a room like this.

106
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,750
Divorce Agreement

107
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,620
What is this?

108
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,080
Oh my, how could this be...

109
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,840
That white thing that looks like a dot is our Dog Poopie?

110
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,960
Yes, the white looking thing inside the amniotic sac is the baby.

111
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,800
Hi, Dog Poopie! It's daddy.

112
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,610
This is really interesting. I can hear the baby thump-thump...

113
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,340
Yes, the heartbeat sounds very good.

114
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,330
Is that so? That means it's really healthy, right?

115
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,060
Look, it's healthy because it takes after me.

116
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,880
It's really healthy because it takes after you.

117
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,650
Look, our baby is so good-looking. It could be a general.

118
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:21,620
Aigoo, you're smiling from ear-to-ear.

119
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,110
Anyway, Octopus Doctor, our Dog Poopie is growing up well, right?

120
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,430
It is growing really well.

121
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,620
Everything seems to be fine, um...

122
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,590
Only the head seems to be a bit big for its age.

123
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,500
Its head is big?

124
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,290
What kind of nonsense is that?

125
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,670
Our family has normal-sized heads.

126
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,860
Who does it take after?

127
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,960
Me?
- No..
- Me?

128
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,900
As you can see, it definitely isn't me.

129
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,210
Our family has small heads after all.

130
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,740
That's true, that's true.

131
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,860
Then, is there something wrong with it's head being big?

132
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,960
There is no problem.

133
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:14,450
I just meant the head is just a little bit bigger for its gestational age, and you are just overreacting.

134
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,790
Aigoo, it's a shame that I'm the only one to see this.

135
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,840
It's because it's my first time. I don't do this twice.

136
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,830
But Dr. Octopus..

137
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:28,320
Our Dog Poopie, is it stingy after eating a pepper,
or just stingy?

138
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,190
What are you saying?

139
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,770
Why are you asking that type of question?
- What's wrong with that?

140
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:38,700
We can't tell from the picture, but
you should be able to see it right away.

141
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,470
You're a doctor with 35 years of experience. It's because we need to buy clothes.

142
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,880
Should we buy pink ones or blue ones? Or blue ones or pink ones?

143
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,560
We can just buy blue ones and pink ones.

144
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,200
The color isn't that important.
- I guess you're right.

145
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,230
Your wife's right, you're so tacky.

146
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,710
So tacky.
- I'm tacky?

147
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,640
Aren't they really cute?

148
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,180
But what do we have to buy?

149
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,130
We don't know if we have to buy pink things or blue things.

150
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,430
Doesn't this look good?

151
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,170
Should we buy all of these? Excuse me.

152
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:22,340
Welcome! I welcome you to, "Tiny Little Baby Goods."

153
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,690
That boob massage...

154
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,100
Prenatal classes.
- Yes, yes.

155
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,750
Instructor Park Hee Jin, right?

156
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,900
Are you two-jobbing here?

157
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,420
It's not two-jobbing, it's t-wins.

158
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,090
Ah, twins.
- You two really look alike.

159
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,270
That's what I'm saying, twins.

160
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,920
Unlike my sister, I have a mole on my face.

161
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,530
You have a mole on your face. Now I can tell you apart.

162
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,360
She seem different.

163
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,600
Then now we will start shopping. This way.

164
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,400
These are the new baby bottles that just came out.

165
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,630
Don't they give off the smell of high quality?

166
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,290
Yes, I can smell it.

167
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,770
Now, these are also insulated and anti-bacterial.

168
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,850
Insulated, anti-bacterial... Give us all of these!

169
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,600
The baby will grow fast, and won't be using these anymore after just a year.

170
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,510
But still, it has insulating and anti-bacterial functions.

171
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,540
I'm saying I want all of them.

172
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,080
Just give us all of them.

173
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,800
Yes, in that sense.

174
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,910
Ah, they are really pretty.

175
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,080
Because all 3 of them are wearing the same outfit, they look like a family, right?

176
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,510
Ah, you like this kind of stuff?

177
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,680
It's a bit childish, right?
- N..no.

178
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,210
Well, there are a lot of men who hate wearing matching clothes.

179
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,810
Ahh, this is really cute.

180
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,280
Aigo, teddy bear!

181
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,120
Is it that cute? Then why don't you buy it?

182
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,830
Should I?

183
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,650
This, don't you think it would be really cute if our Dog Poopie would play with it later?

184
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,600
Yes, indeed.
- I want to buy this.

185
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,860
Buy two of them... both of them.

186
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,130
Let's buy this one, too.

187
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,630
But, Mi Young, why are you so cold?

188
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,320
It lacks affection if you just buy one. Don't you think?

189
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,200
Yes.

190
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:29,310
A couple look is a little cringe worthy, but since it's a family look, well..

191
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:36,190
Excuse me, please take everything off these mannequins and pack them for us.

192
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,460
There, I'll hang this here.

193
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,370
Roar, dduk! (reference to the tiger from the story Gun read to the baby)

194
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,270
Aigoo... finally finished.
- So cute.

195
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,670
There...

196
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,880
Come here.

197
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,130
So, from when will our Dog Poppie start living here?

198
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,170
The due date is February 14th.

199
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,500
February 14th?

200
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,890
That's Valentine's Day.

201
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:33,160
Dog Poopie chose a good day to be born
so people won't forget it.

202
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,620
Our Mi Young, when is your birthday?

203
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,500
Me? Um..

204
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:45,040
July 23rd, the day after tomorrow.

205
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,830
Liar?
- But it really is.

206
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,000
No way! Liar!
- Why?

207
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,850
That day is my birthday, too!

208
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,940
Really?!
- Yes, really!

209
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:02,470
But I thought your birthday was October 23rd.

210
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,580
Ah, that, because our household is so famous for dying early that

211
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,310
my grandmother registered my birth a little later, believing I'll live longer that way.

212
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,670
It's so fascinating. Then, that means that our Dog Poopie's

213
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,720
mom and dad will have the same birthday.

214
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,180
Looks like it. Oh, that's interesting... How can something like this happen?

215
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,950
But how do you normally spend your birthday?

216
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:32,640
Normally, I spent it alone. Mom was busy with the restaurant and...

217
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,390
my sisters and I were busy with our part-time jobs.

218
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,860
On your birthday, is there something you really wanted to do? Tell me.

219
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,740
If you want me to, I'll even pluck a star from the sky for you.

220
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,940
Nothing.
- There's nothing?

221
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,710
Just the fact that you, me and Dog Poopie will be spending it together.

222
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,820
I think just that would be exciting.

223
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,980
How can one be so selfless, while I even said I'd pluck the stars for you?

224
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,150
What about you?
- Me?

225
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,140
Is there something that you want to receive?

226
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,140
Why? Are you going to get it for me?

227
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,740
If I can do it, then I will do it for you.

228
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,620
Really?
- Yes.

229
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,930
Are you serious?
- What is it?

230
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,500
I want that... give me that.

231
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,180
The cup?

232
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,030
A Dog Poopie cup?
- A Dog Poopie cup.

233
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:39,100
You made a cup for Dog Poopie, so why didn't you make one for me? So unfair. I know how to use cups, too.

234
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,660
Make me a Gunnie cup. Gunnie Cup!

235
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,800
Okay, fine. I'll make one for you.

236
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,940
Really?

237
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,970
Aigoo, I'm sleepy. I better get some sleep.

238
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,410
Aigoo, I'm sleepy, too. Better get some sleep.

239
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,570
Do these two have to sleep here?

240
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,550
Why? They're cute.

241
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,330
If they're cute, they can sleep here?

242
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:10,720
I think I shouldn't have bought this.
We should have just bought one.

243
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,320
Good night.

244
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,600
One second... you can't get cold.

245
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,510
The show is not quite at performance grade yet.

246
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:40,180
I feel it requires more time to fine-tune the performances.

247
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:46,290
I would like to change the schedule to get us further rehearsal time to make it to my specifications.

248
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,860
He wants the schedule changed. Shall I see if it's possible?

249
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,150
Okay.

250
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,210
Se Ra!

251
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,570
Se Ra!

252
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,780
You took a sleeping pill last night, too?

253
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,460
What are you planning to do, being like this?

254
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,750
You need to get your feelings together and concentrate on the performance.

255
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,120
Everyone is saying that you're acting strange.

256
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,370
I thought that as time passed by...

257
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,920
I would feel better

258
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,870
but it just keeps getting harder.

259
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,580
I can't take it.

260
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,510
If I could go back to how it was before.

261
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,480
If I could turn back everything.

262
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,250
Hello.

263
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,990
Oh! Mi Young.

264
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,640
What's the occasion?

265
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,110
I came since I have a favor to ask.

266
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,740
Tell me. I'll do everything for you.

267
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,660
Tomorrow is Gun's birthday. I want to make a present.

268
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:16,880
♬ From the day that you arrived,♬

269
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,170
♬ I had no idea you'd be my life. ♬

270
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,170
♬ And when I look into your eyes ♬

271
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,560
Dog Poopie's Dad 
♬ I knew someday,♬

272
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,770
♬ You'd be my wife.♬

273
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,760
♬ I know there's times when I am wrong ♬

274
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,270
Do you think that person will like it?
♬ And you know there’s times when I am right♬

275
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,840
Of course, he has to like it.

276
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,450
It's a work of an artist recognized by
the world-famous designer, Daniel Pitt.

277
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,600
When you say it like that, it makes me sound like an amazing person.

278
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,740
Why don't you take this chance to get proper lessons?
It will be good for the baby as well.

279
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,490
I like it. I will think about it.

280
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,680
But when is your birthday?
- My birthday?

281
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,660
I want to get you a present, too.

282
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,650
Aren't you going to tell me?
- Mine is also tomorrow.

283
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,970
Then your birthday is the same as his.

284
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,920
Oh well, it's not just one or two who have the same birthday.

285
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,130
I've asked the most popular Korean food specialist you mentioned to prepare the birthday dishes.

286
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:35,620
I wanted to buy the cinema you chose at first, but changed it to renting the place for a day.

287
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,650
It's too expensive.

288
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:44,250
And lastly, I reserved a table at the Tower Restaurant you wanted to go to.

289
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:49,970
CEO, I did better than Assistant Manager Lee Yong, right?
Here.

290
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,350
But CEO, you're not normally the type to go all out for your own birthday.

291
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,820
It's our snail's birthday... snail's birthday.

292
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,330
Sna-- Madame?

293
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,950
Wow! You birthdays are on the same day?

294
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,020
How could it be?

295
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,600
In the world, it's not like we are the only ones that have the same birthday.

296
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,870
Why are you overreacting today?

297
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,190
Having double morning sickness AND a double birthday.

298
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,020
With that you two might as well have been destined for each other.

299
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,800
Destiny?

300
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,720
♬You are my destiny.♬

301
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,600
♬Oh, baby.♬

302
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,230
Destiny.

303
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,030
CEO.

304
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,510
Why do you look so tired? Did you not get enough sleep?

305
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,460
I am not tired. You can go now.

306
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,080
Leave now? Then I shall conclude my report now.

307
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,230
Allegiance!

308
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,690
What on earth are you doing?

309
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,220
I put you in the same house so that you can get something big on him and if this continues...

310
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,940
You will get chased back to the semi-underground house again.

311
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,040
Do you know how I escaped from that semi-underground house? Do you think that I would go back there again?

312
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,400
I don't mind myself, but I will not allow my Yong to go back to how we used to live.

313
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,870
What's with the confident attitude?

314
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,910
Do you have something useful?

315
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,520
Divorce Agreement

316
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,730
This is...
- What do you think?

317
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,090
Do you still think that I should go back to the semi-underground house?

318
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,670
This means... with one blow...

319
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,730
That guy Gun is done, done.

320
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:47,590
But you have to defeat him with one blow this time!

321
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,780
How busy must you have been to not have had time to eat?

322
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,140
Slowly, eat a lot.

323
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,360
You didn't have to cook it for me.

324
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,630
Wow! It's delicious.

325
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:10,190
What is this squishy thing? Is it tapioca?

326
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,250
It's my favorite food, fish eye.

327
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,240
It's very chewy, right?
- Mmhm ahahaha!

328
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,710
So tasty...

329
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,080
You can go back now.

330
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,760
It's sad when you're eating alone.

331
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:34,730
Because someone's watching me eat, it feels weird...

332
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,470
I always ate alone while my mom worked at the restaurant.

333
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,370
Then from now on I'll keep you company.
We are family now, after all.

334
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,460
When I was young, just knowing that my hyung was in Seoul, I was very happy.

335
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,480
I didn't know he was such a scary hyung.

336
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:07,930
That person, he may look mean, but...

337
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:12,160
he is a very warm and lonely person.

338
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,010
Someday, he will open up towards you, too.

339
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,290
You should eat before it becomes mushy.

340
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,370
Eat with kimchi, too.

341
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,890
This is the most delicious thing I've eaten at this house.

342
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,490
Dog Poopie, you had a good day, too, right?

343
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,710
I always feel you inside.

344
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,860
You're probably like that to, right?

345
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:55,280
Tomorrow, it's me and your dad's birthday, on the same day. Interesting, right?

346
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,270
At first, I thought that he was a totally different person from me.

347
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,930
I find it fascinating that I keep finding more similarities over time.

348
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,410
I like it a lot

349
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:18,640
Tomorrow, let the three of us have a fun day like today.

350
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,430
Where did our snail go?

351
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:35,440
Snail...

352
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,670
Snail...

353
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,750
Why?

354
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,390
If you wash your hair this early in the morning,
can't you imagine how distracted I would be?

355
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,850
Since it's morning, I thought I'd wash my hair...

356
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:14,320
Well, if it bothers you, I'll shower after you fall asleep.

357
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,760
Wait.

358
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,760
Come out for dinner tonight.

359
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,670
Dinner?

360
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,120
No way, did you forget what day it is today?

361
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,820
Of course, I remember. It's our birthday.

362
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,780
You know that department store from before?
Let's meet there at 6.

363
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,900
I won't forgive you if you come even a minute too late, okay?

364
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,000
Okay. I'll make sure to be on time.

365
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,860
Good.

366
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:52,970
That snail, even her behind is kind.

367
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,710
I really want to be that towel for her.

368
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:59,210
I want to be that towel... I want to be that towel!

369
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,260
Aigoo.

370
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:11,130
Aigoo, everything about Seoul is great, but the air is so bad!

371
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,830
Aigoo, aigoo!

372
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,310
Jangin Chemicals' CEO Lee Gun's marriage turns out to be a contract marriage.

373
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,460
Wha- what is this?!

374
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,920
Eh?

375
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,450
What is it?

376
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,420
Look at this!

377
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,730
What is this all about?

378
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,700
It's Mi Young, Mi Young!

379
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,010
Oh my, what is this?

380
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,580
Oh my, oh my, what on earth happened?
Exclusive: Divorce Agreement -
CEO Lee Gun trades baby with money.

381
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,740
Oh my!
Exclusive: Divorce Agreement -
CEO Lee Gun trades baby with money.

382
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,270
A divorce agreement?!

383
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,550
What on earth is this?!

384
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,860
What an awesome work you did, Head Grandson!

385
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,720
Our family is entangled in such a terrible scandal!

386
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,980
How deplorable!

387
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,510
Then what will become of the Lee household!

388
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:17,760
And what about our Jangin Chemicals?!

389
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,160
Madame Wang, say something!

390
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,670
I cannot believe this.

391
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,350
This must be a plot.

392
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,870
Gun, you say something.

393
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,890
This isn't the truth, right?

394
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,910
No.

395
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,980
Mi Young, you answer.

396
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,040
This isn't true, right?

397
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,460
Grandmother,

398
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,240
I'm sorry.

399
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,990
Grandmother! Grandmother!

400
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,660
Are you alright?

401
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,630
You fool!

402
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,380
How dare you act like a rotten chaebol?!
Why, you fool?!

403
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,720
What are you going to do?!

404
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,740
Grandmother, don't stress yourself. It's bad for you.

405
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,440
Only a few days ago,

406
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,160
that love story or whatever was the hot topic.

407
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,150
But what kind of disgrace is this now?

408
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,430
That is exactly what I mean.

409
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:24,080
Hey, Head Granddaughter!
No, granddaughter, my butt.

410
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,000
Hey, Lady! You tell me now.

411
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,470
Were you really planning on receiving money and giving the child to him?

412
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,100
Do you really think she would have sold her child for money?

413
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,140
If she is a normal mother?

414
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:43,050
Then do you mean you are not giving the child?

415
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:47,060
Meaning that the Lee family's bloodline will be discontinued?

416
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,460
No, it's not that...

417
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,110
Stop it.

418
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,660
This has nothing to do with her.

419
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,080
Just leave it be.

420
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,680
But the divorce papers are something between the two of you. What do you mean she has nothing to do with it?

421
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,500
What kind of nonsense is this?

422
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,420
This marriage is fake, and it seems she won't hand over the baby.

423
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:09,600
Then, isn't there a big problem with his heritage rights?

424
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,490
Move out of the way!

425
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,450
Aigoo, wait a second!

426
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,450
Let me go!

427
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,000
Mom...

428
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,520
Stand up. Let's go!

429
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,480
Mom!
- Mom!

430
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,700
Elder-in-law.

431
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,080
What did you just say?

432
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,130
Mom?!

433
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:40,240
And how can you call me an in-law in this situation?

434
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,880
What are you doing? Let's go!

435
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,110
Mom, don't do this and listen to me.

436
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,190
What more do I have to hear?

437
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,690
The divorce paper that demands you
to hand over the baby for money...

438
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:56,680
You mean I have to listen to the whole story of you living with him despite receiving that treacherous piece of paper?

439
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,640
Let's go!

440
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,320
There is no need for you to stay at this ridiculous household!

441
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,000
Mom.

442
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,920
I like him.

443
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,640
What did you just say?

444
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,770
No matter what people say;

445
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:15,060
to me, that person is a very nice person.

446
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,990
This girl! Don't talk nonsense!

447
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:22,350
Let's go!
- Mom, you like Gun, too.

448
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,590
Be quiet, let's go now!

449
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,510
Mom.

450
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:39,790
Such a mother and such a daughter had become a part of our family.

451
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:44,830
You said she's a virtuous lady, and see how vulgar she is.

452
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,020
I don't care what you do to me,

453
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,770
but watch what you say about those two.

454
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,950
I won't leave you alone if you do that.

455
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,200
Mom!
- Let's go.

456
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,580
Follow me.

457
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,860
Mom, please calm down,

458
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,220
and listen to me.

459
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,460
What do you have to say?

460
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,100
When that unbelievable piece of paper came out, what will you say against that?

461
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,990
There was a reason why he gave it to me.

462
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:21,830
We met by accident in the beginning, and we had no choice but to marry because of the baby.

463
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:25,130
We married without love, so he thought we could divorce,

464
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,790
and I also agreed to that.

465
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,890
But we can't let people think that he's the only bad person.

466
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,890
I did the same thing as him.

467
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,740
This girl, are you on that bastard's side even now?

468
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,190
You foolish girl!

469
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,850
Mom! Mom!

470
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,310
I was wrong, okay?

471
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,800
I was wrong, so

472
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,710
please don't take Mi Young.

473
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,080
I did wrong!

474
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,530
Lee Gun!

475
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,200
I actually really liked you.

476
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:05,320
Since you married Mi Young, my thoughts about that never changed.

477
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,610
You should know that best.

478
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,400
If it's not then say it's not.

479
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,590
I did wrong...

480
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:16,150
I'm sorry!
I said I'm sorry!

481
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,240
I honestly do not know a lot about your agreement or whatever.

482
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,110
Whether or not it has a legal effect, I do not know.

483
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,330
But I know one thing for sure,

484
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,700
you hurt my daughter's feeling.

485
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,060
You took my daughter and made her miserable.

486
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:40,340
That I know exactly well! Am I wrong?

487
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,970
Isn't that enough?

488
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:47,800
Then there won't be a reason to let my daughter stay here, right?

489
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,870
Let's go.

490
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,260
They're here!

491
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,560
Is the divorce agreement real?
- Is it true that it is a contract marriage?

492
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,050
Did the mother know about this?

493
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,270
Please say something!

494
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,710
Look, you reporters!

495
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,270
You should not be happy about another person's misery.

496
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,740
You must also have a family and children.

497
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,770
Isn't this too much? Move out of the way!

498
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,330
Look over here!

499
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,870
You all are too much!

500
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,780
Please say something.

501
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,280
Se Ra.

502
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,090
Se Ra.

503
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,470
Se Ra, look at this.

504
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:31,310
Jangin Chemicals CEO Lee Gun, revealed to have had a contract marriage

505
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,860
What is this?
- They say it's a fake marriage!

506
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,560
You didn't know either?

507
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,400
Mom,

508
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,380
I was wrong.

509
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,770
I'm really sorry,

510
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,860
for making you upset.

511
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,520
For being a bad daughter,

512
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:08,810
I'm really sorry, Mom.

513
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,590
My poor girl.

514
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,270
Do you not have a mother? Do you not have a sister?

515
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:25,620
Why did you endure it all by yourself?

516
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,570
With this delicate heart.

517
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,900
How did you endure it all by yourself?

518
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,740
Mom,

519
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,200
I really won't make you cry from now on.

520
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,170
I won't make you sad anymore. I'll truly be a good daughter from now on.

521
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,650
Don't cry, please.

522
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,550
Don't cry because of me, Mom.

523
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,640
Yes. Yes.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

524
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,780
Alright, I won't.

525
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,230
Grandmother,

526
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,420
I was wrong.

527
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,590
I really did wrong.

528
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,030
At first, when I got married,

529
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,380
I was deeply troubled inside.

530
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,680
So I did it, even though I knew how petty it was.

531
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:09,130
I thought that was the only way I could endure it.

532
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,480
But now, Grandmother,

533
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,190
I feel so numb inside and

534
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,200
it feels empty.

535
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:26,360
Empty.

536
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,720
Anyway, I'll handle all this and make you smile again.

537
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:41,490
You can get angry but don't get sick, okay?

538
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,760
If something bad happens to you,

539
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,550
then I'm really alone.

540
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,060
Okay?

541
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,510
My baby.

542
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,590
CEO.

543
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,820
The state of the company..

544
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,900
Calls from the reporters have stopped work.

545
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,530
People are writing posts slandering Jangin Chemicals on portal websites.

546
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:03,810
There are websites popping up all over to boycott our products!

547
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,390
It's become a huge mess.

548
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,390
Are you listening to me right now, Mr. CEO?

549
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,550
Huh!?

550
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,680
Secretary Tak,

551
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,010
those things right now

552
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:22,610
I can't even hear them.

553
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:27,700
Things like that can slowly be taken care of by me.

554
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:33,420
But there is something that must be handled immediately.

555
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,340
What's that?

556
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,380
Today is our snail's birthday.

557
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:46,780
I shouldn't be like this right now.

558
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,520
That's what needs to be taken care of?

559
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,090
What can be done now when your mother-in-law came and took her already? Huh?!

560
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,180
You're not even a Korean Romeo and Juliet!

561
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,670
What would you like to do, huh!?

562
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,360
That would work.

563
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,610
It's making me crazy. It's so hot.

564
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,010
He's coming out.

565
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,660
Hey kids, is Gun Lee inside?

566
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,650
What's with the informal dialect to a stranger?

567
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,000
Oh my, how rude.

568
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,390
I'M GOING CRAZY!!!!

569
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:48,050
You and you! If I went in this time, I would graduate from school this time. Did I say that or not?

570
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:50,530
You did.
- You did.
- Apologize!

571
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:51,870
I'm sorry.

572
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:53,340
I'm sorry.

573
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,170
Okay, okay.

574
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:01,770
CEO!

575
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,780
Excuse me!

576
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,730
What happened?

577
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:12,250
Did you call hyung-nim and President Park?

578
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:16,140
There is no point in repeating it. Madam is also going to run away some how,

579
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,140
and come to the promised location.

580
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,510
Okay. How long do we have to run?

581
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,880
Keep running.

582
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:26,750
Oh my, reporters! The weather is so hot.

583
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,750
You guys are working hard.

584
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,260
Have this while you're working.

585
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:33,830
This place is famous for Seoul's best lettuce and rice wrap.

586
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,590
This is the Anchovy Rice Wrap House.

587
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:38,750
Needless to say it twice and saying it three times will only hurt your mouth.

588
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,410
Hamo-hamo~!

589
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,920
Here, here, have some while working.

590
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,940
Here, here, have some. It's amazing!

591
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,520
Not this... but

592
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,120
call Kim Mi Young.

593
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,400
Kim Mi Young,

594
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,520
simply a couple words.

595
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,540
Simply, simply.

596
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,940
Simply, enjoy this.

597
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,910
Enjoy, enjoy, it's awesome.

598
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,100
It's tastier than I thought it would be.
- It's delicious, of course!

599
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,900
He's right. Let's eat and wait.

600
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,300
We are doing this to eat after all!

601
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,680
Hamo-hamo~! Go on and eat, please!

602
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,300
It's awesome. It's delicious, delicious.

603
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:16,220
What is this?

604
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,590
What are you doing?

605
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:20,830
Please start eating before anything.

606
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:28,410
Yang Soon! I LOVE YOU!
(Jang Na Ra's character in Bright Girl's Success)

607
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:35,560
Noona, you're totally my style.
Would you like to go out with me?

608
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,600
It's a love confession.

609
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,070
You terrible jerk!

610
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:51,160
How could you ask someone else to date you other than me?!

611
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,300
Excuse me? This wasn't what we agreed on!

612
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,920
You're mine!

613
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,990
How cool. That was cool.

614
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:01,690
Wow, this is something.

615
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,060
Wow, this is..
- What are you going to do now?

616
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,130
More risque, risque, risque.

617
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,290
Kiss!

618
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,530
That's hot.

619
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:11,380
Traitors.

620
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:18,350
I'm sorry, Brother-in-law. Thanks, Ji Yun!

621
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:23,710
One more time! One more time! One more time!

622
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,570
Hello?

623
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,040
Yes.

624
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,970
What did you say?

625
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,090
Yes, understood.

626
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,620
What was that about?

627
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,220
Did something happen to Mi Young?

628
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,100
That's not it.

629
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,420
An emergency board meeting has been called.

630
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,930
On the agenda

631
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,290
is the resolution for your dismissal.

632
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:00,640
Mr. CEO, you need to go there right away.

633
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,990
Boarding pass to Seoul

634
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,340
Are you crazy? You're going to Seoul right now?

635
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,990
Yeah. At first, how Gun could leave me and do such a thing...

636
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,190
I didn't understand but

637
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:27,040
after seeing the articles now I think I understand.

638
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:30,630
I need to see him in person and talk to him.

639
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:56,070
CEO Lee Gun, who traded money and baby.
Our exclusive on the divorce settlement agreement.

640
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:05,040
I got married.

641
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,470
I don't know why tears keep coming out.

642
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:12,730

You said that he was with you.

724

To lie like that means you were hurt.

Since meeting him, you have only held it in and waited.
