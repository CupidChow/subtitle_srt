Episode 6

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,360
You should leave now. I can go by myself.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,220
No way. Someone might kidnap you. It is dangerous at night.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,290
No way.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,980
But Mr. Priest, is it ok for you to go to church this late?

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,900
I'll be going soon.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,500
We are here.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,700
This is my in-law's house.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,390
Then, Mi Young, you are the Queen's...

10
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,810
You came.

11
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,530
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,280
Hello, I've been wanting to meet you.

13
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,740
Who are you that you wanted to see me?

14
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,970
Uh, me?

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,540
I'm a neighborhood oppa.

16
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,960
Mi Young is like a sister I cherish.

17
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,810
An oppa?

18
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,780
A neighborhood oppa?

19
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,310
What is that childish bandaid?

20
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,840
It's nothing. I got a small scratch.

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,470
This happened when she was with me.

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,330
I'm very sorry. I should have protected her.

23
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,630
You don't have to be sorry. It was all my fault.

24
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,560
Let's go inside.

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,430
Yes.

26
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,610
I'll see you later.

27
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,710
Call me when something happens.

28
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,160
Ok. Thank you for today.

29
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,370
This is unbelievable. Unbelievable.

30
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,900
How long have you lived here that you have already made a friend in this neighborhood?

31
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,460
Actually, he is a priest.

32
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,850
I coincidentally met him, so we talked and he took me home.

33
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,320
Can I give you some advice?

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,080
While you live with me, live with class.

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,840
Don't hang out with a priest or punk, or whatever he is. Unbelievable.

36
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,510
Shameless man.

37
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,160
Who is he to tell her to call him if something happens?

38
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,550
She has a husband.

39
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,840
I... have something I want to ask.

40
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,090
I'm not in the mood to forgive anyone.

41
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,070
That's not why I came, but

42
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,390
I came because of this.

43
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,670
Then, are you saying that you will sign this?

44
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,260
I've been thinking about this all day,

45
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,060
I don't think I can give up the baby.

46
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,600
I'm sure I can raise the baby,

47
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,080
loving it more than myself.

48
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,510
I'll prove it to you.

49
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,990
Can't you wait?

50
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,640
I'm sure you can feel

51
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,820
who the baby needs the most.

52
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,880
Signing this contract,

53
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,000
can't you delay it for 10 months please?

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,100
I ask this of you.

55
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,110
Well, that

56
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,400
would be just wasting time.

57
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,610
Even if you sign it now or in 10 months, the fact that we will divorce will not change.

58
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,440
I'm sure Mi Young, you are going to be the one giving up.

59
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,540
When that time comes, come here and sign this.

60
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,220
That will be the only time you are allowed in this room.

61
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,990
Yes. I know.

62
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,440
That's good. You understood.

63
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,340
It's good. Good. Good.

64
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,050
It's good...

65
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,240
Well,

66
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,480
since when did our Jangin Chemicals have a new tradition of pregnancy before marriage?

67
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,560
Our elders in the family are very angry.

68
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,740
I'm very sorry.

69
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,110
I should have visited you first.

70
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,000
I apologize.

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,560
Don't be so angry.

72
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,630
There was a reason why this happened.

73
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,370
But still, there is a baby to continue the Lee family bloodline.

74
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,640
What is a greater happiness than this?

75
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,690
Are you sure about that?

76
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,660
The world is full of distrust.

77
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,370
Are you saying my grand-daughter-in-law

78
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,350
is pretending to be pregnant?

79
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,500
I don't know where you heard that story, but

80
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,200
I don' t even wear fake branded socks.

81
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,190
Who is the one spreading this kind of rumor?!

82
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,580
I heard that your mother runs a restaurant by herself.

83
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,960
I'm guessing it is a franchise restaurant?

84
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,180
No.

85
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,790
It is a small anchovy rice wrap restaurant on Yeoul Island.

86
00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:01,320
So, she isn't from the capital or a big city, but from some countryside island.

87
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,810
Isn't this unacceptable, elders?

88
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,170
Excuse me...

89
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,800
The beach on Yeoul Island

90
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,700
has some of the cleanest water in our country.

91
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:26,040
And at night, you can see more stars than you have ever seen.

92
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,030
Also, the air is very, very fresh.

93
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,700
Although it is small, it is a beautiful island.

94
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,450
That's why...

95
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,880
I'm proud that Yeoul Island is my hometown.

96
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,460
You have a good girl as a daughter-in-law.

97
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,660
Gun wasn't so careful for nothing.

98
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,930
How did you find such an innocent girl?

99
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,620
Elders, these two have a complicated relationship...

100
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,620
On my grand-daughter-in-law's island, there is a natural soap factory.

101
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,280
Our Gun took over that factory.

102
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,310
And through that, this couple met.

103
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,470
How thankful is that soap?

104
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,050
The soap factory in Yeoul Island almost shutdown,

105
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,080
but Gun promised to transfer it to Seoul.

106
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,910
So, all the Islanders are very thankful to Gun.

107
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,310
Chief Secretary Tak, what did they say they are going to build on Yeoul Island?

108
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,210
Did you find out? What are they going to build?

109
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,850
What? You never told me to find that out.

110
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,770
What is this Chief Secretary Tak?

111
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,230
Do you only find things out when I tell you to?

112
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,160
Find it out quickly. Quickly.

113
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,560
Stupid.

114
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,090
Se Ra

115
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,830
Yes.

116
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,930
It's been a long time since I've heard your voice.
Were you busy?

117
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,940
Yes.

118
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,850
Um...

119
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,470
The show is ending soon, right?

120
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,680
When are you coming back to Korea?

121
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,950
I'm planning on going back sometime next week, after I'm done sorting some things out here.

122
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,580
Why? Do you miss me that much?

123
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,340
No, it's just that I..

124
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,160
I..

125
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,460
I have something I really need to tell you.

126
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,100
I'll call you right back!

127
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,730
Oh no! What should I do?!

128
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,540
What's wrong with this?

129
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,270
What's going on?!

130
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,110
Oh no, what to do. Are you okay?!

131
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,780
What is this?

132
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,770
You..

133
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,850
Why are you being like this?

134
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:04,150
I'm sorry. I was trying to clean up after showering.

135
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,680
The maid cleans the bathroom and everything afterwards;

136
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,780
you don't need to worry about that.

137
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,880
But I still... I'm sorry.

138
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,250
Wait here.

139
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,710
Dry yourself.

140
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,080
I'm okay..

141
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,390
I'm okay.

142
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,130
You'll be cold.

143
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,860
You can catch a cold, so...

144
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,880
You must be cold.

145
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,890
Aren't you cold?

146
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,760
Let's go out.

147
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,430
What are you doing? I thought you were talking to your boyfriend?

148
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,760
It's weird.

149
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,860
What is?

150
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,000
He's never hung up on me first.

151
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,870
I'll make it quick. Sorry.

152
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,140
No, it's okay. Take your time.

153
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,100
Make sure you fully dry yourself, so that you don't catch a cold.
- Okay.

154
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,100
Um...

155
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,510
I really want to thank you for earlier.

156
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,340
Sure.

157
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,200
Sure. Go ahead and dry yourself.

158
00:12:55,710 --> 00:13:01,310
♬ From the day that you arrived, ♬

159
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:07,660
♬ I had no idea you'd be my life. ♬

160
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,840
♬ But when I looked into your eyes, I knew someday, ♬

161
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,220
♬ You'd be my wife. ♬

162
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,350
♬ I know there's times when I am wrong. ♬

163
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:31,390
♬ Just as long as we both give it all we can. ♬

164
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,570
♬ And for both to see that we try ♬
With you, Father,

165
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,820
I really have no secrets.

166
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,770
But that really makes me feel at ease.
♬ You took my heart so unexpectedly ♬

167
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,030
I'm weird, aren't I?
♬ You took my heart so unexpectedly ♬

168
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,550
Maybe it's because you're a Father.
♬ Who knew that you would ♬

169
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,200
♬ be the one. ♬

170
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,470
What am I doing? I feel like I'm conning her.
♬ But I always knew that there was something special 'bout you ♬

171
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:04,190
♬ From the day that you walked into my life ♬

172
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,120
Hello?

173
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,810
Ah, yes, this is he. I am Daniel Pitt.

174
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,600
You know very well that I don't attend those types of things. I'm sorry.

175
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,050
Wait.

176
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,300
I'll make an exception this time,

177
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,230
I'll make it low-key and quiet.

178
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,100
Isn't it pretty? Yes, so pretty.

179
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,440
Okay, today, it's the first set of clothes that our newborn baby will wear.

180
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,460
We'll be making clothes for the newborn infants.

181
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,310
Doesn't it sound fun?

182
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,200
Yes.

183
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,710
Wait.

184
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,810
Today, the fathers will do the sewing.

185
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:10,020
The fathers need to put their hearts and sincerity into each stitch.

186
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,530
Now, fathers, let's raise our needles.

187
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,950
It's okay, no need to be shy.

188
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,710
Yes, that's how you do it. Start slowly.

189
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,770
Yes, that's good. Carefully, carefully.

190
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,310
Help us over here.

191
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,390
You're doing well.

192
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh my.

193
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,660
Is Gun busy?

194
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,150
It would be nice if he could be here to do this with you.

195
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,490
He's really busy with the company matters.

196
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,920
In any case, he's probably never held a needle before, so he would've done a poor job.

197
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,310
I will make it well.

198
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,940
Okay, go ahead.

199
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,420
I'll do a poor job?

200
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,110
Poor job...

201
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,780
Hello.

202
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,160
You're late.

203
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,770
Isn't it more important that I came?

204
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,160
True.

205
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,080
What do you mean "poor job"?

206
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,350
When I was in the military, my specialty was the overlock stitch.

207
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,160
I was an ace.

208
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,060
He said he was an ace.

209
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,050
I look forward to seeing your skills, Father Overlock.

210
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,860
Look forward to it.

211
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,560
I thought you wouldn't come. If you're busy, you can leave. I'll do it.

212
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,400
You said our baby would like it.

213
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,150
You can't upset the baby even while it's in your stomach.

214
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,310
Our baby will sulk.

215
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,590
Hand over the needle.

216
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,290
Thread.

217
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:19,080
♬ Oh, baby, I love you. Yes I do, like a lie ♬

218
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,720
♬ I cry and smile because of you. ♬

219
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,410
♬ I just wanna be with you, can you hear my heart? ♬

220
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,610
♬ Your love shines within all pain. ♬

221
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,270
You put it over like this, then

222
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,000
pull it like this.

223
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,980
Look at the vertical line.

224
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,900
Wipe my sweat.

225
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,140
One more time, one more time.

226
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,290
Now we pull it straight up.

227
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,600
Amazing, aren't I?

228
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,400
What's with this "Behind the White Tower" situation? 
*Famous medical drama

229
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,160
Wow, awesome. You're really good at this.

230
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,750
♬ Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you. Even more than yesterday, ♬

231
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,500
♬ my love grows every day. ♬

232
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,100
♬ Tell me that you love me. Your eyes ♬

233
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,880
Okay, from here on it's really difficult. Look closely.

234
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,880
I like it.

235
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,770
Excuse me...

236
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,970
What? Are you hungry again?

237
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,080
No, I want to thank you.

238
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,290
I'll cherish this and dress the baby with it.

239
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,090
Why dress the baby with something like that?

240
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,900
If you go to the department store, there are so many brand name baby clothes.

241
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,680
But still. This is a one-of-a-kind baby clothes.

242
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,330
If you cherish the clothes

243
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,870
that the baby wears for the first time, later when they take tests or

244
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,390
have some hardship, the baby will receive luck.

245
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:28,290
That's all a lie. A superstition, superstition. What era is it for you to still believe that?

246
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:33,000
But still. I will cherish it forever.

247
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,760
Oh my, Gun oppa?

248
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,960
Oppa, you really don't remember me?

249
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,700
What is this? I'm Se Ra's friend, Soo Hyun.

250
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,570
Ah, Se... uh, Soo Hyun!

251
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,370
Ah, I remember, I remember... Soo Hyun.

252
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,100
But what business do you have here?

253
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,770
Prenatal Care

254
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,510
You guys came together?

255
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,740
Ah ... that ... uh ...

256
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:22,060
Our factory decided to fund projects related to kids.

257
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:27,230
So we are on our way from the meeting.

258
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,190
President, I will organize the things that we are interviewing today...

259
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,110
and inform you by tomorrow morning.

260
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,760
I will go in first. I'll see you at work.

261
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,270
Oh, okay. You worked hard. See you tomorrow.

262
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,020
Yes.

263
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,200
Excuse me.

264
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,080
Wait.

265
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,160
Can you throw this away?

266
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,560
Yes, of course.

267
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,920
Looking for a trashcan is harder than looking for treasure nowadays.

268
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,530
You are so nice!

269
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,480
Your secretary is really good!

270
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,880
Yes. She should throw that away herself. Does she not have arms or legs?

271
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,330
What did you say, Oppa?

272
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,760
Ah, nothing. It's nothing.

273
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,030
Oh, right!

274
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,110
Oppa, did you see Se Ra's performance?

275
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,400
Yes?
- I didn't see.

276
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,420
All the business seats were sold out.

277
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,330
I couldn't take economy seats.

278
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,190
Did you get airplane tickets?

279
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,100
I don't ride buses.

280
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,000
My Mom

281
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,190
Yes, Mom.

282
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,870
Wench, did you not eat yet? Why do you sound so weak?!

283
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,480
Why would I be weak? Your ears are just weird.

284
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,020
I'm going to go to Seoul because my friend's daughter is having a wedding.

285
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,840
Do you have time? Come with Son-in-law Lee.

286
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,770
Let me see your faces.

287
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,190
I can go.

288
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,540
I will ask Gun.

289
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,920
I'm going back home right after the wedding,

290
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,740
so take him and meet me there so that I can see him. Okay?

291
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,420
I got it.

292
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,110
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

293
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,740
Ji Yun

294
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,420
How can they fire me?

295
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,510
And with a phone call, too.

296
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,230
They didn't want to have a contract with me. No more!

297
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:14,650
Why wouldn't they re-contract with you? You are good at working.

298
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,210
There's nothing to be done.

299
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,510
I'm just going to drink. The Earth will spin only if I drink.

300
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,260
I want to live in a world with no bias.

301
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,930
Ji Yun, stop drinking.

302
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:43,090
Since you are not in this house, it feels so empty.

303
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,990
I'm lonely.

304
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,640
It was really nice when we lived together.

305
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,110
Unni, you wouldn't know because you are having such a good time with your husband, right?

306
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,420
Aigoo.

307
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,470
Unni.

308
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,560
Unni, you have to be happy.

309
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,500
You really have to be happy.

310
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,060
My Unni!

311
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,890
If you're happy, then I'm fine. I'm okay.

312
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,730
Okay, Ji Yun.

313
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,090
I should be happy.

314
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,630
I should.

315
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,950
My Unni! My Unni!

316
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,430
Unni is stupid.

317
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,140
I'm stupid.

318
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,390
The world is stupid.

319
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:03,210
S-T-U-P-I-D.

320
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,320
My head...

321
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:39,160
This is the chip that made you a goddess of luck.

322
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,780
Take it.

323
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:49,160
What did I expect?

324
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,020
Why isn't she answering her phone?

325
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,560
Did she go somewhere?

326
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:29,860
♬ When the twinkling stars♬

Mother?
-That's right.

486
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:06,230
Now, Mi Young, you really have to treat your husband well, okay?

487
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,380
I got it.

488
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,860
Aigoo, but you seem thinner than before.

489
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:14,860
Ask Mi Young to make you some delicious food.

490
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:19,820
My son has to be well, okay?

491
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,900
Here. Mom's is leaving.

492
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,780
Aigoo. Aigoo.

493
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,510
Mom.
-Yes, my son.

494
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,610
That's right, my son.

495
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,490
Okay, I'm leaving.

496
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,670
Mom!
- Huh?!
Have a safe trip!

497
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,630
You have to have a safe trip!
- Of course, of course~

498
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,480
You've got to run!

499
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,260
Mom.

500
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,470
Okay. Goodbye!

501
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,330
Alright, let's go! Cross the Pacific!

502
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,220
Run! Run!

503
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:23,490
I'm really thankful. I couldn't even imagine it.

504
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,370
Do you know the saying?

505
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,890
A son-in-law is also a son.

506
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:37,090
But you, you were better at singing than you looked like you'd be.

507
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,160
You could be a singer.

508
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,680
Your rap was amazing, too.

509
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,510
You were like Eminem.

510
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:50,930
I had to do something like that before. A project.

511
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,760
Have you eaten?

512
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,210
Let's go eat.

513
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:08,170
Chief Tak, what happened to that thing I asked you.

514
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,810
CEO.

515
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:13,450
Please don't be surprised.

516
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,470
At Yeoul Island,

517
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,050
they're making an industrial waste landfill.

518
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,070
They are making what? That's impossible!

519
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,560
This is Lawyer Hong.  That DuDu Industries

520
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,320
is gathering electronic waste and industrial waste

521
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,900
and burying it in mountains and dumping it into the sea. The've been sued

522
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,590
multiple times already.

523
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,820
This-
-What are we going to do?

524
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:38,040
When your wife finds out, she will be very upset.

525
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,970
She would be very upset!

526
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:42,650
AH! You scared me!

527
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,000
You scared me!

528
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,460
Why were so surprised?

529
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,300
You came out of nowhere, who wouldn't be scared.

530
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,650
I'm sorry I scared you.
 -CEO, why aren't you saying anything?

531
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,460
I will quickly-

532
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,770
Kim Mi Young!
 -CEO!

533
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:56,630
Your phone...
-Kim Mi Young!

534
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:06,040
Why...are...you...to me...

535
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,240
What do you mean why?

536
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,700
HEY, CEO!

537
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:17,520
Why were you still walking around and not going to sleep?

538
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,170
This is my place so I was going to sleep, but I'll come back later.

539
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:25,790
Oh yeah, you're place. No, I should go. That's right. I should leave.

540
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,640
But you, why did you hug me from the back all the sudden?

541
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,270
I did?

542
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,150
But you were the one hugging me...

543
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,710
Just exactly what did you do? Am I crazy?

544
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,910
The flight is still days later. Why are you packing up now?

545
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,210
Are you that excited?

546
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,290
Aren't you?

547
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,370
What is that?

548
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:18,250
I have done a lot of bad things so I have to make up for it.

549
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,000
Cuff links. Aren't they pretty?

550
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:29,930
If Gun wears these and signs a contract, he'll look really cool.

551
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:33,940
Is it okay for you not to call? Wouldn't it be too surprising?

552
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,220
He didn't sound too well when I talked to him on the phone.

553
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,540
The company must not be doing so great.

554
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,300
I don't want to interfere with his work.

555
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,180
When I see his face...

556
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,250
I'll him hug tightly,

557
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:52,090
and tell him all the things I wasn't able to say.

558
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:03,050
CEO, you need to be there an hour before.

559
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:04,980
Just as you expected, the exhibition is today.

560
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,480
I can just take care of it over there. Keep alert while we're there.

561
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,980
Yes.

562
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,180
CEO, I have something to report to you.

563
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,570
You rude thing. Don't you see me leaving?

564
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,710
See me later.

565
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:19,570
Of course. Later.

566
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:23,030
Ah, it's very hot! Take care of your skin so it won't get burned!

567
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,070
Have a good time!

568
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,050
Ah, it got all wrinkled.

569
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,170
Where are they going so quickly?

570
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:38,380
I want to know.

571
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,970
I don't really know, but

572
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:44,430
I know they're going to DuDu Industries to discuss the Yeoul Island issue.

573
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:48,390
DuDu Industries... Yeoul Island?

574
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,950
Mom! Mom! Mom!

575
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:01,080
What is so urgent that you called me up?

576
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:06,580
Surprise! Watch carefully. You will surely love this.

577
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:17,140
Jangin Chemicals Yeoul Island Purchase.

578
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,990
Yeoul Island? Isn't that Gun's wife's hometown?
-Exactly.

579
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:22,180
That woman's hometown.

580
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,040
Gun sold it to DuDu Industries.

581
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,440
So? If it's worth money, you should sell it.

582
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,180
It isn't fun if it just ended there.

583
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,560
Do you know what DuDu Industries is going to build there?

584
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,070
The guys who line up behind me at work say that...

585
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:44,650
Oh my. What in the world. He sold it even though he knew they'd build something like that in his wife's hometown?

586
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:49,370
Exactly. If that woman finds out, what do you think will happen?

587
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:53,740
What do you mean. Those two, will be the end.

588
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,210
End!

589
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:05,190
It says it's made out to you, but the sender isn't written.

590
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,170
Thank you.

591
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,230
To Kim Mi Young.

592
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,220
Mi Young, you know I've always been sincere with you, right?

593
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,680
I have something to say. Let's meet up at this place at 1 o'clock.

594
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,040
I will wait until you come.

595
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,300
♬ Those days without you, how lonely they were ♬

596
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:45,260
♬ You who is far away, thoughts of you grow long today ♬

597
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:50,280
♬ When I miss you're white face, I draw you in my mind ♬

598
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:57,460
♬ The day we can meet again, I counted the days with my fingers ♬

599
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,690
You! How many times have I told you not to just come in and out when you want?!

600
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:10,510
YOU! Act properly.

601
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,450
I apologize.

602
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:30,710
This Yeoul Island Purchase Agreement,

603
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:32,680
I'm cancelling it.

604
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,480
Do you think this contract is a joke?

605
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,170
Do you think of me as a joke?!

606
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,780
I'm not afraid.

607
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:56,060
Of course, since this issue is due to my change of heart,

608
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:00,360
I will be sure to give you an unimaginable amount of compensation.

609
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,250
Look here, Lee Gun CEO!

610
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,110
You are the one who wanted to sell the factory quickly...

611
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:11,520
What is the reason you are suddenly paying the breach of contract fee?

612
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,230
You should know.

613
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,260
That island,...

614
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:23,650
is not a lousy and worthless island that

615
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:27,430
you can use for your dirty industrial wasteland.

616
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:31,060
Our Yeoul Island's seas

617
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:35,300
are one of the cleanest seas in our nation

618
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,730
and the air is very good.

619
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:43,900
It's small but it's a beautiful place.

620
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,610
So, to me,

621
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,630
I feel proud to have Yeoul Island as my hometown.

622
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,140
Lee CEO,

623
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:03,160
how much will it be?

624
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:08,300
If money is the problem, I swear I'll go beyond my limits and

625
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,410
I'll pay you anything! Now, tell me any amount.

626
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,700
Look here, CEO Cha.

627
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:41,660
If I say I won't be selling once, that means I will never be selling it.

628
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:48,380
Also, that island, is my wife's hometown.

629
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,690
Before I die,

630
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,160
my decision

631
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,800
will never change.

632
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,490
Do you understand?

It's an honor to be able to exhibit the artist's work.

635
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,250
Over here is Exhibit No. 1

Don't worry about me. Just do your work.

638
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:36,330

Mi Young.

668
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,290
Did something happen?

669
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,510
Father, I...

670
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,910
What should I do?

671
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,020
What happened?

672
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,300
To me, I thought that...

673
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,710
that person was a really good person.

674
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,290
He could've ignored me and my baby,

675
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:31,680
but he didn't...

676
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,330
And he did all he can do for my hometown people.

677
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:38,490
And so,

678
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:43,120
perhaps,... perhaps,

679
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,820
more than me,

680
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:50,640
he could be more important to the baby.

681
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,600
But...

682
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,040
now,

683
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,080
I don't know who that person is anymore.

684
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,150
What should I do?

685
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,200
Wha-

686
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:39,780
Father, I'm...

687
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,630
I'm sorry. I'll be going.

688
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:54,450
Shall we check what kind of person he is?

695
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,680
I can't go to that person.

696
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,520
You have to speak for me to know. Now why are you doing this?

697
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,340
You are avoiding him

698
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,300
because it's hard, right?

699
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,350
I'm FREE!

700
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,330
What are you doing...

701
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,730
to another man's wife?

702
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,250
Are you sure that she is your woman?

703
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,080
Give up!

704
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,120
The word 'give up' doesn't exist in my dictionary.

705
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,840
What's the real reason why you want to work with our company?

706
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,310
Is it because of my wife?
