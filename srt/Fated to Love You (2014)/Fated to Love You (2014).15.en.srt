Episode 15

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,100
Mi Young, will you be my real family?

3
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,150
Daniel,

4
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,660
when I arrived in Paris..

5
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,630
for a while..

6
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,750
I couldn't do anything and my mind was blank.

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,100
During that time, you never said anything

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,880
and you were just beside me.

9
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,480
I thought "this person beside me is going through the same pain..

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,430
and is handling it well."

11
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,100
So then, I thought

12
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,790
I have to be really good to this person.

13
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,990
For me,

14
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,080
if I were to be a part of someone's family,

15
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,310
it must be this person.

16
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,070
But.. my

17
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,100
feelings for you,

18
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,640
I'm not sure if they're gratitude

19
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:39,600
or love.

20
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,980
It's not okay if I'm not sure.

21
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,350
You..

22
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,910
asked me earnestly.

23
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:58,260
I want to answer earnestly, too, but...

24
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,220
I understand.

25
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,590
I understand what you're saying.

26
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,160
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,490
Instead of being sorry, I have a request that I hope you'll definitely fulfill.

28
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,050
From now on, I am officially going to get closer to you as a man.

29
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,830
So please give me a chance so I don't regret it.

30
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,540
Stay by me until the end of the biennial.

31
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,990
And if by then, your feelings are the same as now,

32
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,610
I will just remain your good friend forever.

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,710
Yes, okay.

34
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,580
♫ Goodbye, my love... ♫

35
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,420
♬ My heart already knew ♬

36
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:08,320
♬ This feeling of loneliness that’s about to explode ♬

37
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,570
♬ I try to hide it but I can’t hide it ♬

38
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,530
Mi Young,

39
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,640
will you be my real family?

40
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,620
So then I thought...
♬ Oh you, ♬

41
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,080
I have to be real good to this person...♬ I can’t have you, ♬

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,660
♬ I can’t touch you, but I’m okay♬

43
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,170
Just yet...

44
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,030
I'm not sure if my feeling towards you are

45
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,560
gratitude or love.

46
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:53,530
♬ if you can smile, then I…♬

47
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:59,380
♬ I will miss you the more I erase you ♬

48
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,930
I understand.

49
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,070
I understand what you're trying to say.

50
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,040
♬ tears than today ♬

51
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,240
♬ Like fate, ♬

52
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,440
I'm sorry, Daniel...
♬ I won’t ever have anyone ♬

53
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,630
♬ like you ♬

54
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,250
♬ Only you, ♬

55
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,680
My feeling towards you...
♬ only you ♬

56
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,530
keeps changing.
♬ That’s all I need, ♬

57
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,140
Just being a good person by your side was enough.
♬ until the day ♬

58
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,380
Now, you're the person I want by my side for a long time...

59
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,450
♬ meet again ♬

60
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:43,890
♬ I’ll wait, it’s only a momentary goodbye ♬

61
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,760
♫ Goodbye, my love... ♫

62
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,980
Hey, Gun, what're you doing with your food in front of you.

63
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,370
Huh?

64
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,770
What? Am I a person who only eats rice?

65
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,460
If you want me to eat, then change the side dishes. It's the same everyday, everyday.

66
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,730
What is this?

67
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,540
Why are you nagging about side dishes when you never did before?

68
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,950
Grandma, just eat very deliciously and a lot, okay?

69
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,690
And stop doing useless diets to lose weight.

70
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,540
Orders given feel right when they are personal and it feels right when you are chubby.

71
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,780
Chubby is what feels right!

72
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,800
What is this rascal saying?

73
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,640
Come home early, early.

74
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,800
Since I'm working hard, our company is doing well.

75
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,370
Hey you rascal, there's no time to eat, you have to work.

76
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,550
Aigoo.. He's living in loads of work.

77
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,380
Aigoo.. when will he settle down?

78
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,730
He got divorced while still young. Work is the least he can spend time doing.

79
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,480
He reeks of being a divorced man, so these days I do feel a little sorry for him.

80
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,260
Even if I try to find him a partner,

81
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,540
there's no one like Mi Young.

82
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,340
Grandma, actually, I met up with Sister-in-law.

83
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,650
She got really pretty, to the point Cleopatra has to bang her head.

84
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,700
And she looked healthy?
- Yes.

85
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,810
And... she's still single.

86
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,500
Really?

87
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,020
Oh my, how is it your eyes are the same as before.

88
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,560
Our very, very nice granddaughter-in-law's eyes are still the same.

89
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,420
Since I get to see your face, I really, really like it.

90
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:40,380
When I heard you arrived in Korea, I really wanted to see you, but

91
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,630
seeing my face, to you,

92
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,550
is not the happiest thing, so I hesitated.

93
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,350
What are you talking about?

94
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,640
For making you contact me first, I'm very sorry.

95
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,510
Thank you.

96
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,910
At least seeing you like this right now, I'm very happy.

97
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,580
If you were to be my granddaughter-in-law, I would be even happier.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,440
Still, whenever you see Gun, you have a hard time, right?

99
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,930
Aigoo..

100
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,620
Divorce contract and..

101
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,920
since that accident happened, it wouldn't be easy for you.

102
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,130
Grandmother,

103
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,560
that person and I,

104
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,340
our fate ended, I think..

105
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,020
Mi Young,

106
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,890
all men are about the same.

107
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,890
Our Gun, is..
-Grandmother..

108
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,530
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,330
Even though you started your career as an artist at a later age,

110
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,270
was there a special moment to get you started?

111
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,190
There was a time I was kind of sick..

112
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,120
There was a person that made me officially start drawing.

113
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,170
Like the person said, drawing helped ease and treat my pain.

114
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,700
So I kept walking this path.

115
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:21,050
Ah.. I know this is a personal question, but do you have anyone you are dating or a marriage plan..

116
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,090
CEO!

117
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,500
Oh, CEO, CEO, CEO~

118
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,210
Ah!
- Your five-province-silliness.

119
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,710
Your silliness goes beyond 5 provinces, to 8 provinces!

120
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,020
An 8-provinces-man Secretary Tak, who doesn't know when to stop.

121
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,710
Here.

122
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,930
It's the final list for the Collaboration Artists.

123
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,940
But, for organizing things, our Secretary Tak is..

124
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,830
I'm pretty good.

125
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,880
But...

126
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,430
Why, why, is Ellie Kim not listed on this?

127
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,060
That last time, you persistently said no, so I took Ellie Kim out.

128
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,770
So it's been narrowed down to Artist Lee Bora and Artist Shin Suzy.
- Ah...

129
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,900
Wow.. you severely narrowed it down.

130
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,180
Unnecessarily obedient.
- What'd you say?

131
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,160
Oh no, I mean you did a good job.

132
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,650
Anyways, Secretary Tak , there's no rush for this.

133
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,790
These people, check their portfolios and meet them in person and then bring it to me.

134
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,440
Since I'm going to decide slowly, very slowly.
- Oh, yeah, and...

135
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,930
The painting that I brought to your house last time...

136
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,480
Madam, oh no...

137
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,780
It was ex-Madam's art, right?

138
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,650
Hey, Secretary Tak, I liked it so I bought it, okay? There's no other meaning to it.

139
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,490
If I like it and don't buy it, isn't that more funny?

140
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,040
It's funny, right? It's funny.

141
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,130
It is funny.

142
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,990
CEO.
- Yes?

143
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,820
If you couldn't forget her for the past 3 years, just reveal your face and..

144
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,380
grab her again? Isn't it like that?

145
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,390
While saying "I thought wrong. You're my destiny." Right?

146
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,200
Because honestly, your disease didn't progress, either.

147
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,190
Chief Secretary Tak,

148
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,590
she's happy enough now, and will continue to be happy.

149
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,160
Besides, she has a good person by her side.
There's no reason

150
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,730
for me to shake her up, and I shouldn't do it, either.

151
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,970
I should not do it.

152
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,120
CEO?

153
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,300
You know that you have a meeting with
the art agency CEO Jeong Jae Hyun, right?

154
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,140
I know.

155
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,420
And you know you have a weekend plan to visit the botanical garden for research on ingredients, right?

156
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,270
I know that.

157
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,690
Then you know where we are going now, right?

158
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,730
I know, I know, I know! You sticky, sticky, I know!

159
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,700
Then where are you going?

160
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,060
Look here, Chief Secretary Tak.
-Yes?

161
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,980
You're bad. You're bad, Chief Secretary Tak. You put me in a bad mood.

162
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,000
I mean, you're not even a creek, but you're always following me around.

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,160
At this rate, you are even going to follow me to my personal dates.

164
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,630
Can't I?

165
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,040
This Tak gangshi (Chinese zombie)!

166
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,350
Go away, go away, go away!

167
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,960
Gun!

168
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,240
Today is the day you lost Dog Poopie.

169
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,850
You're going there again just to sit?

170
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,260
Gun...

171
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,540
Mom is here, Dog Poopie.

172
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,050
Mom came too late.

173
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,730
Right?

174
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,540
Mom never forgot you, even for just a day.

175
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,050
I lived with you in my heart.

176
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,550
Our Dog Poopie knows that too, right?

177
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,900
Why are you here?

178
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,450
Well, I just... I came, somehow.

179
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,300
You don't have to bother to come here anymore.

180
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,110
What does that mean?

181
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,010
I will live my whole life remembering Dog Poopie,

182
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:25,560
so Lee Gun, you can just forget everything and live comfortably.

183
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,830
Look, Kim Mi Young. It's fine if I forget,

184
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,970
but it's not okay if you forget? What kind of nonsense is this?

185
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,530
Why do I have to do that?
-Dog Poopie is my baby.

186
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,880
It is my baby, too.

187
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,470
That time, you gave up everything about Dog Poopie anyway.

188
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,690
Because you're so stubborn,

189
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,150
he said that he will give the baby to you and end it like that.

190
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,980
I will completely give up my child custody.

191
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,700
Even your feelings for Dog Poopie.

192
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:05,570
Ellie Kim, seeing that you even changed you're name, you wanted to start your life anew.

193
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,910
At a place like this, that past with weird trails,

194
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,820
while thinking of your memories, isn't that funny?

195
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,950
If there was a child called Dog Poopie, she'd be laughing at you.

196
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,020
She would've been laughing down upon you.

197
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,590
Whether it's starting a new life or becoming a new person,

198
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:29,330
no matter how many times I live again,
I'm going to live without erasing Dog Poopie.

199
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,180
You don't have to do something like that though.

200
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,070
I'll take my leave first.

201
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,940
♬ I keep thinking of you,♬

202
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,180
♬ seems like coincidence ♬

203
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,370
Only her outside changed. Her inside didn't change.

204
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,260
♬ In case you see my heart, I secretly look at you from far away ♬

205
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,120
Dog Poopie! Let's eat something really sweet with Dad.

206
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,860
Here!

207
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,380
It looks good, right?

208
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,560
Dog Poopie! Dad is sorry again this year.

209
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:36,030
It's good.
♬ When I hold out my hand and hug you tight ♬

210
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:42,380
♬ The missed destiny will become love ♬

211
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,480
♬ I shout out loud,♬

212
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,180
Whether it's starting a new life or becoming a new person,
no matter how many times I live,

213
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,060
I will live without erasing Dog Poopie.

214
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,540
You don't have to do something like that though.

215
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,460
Lee Young Ja, are you doing okay?

216
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,400
I'm really sorry about last time.

217
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:26,520
Whenever I'm trying to return the painting to you,
why does that kind of thing have to keep happening?

218
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:32,630
That painting seems like it wants to stay with you more than with me.

219
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,970
Is that so?

220
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:43,460
I wonder if it's because it's your work, Artist Ellie Kim,
but when I look at it, I really do like it.

221
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,270
Please just call me Ellie.

222
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,200
Should I?

223
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,180
Artist is Ellie. I am Eonni.

224
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,970
Sister! Sister!

225
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,490
Ah! I decided on putting off going to Paris for a bit longer.

226
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,270
Could it be because of the proposal?

227
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,090
How much longer are you going to stay in Seoul?

228
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:24,210
I think I'll stay for about 6 more months.

229
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,550
6 months...

230
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,080
Am I supposed to like it or am I supposed to be having a hard time?

231
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,780
What are you doing this late that you're not sleeping yet?

232
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,980
Actually, there's something that I've been thinking about all day.

233
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,490
Are you worried about something?

234
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,230
You're not supposed to pile up your worries.

235
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,220
If you pile it up, then your heart will get bruised and you get old faster.

236
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,660
Tell me.

237
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,210
I thought they were happy moments,

238
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,650
but once I confronted them,

239
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,190
I think I've been living my life embellishing those memories as happiness.

240
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,630
Memories that are so painful,

241
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,100
are they those kinds of memories?

242
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,910
It hurts so much.

243
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,560
But since they are also happy memories,

244
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,610
I'm happy though it hurts and it hurts though I'm happy.

245
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,710
It's like that.

246
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,680
I'm not sure if this will help,

247
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,210
but it's something that I've felt as I've lived.

248
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:58,160
Very painful memories are not meant to be forgotten.

249
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:05,360
You're supposed to keep it well
in the corner of an empty heart, I heard.

250
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,630
As you said, Unnie,

251
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,040
I want to comfortably accept it now.

252
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,180
At least for the sake of that person who's waiting for me.

253
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,440
You'll do well, Ellie.

254
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,360
Cheer up!

255
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,760
Thank you, Eonnie.

256
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,950
Sleep well, Ellie.

257
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,350
Good night.

258
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,390
Good night, Kim Mi Young.

259
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,750
Yes, I just came and am looking around.

260
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,870
Yes.

261
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,590
Yes. Well, this is more than enough.

262
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:23,090
Oh no, she's the type to not like anyone chasing her around.

263
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,540
Yes. Yes, thank you.

264
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,510
You live here?

265
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,570
It seems so.
-Since when?

266
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,170
Since today.

267
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,470
We're neighbors.

268
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,660
You're right.

269
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,150
Then.

270
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,010
Excuse me.

271
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,830
You and Lee Gun CEO,

272
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,880
are you still in the kind of relationship that I think you are?

273
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,670
It doesn't seem like a proper question to ask in your first encounter with your neighbor.

274
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,230
I told you, you can't! No, you can't! Hold on, Madame.

275
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,190
Even if it's this kind of situation, how can you just barge in here as you please?

276
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,900
Tak Secretary,

277
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,910
you can leave now.

278
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,030
Yes, CEO.

279
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,510
Please sit down.

280
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,170
I think I'll have to listen to your thoughts after all.

281
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,150
My thoughts?

282
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,380
Young people these days

283
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,350
seem to think that two people who have broken up can still be friends.

284
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,250
Do you think of Se Ra as one of these people as well?

285
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,320
We are continuing to meet as very good friends.

286
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,570
What kind of relationship is it if only one is happy?

287
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,980
Lee CEO, did you know that every time she went to meet you,

288
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,550
Se Ra came back crying until her eyes puffed up?

289
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,450
She even moved out because I kept pestering her about it.

290
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,740
We sorted out our feelings

291
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,430
and have already settled on seeing each other as friends.

292
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,080
You alone settled your feelings, are cool about it, and whatnot.

293
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,110
You play with her, and shake her up as you please.

294
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,140
You're very skillful.

295
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,910
You words are too harsh.

296
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,370
Harsh?

297
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:44,800
I have stuck my neck on the line to make that kid a primadonna and came all the way here; yet you, Lee CEO,

298
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,780
made Se Ra quit her career as a ballerina.

299
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,770
Who do you think the harsher one here is?

300
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,460
Saying you're friends or whatever with Se Ra,

301
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,750
if you intend to keep the relationship that is convenient for you, please end it.

302
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,210
If you continue to make her suffer any longer, I won't stay still.

303
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,690
I didn't know the office would be like this.

304
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,910
Oh, this is nothing. For an artist like you, this is the least we can do.

305
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,020
Thank you so much for taking extra care.

306
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,110
Oh no, no, I just did what the contract told me to do.

307
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,470
Take a seat
-Yes.

308
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:33,600
Then.. did you decide on the projects that we'll be working on while I'm in Seoul?

309
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,850
Image ad campaign collaboration with Jangin Chemicals
-Contract-

310
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,550
Jangin Chemicals
Ellie Kim (Dongyoon Agency)

311
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,340
Why? Are you nervous because the first project is with a big company?

312
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:50,100
This project.. Are you sure Jangin Chemicals made an offer?

313
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,970
We're done with legal reviews.

314
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,120
All you need to do is sign.

315
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,160
I want to think it over for a little longer.

316
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,350
I could do that, right?

317
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,450
Image ad campaign collaboration with Jangin Chemicals
-Contract-

318
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:16,310
I think you should do the projects that the agency suggests
to avoid problems.

319
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,580
You're like this because it's Jangin Chemicals, right?

320
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,660
It's my first domestic project.

321
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,300
To be honest, it weighs on my mind a little.

322
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,770
Actually, isn't it better being the first project?

323
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:36,860
Objectively speaking, this is a good opportunity to really establish yourself as an artist.

324
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,200
Doing this even risking breach of contract penalty,

325
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,700
in Jangin Chemicals' perspective,

326
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,110
you'll just appear to be running away.

327
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,250
That's not true.

328
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,770
If you need funds to run your business,

329
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,360
we do have the alimony allocated for you.

330
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,390
Lawyer Hong,

331
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,670
I would like to have that matter buried now.

332
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,700
Please do me a favor.

333
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,430
Saying you settled your feelings,

334
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,450
acting all nonchalant,

335
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,690
you play with and shake her up and down.
Very skillful.

336
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:37,060
CEO, we finally have the happy time!

337
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:41,950
Our CEO who becomes happy when he eats sweet things~

338
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,010
Candies and chocolate!
- Even marshmallows and macaroons!

339
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,320
Pick anything you like.

340
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,600
We'll follow your order no matter what.

341
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,010
He's moved. Deeply moved!

342
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,180
Get this out of here.

343
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:11,400
It's too sweet that I feel like

344
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,660
my head is about to crack up.

345
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,200
But we specially prepared it for you..

346
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,570
Do you have something else you want to eat?

347
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,020
For me..

348
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,370
nothing sweet like this.

349
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,210
Not this tongue, but this chest,
- Chest?

350
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,070
this heart,
- Heart...?

351
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,370
Something that will wet it.
- Something that will wet it?

352
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,380
Yeah.

353
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,590
Yes, Mi Young, where are you?

354
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,480
Huh? You're coming now?
 - Yes.

355
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,610
I want to see your face.

356
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,870
This girl..

357
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:59,720
You have to go to your office, why come here when you're probably tired?

358
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,830
Uh.. I-I don't think you can come right now

359
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,490
Come later, I'm tired okay?

360
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,610
Is there food left over?

361
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,180
You usually don't come on this day, what're you doing here at this time?

362
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,320
I came to a restaurant because I'm hungry.

363
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,200
Give me food, food, give me food.

364
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,960
There's no food today.. so just go.

365
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,650
Are you rejecting a customer? I'm not leaving a step until you give me food.

366
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,690
Aigoo.. this.. aigoo..

367
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,090
What is this poo belly bragging.
Eat up quickly and leave!

368
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,950
I'm tired, so I have to close and leave soon.

369
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,600
Aigoo, acting like you're weak...

370
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:59,240
Hey, why'd you come today? Is there something wrong?

371
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,610
What is there today? Nothing. I just came to eat.

372
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:09,420
Then don't come to me later talking crap about indigestion. So eat slowly, slowly.

373
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,940
How can you say crap to a customer?

374
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,090
You're talking crap.

375
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,470
Wait. Mother.

376
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,900
What?

377
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:25,130
By chance... here... Mi...

378
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,350
Mi...

379
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,320
You're Mi-in (beautiful woman)!
Even if you're old, you're a beautiful woman!

380
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,160
Unforgettable wrapped lettuce rice lady~

381
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,590
Aigoo.. crazy man. You have a good set of eyes though.

382
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,520
I do have good eyes. I am crazy.

383
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:55,430
Don't just eat plain rice, eat it together with this.

384
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,630
Here, here.

385
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,090
Wow.. this is like honey (tastes really good).

386
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,740
It's taffy. Not honey.

387
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,280
Oh, it's a taste of taffy?

388
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,530
It tastes like taffy!

389
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,940
Aigoo.. hey, hey.
- Is your daughter a customer?

390
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,200
I came all the way here. Why are you telling me not to come?

391
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,030
Run.

392
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,930
I did. Yes, I ate, I ate.

393
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,990
Were you seeing my mother the whole time?

394
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,350
Yes. Is there something wrong with that? Is coming here to have dinner that bad?

395
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,910
Lee Gun,

396
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,230
I know that my mother liked you a lot, right?

397
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:15,130
I like your mother, too.

398
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,370
So stop coming here. I ask you.

399
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,430
Even if you are her daughter,

400
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,550
do I need a permission to meet your mother?

401
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:28,760
My mom, she may seem strong and fierce, but she has a tender heart.

402
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:34,000
If you keep visiting her, she will begin to like you and have a difficult time.

403
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,550
That's a problem between your mother and I.

404
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:43,320
You shouldn't let her like you without taking responsibility.

405
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,230
I hope that you don't do that to my mother (like you did to me).

406
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,420
Kim Mi Young, no, Ellie Kim! Don't go overboard.

407
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,660
Why are you so tense?

408
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,580
I just visited your mother to eat!

409
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,110
I don't have any feelings for you!

410
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,050
Then are you saying that you aren't uncomfortable when you see me?

411
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,700
Yes. Not at all.

412
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,660
That's why you suggested to collaborate with me through the agency?

413
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,540
Yeah. Did I do something wrong? Is that a problem with you?

414
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,040
Why does it have to be me?

415
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,110
There are plenty of other artists.

416
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,950
Are you acting mighty?

417
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:30,970
You are acting all cocky because you are skilled.

418
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,270
They suggested that you are the most suitable for this collaboration.

419
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,570
That's what they said. As the CEO,

420
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,680
I can't let personal emotions to affect my decision.

421
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,850
How can I do that?

422
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:47,720
Look over here, Ellie Kim. Collaboration is business.

423
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,580
Do you really think that?

424
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,240
You don't have any other intentions?

425
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,470
Of course. Not at all.

426
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,940
What if I don't want to do this?

427
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,600
Then that's your decision.

428
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,350
We have nothing to lose just because you don't want to do this.

429
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,820
Okay, then.
- However,

430
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,900
if there isn't a valid reason,

431
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,400
I'll take it as you running away because you're scared.

432
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,600
You coward.

433
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,100
Why would I run away?

434
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,370
What am I scared of?

435
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:57,980
Lee Gun, are you saying that you aren't uncomfortable when you see me?

436
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,270
Yes, not at all.

437
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,720
Not at all...

438
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,900
That's right.

439
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,900
Why would I run away?

440
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,730
I'm above (A). You're below (B).

441
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,110
Again, I'm above (boss), you're below (subordinate).

442
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,190
Why?

443
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:34,350
As soon as you sign this, again I become above

444
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,010
and you become below.

445
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,850
If I say, "let's go, let's go" eat, you have to say, "yes".

446
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,320
If I say, "let's go exercise, you have to say, "yes".

447
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,910
Oh!

448
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,780
CEO, Ellie Kim is going in.

449
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,650
Okay, let her in.

450
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,620
Here. Have a sit.

451
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:12,370
What tea would you prefer?
- It's okay.

452
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:15,550
Anyways, you must be in a hurry.

453
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:20,660
Everything from suggestion to the contract went along so smoothly.

454
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,280
Let's take a look at the contract first.

455
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,800
Oh, contract. I have to see it.

456
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:33,110
Here. I should check.

457
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,150
Here, in the end, you just have to sign.

458
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,910
Where is the pen? Here.

459
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,880
When can you start working?

460
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,970
I wish that we can start as soon as possible.

461
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:10,360
If you send me the files, I will start working on it today.

462
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:16,430
Oh, and I will only contact you through Secretary Tak.

463
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,460
Wait!

464
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,600
Why are you in a hurry?

465
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,700
I have to go work.

466
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,030
You must not know this, but Kim Mi Young, no, Ellie Kim.

467
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:31,130
In a business, after a contract, you have to eat together

468
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,340
and watch movies.

469
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,540
I'm not hungry.

470
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,220
You're not hungry? When I say, "let's go", you have to go.

471
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,630
The moment you sign the contract,

472
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,800
I am above, you are below.

473
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,580
I am above, you are below.

474
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,910
That's how the relationship becomes.

475
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:57,140
You are the one who held out your hand first.

476
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:03,860
Oh, and it will be hard finding someone below like me, CEO Lee Gun.

477
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,550
Our Snail became really cool.

478
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,830
Making me not want to send her away.

479
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:32,570
♬ Can you hear my heart? ♬
♬ My only love has blossomed inside the pain ♬

480
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,560
♬ Love is you, filling up my heart ♬

481
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,640
♬ Like the stars, you’re so bright ♬

482
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,910
♬ I can’t explain with words ♬

483
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:50,910
♬ It’s a fate-like love ♬

484
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:55,230
♬ So I pray that my love ♬

485
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:59,470
♬  Will be told to you ♬

486
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:03,660
♬ A sweet dream’s romance ♬

487
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,960
♬ You’re all I want ♬

488
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:14,170
♬ Your breath ♬

489
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:18,170
♬ That embraces me ♬

490
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:22,300
♬ Is like the silent wind ♬

491
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,560
♬ Love is in my heart ♬

492
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,700
♬ Baby I love you, yes I do ♬

493
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:36,500
♬ Like a lie, I laugh and cry because of you ♬

494
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,060
♬ Just wanna be with you ♬

495
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:45,380
♬ Can you hear my heart? ♬
♬ My only love has blossomed inside the pain ♬

496
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,480
♬ Baby I’m so in love with you ♬

497
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:55,630
♬ Your two eyes are telling me about the love♬

498
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,470
Hello!

499
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:06,170
It's Tak, Tak, Secretarty Tak!

500
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:10,560
I am sending you the files that you requested.

501
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,500
Truthfully, you might be a famous artist to other people,

502
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,630
but to me, once Madam is forever my Madam.

503
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,550
If you need help, call me over.

504
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,840
No, even if you don't need my help, please call me over.

505
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,760
I'm Secretary Tak,

506
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,350
your forever genie,

507
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:36,210
who will forever support you.

508
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,460
Thank you, Secretary Tak.

509
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,720
Let's see.

510
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,560
Mi Young!

511
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,580
Daniel!

512
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,180
I knew it. You weren't answering your phone.

513
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,310
This overworking won't do.

514
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,530
Why?

515
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,320
Be quiet.

516
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,880
What time did you eat last?

517
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,730
Well, a meal...

518
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,980
How many hours did you sleep last night?

519
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,430
I knew it!

520
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,900
If you overwork for a few days, you get a high fever and get dizzy.

521
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,060
You're scary when you get mad at me like this.

522
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,140
I'm being mad so that you get scared.

523
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,670
And don't come back to your workplace this afternoon.

524
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,990
No! I have to work!

525
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:51,880
And while I install that, don't do anything and sit here.

526
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,370
Okay? Sit still.

527
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:01,220
I debated a lot before buying this to celebrate this new office, so you have to use it well.

528
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:05,210
Yes. Thank you.

529
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:11,210
I use a lot of post-its so can you put some in the right pocket there?

530
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,350
Okay.

531
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:23,160
♬ You’re my girl oh my sunshine ♬

532
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,400
♬ Brighter than sunshine ♬

533
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,210
♬ I wanna feel you I wanna be loved ♬

534
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,480
♬ Like a dreamy paradise ♬

535
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,310
♬ A love story like the movies ♬

536
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,620
When did you prepare all this?

537
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,810
You probably didn't have time though.

538
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,510
If I did this with left over time, that means I'm unemployed.

539
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,420
Thinking of my heart and soul that went into making this, you have to eat it all okay?

540
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,090
How is it?

541
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,080
It's spicy and really good.

542
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,030
I thought you were only good at making pasta.

543
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,740
Here. Since it's spicy, have a drink of this.

544
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:07,450
Since you're eating this well, I'm very happy.

545
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,760
Then, can we go back to work?

546
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,000
No.

547
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,470
And this, sitting at a desk is not all.

548
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:20,060
If not the beach, then a mountain or river, you have to get some fresh air.

549
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,870
Right now, I'm not a teacher.
I'm saying this as a man who's truly worried about you.

550
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,950
Please listen to me.

551
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:34,830
Honestly, I don't like that you're collaborating
with Jangin Chemicals but I'm just pretending that I do.

552
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,630
If you don't like it, then say so.

553
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,050
If you tell me to quit, I will do so anytime.

554
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,690
What are you saying?

555
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,060
Instead, you have to do well.

556
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,470
So they'll keep their heads low in front of you.

557
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,880
You know what's going to happen if you can't, right?

558
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,910
Yes. I understand.

559
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,740
Should I try this one?

560
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:09,220
Secretary Tak, the files of pictures you sent me, may I see them in person?

561
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,300
The condition is good.

562
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,050
And you're managing the samples well.

563
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,820
I am very satisfied.

564
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,920
Oh, so that we can launch an impressive marketing,

565
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,570
please spur the development of new ingredients.

566
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:34,160
By collaborating closely with the research center,

567
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,330
I will give you some surprising news soon.

568
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,980
That's great.

569
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:45,390
While you're here, enjoy the fresh air to your heart's content.

570
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,460
I was thinking of doing so anyway.

571
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,170
Then I'll see you at headquarters.

572
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:35,130
♬ You came to me like destiny♬

573
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:41,830
♬  and you took all of my heart. ♬

574
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,230
♬ Do you know how ♬

575
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:52,760
♬  my heart pounds? ♬

576
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:00,550
♬ You make me smile ♬

577
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:06,560
♬ My feelings keep growing ♬

578
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,640
♬ All day, I think about you ♬

579
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,820
♬ I love you, I love you ♬

580
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:27,500
♬ I have a lot of fear and I’m weak ♬

581
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:33,650
♬ So love was always far away ♬

582
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:38,210
♬ Please accept my trembling heart ♬

583
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:44,110
♬ Forever, you’re my love, (you) everything ♬

584
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:54,670
♬ Softly, your low voice is in my ear ♬

585
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,150
What is it?

586
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:05,140
♬  The first person I ever loved, ♬

587
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:11,510
♬  Forever, you are my life. You, everything. ♬

588
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,090
It's cute.

589
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,900
What was that sound?

590
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,200
What was that sound?

591
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,510
Is anybody there?

592
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,860
Is it a scops owl?

593
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,290
Ah, it's not even night.

594
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,680
It was a scops owl a few minutes ago.

595
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:10,600
Maybe it's a cuckoo bird. Oh my god, I have to take a picture.

596
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:17,410
Since it's crying like buckoo buckoo, it must be a male.

597
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,870
Then, like a female... bbee bbee.

598
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:37,010
Wow.. I really became a bird (got messed up).

599
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,950
This is weird, is it because I got older?

600
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,260
I'm sure it was here.

601
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,840
Where did it go?

602
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,560
It probably flew away.

603
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,570
Yeah, say bbee bee for 100 days, see if you can find them.

604
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:25,840
What are you doing here, CEO Lee Gun?

605
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,080
I was working.

606
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,440
You're working?

607
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,820
This is our company's botanical garden.

608
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,890
Isn't it a given for the CEO to come visit here?

609
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:38,240
So why did you hide?

610
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,970
Hiding? Who was hiding? I wasn't hiding.

611
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:43,330
If you weren't hiding, why did you make a bird sound?

612
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:46,850
Ah, well, that sound... By becoming a bird,

613
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:51,600
I was bonding with the nature.
The earth below and the open sky above...

614
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,840
Inhale then exhale..

615
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,390
then inhale then exhale..

616
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:00,860
Be honest. You were following me, right?

617
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:05,770
Following? Me? Following you?

618
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:07,760
Someone above to someone below?

619
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,590
Aren't you the one who followed me?

620
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:13,280
Isn't it strange that someone
who's supposed to be in Seoul suddenly appears here?

621
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,810
Lee Gun, I'm also working right now.

622
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:21,920
I thought I should come here because the natural ingredients for Jangin Chemicals products grow here.

623
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:28,350
Instead of just looking at the picture, I thought I should come and touch them myself then start sketching. So that's why I came

624
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,600
That passionate attitude.

625
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,790
I am very satisfied as the one above.

626
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,410
But be careful,

627
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:41,290
rather than filing a workers compensation claim
after getting stung by bees,

628
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:44,640
while doing unnecessary stuff that you weren't even asked to do.

629
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,740
Also, how can a woman go around
alone like this in a dangerous place?

630
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,050
So, you're trying to get over this topic, like whatever?

631
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:53,980
Shouldn't you apologize first after scaring someone like that?

632
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:57,820
How did you not change at all?

633
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:02,370
I'm more humane than you, who changed a lot.

634
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:04,140
I ask you.

635
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:07,500
Coincidence or not, I hope that we don't see each other outside work.

636
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,830
That's exactly what I want to say.

637
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:13,440
That's a relief. At least we have one thing that we can connect to.

638
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,210
Of course, we can connect to at least one thing, when we are working together.

639
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,640
You always said "dignity, dignity".

640
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,410
I hope that you maintain your dignity, CEO Lee Gun.

641
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:28,360
She had fun, too.

642
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,700
Saying, "bbebeeb".

643
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:36,650
What is this? Is it raining?

644
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,710
This doesn't make any sense!

645
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,880
It's fine. I'm okay.

646
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,500
You don't have time for this. Do you like me?

647
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,960
No! Not at all.

648
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,820
Then it doesn't matter.
- Yes!

649
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,330
Yes, yes. It doesn't matter.

650
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,490
Come inside!
- Yes, yes!

651
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,310
Yes!

652
00:50:57,310 --> 00:50:59,040
Let's go!

653
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:03,500
Let's go that way.

654
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:18,940
♫  To you, I'm like a setting sun  ♫

655
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:25,340
♫  It becomes a wonderful memory  ♫

656
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:32,160
♫  While remembering our bright past, which was valuable ♫

657
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,580
♫ Without a regret, ♫

658
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,860
♫  I hope that it remains like a picture ♫

659
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,550
CEO! Artist!

660
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,680
You guys can't go back down today.

661
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,340
What do you mean by that?

662
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,710
When you came here, you saw the bridge, right?

663
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,410
It's flooded over, the bridge is covered with water.

664
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:22,030
All the paths that lead into the mountain are blocked, too.

665
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:25,490
That makes no sense. How can this be?

666
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,330
Natural disaster!

667
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:30,830
This natural disaster, which we can do nothing about.

668
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:32,880
Nothing can be done.

669
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,180
What do you mean, "nothing can be done"?

670
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,120
We have to do something.

671
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,110
For now, you two can rest here.

672
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:44,250
I will try to find a solution.

673
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:47,210
How can natural disaster be solved by a human?

674
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:50,250
We can't do anything.

675
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,120
Really...

676
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,370
Drip, drip.

677
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,150
Drip, drip.

678
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:05,260
This rain isn't something that will stop soon.

679
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:10,080
Anyway,

680
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,470
you were under the rain for a long time.

681
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:15,070
Are you okay?

682
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:17,510
Yes. I'm fine.

683
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:21,360
Since you might get a cold, wipe yourself meticulously.

684
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,400
Without missing a spot.

685
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:33,780
Ellie Kim, our company's fortune,

686
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,370
and I'm the above guy who hired you.

687
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:41,150
So, in terms of responsibility, and taking care of my employee.

688
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,020
Well, something like that.

689
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,660
Yes,

690
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:49,810
I will take care of myself well as the below person, so don't worry.

691
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,850
This music...

692
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,970
How is it?

693
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,080
What do you mean, music?

694
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,150
The sound of rain falling.

695
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,380
The sound of rain falling is music.

696
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,870
Like rain, like music.

697
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:45,870
That isn't bad.

698
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:48,640
When I was young,

699
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,170
I really liked the sound of rain.

700
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:55,470
When it rains at night,

701
00:54:55,470 --> 00:55:00,110
I would close my eyes, make a wish,

702
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:03,950
listen to the sound of rain,

703
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:06,340
and fall asleep.

704
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,090
Listen well.

705
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:22,500
Doesn't it sound like pork cooking in a grill?

706
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,440
Aren't you hungry?

707
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,010
I'm not hungry.

708
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:41,280
Your habit that you have when you are three goes on till you are eighty years old. You still didn't fix that habit.

709
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,640
You didn't fix it...

710
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,270
It's not me.

711
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:52,700
I'm sorry.

712
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,900
I was wondering why you aren't like that.

713
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:05,830
If you are hungry, you should eat something.

714
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:10,840
Dragon was bragging that he ate

715
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,260
ramen with pollack's eyes.

716
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:18,360
The bum, who didn't eat something like that yet,
while saying, "I should just die, die,"

717
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,360
is barely living.

718
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,300
There was a lunch box.

719
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,070
Lunch box?

720
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:28,160
Lunch box with faces.

721
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,200
Tada!

722
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:35,370
You really made all this?

723
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:38,330
Oh yeah! Lunch box with faces!

724
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:41,600
Lunch box with faces...

725
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,740
I want to eat that. It was delicious.

726
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,770
Anyways, Mi Young.

727
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,040
Just be Mi Young today! It's raining.

728
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,730
I don't know. I'm going to call you Mi Young.

729
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:03,750
The sound of rain differs on how you listen.

730
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,990
When rain falls on the rooftop,

731
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,300
it makes a sharp sound.

732
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:14,870
"Tootoo dak, toodak, todak".

733
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:19,630
"Todak, todak".

734
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:24,520
"It's okay, it's okay."

735
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:29,000
"It's not you fault."

736
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,070
"It's okay now."

737
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:35,650
It sounds like somebody is

738
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:39,940
comforting you, doesn't it?

739
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:48,420
I don't know.

740
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:52,860
I don't really know what you mean.

741
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,780
I...

742
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:00,390
I have to go now.

743
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:04,250
What's wrong? Are you okay?

744
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,960
Yes.

745
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,990
I'm okay.

746
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:16,610
Did you not understand the director? They are blocking the roads!

747
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:19,050
I can probably go.

748
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,930
You don't even know the road very well! It's dangerous.

749
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:28,890
No, I will go.

750
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:31,670
Why aren't you listening to me?

751
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:38,450
Hold on.
- Let go!

752
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,510
Why are you so hot?

753
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:48,420
Don't pay attention to me.

754
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,770
I can go alone.

755
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,580
What nonsense are you speaking?

756
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,880
How are you going to leave in this state?

757
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:57,080
I really don't want

758
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:00,500
you to

759
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,200
worry about me.

760
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:07,820
We don't have any relationship.

761
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,510
Let go of tihs.

762
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:18,540
♫  Goodbye, my love  ♫

763

♬ My heart already knew ♬

764

765

You foolish woman.

♬ Oh you, I can’t have you, I can’t touch you ♬
