1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,510
You worrying about me...

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,430
I would really like to decline it now.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,970
We no longer have any relationship.

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,570
Please let this go.

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,130
♬ My tears remember ♬

00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:33,890
♬ It fills up your seat again ♬

00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:41,210
♬ I try erasing but I can’t erase you ♬

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:49,610
♬ You’ve become my everything ♬

9
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,450
You foolish woman.

10
00:00:51,450 --> 00:01:00,750
♬ Oh you, I can’t see you, I can’t hear you ♬

11
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,460
♬ But I’m okay.
Goodbyes are sad, ♬

♬ my heart aches.

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,740
♬ can smile, ♬

Mi Young. Mi Young!
♬ then I… ♬

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:29,440
♬ I will miss you the more I erase you ♬

00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,170
♬ I will shed more tears than today ♬

17

♬ Like fate, I won’t ever have anyone like you ♬

00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,640
♬ Good bye my love ♬

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,250
Dog Poopie...

20
00:01:51,250 --> 00:02:00,710
♬ My heart already knew
This feeling of loneliness that’s about ♬

21
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:06,020
Why are you still hurting? You should stop that.

22
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,380
Then I can stop as well.

23
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:19,590
♬ You’ve become my heart
Oh you, ♬

24

♬ But I’m okay
Endless pain, ♬

26
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,610
♬  tears shed again
But if you are ♬

27
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,250
Did something happen at the arboretum?

28
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:48,240
♬ if you can smile, then I… ♬

29
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:55,110

32
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:17,790

I’ll wait,♬

33
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:24,660
♬ it’s only a momentary goodbye ♬

34
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,020
♬ Good bye, my love ♬

35
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,890
Look here.

36
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,290
Lee Gun.

37
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,620
Gun.

38
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,670
I'll go down first.

39
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,100
Thank you for for yesterday.

40
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,210
Mi Young, what happened?

41
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,740
Do you know how worried I was all night?

42
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,610
Because the roads were blocked due to rain, I was at the cottage in the arboretum.

43
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,350
I wasn't feeling too well so I went to sleep early, and I didn't even know you called.

44
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,880
You're not feeling well? Where? Are you okay now?

45
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,400
Yes, I am fine.

46
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,110
As long you came back without any troubles, it's fine.

47
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,840
I should escort you when you work from now on.

48
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,670
So that you can work comfortably.

49
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,010
Because you are not in your best condition, your face looks gaunt.

50
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,700
Just sit here and wait a bit. I'll bring you some warm coffee and a sandwich.

51
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,570
You haven't eaten breakfast yet, right?
-Yes.

52
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,460
No more. It shouldn't go on anymore.

53
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,320
CEO! CE-

54
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,400
What's wrong now? Why, why, why? What's wrong, huh?

55
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,600
CEO-

56
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,790
Why are you crying? Why, why? Is there something wrong?

57
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,070
Why? Don't be hurt, CEO. Why?

58
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,710
This is because of you, because of you, all because of you!

59
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,550
What did I do?
-Just what have you been doing this past day?

60
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,960
Have I made another mistake?
-Our company was made a long time ago.

61
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,220
Why isn't there a system to oversee the artists!

62
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,010
Artists...

63
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,680
Are you talking about Ellie Kim, who is working on the collaboration, if you are talking about "artists"?

64
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,900
Not just that artist, Ellie Kim, but all of the artists we've worked with!

65
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,070
All of the artists we will work with in the future!

66
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,810
The system for the artists who work for our company,
it's an absolute mess, mess, mess!

67
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,470
Ah, CE-
CE-

68
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,390
I know.

69
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,340
So in conclusion, pay more attention to Ellie Kim,
that's what you mean!

70
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,810
You really... I got it.

71
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,030
Then perhaps, at the arboretum, with Ellie Kim...

72
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,040
That's it, isn't it? Did something happen with her?

73
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,270
Anyway, our company should

74
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,730
get everything we can from that frail Ellie Kim.

75
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,920
But I can't trust you.
- No. Trust me one more time.

76
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,950
Fine. Then I'll give you a really difficult order.

77
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,820
Come here.

78
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,920
Find artist Ellie Kim's studio address for me.

79
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,020
Yes, sir.

80
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,840
Salute! Sgt. Tak Goo Jang (a name, also means a table tennis lounge)!

81
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,070
Who's Tak Goo Jang?!
- I said it wrong, that's my brother. Sorry.

82
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,790
Just leave.

83
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,460
♪ It feels like you’re mine, but you're not and... ♪

84
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,280
Anyways, did she only eat baguettes in Paris for three years?

85
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,080
Why is she so weak?

86
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,650
Your strength is the most important thing when you work.

87
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:26,520
Let's buy some new shoes, and starting tomorrow morning, let's exercise together.

88
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,000
Now, let's see, for our Mi Young...

89
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,340
I think this would look good.

90
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,560
Your size is 240, right?
*korean shoe size 240: equivalent to US size 7

91
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,910
Yes. That's right. How did you know?

92
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:45,430
Did you think that as a designer I wouldn't even be able to figure that out?

93
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,410
What are you going to choose?

94
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,230
Me? Hmm... For me..

95
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,250
I think I like these. Aren't these nice?

96
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,860
Let's see...
- I'll do it.

97
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,660
Just stay still.

98
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,210
I will tie them very well, make it look cool.

99
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,680
Finished!
- Thanks.

100
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,770
So this is Snail's shelter.

101
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,470
I didn't bring Omega-3.

102
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,170
I will give it to her later, then.

103
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:10,000
Snail brought that swallow (gigolo) with her. If I break that swallow's legs,

104
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,080
it will come back to Snail, holding a seed, right? (based on Korean folktale, Heungbu and Nolbu)

105
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,480
Oh! They're going in together. They're going in together! Aissh.

106
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,810
Noona! Over here.

107
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,950
Hello, Mother.

108
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,280
Isn't this lady Mi Young's friend, who came to our house? That couple manager.
-That's right.

109
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,870
I am a couple manager,

110
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,640
and my household...
- Do you want to introduce someone to us?

111
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,790
No, that's not it...

112
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,940
The woman that I want to introduce to you...
- So...

113
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,340
When is the girl that Yong is dating coming?

114
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,530
Mother.

115
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,470
Why are you calling me "Mother"? We only met a couple of times.

116
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,180
Mother...
- Why are you saying that so pitifully?

117
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,050
Actually, the woman I'm dating is here.

118
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,900
Oh my! She's here?! Where?

119
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,590
Mom, I'm dating this noona.

120
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,350
What? What kind of... It can't be her.

121
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,950
Mother.

122
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,750
Do you guys see me grabbing the back of my neck?

123
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,350
I can't agree to this!

124
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,850
Before dirt goes into my eyes!
- Mom.

125
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,660
Honestly, what's the whole point of me seeing a woman that is rich and successful?

126
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,660
They will look down on us because you are a mistress!

127
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,350
We just need to have more children than Hyungnim.

128
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,950
It does seem like she won't lose to anyone in doing that, but...

129
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,710
Even if I die, you can't do it. I'm against this marriage till the end!

130
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,840
Yes, yes. It's been crazy for me recently.

131
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,450
For this biennale, although the overall theme is important,

132
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,890
I want for it to have a detailed color theme as well.

133
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,840
So that we can make a visual appeal to the visitors more easily.

134
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,610
Let's think about it more then. Okay.

135
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,950
If you decide, I can do anything for you!

136
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,150
Just give up on being a teacher and start ballet.

137
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,150
I told you that I'm well. I like teaching students, and I'm perfectly happy now.

138
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:48,210
Do you call that happiness when you are fine, only on the outside? You are rotting on the inside!

139
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,730
If you are not going to do ballet, just marry CEO Lee Gun!

140
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,120
Please don't go see Gun anymore. If you do...

141
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,760
then I'm really going to die.

142
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,340
Die? Is that something to say to the mother who raised you?

143
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,950
Excuse me.

144
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,110
If you don't have any business with me, just leave.

145
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,840
That's not it.
- Please, I ask you. Just leave.

146
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,150
I can only go in after inserting the card, once you move out of the way.

147
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,300
Verification complete

148
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,340
You feel thirsty, don't you?

149
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,780
Do you want some ice cream?

150
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,020
I'm so tired. This is really far.

151
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,850
What flavor do you like?

152
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,520
I like.. this.

153
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,150
I bought that for me.

154
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,820
But you seem to have a bad relationship with your mother.

155
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,480
She was really mad today, and she slapped you last time.

156
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,880
It's because I'm disappointing her.

157
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,170
My mother has lived with the single goal of making me into a prima ballerina.

158
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,640
But I shattered that dream.

159
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,710
But you are actually a nicer daughter than you look.

160
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,980
You even understand such a scary mother.

161
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,630
She isn't wrong. If I'd done what she asked me to do,

162
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,260
I could have lived better.

163
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,000
Do you still meet CEO Lee Gun?

164
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,100
I do meet him, but

165
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,200
that's it between us.

166
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,920
That person will not come back to me,

167
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,220
and I can't venture closer to him.

168
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,810
What do you mean you can't venture closer to him? If you guys are under the same sky, you can.

169
00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:00,240
It's probably because I committed many wrongdoings to them.

170
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,860
"Them"? Who are those people?

171
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:10,590
I never knew that you were such a tacky person
who is interested in somebody else's dating history.

172
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,910
I'll eat this ice cream well.

173
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,490
It's no longer somebody else's dating history that has no relation to me.

174
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,310
I proposed to Kim Mi Young.

175
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,600
Doesn't that mean that I have the right to be curious?

176
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,170
I don't have any more work today.

177
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,460
Right. We have to work well! We have to call Ellie Kim, "Madam"!

178
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,980
Oh! CEO!

179
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,450
You two... What is this?

180
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,690
These are the files that the artist requested.

181
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,540
Because she is very strict about researching beforehand,

182
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,370
she needs a lot of files.

183
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,370
We are moving this to the artist's workshop.

184
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,180
Wait a moment!
- We're busy! Why?

185
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,000
The artist wanted us to deliver it to us quickly!

186
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,240
Why are you two leaking confidential documents to the outside?

187
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,040
If that person wants to see it, she should come here and see it for herself.

188
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,630
I will put you two in jail for leaking confidential documents,

189
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,040
if you guys carry this outside.

190
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,370
You guys can do whatever you want.

191
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,980
These are all confidential documents, you say?

192
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,690
Well, they could look like normal files,

193
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,220
but there are enormous secrets hidden.

194
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:47,210
So I have no other choice but to be here
to avoid confidential information from leaking outside.

195
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,610
So you shouldn't think about anything or pay attention

196
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,950
and work hard.
- I will watch over you

197
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,450
quietly because I have no other choice.

198
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,920
Wait a moment.

199
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,690
And if you are tired while working,

200
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,060
or if you are having a hard time and your eyes are getting tired,

201
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,560
eat these things, to prevent loss for our company.

202
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,620
This is the first step. This is the second step.

203
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,060
Lastly, this is the third step! Get started.

204
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,590
Let's see...

205
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,630
Excuse me.

206
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,660
Yes?

207
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,130
I won't leak the information, so can you leave?

208
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,960
You are interfering with my work.

209
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,900
If you want, I can sign on the contract.

210
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,670
If I'm bothering you,

211
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,460
I will leave.

212
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,990
My leg must have fallen asleep!

213
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,950
Even if it fell asleep, I should leave because I'm bothering you.

214
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,520
Then...

215
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,040
I should start.

216
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,720
Jangin?

217
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,920
Chemicals?

218
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,630
Why did it have to be Jangin Chemicals out of all companies?

219
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,650
Who cares where she works as long as she does a good job.

220
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:47,960
Still, what happens if CEO Lee and Mi Young start liking each other again?

221
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,270
In my opinion, I am against this collaboration.

222
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,900
I think...

223
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,400
the handsome Daniel is better.

224
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,390
I approve this collaboration. I prefer Secretary Tak's boss, CEO Lee Gun.

225
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,190
Daniel is better.
- Lee Gun.

226
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,150
Daniel!
- Lee Gun.
- Daniel!

227
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,430
Be quiet! Mi Young will figure it out on her own.

228
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:14,420
Son-in-law Choi and President Park, why don't you two clean the front of the store?

229
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,010
Hamo hamo.

230
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,800
But Mother-in-law,

231
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,140
there is one thing that upsets me.

232
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,440
What are you talking about all a sudden?

233
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,840
Why is it that you only call me Son-in-law Choi

234
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,490
and never call me by my real name?

235
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:36,190
You call someone else by his name, as if he was your own son.

236
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,160
What a silly thing to be upset about.

237
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,070
Okay, then.

238
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,540
Ko Bong. Choi Ko Bong.

239
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,620
Ko Bong, why don't you do some cleaning, okay?

240
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,530
Yes, Mother.

241
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,120
Mother!

242
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,950
Ahjumma since we're talking about it,

243
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,950
call me by my name just once as well.

244
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,990
Your name is Sa Jang (president), what else would I call you?

245
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,500
Hamo hamo.

246
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,100
Both Managing Director Yoo Sang Moo (means
managing director) and President Park Sa Jang,

247
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,970
it's a little better for me because I was destined to become a president.

248
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:19,020
Hey, Ko Bong, wait for President Park Sa Jang!

249
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,750
MOTHER!

250
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,250
KO BONG!

251
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,540
SA JANG!
- MY NAME IS SA JANG!

252
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,580
This guy says he'll help prepare for tomorrow morning, but all he does is eat instead of helping out.

253
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,290
SA JANG!
- MOTHER!

254
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:37,710
Are they interested in me?

255
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,220
Is anyone here?

256
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,100
This is fascinating.

257
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,770
Make sure it goes straight down without any stops.

258
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,790
And don't forget to turn on the lights in the lobby as soon as she arrives on the first floor.

259
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,640
I understand.

260
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,280
Elevator No. 2 will pass through all floors.

261
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,770
Everyone on the first floor lobby, standby.

262
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:11,120
She's getting off soon. The lights, standby.

263
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,310
Standby.

264
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:16,570
Three, two, one. Go!

265
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,890
Miss Artist.

266
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,150
The taxi is ready.

267
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,990
I'm fine.
- It's a little late,

268
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,000
please take it.

269
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,920
Okay.

270
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,030
Thank you. It's okay, I can do it.

271
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,740
Thank you.

272
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,880
You worked hard, Artist Kim Mi Young.

273
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,480
Go home safely.

274
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,170
So you're saying the reason why Gun was working overnight yesterday and today

275
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,250
was because of Mi Young?

276
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:22,380
Yes. The CEO and the former madame have been enjoying their time together these few days.

277
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,580
Ah~ So it's a date that I've been waiting for!

278
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,980
So, they're busy

279
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,480
going on lovely dates together, right?

280
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,790
It would be great if that were true, Grandma. But it's not really going anywhere.

281
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,530
The collaboration will end soon and they won't have anymore reason to see each other. What should we do?

282
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,140
But you are sure

283
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,520
that they still have feelings for each other, right?

284
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,730
Well, we are hundred percent, no, two hundred percent sure of his feelings.

285
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,720
But as for the madame, we are not quite sure yet.

286
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,330
So you've reviewed all these already?

287
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,860
Yes, as you can see.

288
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,590
Did you pay attention to detail or do things half way?

289
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,870
Our company doesn't allow you doing things this way, at all!

290
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:18,160
I'd rather do nothing than working that way.

291
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,470
I'll have everything done today before going home and

292
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,100
I'll send you the finished designs in 2 or 3 days.

293
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
Are you saying,

294
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,900
you'll be done with your research as of today?

295
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,680
I will do my best to the very end,

296
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,740
so don't worry.

297
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,840
Aigoo, it's already very late.

298
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:55,300
He has never not come this late even with his busy work.

299
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,950
Aigoo there must be something wrong.

300
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:06,680
Surprise!
- You scared me, you rascal.

301
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,100
La la la la,

302
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,290
Ssambap lady, you've been waiting for me, right?
*ssambap: lettuce wrap with rice

303
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,010
Am I right, or am I wrong?

304
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:23,050
You thought you were going crazy because you missed me right, ssambap lady?

305
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,240
Yeah, right.

306
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,640
Aigoo, you fool. Just take a seat.

307
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,870
I was right, wasn't I?

308
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:35,660
Women, no matter the age, they're weak when it comes to push and pull.

309
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,720
Pull and push. Push and pull.

310
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,780
If you're going to talk nonsense without eating, just go already.

311
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,550
I don't have time to joke with you.

312
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:48,020
I got it. Today, I'll have take out.

313
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,430
What? Do what?

314
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,120
I said take out, take out.

315
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,120
Why take out all a sudden?

316
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,850
Who are you going to eat it with?
-There's someone.

317
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,940
There's another lady who plays with my feelings, like you, ssambap lady. Mata Hari.

318
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,300
There's a woman like Mata Hari.

319
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,610
What are you talking about?

320
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:16,650
I heard they're doing some collabo or something like that.

321
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,550
Is he meeting Mi Young again?

322
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:47,170
♬ When then twinkling stars color ♬

323
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:53,670
♬ in the dark night sky ♬

324
00:28:53,670 --> 00:29:00,070
♬ I draw out the one star in my heart, ♬

325
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:06,270
♬ the hidden you ♬

326
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:13,760
♬ I don’t know why
The more I erase you with tears ♬

327
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,270
♬ The clearer you get ♬

328
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:23,980
Object. Object.

329
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,670
Object!

330
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:32,170
I'm an object! I'm an object!

331
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:38,870
♬ My everything, my destiny ♬

332
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:45,140
♬ My heart keeps going to you ♬

333
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:51,790
♬ When I open my eyes, let me hear it ♬

334
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:59,990
♬ Let me hear you saying I love you
Sweet melody ♬

335
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:05,080
Kim Mi Young, what are you doing? Wake up.

336
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,210
What is this?

337
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,560
Night! Night! Call!

338
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,920
Late night snacks. Let's eat some.

339
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,350
I will...do it.

340
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,920
There.

341
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,870
Isn't this from my Mom's restaurant?

342
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:34,020
That's the only anchovy wrap restaurant I know.

343
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,670
Is what I'm saying funny to you?

344
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,040
I already asked you to not meet my Mom, right?

345
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,380
Well, there's no law saying that I should do what you asked me to do.

346
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,660
That always joking attitude is the problem.

347
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:53,520
You don't usually think about what another person thinks
and do what you want to do.

348
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,760
Have you even tried to at least listen
to my favor when I asked you?

349
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,540
Did you see it?

350
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,020
Did you see me not trying?

351
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,850
Someone who's says he tried,

352
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,330
even after knowing how sincerely I asked the favor,

353
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,940
you put anchovy wraps as a late snack?

354
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,520
Look here, Ellie Kim.

355
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,600
The first anchovy wrap I ate was in Yeoul-do at your mother's place.

356
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,480
I grew accustomed to that strange spicy taste.

357
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,970
I still can't get over that taste!

358
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,330
Why are you only doing this to me?
Why am I the only one that has to cut it off?

359
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,840
The mom that's so important to you

360
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,110
and the mom you want to protect...
She's become my mom!

361
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,970
What do you want me to do now
when you're telling me that you're taking my mother away?

362
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,740
What do you want me to do?

363
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:46,600
Mother~ Please give me some rice wraps~

364
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,800
From now on, I will be a Mom to you.

365
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,480
Are you saying you'll be my mom?

366
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,670
Hey! Mom is going!

367
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,770
Just eat it all alone.

368
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,960
I don't feel like eating.

369
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,300
So flippant.

370
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,360
You told me I don't listen to your requests,

371
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,150
but you're ignoring someone's sincerity.
Come to think of it, you're also selfish.

372
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,030
Fine. I will eat all of this by myself until my stomach explodes.

373
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,770
Are you happy now?

374
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,790
What's up with the taste!

375
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:37,010
Same, same! They're always the same!

376
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,940
Why are you throwing a temper tantrum towards the anchovy?

377
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,960
You've been eating it well until now.

378
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,240
This ssambap lady!

379
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,660
She must've put a drug in here. She put drugs in them!

380
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,720
Quiet. It's too quiet!

381
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,190
Be quiet! I'll have to listen to some music.

382
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,050
♬ Gypsy gypsy gypsy, gypsy lady ♬

383
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:25,350
♬ Endlessly wandering around ♬

384
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:30,440
♬ Following the stars at night, and the flowers at day ♬

385
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,900
♬ Lonely gypsy lady ♬

386
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,950
This... This... This...

387
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,780
Unnie Young Ja, what are you doing?

388
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,970
It's because of the painting.

389
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,680
When should we schedule to meet again?

390
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,660
Hello?

391
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,110
Unnie Young Ja?

392
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,420
Ellie...

393
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,530
I'm very busy right now.

394
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,920
Ah, yes, Unnie.

395
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,090
But you called me first...

396
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,270
Oh! CEO!

397
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,320
Hello?

398
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,790
Hello? Unnie Young Ja?

399
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:53,700
I will call you later.

400
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:59,410
CEO, how did you end up like this?

401
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,180
That's enough. Forget it.

402
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,730
Forget it.

403
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,970
His wound must be so big

404
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,320
now he's going around making woman's voices.

405
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,460
Yes, Daniel?

406
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,090
It will end soon.

407
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,380
That's right. Today is the last day to do the research.

408
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,180
Of course, it would be good if you come pick me up.

409
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,010
Ok.

410
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,340
Who was that?

411
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:43,360
Daniel? D. Pitt! D. Pitt! It's Daniel, right?

412
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,390
Wow! That's awesome.

413
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:53,200
It's totally unbelievable.

414
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,920
Calling a man to the office. Pulling him in.

415
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,790
Why do you say it like that?

416
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:10,920
Also that person isn't someone that you can speak badly of.

417
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,020
To me, he's a very good person who I'm very grateful to.

418
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,850
Oh, I envy you.

419
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:23,400
It must be nice having someone nice beside you.

420
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:28,210
Eat. You shouldn't be wasteful.

421
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,440
"Ballerina Kim Mi Na, New York performance ends in great success"

422
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,540
"Artist from Paris, Ellie Kim, is doing her first collaboration with Korea's JangIn Chemicals"

423
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,710
Artist! I'm here.

424
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,380
You're here?

425
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,880
Yes.

426
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,690
I asked for one of your drawings that was in Paris.

427
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:37,220
For some reason, I thought you wouldn't forget your original intentions if you saw this painting. But it took awhile to get here

428
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,430
It's a parcel filled with my mentor's profound meaning.

429
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,380
Thank you.

430
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,400
Let's see.

431
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,500
Open it.

432
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,230
I think something amazing could come out of this if we make a few minor adjustments.

433
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:04,240
It seems like you're getting much inspiration lately, Artist Ellie Kim.

434
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:30,800
This was one of your first drawings. You remember, right?

435
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:36,470
I feel like this one drawing brings this whole studio to life.

436
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:39,010
I feel like you're going back to your basics.

437
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,930
Hang it where you like.

438
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,230
Should I?

439
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,830
Dog Poopie,

440
00:38:54,870 --> 00:39:00,560
Dad is now ready to completely let go of Mom.

441
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:26,090
What are you doing, Ellie?

442
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,280
Unnie Young Ja.

443
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,950
I stopped for a bit while working.

444
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,030
Is something wrong?

445
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,430
Is it not working well?

446
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,800
Yes.

447
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,480
It's a bit like that.

448
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,420
I have to go back to the basics, but it's not easy.

449
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:52,240
Why do you sound so weak when you're doing things well?

450
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,320
More than anything, I wanted to do well on this project.

451
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,140
It's not going well.

452
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,950
I feel as if I've fallen in a slump.

453
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,390
Miss Ellie, may

454
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,370
I just say one thing?

455
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,940
Of course.

456
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,070
You're my number one fan club member, Unni.

457
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:35,230
I've never met you but

458
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,700
what I can feel from you so far is...

459
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,520
this friend must be like a young girl.

460
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,340
That's what I feel.

461
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:49,220
I do often hear that I look young for my age but not to that degree.

462
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,490
I'm already quite old.

463
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,890
What do you think about forgetting that "age" for today?

464
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,220
How?

465
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:03,180
When I exchange conversation with you,

466
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:10,180
that young age when I used to run with my friends, share friendship,

467
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,720
I think of that time.

468
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,470
As if I've gone back to being a young girl.

469
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:23,160
"In every woman's heart, there lives a young girl,"

470
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,040
is that what you're saying.

471
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,780
That's a nice expression.

472
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,320
I feel something coming.

473
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:36,340
There was a girl I used to know.

474
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:41,350
That girl wore ugly glasses

475
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:47,120
and thought of herself as the ugly duckling.

476
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

477
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,350
I'm sorry.

478
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,680
Kim Mi Young.
- Yes!

479
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,980
Make me a copy.
- A cup of coffee.

480
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,520
Just as your nickname suggests, you're just a post-it girl."

481
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:05,110
Used when it's good and thrown away after it's been used.

482
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,180
Wear them already.

483
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,870
At the time, in my eyes,

484
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:16,020
she was so very beautiful.

485
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,490
I'm Kim Mi Young.

486
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:26,110
In her heart the widest sea and the brightest star.

487
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,980
She was a girl with those beautiful qualities.

488
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,190
Women

489
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:37,360
want to change into something different from themselves on the outside, but

490
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,410
the most lovable and beautiful moment is

491
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,850
when they are little girls

492
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,100
who are filled with dreams.

493
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,520
Thanks you, Young Ja Unni.

494
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,520
I feel as if something is coming.

495
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,460
Do you?

496
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,960
Be strong, Ellie.

497
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,890
Fighting!

498
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:20,340
CEO, CEO, CEO, CEO

499
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,070
CEO.

500
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,910
What is this now? Finally,

501
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:28,530
Ellie Kim's advertisement image has been completed!

502
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:32,550
Done. It's done.

503
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,980
Is that so?

504
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,740
So. So. So, saying

505
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,110
"Our CEO wants to see you and speak to you in person"...

506
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:45,270
Come in. Come In. I told her to come in. I did well, didn't I?

507
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,480
I did well.

508
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,010
It's been a while, Tak. Tak.

509
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,360
This is an added bonus!

510
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,720
When is she coming?
-Now.
-Now?

511
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,080
Do I tell her to come in now?
-Now, hurry hurry, hurry.

512
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,030
Hurry, hurry.

513
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:05,800
Of course, then I should see her.

514
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:10,960
You're here.
-You came already?!!

515
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,800
Are you waiting for someone?

516
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,160
I have a business meeting.

517
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,290
I snuck out to have lunch with you today.

518
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,460
Oh...

519
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,180
Aigoo...

520
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,990
Today is rather difficult.

521
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:36,160
I'm sorry but today is a little..... What should I do?

522
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:00,590
I took some of your time.

523
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:02,760
No.

524
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,050
I was wondering what I should do since I was early for the meeting.

525
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:08,490
You're talking about a meeting with Gun?

526
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,330
Yes.

527
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:13,260
I heard that you were doing a collaboration with Jangin Chemicals.

528
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,760
I'll speak frankly.

529
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,160
It really bothered me that you were working together.

530
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,150
I would have felt the same from your point of view.

531
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,820
Our work is coming to an end so

532
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,990
there won't be any reason to concern yourself.

533
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,350
Is that so?

534
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:35,010
We only met for work. There aren't any feelings between us.

535
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:38,640
Thank you for understanding.

536
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:17,950
I had something funny happen earlier.

537
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,860
It's not bad.

538
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:29,000
I'll have our advertisement team go with this draft.

539
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,770
That's a relief that you like it.

540
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:35,020
Now our work has really come to an end.

541
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,290
Once the last advertisement draft is confirmed,

542
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,560
it's really the end.

543
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,470
Yes.

544
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,840
It's the end.

545
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,560
Thank you for being good to me during this time.

546
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,910
During this time,

547
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:10,870
you really endured a lot,

548
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,320
Artist Ellie Kim.

549
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,730
Things that make a girl's heart flutter.

550
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:31,510
A butterfly that flies into the house.

551
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,370
A stylish pair of shoes you discovered by accident.

552
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:39,260
A sudden rain shower.

553
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,520
Beautiful scent of flowers.
CEO, isn't it amazing?

554
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,610
Within every women's hearts

555
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,720
lives a girl.

556
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:53,660
Jang In Chemicals.
- "In every woman's heart lives a girl,"

557
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,090
is that what you mean?

558
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:59,420
That's a nice expression.

559
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,180
Jang In Chemicals
Daeng Gi Meo Ri
(Lock of Hair)

560
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:27,480
That was Jang In Chemicals and Ellie Kim's first collaboration. Please give a round of applause!

561
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:44,750
I feel that we've found the marketing point to grab the hearts of our woman consumers.

562
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,980
And lastly, Mr. CEO.

563
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,350
Please say a word.

564
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:50,620
Please.

565
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,930
It's CEO Lee Gun.

566
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,050
Our Jang In Chemicals will continue

567
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:17,860
our work with many different artists. That is our plan.

568
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,520
With Ellie Kim

569
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,480
we were able to happily and safely work together,

570
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,290
so I feel very fortunate.

571
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,560
Good work everyone.

572
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:45,250
You're amazing.

573
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,610
What do you like best?

574
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,030
She's quite a treasure.

575
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,920
Our company's treasure.

576
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:57,540
It was really good!
- Where did you get those good ideas?

577
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,270
There's so many!

578
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:07,430
♫  You, who just seemed like a coincidence. ♫

579
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:15,090
♫  In case you find about my heart,  ♫

580
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:17,370
♫  From far away,  ♫
Artist Ellie Kim!

581
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:22,580
♫  I look at you  ♫

582
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:31,450
It's really all done now.

583
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:38,860
For the last time, I want to treat you to a meal.

584
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:42,560
We're supposed to meet at my mother's restaurant.

585
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,210
It's Mi Ja's birthday, too.

586
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:48,050
Oh, it's sister-in-law's birthday...

587
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:54,180
It's your sister's birthday.

588
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,570
Is her child growing up well? Is he healthy?

589
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:00,080
Dae Chul?
- Yes, Dae Chul.

590
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:05,200
He is growing up well. He is healthy and strong.

591
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,270
Dae Chul won't know my face, right?

592
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,450
Anyways, that's good. Everything is well.

593
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:20,740
Our collaboration ended well.

594
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:24,250
And Dae Chul grew up healthily.

595
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:28,580
I'm happy that many happy events are occurring at the same time.

596
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:34,510
♫  You and my distance  ♫

597
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:39,900
♫  Feels awkward and far  ♫

598
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,100
Then, I'll leave now.

599
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:50,210
♬ I purposely pass by you ♬

600
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,980

602

603
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:04,750
♬ I think of you ♬

00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,510
I really enjoyed it.

♬ When I hold out my hand ♬

606

612
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,310
This is really the end.
♬ My heart wants you ♬

613
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:58,360
Be well, Gun
♬  You, who is like destiny ♬

614
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:08,460
♬ I love you ♬

615
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:14,150
Dog Poopie, I asked your mother if we could eat together,

616
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:17,130
and got rejected!

617
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:20,460
But your mother was really cool today.

618
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:25,510
She was totally "ding ding hao"! Ding hao!

619
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,690
Here, France...

620
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:41,860
France is really far away. It's right here.

621
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,440
Let's go.

622
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:53,430
I can't send your mother away alone, Dog Poopie.

623
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,750
Our Dog Poopie

624
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,120
should go with her.

625
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,080
Instead of Daddy. Okay?

626
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,220
I didn't bring it...

627
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,250
I'm sorry, but can you turn around?

628
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,410
Okay.

629
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:40,570
Today, on my birthday, something good must have happened to Mi Young.

630
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,570
That's why he is a piece of luck!

631
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,080
I know, right! Aren't I a piece of luck?

632
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,300
Not you! Our Dae Chul!

633
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,900
After we had Dae Chul, everything is working out well.

634
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,310
Hamo, hamo. Dae Chul is a piece of luck,

635
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:57,460
and his father, who gave birth to Dae Chul, is the father of the piece of luck.

636
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,180
That's right!

637
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,220
If somebody else sees, they will think that you two are the one that gave birth to him.

638
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,370
What are you saying?

639
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,350
They are basically a couple.

640
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,730
Unni! What are you saying?

641
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,550
A joke can become real.

642
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:13,630
That is nonsense. You are jealous about the randomest things.

643
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:17,590
Hamo, hamo! It's just an innocent friendship.

644
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:21,180
But now that I see it, you guys look similar.

645
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,340
Do we look good with each other?

646
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:26,420
Is that right?
- No, with over here.

647
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,910
Yes, Mi Young.

648
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:35,620
Yes, I'm with your family. Where are you?

649
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,140
What should I do? I'm going to be a little late.

650
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,390
I left the presents.

651
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:41,830
Please wait just a little longer.

652
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:44,370
Of course. I'll wait. Come slowly.

653
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:46,370
Okay.

654
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:50,130
Why?
- Mi Young said that she'll be a little late.

655
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:54,530
Aigoo, Dae Chul, you are going to be so hungry!

656
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:21,730
This is the candy that grants you love.

657
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:25,600
I believe it when people say if you confess with this candy, you will succeed (in love).

658
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,290
No, I want to believe them.

659
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:35,640
You said that people that like sweet things want to be happy, right?

660
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:40,930
If there's even a little happiness left for me,

661
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:44,560
I will give you everything.

662
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,130
You have to become happy.

663
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:55,930
♬ You’ve become my everything ♬

664
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:00,510
♬ Oh you, ♬
What are you doing right now?

665
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:06,810
♬  Even if I can’t see you, ♬

666
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:12,960
♬ But I’m okay. Even if goodbyes are sad,♬

667
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:18,080
Lee Gun, what are you doing over here?
♬ Even if my heart aches, ♬

668
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:28,380
♬  If you are happy, as long as you can smile ♬

669
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:35,010
♬ I will miss you the more I erase you ♬

670
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:42,450
♬ I will shed more tears than today ♬

671
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:45,240
You were Young Ja?
♬ Like fate,♬

672
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,810
♬ I won’t ever have anyone like you ♬

673
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:55,850
♬ Only you, only you ♬

674
00:58:55,850 --> 00:59:04,140
♬ As much as my tears, I hope you are happy ♬

675
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,160
Lee Gun, why are you like this to me?

676
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,320
♬ Good bye my love ♬

677
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,200
What on earth are you?

678
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,060
♬ My heart already knew ♬

679
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:19,720
♬ This feeling of loneliness♬

680
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,240
♬ that is about to explode.♬

681
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:30,160
If there's even a little happiness left for me,

682
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,670
I will give you everything.

683
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:39,650
♬ Oh you, ♬

684
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:43,890
♬  Even if I can’t see you, ♬
You have to be happy.

685
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:47,000
♬ Even if I can't touch you, ♬

686
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,920
♬ But I’m okay ♬

687
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:56,690
♬  Endless pain, even if tears are shed again, ♬

688
00:59:56,690 --> 01:00:07,950
But if you are happy, if you can smile, then I… ♬

689
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:13,600
♬ I will miss you the more I erase you ♬

690
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,450
Yes.

691
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:21,050
Kim Mi Young.
♬ I will shed more tears than today ♬

692
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:25,550
I'm your No. 1 fan,

693
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:28,220
Lee Young Ja.
