1
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,000
=Episode 7=
Your Majesty.

2
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:41,439
(My Beloved Made Me Do It)
I was confused and made a mistake.

3
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,280
I hired

4
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,439
that Taoist

5
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,000
to assassinate Lady Xiao.

6
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,879
I deserve to die.

7
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,760
I almost harmed
Your Majesty and Lady Xiao.

8
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,280
I

9
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,319
deserve to die.

10
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,079
But I didn't know
Grand Tutor Wang's plan.

11
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,959
Your Majesty has been

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,920
quite absurd since your enthronement,

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
lacking the demeanor of a wise ruler.

14
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,400
To save Chen State,

15
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,280
back at the rain prayer ceremony,

16
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,240
I almost

17
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,800
started a coup.

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,960
No wonder when I asked for help

19
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,319
during the ceremony,

20
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,400
everyone played dumb and ignored me.

21
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,439
Alright.

22
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,120
My two loyal ministers.

23
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,039
One wanted to kill me.

24
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,000
One wanted to kill my beloved.

25
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,919
I deserve a thousand deaths.

26
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,039
But I don't regret it.

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,479
Your Majesty.

28
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,280
I deserve to die.

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,439
But at that very moment,

30
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,719
the potential Your Majesty displayed

31
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,639
and the Edict of Self-Reproach

32
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,000
might have truly moved the heavens.

33
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,879
I thought to myself,

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,240
this might be the will of heaven.

35
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,680
Your Majesty,

36
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,280
you finally learned
to shoulder responsibility

37
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,080
and be a wise ruler.

38
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,639
Your Majesty,

39
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,479
people accused the Grand Marshal
of plotting a usurpation.

40
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,439
I don't believe it.

41
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,520
He's risked his life many times

42
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,879
to go on expeditions
and defend our state

43
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,400
during the former king's reign.

44
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,439
Your Majesty, kill me if you want.

45
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,719
Spare the Grand Marshal

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,319
and keep him by your side.

47
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,400
Your Majesty.

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,599
I fell

49
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,759
for the rumors

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,000
and misunderstood Lady Xiao.

51
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,919
I used to think

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,319
that Lady Xiao was not kind to you.

53
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,479
Now I realize

54
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,639
that she wants all the best for you.

55
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,960
The rejuvenation
of Chen State will come.

56
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,319
Your Majesty

57
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,599
is wise and valiant,
saving our people on your own.

58
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,879
That's right.

59
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,039
I do feel that

60
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,400
I've toughened up this time.

61
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,599
Urgent military report!

62
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,960
Your Majesty!

63
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,280
Your Majesty!

64
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,280
Your Majesty!

65
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,840
Your Majesty.

66
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,000
It's an emergency.

67
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,759
King Wu died.

68
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,879
Prince Wu is crowned.

69
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,759
While mourning,

70
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,039
he mobilized the troops

71
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,800
at the border

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,439
for an imminent attack.

73
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,519
The one who truly deserves to die

74
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,480
has finally shown up.

75
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,800
I've dealt with

76
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,759
Wu State for half my life.

77
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,000
The late King Wu

78
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,079
was intimidated by our former king

79
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,040
and focused on state governance.

80
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,160
He dared not act against us.

81
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,000
But this newly enthroned young king

82
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,439
seized upon the resources at hand.

83
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,639
It seems he's truly coming for us.

84
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,000
So what?

85
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,360
We shall fight.

86
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,879
My people

87
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,839
have seen my changes
at the rain prayer ceremony.

88
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,600
And they greatly admire me now.

89
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,560
We are united as one.

90
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,240
I, Chen Xiaohua,

91
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,360
have risen.

92
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,439
What's your plan?

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,920
Fight them.

94
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,439
I swear

95
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,879
I will defeat them utterly.

96
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,279
Honey.

97
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,759
Do you see

98
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,480
a wise and majestic ruler in me now?

99
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,079
Honey.

100
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,439
We won over

101
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,959
those two old fogeys today.

102
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,920
They are really skilled

103
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,480
at sweet-talking.

104
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,959
Their compliments almost made me blush.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,079
You've made progress.

106
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,879
But don't get cocky.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,399
The rain was just a natural phenomenon.

108
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,279
It was a thunderstorm
caused by strong convection.

109
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,959
It wasn't the will of heaven.

110
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,199
Will you stop talking nonsense?

111
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,240
My devotion moved heaven and earth

112
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,600
that bestowed the rain upon us.

113
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,560
What was that?

114
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,240
An auspicious omen.

115
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,160
It foretells

116
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,079
that I shall lead
Chen State to prosperity

117
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,519
and defeat Wu State.

118
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,879
Honey.

119
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
I used to be

120
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,480
quite childish, that's true.

121
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,399
And those old fools

122
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,519
were a bit mean towards me.

123
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,240
But you see,

124
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,839
once I make a little effort,

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,680
what happens?

126
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,360
It all worked out.

127
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,040
Honey, you see.

128
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,199
Once we

129
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,720
defeat Wu State

130
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,959
and wipe it out,

131
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,839
I'll take you to travel around

132
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,759
and live a poetic life
somewhere far away.

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,879
We'll sunbathe

134
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,959
and watch the stars.

135
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,040
How does that sound?

136
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,000
Honey.

137
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:35,839
(Three days later)

138
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,879
Your Majesty.

139
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,439
The latest report says

140
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,879
that the Wu Army has crossed the border.

141
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,319
King Wu is leading the troops.

142
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,560
They've encircled Hanzhou

143
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,399
and are holding still.

144
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,600
Ministers.

145
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,279
Any thoughts?

146
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,040
Your Majesty,

147
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,879
in my humble opinion,

148
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,720
since the combat hasn't started,

149
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,079
there is room for peace talks.

150
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,680
If we dispatch troops

151
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,360
and face them head-on,

152
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,519
even if we win,

153
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,600
the people at our borders
will suffer huge losses.

154
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,519
Besides, our troops haven't
fought any wars for a long time.

155
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,800
Are you saying
we should avoid the war, Grand Marshal?

156
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Your Majesty,

157
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,439
in my humble opinion,

158
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,560
it's a critical moment for all of us.

159
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,480
If we put up

160
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,240
with their threat
and carry out peace talks,

161
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,199
what will the other vassal states

162
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
think about us?

163
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,120
Your Majesty.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,920
Your Majesty.

165
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,079
Both of them

166
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,720
made a fair point.

167
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,319
Let's do a deduction.

168
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,879
If our army sets out
from the northwest to aid Hanzhou,

169
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,480
it will be a long trip.

170
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,639
Even the costs
in provisions and logistics

171
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,000
would be too much to bear.

172
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,800
In comparison,

173
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,399
the plan for peace talks
will buy us some time.

174
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,519
Your Majesty.

175
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,639
It seems that our generals

176
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,240
have grown accustomed to comfort

177
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,439
and don't intend to fight.

178
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,560
Who are you talking about?

179
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,879
You know who I'm talking about.

180
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,399
You bookworms talk easily

181
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,000
of going to war.

182
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,959
But fighting a war

183
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,439
is no easy matter.

184
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,480
If you are sent to the battlefield,

185
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,480
you might not even
be able to hold a sword.

186
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,440
We have our expertise.

187
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:42,240
Indeed, we're not
great warriors like the general.

188
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,399
We can't hold swords

189
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,919
but we can hold pens to write.

190
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,039
Regarding military matters,

191
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,279
the Grand Marshal
has the greatest authority

192
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,120
to speak in this court.

193
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,960
I do wish to fight.

194
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,480
But the army needs ample provisions.

195
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,639
Where is the money?

196
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,919
Grand Tutor Wang.

197
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,279
Where is the money?

198
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,159
Thankfully, Hanzhou
hasn't been besieged.

199
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,879
There is still room for maneuver.

200
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,679
Your Majesty,

201
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,039
I believe there is
something more important.

202
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,080
I wonder if I should speak my mind.

203
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,080
Grand Tutor.

204
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,559
Cut to the chase.

205
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,279
I believe that

206
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,919
Your Majesty should

207
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,320
fill the harem

208
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,879
and establish an heir early.

209
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Establishing an heir
lays a solid foundation for the state.

210
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,679
The Grand Tutor

211
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,200
has a fair point.

212
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,919
I also have it in mind.

213
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,399
Let me think about

214
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,559
the war against Wu.

215
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,759
I will also decide

216
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,120
whom to make the queen.

217
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,200
My Beloved.

218
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,320
Have some tea.

219
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,759
Well...

220
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,639
There's something
I don't know if I should say.

221
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,559
Go ahead.

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,840
You see.

223
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,120
A huge war is approaching.

224
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:23,279
There's a heated debate
about whether to go to the war

225
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,279
or have peace talks.

226
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,480
And?

227
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,519
And

228
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,039
Grand Tutor Wang suggested

229
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,799
I establish an heir for the state.

230
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,679
Where are you getting at?

231
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,960
Grand Tutor Wang means

232
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,080
that we must hurry up...

233
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,440
and...

234
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,960
You know?

235
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,120
What is it?

236
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,399
Have a child.

237
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,240
A huge war is imminent.

238
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,679
It makes sense to expect

239
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,879
an heir just in case.

240
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,399
In that case,

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,639
even if Chen State is defeated,

242
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,720
and you die in battle,

243
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,399
at least your lineage won't be cut off.

244
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,279
That's the idea.

245
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
But why does it sound a bit weird

246
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,519
when I hear it from you?

247
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,000
But it doesn't matter.

248
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,399
My Beloved.

249
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,639
For the future of Chen State,

250
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,600
let's do it.

251
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,600
Wait.

252
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,399
My Beloved.

253
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,000
Didn't you say it made sense?

254
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:28,919
I get it.

255
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,399
It's my first time too.

256
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:31,679
Let's go.

257
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,600
Listen to me.

258
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,519
No, I won't.

259
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,480
Actually, it doesn't hurt to listen.

260
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,799
Go ahead.

261
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,639
You are the king.

262
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,360
You want to

263
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,080
establish yourself
in this perilous court

264
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,080
and let Chen State rise under your reign

265
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,039
and defeat Wu.

266
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,799
Then

267
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,440
we'll travel around

268
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,200
and live a poetic life.

269
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,919
We'll watch the stars and the moon.

270
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,679
I mean,

271
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,080
at this point,

272
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,879
you really need an heir

273
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,399
to reassure all the officials

274
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,080
and the people of Chen.

275
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,879
Pick from Zhen'er and Bao'er.

276
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,840
Have an offspring with one of them

277
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:10,879
for the state.

278
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,440
What do you mean?

279
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,879
Trick question.

280
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,919
Trick questions are lame.

281
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,879
I know.

282
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,320
Women are

283
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,720
prone to jealousy.

284
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,000
I swear

285
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,600
that I'm not interested

286
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,399
in them at all.

287
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,080
You have to be.

288
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,360
Even if you are not,

289
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,919
you must see the big picture

290
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,759
and try to be interested in them.

291
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,639
This is for the stability of the state.

292
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,159
It's a mandatory mission you can't skip

293
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,080
to complete the ultra-difficult task.

294
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,879
Honey.

295
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,960
First of all, I will be reborn.

296
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,159
I won't die.

297
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,559
Secondly,

298
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,039
I only want to have kids with you.

299
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,080
I don't care about the stability

300
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,360
of the state.

301
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
You have to.

302
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,600
You are the king.

303
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,480
They are your women.

304
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,440
They're fond of you.

305
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,320
What's the problem?

306
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,480
Fine.

307
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,960
If I have to continue the lineage,

308
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,720
why can't you bear my child?

309
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,039
Why are you pushing me to other women?

310
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,600
Don't you have a conscience?

311
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,480
No, I don't.

312
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,879
I'm a robot.

313
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,120
You're driving me crazy.

314
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,480
You only want to make me a good king.

315
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,080
Do you have no feelings for me at all?

316
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:35,879
I can't

317
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,639
have kids.

318
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,240
Why are you

319
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,159
sneaking around?

320
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,080
You startled me.

321
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,600
You're the sneaky one.

322
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,879
They're arguing in there.

323
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,080
They argue every day.

324
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,120
Why are you here?

325
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,440
I must protect His Majesty
as a secret guard.

326
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,919
Give me a break.

327
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't mean to pry.

328
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,919
I just want to see

329
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,759
if my lady

330
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,080
is really silly enough

331
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
to push your king
to sleep with other women.

332
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,480
What?

333
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,600
Sleep with whom?

334
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,279
Listen for yourself.

335
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,960
- You don't love me.
- Are you even listening?

336
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,240
I mean,

337
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,679
I can't

338
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,399
have kids.

339
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,080
I understand.

340
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,519
You don't care about me.

341
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,639
I do care.

342
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,320
But for your ultimate goal,

343
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,120
you must go to them.

344
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,240
So, you insist

345
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,279
on me sleeping with someone else.

346
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:53,879
I have to.

347
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,879
You...

348
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,679
I have no choice.

349
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,240
Why

350
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,519
are you so close to me?

351
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,240
Were you trying to grope me?

352
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,480
You told me to eavesdrop.

353
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,000
You were trying to grope me.

354
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,480
Why would I grope you?

355
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,720
Without me, how did you butt...

356
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,639
Long Qi.

357
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,159
Tell Eunuch Li.

358
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,120
Tonight,

359
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,200
I will have Zhen'er and Bao'er

360
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,679
serve me in bed.

361
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,120
You really don't mind?

362
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,480
Mind what?

363
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,480
It's not too late if you regret it.

364
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,279
I don't regret it.

365
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,080
Stop lying to yourself.

366
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,320
We are both women.

367
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,159
I get it.

368
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,399
How am I lying?

369
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,679
And what did you get?

370
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:12,200
I know demons and humans
are not meant to be.

371
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:12,879
But

372
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,600
not a single woman would

373
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,879
have her husband
sleep with another woman.

374
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,840
He is first the king,

375
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,879
then himself.

376
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,840
I don't get

377
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,279
you big figures.

378
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,279
Ladies.

379
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,919
Not here.

380
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,960
Ladies.

381
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,159
Ladies.

382
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,440
This is Lady Xiao's residence.

383
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
Go in.

384
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,320
Can't we

385
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,360
go directly to Linhua Hall?

386
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,679
Eunuch Li.

387
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,480
Are you afraid of that demoness?

388
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,480
Think about it.

389
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,879
If you offend us,

390
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,440
you might also die.

391
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,799
Zhen'er.

392
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,320
Some people

393
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,679
broke the palace and set a fire.

394
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,799
So full of tricks.

395
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,200
But she still doesn't
get to serve His Majesty.

396
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,240
That's right.

397
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,039
The king wants to leave heirs.

398
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,519
He can't go with someone
as thin as a pair of chopsticks.

399
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,160
A pair of chopsticks?

400
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,599
She's a single chopstick.

401
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,240
Xiao'er.

402
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,599
Should we come by

403
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,359
to tell you

404
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,640
how His Majesty

405
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,519
slept with us tonight?

406
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,319
Bao'er.

407
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,839
Don't be so explicit.

408
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,599
Just let Xiao'er imagine it.

409
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,279
Lady.

410
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,920
Can I kill them now?

411
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,880
No need.

412
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,440
In my humble opinion,

413
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,799
we'd better leave.

414
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
Are you really

415
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,519
not scared at all?

416
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
She dares not.

417
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,200
Bao'er.

418
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,559
His Majesty finally asked us

419
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,200
to serve in the chamber.

420
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,559
Let's not keep him waiting.

421
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,519
That's right.

422
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,759
His Majesty must be

423
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,480
craving us

424
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,200
with a burning

425
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,680
desire.

426
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,200
Let's go.

427
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,960
Raise your cups.

428
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

429
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,759
Cheers.

430
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,519
Dear.

431
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,799
Take it slow.

432
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:14,559
Take it slow.

433
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,440
Take it slow.

434
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,200
I can't handle it at that pace.

435
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,079
Still not drunk?

436
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,079
Come on.

437
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,559
Drink some more.

438
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,119
Drink some more.

439
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,680
Come on.

440
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,640
Drink more.

441
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,960
And we'll sleep well.

442
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,559
We'll sleep well.

443
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,559
Cheers.

444
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:54,759
Alright.

445
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,880
You made me do this.

446
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:17,920
Your Majesty.

447
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,680
Let's keep drinking.

448
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,599
Bottoms up.

449
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
Come on, let's drink.

450
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
This wine

451
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,319
goes down so smoothly.

452
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,599
It's as bland as water.

453
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,920
Your Majesty, here.

454
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,559
Let's get wasted.

455
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:54,680
Tonight belongs to me.

456
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,839
No one shall compete with me.

457
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,000
Honey.

458
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,880
Why don't you get it?

459
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,839
I only want you

460
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,039
as the queen with my body and soul.

461
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:44,920
I get it.

462
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,359
Honey.

463
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,319
Why are you here?

464
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,119
At this very moment,

465
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,640
shouldn't you be in your chamber?

466
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,960
Honey.

467
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,200
I didn't do anything to them.

468
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,119
I did that

469
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,440
just to make you angry.

470
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,880
You don't have to tell me this.

471
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,880
I'm not angry.

472
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,119
Really?

473
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,920
What do you mean?

474
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,480
Actually, I've only

475
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,799
had feelings for one person,

476
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,079
and that's you.

477
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,519
Weird.

478
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,599
Why is there a strange feeling surging?

479
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,839
This is a feeling beyond calculation.

480
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,720
I'm not sure...

481
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,640
Honey.

482
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,279
Don't go, Honey.

483
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,319
It's okay.

484
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,160
Just sleep.

485
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,880
Your appearance

486
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,599
made me discover

487
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,880
(the joy of being human.)

488
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,880
(I hope in the next life,)

489
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,279
(you can still be with me.)

490
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,960
It has nothing to do with her.

491
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,839
I love her.

492
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,039
I love my state.

493
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,960
Oh heaven,

494
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
kill me if you want to

495
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,079
punish someone.

496
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,920
Weird.

497
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:28,519
What is this?

498
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:44,359
Honey.

499
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,119
Will you

500
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,759
leave me one day?

501
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,799
No.

502
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:53,119
I exist because of you.

503
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,480
Then will you

504
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,480
escape with me?

505
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,119
I'm done being a king.

506
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,079
Let's find a secluded place

507
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,960
and grow old together, okay?

508
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,200
For you and me,

509
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,680
there is no escape,

510
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,119
only missions.

511
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,799
What mission?

512
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,119
My mission

513
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,119
is to help you

514
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,519
become a wise ruler.

515
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,519
Your mission

516
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,359
is to become a wise ruler.

517
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,920
You shall save the people from danger,

518
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,519
lead Chen State

519
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,640
to regain the glory
it enjoyed 100 years ago

520
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,160
and bring peace

521
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,880
and prosperity.

522
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,720
The same question.

523
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,359
Why does it have to be me?

524
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,319
I don't know.

525
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,079
I only know

526
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,319
that I must complete my task.

527
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,799
But I believe

528
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,519
you can do it.

529
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,880
I have always believed so.

530
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,640
During the rain prayer,

531
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,720
I felt your courage

532
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,920
and saw how you looked at the people.

533
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,680
I think

534
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,519
your people

535
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,359
also surely believe

536
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,920
that you can lead them
to a glorious future.

According to you,

547
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,720
both peace talks and war

548
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,880
require funds.

549
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,599
How much money do we need?

550
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,599
Your Majesty.

551
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,880
We need to do an accounting.

552
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,319
The rain prayer ceremony

553
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:51,720
must have cost a lot, right?

554
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,599
There was money
for such intangible things

555
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,599
but not serious matters?

556
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:01,920
Fine.

557
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,440
I just want to know

558
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,440
how much money we have in the Treasury.

559
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,400
How much do we need?

560
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,319
Your Majesty.

561
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,440
It requires some calculation.

562
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,440
Does Your Majesty

563
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,839
really want to

564
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
start a war?

565
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,720
I just want to know

566
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,920
how much money we have in the Treasury.

567
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,519
Your Majesty.

568
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,000
The Treasury is depleted.

569
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,160
We have no money left.

570
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,559
Where did the money go?

571
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,759
Your Majesty.

572
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,920
Recently,

573
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
we've seen droughts and floods.

574
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,160
There was

575
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,519
no income at all.

576
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,480
And last year,

577
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,160
the former king passed away.

578
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,400
We spent a lot of money on repairing

579
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,720
the royal court and the palace.

580
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,160
The Treasury is empty.

581
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,640
It's a known fact to all.

582
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,559
What His Majesty truly wants to ask is,

583
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,759
what about this year?

584
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,880
We boast a renowned salt industry.

585
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,720
Half of our annual taxes

586
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,039
come from the salt industry.

587
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,119
Even in years of disaster,

588
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,880
salt production is not affected.

589
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,759
Moreover,

590
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,559
the prefectures hand in taxes.

591
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
That's right.

592
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,440
This is what I want to ask.

593
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,119
Have we collected the salt tax

594
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,359
and other taxes properly?

595
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,279
Also,

596
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,799
has the tax income

597
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,279
been used for other purposes?

598
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,920
Where did the money go?

599
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:31,400
Who's in charge?

600
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,839
The Ministry of Revenue
or the Ministry of Rites?

601
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:34,480
Your Majesty.

602
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
Your Majesty.

603
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,799
No women in politics.

604
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,079
Lady Xiao is violating

605
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,720
the ancestral regulations.

606
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,119
Violating the regulations?

607
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,720
Grand Tutor.

608
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,039
Does it count?

609
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,359
Do not let minor formalities

610
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,200
hinder major duties.

611
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,200
We're discussing major state affairs.

612
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,119
It's alright.

613
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:06,559
Can anyone answer my questions?

614
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,680
Your Majesty.

615
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,079
All the income and expenses

616
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,480
of this year have been recorded clearly.

617
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:17,119
If Your Majesty has any doubts,

618
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,920
I'm willing to assist in supervision.

619
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,400
Your Majesty.

620
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,759
You're swamped by state affairs.

621
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,960
I'm willing

622
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,759
to work with the six ministries

623
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,799
to clear up the accounts.

624
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:30,799
How about this?

625
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:33,279
You're all busy with your duties.

626
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,279
This is an urgent matter.

627
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,799
I will look into it by myself.

628
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,359
Your Majesty.

629
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,759
You are the ruler of the state.

630
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,039
Leave

631
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,319
this trivial matter
to the Ministry of Revenue.

632
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,519
Seconded.

633
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,240
As the king, it is only right

634
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,480
for His Majesty to audit the accounts.

635
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,920
Why do you keep

636
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,319
making excuses to stop him?

637
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,440
Your Majesty.

638
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,000
My loyalty is evident
to heaven and earth.

639
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,880
Leave it to the Ministry of Revenue.

640
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,240
What if I insist

641
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,920
on investigating it?

642
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,680
I

643
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:07,519
object.

644
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,839
Anyone else?

645
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,079
Court adjourned.

646
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,559
Court adjourned.

647
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,799
You old thing.

648
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:47,720
What?

649
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,519
What are you doing?

650
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,079
You old thing.

651
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,480
Let's be honest here.

652
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,920
Which side are you on?

653
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,440
Are you for war or peace?

654
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,799
I would like to ask you.

655
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,759
Are you for war or peace?

656
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,400
Stop dodging my question.

657
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,599
You own the Ministry of Revenue.

658
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,000
Why won't you let His Majesty

659
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,400
look into the account?

660
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,440
It's not just my subordinates
who are against it.

661
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,519
Grand Marshal.

662
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,440
You've held the military seal

663
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,559
for half a lifetime.

664
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,480
In the end,

665
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,759
you're going for peace talks, huh?

666
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,640
Also,

667
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,200
you are indulging Lady Xiao

668
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,880
in beating court officials.

669
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,200
As the old saying goes,

670
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,160
"The hero has aged."

671
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,559
Don't give me that nonsense.

672
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,839
My adopted daughter never listens to me.

673
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,319
Grand Tutor Wang.

674
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:40,319
Do you really not understand

675
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,720
or are you playing dumb?

676
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,720
We can't

677
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:48,319
afford to fight this war.

678
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,920
You keep quoting sages' sayings.

679
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,920
Have you ever seen blood in your life?

680
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,160
It's easy to talk about war.

681
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:57,160
And the money?

682
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,119
Where is the money?

683
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,759
I believe that

684
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,240
regarding the accounts,

685
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,279
His Majesty will figure something out.

686
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,200
His Majesty will figure something out.

687
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,880
(Taiji Hall)
He will figure it out.

688
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,000
Honey.

689
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,880
You showed up just in time today.

690
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,160
But then again,

691
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,440
how did you know they'd

692
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,079
bring up the account checking?

693
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,920
I didn't know,

694
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,480
but I knew

695
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,000
they'd have opinions

696
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,519
about whether to go to war.

697
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,319
So they would give you a hard time.

698
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,480
You're amazing, honey.

699
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,480
You got those old fogeys to agree to

700
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,880
the account check

701
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,960
so effortlessly.

702
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,279
The credit is yours.

703
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,359
You asked to check the accounts.

704
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,599
It's a huge progress.

705
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,559
I won't disagree with that.

706
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,319
Something feels off.

707
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,039
The number has gone up.

708
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,920
If he passes all the levels,

709
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,279
he will surely come back to life.

710
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,559
What?

711
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,359
