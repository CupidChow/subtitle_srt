1
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:13,720
(Rookie.)

2
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,039
(Come find me.)

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,600
(Come find me.)

4
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,800
(Rookie.)

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,479
Before dawn.

6
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:38,840
(Chen Xiaohua, King of Chen State)
(Was that a dream?)

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:43,920
(No way.)

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,920
(Someone slapped me.)

9
00:00:59,159 --> 00:00:59,920
Your Majesty.

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,599
Eunuch... Li?

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,840
(Eunuch Li)
Your Majesty.

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,920
Yes, it's me.

13
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,719
Eunuch Li.

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,680
When I was asleep,

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,040
did a woman

16
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,159
slap me in the face?

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,280
I'm dazed.

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,879
From the sleep.

19
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,239
Then

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,920
I'll sleep a bit more.

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,959
Your Majesty.

22
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,760
Since you're up,

23
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,840
why not attend the court session?

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,120
(I'm Chen Xiaohua.)

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,799
(I grew up in the Cold Palace,)

26
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,000
(starving)

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,159
(and deprived.)

28
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,840
(It was a life-threatening hardship.)

29
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,680
(But at some point,)

30
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,319
(I suddenly became
the king of Chen State.)

31
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,319
(I really)

32
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,760
(didn't want to be the king.)

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,000
(However,)

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,599
(the good thing about it)

35
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,799
(is that I'll never go hungry again.)

36
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,840
Just these few dishes?

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,199
I won't have any

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,080
if they're not extravagant.

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,840
Your Majesty.

40
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,400
This

41
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,719
is fritillaria and loquat stew
with premium peach gum.

42
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,159
This is chicken paste
with East Sea fish soup.

43
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:22,919
Your Majesty.

44
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,520
Which one should I serve you first?

45
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,439
I'm not going to choose.

46
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,319
I'll have them both.

47
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,120
Please slow down.

48
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,280
What's wrong?

49
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,520
Wait.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,599
This...

51
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,360
This is poisonous.

52
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:45,984
=Episode 1=
(The Rookie Prophet)

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,800
Before dawn.

54
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,160
(Dreaming again?)

55
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,680
Your Majesty.

56
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,560
Eunuch... Li?

57
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,199
Your Majesty.

58
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,079
Eunuch Li.

59
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,720
Your Majesty.

60
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,240
Yes, it's me.

61
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,439
Wait.

62
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,319
Hasn't it happened before?

63
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm dazed.

64
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,839
I must be dazed from sleep.

65
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,680
Then I'll sleep a bit more.

66
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,439
- Since you're up,
- Since you're up,

67
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,399
- why not attend the court session?
- why not attend the court session?

68
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,439
Heaven bless Chen State.

69
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,240
You're finally
attending the court session.

70
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,000
(Don't tell me these are the stew
with premium peach gum)

71
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,639
(and chicken paste
with East Sea fish soup.)

72
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,240
Your Majesty.

73
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,959
This is fritillaria and loquat stew
with premium peach gum.

74
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,560
And chicken paste
with East Sea fish soup.

75
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,720
Your Majesty.

76
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,399
Which one should I serve you first?

77
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,680
(They're poisoned.)

78
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,439
I just want to muddle

79
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,240
through life.

80
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,439
But you people

81
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,360
want to kill me in broad daylight.

82
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,560
Long Qi.

83
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,639
Your Majesty.

84
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,820
(Long Qi, Secret Guard)
- They poisoned me. - What?

85
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,639
Spit it out.

86
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,959
Long Qi.

87
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,800
I haven't

88
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,040
had any soup at all.

89
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
(Rookie.)

90
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,600
(Rookie.)

91
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,639
(Come find me.)

92
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,519
(Come find me.)

93
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,319
(Rookie.)

94
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,160
Who poisoned the food?

95
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,480
Why did you do that?

96
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,920
Confess.

97
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,959
Answer my questions.

98
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,079
Or die.

99
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,519
You won't talk?

100
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,079
Drink up.

101
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
One bowl each.

102
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,160
Please show mercy.

103
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,079
General Long, mercy.

104
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,759
Your Majesty!

105
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,639
Your Majesty.

106
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,279
Mercy!

107
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,199
I have sinned.

108
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,319
I failed

109
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,040
to regulate my subordinates.

110
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,759
Your Majesty, General Long.

111
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,199
Please leave these people to me.

112
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,160
I will interrogate them without mercy.

113
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,959
In three days...

114
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,360
No.

115
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,639
Within a day,

116
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,120
I will find the person behind this.

117
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,399
The person behind this?

118
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,920
Only a few people have issues

119
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,720
with me, am I right?

120
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,720
He made me king back then.

121
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,439
Listen.

122
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,759
How about this?

123
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,480
Tell Dowager Zhang and the Grand Marshal

124
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,879
that I might as well

125
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,120
just resign.

126
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,120
I want nothing

127
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,160
but a leisurely life.

128
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,720
Right?

129
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,959
The Zhang family can

130
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,399
find someone to replace me.

131
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,120
Anyway, the Grand Marshal
is all-powerful

132
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,160
as the uncrowned king of Chen State.

133
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:27,759
Am I right?

134
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,279
Your Majesty.

135
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:30,879
Speak cautiously.

136
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:54,919
Danger?

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,799
My legs go weak.

138
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,159
You can't be weak

139
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:57,960
as a king.

140
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:58,840
Toughen up.

141
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,960
I was almost poisoned to death.

142
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,879
And you punched me in my belly.

143
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,679
Toughen up?

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Shouldn't you ask me

145
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,679
how I knew the food was poisoned?

146
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,799
A secret guard

147
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,799
never asks questions.

148
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Since you asked

149
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,480
as my only confidant,

150
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,120
then I shall

151
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,519
mercifully answer you.

152
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,320
I was

153
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,759
inspired.

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,600
I

155
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,720
can foresee the future.

156
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,000
You foresaw that?

157
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,639
I foresaw that.

158
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,120
That means,

159
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,440
Your Majesty,

160
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,320
you are...

161
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,840
The chosen one

162
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,759
who can foresee the future.

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,799
You hit me again?

164
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,679
Well,

165
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,200
you didn't foresee that, huh?

166
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,600
That's because

167
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,200
I let my guard down.

168
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,399
Stop it!

169
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,279
To be honest,

170
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,399
it's your decree.

171
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,759
Nonsense.

172
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,200
When did I issue such a decree?

173
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,320
Your Majesty,

174
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,919
I think you've forgotten many things.

175
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,600
I have?

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,639
A secret guard

177
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,519
never lies.

178
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,519
Then tell me

179
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,000
why I issued such a decree.

180
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,960
A secret guard

181
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,039
never asks questions.

182
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,759
Come with me.

183
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,639
Fall.

184
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,159
Mercy!

185
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:27,519
See?

186
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,679
Show mercy.

187
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:30,960
Noodle soup.

188
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,279
Your Majesty.

189
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,759
See?

190
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,720
No, Your Majesty.

191
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,440
This is for the servants.

192
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,799
That's good.

193
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,279
It must be

194
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,440
poison-free.

195
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,440
Do you get it?

196
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,759
Yeah.

197
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000
Elaborate.

198
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,320
What did you get?

199
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,879
Your Majesty

200
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,759
has risen.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,600
That's right.

202
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,279
I

203
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,159
have risen.

204
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,080
You have toughened up.

205
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,080
That's right.

206
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,440
And this time I will be unrestrained.

207
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,320
Heaven bless.

208
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
With this divine skill,

209
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,919
Your Majesty can confront

210
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,440
the Grand Marshal head-on

211
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,519
to regain power soon.

212
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,440
Then Chen State will remain yours.

213
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,480
The rejuvenation

214
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,639
is to be expected.

215
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,639
No, no.

216
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,720
This divine skill of mine

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
may save my life,

218
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,240
but forget it if I have to

219
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,399
attend court sessions.

220
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,799
Isn't it nice to just

221
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,879
eat and do nothing?

222
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,240
Where?

223
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,200
Where are you?

224
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,679
Where are you?

225
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,399
(Rookie.)

226
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,320
(Come find me.)

227
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,360
(Come find me.)

228
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,559
(Rookie.)

229
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:06,679
Water.

230
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,080
Underwater.

231
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,679
So deep.

232
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,320
So dark.

233
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,840
There can't be anyone here.

234
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,919
His Majesty may be a bit crazy,

235
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,480
but he can't be suicidal, right?

236
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,360
So,

237
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,559
you suspect that you're possessed.

238
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,919
I'm not possessed.

239
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm under a spell.

240
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,840
No wonder you want to drown yourself.

241
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,039
Who is trying to harm you?

242
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,480
Excuse me.

243
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
You think
I have the guts to commit suicide?

244
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,000
I was looking for someone.

245
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,039
In the lake?

246
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,840
Tell you what.

247
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:57,320
I keep dreaming of an immortal.

248
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,759
She keeps calling me underwater.

249
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,519
"Rookie.

250
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,720
Rookie."

251
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,320
Be serious.

252
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,200
How about

253
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,559
you go back to sleep?

254
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,960
I knew you wouldn't believe it.

255
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
But I'm telling you,

256
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,320
I have evidence.

257
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,519
It seems

258
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,879
to lack a certain charm.

259
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,720
Your Majesty.

260
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:42,960
Your Majesty.

261
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,440
Wake up.

262
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,759
Wake up, Your Majesty.

263
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:51,840
Who is this woman?

264
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,440
(Dowager Zhang)
I'm your mother.

265
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,440
It's daytime, and you're so groggy

266
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,240
that you don't even recognize me?

267
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,240
Get up.

268
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,399
Don't get handsy.

269
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,200
I know I am somewhat attractive,

270
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,120
but this is inappropriate.

271
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,440
Show some respect.

272
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,519
You need a beating.

273
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,192
Grand Tutor Wang.

274
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,519
Grand Tutor.

275
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,399
Grand Marshal.

276
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,320
(Grand Marshal)
Discipline your little sister!

277
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,039
She poisoned me

278
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,519
and humiliated me.

279
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,840
(Grand Tutor Wang)
Your Majesty, calm down.

280
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,080
As long as I'm here,

281
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,000
no one

282
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,360
can harm you.

283
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,840
Who said I'd harm him?

284
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:43,759
You little brat.

285
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,159
Who poisoned you?

286
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,879
Who humiliated you?

287
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,399
Watch your mouth.

288
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,440
You see.

289
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,519
You heard her.

290
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,360
Utterly unrestrained.

291
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,759
No manners whatsoever.

292
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,360
We've found the person

293
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,600
who poisoned you.

294
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
It is this person.

295
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,559
Grand Tutor Wang and I came to tell you

296
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,720
that it has nothing to do
with the Dowager.

297
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,519
This eunuch confessed.

298
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,240
He held a grudge against Your Majesty,

299
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,639
bought poison from someone

300
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,279
and added it to the breakfast.

301
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,519
Are you kidding me?

302
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,759
He poisoned me?

303
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,440
You people

304
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,080
just keep scheming against me

305
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
and you want me dead.

306
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,360
I have

307
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,919
brought you the culprit.

308
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,360
It doesn't matter

309
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,720
whether you believe it.

310
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,559
Anyway,

311
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,279
he poisoned the food.

312
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,919
Fine.

313
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,679
You're all bullying me, huh?

314
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:47,600
Tell you what.

315
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,320
If I die and become an immortal,

316
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,840
I'll strike you with lightning.

317
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,600
What's so funny?

318
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,440
Become what?

319
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,159
An immortal?

320
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,200
Too much pressure.

321
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,759
His Majesty is under too much pressure.

322
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,120
Issues at home and abroad

323
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,200
keep him awake all night long.

324
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,639
That's why he's lost it a bit.

325
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,519
Grand Tutor.

326
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,360
He's under pressure?

327
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,879
He has five meals a day

328
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:14,960
and does nothing.

329
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,879
He's under pressure?

330
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,720
Tell me what to do.

331
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,399
Should we let him stay in bed

332
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,559
for the rest of his life

333
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,840
without doing any work?

334
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,759
He doesn't care about the policies

335
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,639
and governance.

336
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:26,559
Is this acceptable?

337
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,519
Sorry.

338
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,600
Excuse me.

339
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,240
Is...

340
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Is that acceptable?

341
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,159
Yeah.

342
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,120
As long as you have an heir,

343
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,240
you can stay in bed
for as long as you want.

344
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,039
An heir?

345
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,679
In that case,

346
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,559
finding virtuous

347
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,799
and talented ladies

348
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,360
for His Majesty

349
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,000
is also a crucial matter.

350
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,960
Finding...

351
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,559
Finding ladies?

352
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,519
I...

353
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,279
I can do that.

354
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,240
His Majesty is losing it

355
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,640
while looking for a lady.

356
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,599
Really?

357
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,160
He has nightmares

358
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,960
and keeps saying
"Immortal" and "Rabbit".

359
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:12,799
Nightmares?

360
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,119
And he keeps saying
"Immortal" and "Rabbit"?

361
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,400
Keep it down.

362
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:21,799
I bet His Majesty

363
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:22,559
has been bewitched

364
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,920
by a Jade Rabbit demon

365
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,839
from who knows where

366
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,759
and lost his wits.

367
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,759
It's freaky.

368
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Stop saying that.

369
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,039
And then?

370
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,480
And then...

371
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,720
You were scared.

372
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Why are you asking?

373
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:34,680
Let's go.

374
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,599
Your Majesty is now an adult.

375
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,240
It's an urgent matter
for you to find a wife.

376
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,039
But you need to tell us

377
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,960
your specific

378
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,319
requirements for your partner.

379
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,599
I get to make requests?

380
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,160
As long as you say it,

381
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,599
Grand Marshal and I will
look through the folk ladies

382
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,200
to find your soulmate.

383
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,240
Actually, I don't

384
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,039
have any specific requirements.

385
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,319
But,

386
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,880
first of all, she must be pretty.

387
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,559
If I can ask for some features,

388
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,640
she should ideally

389
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,920
be a woman holding a pink jade rabbit

390
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,680
who looks arrogant and cold.

391
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,359
She should look arrogant and resolute

392
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,720
with a trace of aloofness.

393
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,519
It would be best if she had a temper

394
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,920
and would slap me

395
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,079
the second we meet.

396
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,079
Yeah.

397
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,680
That's the lady I want.

398
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,799
Go find one for me.

399
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,759
What a masochist.

400
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,599
Your Majesty.

401
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,400
Choose away.

402
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,599
Did you

403
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,880
really give me a choice?

404
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:54,000
Why does Your Majesty say so?

405
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,920
A gentleman should
not be engrossed in female charms.

406
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,359
Seek virtue and morality.

407
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,880
When choosing a wife,

408
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,160
one must choose someone of good lineage.

409
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,920
These

410
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,519
are selected in consultation
with Grand Tutor Wang

411
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,880
and our colleagues.

412
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:13,759
Your Majesty

413
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,559
must pick someone
from them to be your wife.

414
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,519
Grand Marshal is right.

415
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,440
The two ladies in the front

416
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,359
are from our Zhang family.

417
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,160
They're the most virtuous and talented.

418
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,400
Speaking of which,

419
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,559
they're your cousins.

420
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,319
My cousins.

421
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,799
Virtuous and talented?

422
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,039
I'm Zhang Zhen'er.

423
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm Zhang Bao'er.

424
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,279
Greetings.

425
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,400
Greetings.

426
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,920
I heard that Your Majesty favors

427
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,400
unconventional and bold women.

428
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:43,680
I may not be

429
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,160
particularly talented,

430
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,759
but I've prepared some talent shows.

431
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,519
It is time to show our true talents.

432
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,920
Come on, guys.

433
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,079
Bring it up.

434
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,720
Grand Marshal.

435
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,240
W-What is this about?

436
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,119
A rock?

437
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,079
That's right.

438
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,960
My talent is
breaking a rock on my chest.

439
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,279
Here we go.

440
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,079
Come on.

441
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,039
Hit me.

442
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,839
Come on.

443
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,200
Hit me.

444
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,039
I can't bear to watch.

445
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,160
Impressive.

446
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,480
Remarkable.

447
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,000
Thank you.

448
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,799
I'm flattered.

449
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,119
Impressive.

450
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,359
Your Majesty.

451
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,759
Are you pleased with us?

452
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,279
Well...

453
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,279
Here's the thing.

454
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,680
I can't say that I'm not pleased.

455
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,160
It's indeed impressive.

456
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,039
Nor can I say that I'm pleased.

457
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,640
Grand Marshal.

458
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,960
I thought I was looking for a wife.

459
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,519
They're quite skilled.

460
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:16,119
Why? You don't like us?

461
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,559
Alright, bring it up.

462
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,440
Another rock?

463
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:18,880
No.

464
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,480
I shall thrust a spear to my throat

465
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,359
and swallow a sword.

466
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:23,799
No need.

467
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,519
Listen.

468
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,480
I'll pick you two.

469
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,279
Well,

470
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:26,799
reward them.

471
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,519
Reward them.

472
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,480
Reward them.

473
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,920
What's going on?

474
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,720
I suppose he isn't happy with us

475
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,599
and ran away?

476
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:35,519
He did?

477
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,920
No one can escape from me.

478
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,000
I will chase him

479
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,279
to the end of the world.

480
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:40,799
Let's go.

481
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,440
What are you waiting for?

482
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,400
Keep an eye on him.

483
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,200
Understood.

484
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,240
Extraordinary ladies.

485
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:49,720
Your Majesty.

486
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,000
Your Majesty, slow down.

487
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,640
Your Majesty.

488
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:58,480
Your Majesty.

489
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,359
Your Majesty.

490
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:00,400
Your Majesty.

491
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,759
(Xin Caiyi, Spy of Wu State)
Your Majesty.

492
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,640
Your Majesty.

493
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,119
I'm here.

494
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,480
I know you're here.

495
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,039
Stop running.

496
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,279
It's dangerous by the lake.

497
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,759
Oh really?

498
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,039
It's more dangerous around you.

499
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,880
Your Majesty, be careful.

500
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,799
Watch out.

501
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,759
Your Majesty.

502
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,319
Why...

503
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:20,240
Why are you running?

504
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,279
Your Majesty.

505
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,759
I told you it was dangerous.

506
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:44,839
And you kept running.

507
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:45,799
Are you stupid?

508
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:46,960
You're the stupid one.

509
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,240
Your whole family is stupid.

510
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,039
Let go.

511
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,839
No, no.

512
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,279
Pull me up.

513
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:52,480
If I pull you up,

514
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,640
will you stop running?

515
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,440
Yeah.

516
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,839
I swear I'll stop.

517
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:58,640
Then will you marry me and my sister?

518
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,599
Marriage should be happy.

519
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,319
Happiness can't be forced.

520
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:04,960
Actually,

521
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,920
having a little problem is alright.

522
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,000
Come on, pull me up.

523
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:17,880
(Rookie.)

524
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,440
(Come find me.)

525
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,720
Water.

526
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,400
Underwater.

527
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,359
(Rookie.)

528
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,359
(Come find me.)

529
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,000
(Come find me.)

530
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,359
(Rookie.)

531
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,074
(Lady Xiao, 2099)

532
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
It's you.

533
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,440
Who are you?

534
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,799
That's the feeling.

535
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,720
Roo...

536
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:50,759
kie.

537
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,119
Immortal.

538
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,160
Rabbit.

539
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,400
Rabbit.

540
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,759
Immortal.

541
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,160
You finally came.

542
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:03,799
Your Majesty.

543
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,000
You finally woke up.

544
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,039
Why are you

545
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:09,839
so close to me?

546
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,480
You've been in a coma

547
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:12,960
for a whole day and night.

548
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,279
Where is that immortal?

549
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,359
Immortal?

550
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,880
What immortal?

551
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,680
Lady Xiao saved you.

552
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:23,680
Lady Xiao?

553
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,960
Your beloved wife.
Grand Marshal's adopted daughter.

554
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,119
Don't you remember?

555
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,559
Are you saying

556
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,079
that the one who saved me from the lake

557
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,480
was my beloved wife,

558
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,640
the Grand Marshal's daughter?

559
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,039
No.

560
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:42,960
Adopted.

561
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,839
Not important.

562
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,799
Tell you what.

563
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:49,759
She's the one

564
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,680
who keeps calling me a "rookie"

565
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
and humiliating me

566
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,599
while extending my life with spells.

567
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,839
I only know

568
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,720
that Lady Xiao was the only lady

569
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,599
you personally invited to the palace.

570
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:05,480
Wait.

571
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:08,920
Elaborate.

572
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:10,880
Lady Xiao brought you

573
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,519
out of the Cold Palace.

574
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,839
After your coronation,

575
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,200
the Grand Marshal sent Lady Xiao here.

576
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,039
Hurry up.

577
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,440
Bring her here.

578
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
I want to see her now.

579
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,039
How do you wish to see her?

580
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,799
How?

581
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:28,759
Something like

582
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,559
summoning the lady

583
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,039
to reminisce?

584
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,359
