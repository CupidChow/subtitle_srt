1
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,440
Tao, what's wrong with you today?

2
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,839
They adopted me.

3
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,640
That's great.

4
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:41,799
(When are you leaving?)

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
Today.

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,240
Today?

7
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,759
Tao.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,280
You forgot this.

9
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,177
(Year 2095)

10
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,719
This one, please.

11
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,120
Okay, just a moment.

12
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,760
A salted tomato
cherry blossom cake, please.

13
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,799
Sorry, Miss.

14
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,440
That cake is a limited edition.

15
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,399
It's already sold out.

16
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,919
Would you like something else?

17
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,479
No, thank you.

18
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
=Episode 17=
Your Majesty,

19
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,399
(The Ultimate Truth Will Suffice)
the Wu Army has crossed the border.

20
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,799
After the fall of Kangzhou,

21
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,160
the Wu Army pillaged the city

22
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,759
and headed straight to Shaozhou.

23
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,799
Although Shaozhou lacks strong defenses,

24
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,999
under your order,

25
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,640
its soldiers barricaded the inner city.

26
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,640
People stand united,

27
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,639
temporarily stalling Wu's advance.

28
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,480
Another report.

29
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,799
Wu De attacked Chen State
under the pretext

30
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,119
of avenging his brother,

31
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,679
claiming it as righteous
to other states.

32
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,520
In this attack,

33
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Chu State and Yue State
also helped Wu secretly.

34
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,920
Whether Wu De used

35
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,759
avenging his brother as an excuse,

36
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,160
or plotted against Chen,

37
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,079
anyone dares to invade Chen

38
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,360
will be destroyed!

39
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,119
From now on,

40
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,199
any military report

41
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,240
must go directly

42
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,280
to me and Grand Tutor Wang,
day and night.

43
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes.

44
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,160
External threats have not ended.

45
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,160
So I'll take charge
of the armies temporarily.

46
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,000
Understood.

47
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:26,800
Honey.

48
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,480
Honey.

49
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,759
Your Majesty, you're back.

50
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,399
Your Majesty, she remains the same.

51
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,240
She just slept less.

52
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
And Caiyi and Long Qi?

53
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,920
They've been too tired lately.

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,639
I let them go back and rest.

55
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,280
Your Majesty, please take care.

56
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,520
In the face of enemies,

57
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,920
Chen needs you.

58
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,160
Let me take care of her.

59
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,800
You haven't rested for a long time.

60
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:57,879
Thank you.

61
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,480
Is it on?

62
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,720
Okay, it's on.

63
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,000
Tomato Cultivation Project,
first check-in.

64
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,680
Honey, this is my first time
recording something like this.

65
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,559
I know, in your eyes,

66
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,560
I'm probably lazy

67
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,680
with no decent work.

68
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,600
But as your man,

69
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,800
I must at least bring you happiness.

70
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,680
I remember you told me

71
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,040
that since childhood,

72
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,199
your favorite has been tomato.

73
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,960
Now, tomatoes don't exist

74
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,360
in this world anymore.

75
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,920
But don't worry.

76
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,399
Chen Xiaohua is all-powerful.

77
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,040
I won't accept that.

78
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,160
I must grow some for you.

79
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,959
Honey,

80
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,600
look at this.

81
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,279
I asked a plant blogger for these seeds.

82
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,319
Although he warned me

83
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,920
that these seeds

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,480
might not survive,

85
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,999
I'll try anyway.

86
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,079
Right?

87
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,679
Moreover, your birthday

88
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,000
is in seven months.

89
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,319
If all goes well,

90
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,759
it will be your birthday gift.

91
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,160
Tomato Cultivation Project,
second check-in.

92
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,559
Fifteen days have passed

93
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,240
since the last update.

94
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:21,240
But not a single seed

95
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,879
has sprouted.

96
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,879
I wondered why this happened.

97
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,040
I googled and it turns out I forgot

98
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,199
to soak them.

99
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,079
How stupid!

100
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,520
No wonder

101
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,919
nothing grew.

102
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,440
This time, I'll soak them boldly.

103
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,240
I won't be that cautious.

104
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,919
Make or break. Let's see!

105
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,399
Come on.

106
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,879
Some water too.

107
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,759
Feels like stir-frying.

108
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:58,912
♪I simply enjoy staying in your world♪

109
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:05,568
♪I once hoped you'd hold me to the end♪

110
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:09,504
♪Even if I had to start over♪

111
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:13,856
♪Even if I'm given endless choices♪

112
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:17,408
♪I will still♪

113
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:22,656
♪Break all the rules♪

114
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,360
Your Majesty.

115
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,559
Grand Tutor Wang's waiting
in the royal study.

116
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,519
Your Majesty.

117
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,639
Emergency reports.

118
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,279
Shaozhou has fallen.

119
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,759
Shaozhou too?

120
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,320
Yes.

121
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,640
I thought Shaozhou could hold on longer

122
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,000
until reinforcements arrived.

123
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,960
And now?

124
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,720
There is no barrier now.

125
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,600
How long will it take for reinforcements
to reroute to the capital?

126
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,320
They won't come.

127
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,559
Hanzhou, Shaozhou and Kangzhou
fell too quickly.

128
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,320
Reinforcements are advancing slower
even than ox carts.

129
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,439
They're all scheming,

130
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:33,440
betting the Wu Army will crush Chen.

131
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,639
They're hedging their futures.

132
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,920
I see.

133
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,639
Your Majesty.

134
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,240
I have not yet spread the news.

135
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,840
Please make haste.

136
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,199
We'll leave the palace tonight.

137
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,639
With you alive,

138
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,600
Chen State has hope.

139
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:55,600
And I'll face the former king
with dignity.

140
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,679
Your Majesty,
the carriage is waiting outside.

141
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,720
We must leave now.

142
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,360
It's late.

143
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,159
We'll talk tomorrow.

144
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,960
Your Majesty.

145
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,879
Your Majesty.

146
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,240
Are you alright?

147
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
What's wrong?

148
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,200
Your Majesty.

149
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,759
Nothing.

150
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,720
Your Majesty, what happened?

151
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,840
Did the Grand Tutor say something?

152
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,480
No.

153
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,720
He worried I'm overworked.

154
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,240
Life is fleeting

155
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
and plants live a season.

156
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,200
Caiyi.

157
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,639
How old are you?

158
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,080
How old am I?

159
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,720
Long Qi.

160
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,639
Calling someone "honey" is easy,

161
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,200
but calling that when you're old

162
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,360
might take a lifetime.

163
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,679
Your Majesty.

164
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,639
I don't understand.

165
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,200
Alright.

166
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,440
Say no more.

167
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,199
You two, just get married today.

168
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:41,888
What?

169
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,759
We can't.

170
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,159
- Caiyi,
- We...

171
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,399
what do you think?

172
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,120
Your Majesty.

173
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,759
Facing state crisis,

174
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,679
it is not the time for personal affairs.

175
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,440
I'm asking Caiyi.

176
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,440
I...

177
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,679
Don't you always say I'm dumb?

178
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,519
And you always say I'm rude.

179
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,320
I like

180
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,960
a rude woman like you.

181
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,799
I like

182
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,840
a man dumb like you.

183
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:44,840
Alright.

184
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,240
Now the enemy looms ahead,

185
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,399
so just skip those rituals.

186
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,960
If you two don't mind,

187
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,600
I will be the witness.

188
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,199
Just vow under the moon.

189
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,639
No, wait.

190
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,639
I've not prepared yet.

191
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,519
There are many marriage rituals.

192
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,320
Wedding gifts, proposals...

193
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,360
Caiyi,

194
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,559
what do you say?

195
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,040
I'm an orphan.

196
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,559
I don't know about these.

197
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,360
I was born into a royal family.

198
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,399
The rites

199
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,559
and customs

200
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,159
are so annoying.

201
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
In my opinion,

202
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,279
a woman's best dowry

203
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,159
is devotion.

204
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,679
A man's best pledge

205
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,639
is tolerance and companionship.

206
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,320
The most valuable things in the world

207
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,799
are all free.

208
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,679
Dark night.

209
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,480
I knew you were no ordinary maid.

210
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,479
Are you crazy? Why hit me?

211
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,159
Who are you? What do you want?

212
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,839
I'm the maid Xin Caiyi.

213
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,959
I'm protecting the king.

214
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:41,760
A maid?

215
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,879
A maid knows martial arts?

216
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,919
(What do you want to hear?)

217
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,320
Praise me for my beauty.

218
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,960
What?

219
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:32,279
I...

220
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,840
I think you are beautiful.

221
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,320
Who gave me a blanket?

222
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,559
You slept like a log
the first half of the night.

223
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,032
I feared you'd freeze to death.

224
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,240
(I like a rude woman like you.)

225
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,840
(I like a man dumb like you.)

226
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,720
(I attended a wedding
for the first time.)

227
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:14,039
(I realize getting married is
such a wonderful thing.)

228
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,240
I never imagined

229
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,839
my own wedding.

230
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,039
Me neither.

231
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,200
Alright.

232
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,319
Waste no time.

233
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,920
Go enjoy the night.

234
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,519
Honey.

235
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,200
I've done everything I can.

236
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,279
If you could see it,

237
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,359
you would also feel happy

238
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,519
for them,

239
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,359
right?

240
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,519
Tomorrow will be

241
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,599
the last day of this life again.

242
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,880
What should I do?

243
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,119
If you were here,

244
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,400
I know,

245
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,640
you'd make me face it head-on,

246
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,160
right?

247
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,519
Okay.

248
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,960
Go find Lady Zhen and Lady Bao.

249
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,359
I have things to tell them.

250
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,200
Okay.

251
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,400
Your Majesty.

252
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,680
Let me escort you out now.

253
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,400
Grand Tutor.

254
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,599
Rise first.

255
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,279
You promised to leave today.

256
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:58,799
If you don't leave,

257
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,279
I won't rise.

258
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,519
I didn't say I'd go today.

259
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,279
I said we'll talk.

260
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,440
Your Majesty.

261
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,480
We are outnumbered.

262
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,799
The capital will fall.

263
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,360
The Wu Army is less than 100 li
from the capital.

264
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,839
Now is the best time to leave!

265
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,039
Grand Tutor, please rise.

266
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,240
Your Majesty.

267
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,039
Please listen to me just this once.

268
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,039
As a king,

269
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,839
I can't even order my minister to rise?

270
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,200
If so, how can I save Chen?

271
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,720
Please rise.

272
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,160
Rise.

273
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,839
Alright.

274
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,319
I know it all.

275
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,720
Just follow me.

276
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,400
Alright.

277
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,240
Defend the city as planned.

278
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,799
Gather the soldiers.

279
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,119
We will discuss in an hour.

280
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,240
Yes.

281
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,680
You're all here.

282
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,720
Long Qi,

283
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,720
Caiyi.

284
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,119
You are skilled in martial arts.

285
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,160
Escort the three ladies out,

286
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,559
please.

287
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,880
Now.

288
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,759
And you, Your Majesty?

289
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,480
I will leave after arranging the defense

290
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,279
with the Grand Tutor.

291
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,560
After we finish the discussion,

292
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,080
we'll join you.

293
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,799
Your Majesty, please keep your words.

294
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,800
No need. We are good.

295
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,200
We don't need an escort.

296
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,519
I will stay.

297
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,200
Let Caiyi go escort them.

298
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,200
Long Qi.

299
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,599
These are my consorts.

300
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,839
I'd be worried if you don't go.

301
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:53,640
Your Majesty,

302
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
we'll do as you say.

303
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:58,319
Long Qi and I will escort
the ladies out first.

304
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,599
Alright.

305
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:03,440
Go now.

306
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,440
Your Majesty.

307
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,519
Why didn't you say a word of farewell?

308
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,439
What else can I say?

309
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,559
Your Majesty!

310
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,560
Your Majesty.

311
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,440
The enemy has passed

312
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,679
Tiger Roar Valley

313
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:38,800
and is heading here.

314
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,479
They'll

315
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,359
reach us at dusk.

316
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,960
Grand Tutor.

317
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,640
Leave with your family

318
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,039
now.

319
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,959
Your Majesty, I was born
and raised here.

320
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,039
If you stay,

321
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,160
how can I leave?

322
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,440
I would never.

323
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,799
Sound the alarm.

324
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,279
Be on alert.

325
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,679
Prepare for battle.

326
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,440
Understood.

327
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,440
This time,

328
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,880
the Wu Army is truly here.

329
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,079
Let's greet them with dignity.

330
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,959
No! Please don't do that!

331
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:45,799
Your Majesty.

332
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,680
I'm not worthy!

333
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,519
I must.

334
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,119
You're my teacher.

335
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,599
I'm only kneeling

336
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,720
before my teacher.

337
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,160
Your Majesty, please rise.

338
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,519
Give it! This is mine!

339
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:31,400
Don't grab it!

340
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:32,840
Let go!

341
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,719
Run!

342
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,680
Run!

343
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,074
We must hurry!

344
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,440
Take your belongings

345
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:50,880
and go.

346
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

347
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:56,736
- Hurry!
- Quick!

348
00:26:10,797 --> 00:26:13,248
They're coming! Run!

349
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:16,096
We need to hurry!

350
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,336
- Run!
- The enemy is coming!

351
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:19,760
Give it!

352
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,400
- Officer, please!
- Now!

353
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,439
- Don't take them all!
- Let go!

354
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,079
Go!

355
00:26:28,953 --> 00:26:31,424
- There's no time!
- Quick!

356
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,182
- They're coming!
- Quick!

357
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Run!

358
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
Run! The Wu Army is coming!

359
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:44,851
- Hurry!
- Quick!

360
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,319
Your Majesty.

361
00:26:47,776 --> 00:26:51,341
- Hurry!
- This way!

362
00:27:05,178 --> 00:27:07,186
- Hurry!
- Quick!

363
00:27:12,352 --> 00:27:15,726
- Quick!
- They're coming!

364
00:27:21,952 --> 00:27:26,079
- Hurry!
- There's nothing left!

365
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,920
This battle is bound to be lost.

366
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,160
This is your final chance to escape.

367
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:57,599
You are all loyal soldiers of Chen.

368
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,200
You have families to take care of.

369
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,200
Don't waste your lives.

370
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,880
Go.

371
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,759
Grand Tutor.

372
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,240
Let them go.

373
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,559
Thank you, Your Majesty.

374
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,880
Since there's a chance to live,

375
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,200
why throw away your life?

376
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,240
Your Majesty.

377
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:39,440
In the end, it is just

378
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
you and me.

379
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,680
Learn the truth at dawn,

380
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,519
and die content by dusk.

381
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,160
You taught me that.

382
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,599
Doctor, help me.

383
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:02,839
I want to go in.

384
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,959
Mr. Wu will not allow you

385
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,039
to do that again.

386
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,680
I don't care!

387
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,759
I can't let him face all this
by himself.

388
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:12,759
He doesn't know

389
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,559
this is his final life.

390
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,960
Calm down, Jiang Tao.

391
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,320
Even if you go in now,

392
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,999
what can you change?

393
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,199
Be the Warrioress
to fend off the Wu Army for him?

394
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,200
His neural values will crash to zero.

395
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,440
He will die immediately.

396
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,319
Wake up.

397
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,920
You won't save him,

398
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:35,880
and you'll lose everything you have.

399
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,999
Don't forget what your boss said.

400
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:41,160
If you leave Lannao Company,

401
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,279
what will you do with your life?

402
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,440
Even if he will die,

403
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,240
I want to be with him.

404
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,599
What's the point?

405
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,400
He will still die.

406
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,880
But you have a future!

407
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,319
Maybe we were wrong from the start.

408
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,920
He should've stayed in Shangyao Village,

409
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,039
living humbly as he wished.

410
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,880
Digital immortality

411
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:10,000
is the best fit for him.

412
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,519
Everyone has their own fate.

413
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,680
