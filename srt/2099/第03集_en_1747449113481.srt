00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:13,960
What's going on?

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,280
Explain it to me.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,120
Wang, I suspect that she's a fake maid.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,840
A real assassin.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,960
Wang, what did she say?

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,240
Oh no, she's going to die.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,440
I can't let you take her away.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,640
I was the one who stopped her.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,240
Otherwise, the assassination would have been successful.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,800
I haven't called you your true identity.

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,640
You...

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,840
Shut up!

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
If I wasn't smart,

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,000
I would have died a hundred times.

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,000
It has nothing to do with you.

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,800
Tell me, Ban Nian Yan.

19
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,120
What's going on?

20
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,800
Tell me.

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,320
Who are you?

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,360
Even if I tell you, you won't believe me.

23
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,480
If you don't tell us,

24
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,680
how do you know we won't believe you?

25
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,800
I wouldn't have left alive anyway.

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
I'm a knife buried in the State of Chen.

27
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,160
I've been lurking in the State of Chen for ten years.

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,480
I've been waiting for an order for ten years.

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,760
That is, to kill you, the King of Chen.

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,280
To make the State of Chen in chaos.

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
To contribute to the strength of our State of Wu.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Interesting.

33
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,320
What are you going to do after killing me?

34
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,200
What should I do?

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,320
I killed the King of Chen in the State of Chen.

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,440
Of course, I won't be alive.

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,360
It's a joke.

38
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,280
Joke?

39
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,520
How could you win

40
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,960
with me around?

41
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,960
Speaking of which, why did you save me?

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,680
Because you're stupid.

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,560
I think it's better for you to keep Wu.

44
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,600
Makes sense.

45
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,920
What are you waiting for?

46
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,480
Do it.

47
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,360
Hong Xin, he's trying to frame me.

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,680
Kill him.

49
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,200
Kill him.

50
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,960
What do you mean?

51
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,800
Do you think they're right?

52
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,920
You're not afraid of death?

53
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,720
You've ruined Wu State.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,120
You'll never die.

55
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,320
Do you dare to

56
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
bet with me?

57
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,400
Chen Xiaohua won't keep being stupid.

58
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,160
He will become a famous king of the State of Chen.

59
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,880
He will lead the State of Chen to conquer Wu State.

60
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,880
From my observation, it's impossible.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,680
Do you dare to bet with me?

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,880
What's the bet?

63
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,440
You'll be my personal maid.

64
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,880
If the King is in danger,

65
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,200
you'll protect him.

66
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,160
So you won't kill me?

67
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,840
Yes, I won't kill you.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,200
If you win, you'll be rewarded.

69
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
If I win,

70
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,520
it doesn't matter if you die or not.

71
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,880
Okay.

72
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,920
From today on,

73
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,720
I'll train you.

74
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,280
What training?

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,880
Very cruel training.

76
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,960
Lord, see him out.

77
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

78
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,160
Nothing.

79
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,660
Was he즈

80
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,120
Questioning

81
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,660
A secret letter

82
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Another book says

83
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,760
A new story

84
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,620
one who sticks to the Maiden Paragraph

85
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,100
The town.

86
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,360
After many years

87
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
Yes.

88
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:52,840
Someone should be texture and

89
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,640
I'm sure you have the potential

90
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,840
to be his descendant.

91
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,320
Today, let's see

92
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,320
where your potential is.

93
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,400
What are you practicing here?

94
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,600
Nothing.

95
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,680
Just to cure your laziness.

96
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,240
It's a good time to live.

97
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,040
Then you don't know

98
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,680
how lazy I am.

99
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,980
Supervisor Xia is coming.

100
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,300
Put me down.

101
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,900
Put me down?

102
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,840
Me?

103
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,580
Zhou Thank you.

104
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,400
Hello.

105
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,140
I'm Zhou Zining's superiors.

106
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,980
Please give my send-off back.

107
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,220
I'm a general.

108
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,420
What?

109
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,700
You never take orders from each other?

110
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,820
A general who has the disruptor.

111
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,340
And someone who has a fractions a check.

112
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,740
What is that group of people?

113
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,300
It's the general in Music.

114
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,300
These fools...

115
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
Yes.

116
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,900
What does he want?

117
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,060
How ridiculous!

118
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,620
How ridiculous!

119
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,060
Under the bright sun,

120
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,220
he provoked the enemy.

121
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,380
Where is the dignity of the man?

122
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,060
Where is the prestige of the king?

123
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,380
This training

124
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,140
is called me throwing you to the street.

125
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,940
Throwers and catchers

126
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,580
stand three to four meters away.

127
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,020
Throwers can change the direction and height

128
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,820
and catchers can catch the ball.

129
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,460
This training

130
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,460
is mainly to train

131
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,020
your cooperation and coordination.

132
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,820
It's not easy.

133
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,980
It's not easy.

134
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,260
Oh.

135
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,900
Actually,

136
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,900
I can remember everything you throw.

137
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,900
How about

138
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,380
you throw peanuts?

139
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,860
I'll use my mouth to pick it up.

140
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,660
How do you feel?

141
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,100
Come.

142
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,220
Stop!

143
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,220
The funeral is a serious matter.

144
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,220
Where is the dignity of the man and woman?

145
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,220
Where is the rank of the king?

146
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,220
Doctor, please protect me.

147
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,220
Guards!

148
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Take this demoness away!

149
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,220
Take her away!

150
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,220
Take her away!

151
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
You...

152
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,220
You...

153
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,220
Doctor.

154
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,220
My wife and I are exercising here.

155
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,220
Why don't you go back first?

156
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,220
Since it's like this,

157
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,220
I'll take my leave.

158
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,220
Do as you wish.

159
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,220
Doctor.

160
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,220
Doctor.

161
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,220
Guards!

162
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,220
Guards!

163
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,220
Guards!

164
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,220
Guards!

165
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,220
Guards!

166
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,860
You...

167
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,860
Stand further away.

168
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,220
Your Highness!

169
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,180
This is too far.

170
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,180
Are you sure?

171
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,180
Where are you aiming?

172
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,180
I think

173
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,180
it's anungen Studies Search.

174
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,180
Three dots can't be connected.

175
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,100
Let's go.

176
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,700
Close your left eye and open your right eye.

177
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,860
No.

178
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,180
No. No. No.

179
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,940
It's too hard to shoot arrows.

180
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,420
It doesn't suit me.

181
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,060
I can't do it.

182
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:39,860
Brother.

183
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,620
Keep practicing.

184
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,700
Go and find the best way to kill Chen.

185
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,380
Tell him

186
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,980
I want to eat fish.

187
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,180
Yes.

188
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,980
Let me know

189
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,380
what you ate today.

190
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,660
Boiled chicken.

191
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,060
Boiled chicken.

192
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,740
Boiled chicken.

193
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Boiled chicken with mushroom.

194
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,380
Tomato and beef.

195
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,300
Forget it.

196
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,700
It hurts again and again.

197
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,140
It's like a ghost.

198
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,500
Let me see what you ate today.

199
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,500
I'm afraid you won't be able to

200
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,900
avoid the poison at all.

201
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,540
Your Majesty.

202
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,540
This

203
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,820
is made by my wife.

204
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,100
It's called

205
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,860
health and fruit juice.

206
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,300
What juice?

207
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,500
It's like

208
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,060
an apple

209
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,460
with some weeds in the garden.

210
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,940
It's stinging.

211
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,660
It's stinging.

212
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,060
It's stinging.

213
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,700
My wife said

214
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,140
it's stinging.

215
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,180
You have to drink it yourself.

216
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,540
Xiao Fu,

217
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,140
you're a tiger.

218
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,740
Do you really think I dare not resist?

219
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,420
She's a big man.

220
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,460
She's a big man?

221
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,060
I...

222
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,340
I can't beat her.

223
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,580
I can't just

224
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,340
be angry on the ground.

225
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,180
You're great.

226
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,700
Madam Xiao is in the study.

227
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,860
In the study.

228
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,020
In the study.

229
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,420
Long Qing.

230
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:20,900
Come on.

231
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,420
Find me a place to stay.

232
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,420
No.

233
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,180
I expected you to sell me.

234
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,340
How could I sell you?

235
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,780
I'm the master of the country.

236
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,700
Do I have to be in the study?

237
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,700
Didn't you go to find a place to stay?

238
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,620
Didn't you?

239
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,780
Well,

240
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,260
you're right.

241
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,500
But the Grand Tutor taught me

242
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,780
that a good man can't fight with a woman.

243
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,460
Besides,

244
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,380
she's my wife.

245
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,300
What should I call her?

246
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,580
You're too narrow-minded.

247
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,780
You can't fight with women

248
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,580
with your ambition.

249
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,700
But

250
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,700
Grand Tutor is a famous female actor.

251
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,140
Can we be the same?

252
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,620
She's a real female actor.

253
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,460
I'm poor and white.

254
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:03,980
I can't do it.

255
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,620
I can't do it either.

256
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,900
So I can only eat the food of the Zhang family.

257
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,020
I think about it.

258
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,580
To turn the situation around,

259
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,780
we can only rely on our ambition.

260
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,980
You want to eat the food of the Zhang family?

261
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,700
Bullshit.

262
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,260
I want my wife to love me

263
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,420
and admire me.

264
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,660
Do you know

265
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,900
how a man can win a woman?

266
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,740
He can only rely on enough money and money.

267
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,540
But I'm not.

268
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,740
I only need...

269
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,260
Money.

270
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,060
Right.

271
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:30,860
So,

272
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,060
instead of fighting with her,

273
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,100
why don't we have a meeting?

274
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,820
Let's have a meeting and talk about the family's fortune.

275
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,660
I'm afraid she won't listen to me.

276
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,500
It's hard to say.

277
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,660
It's easy to say.

278
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,300
How about this?

279
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,980
You go to see Uncle.

280
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,820
I'll go to the meeting.

281
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,700
But, Wang,

282
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,260
where are you going to the meeting?

283
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,820
The mountain people have their own tricks.

284
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,900
Again.

285
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,940
Why are you playing so hard at night?

286
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,740
It's so late.

287
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,420
This is the lock of the National Treasury.

288
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,420
We don't care.

289
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,700
What do you care?

290
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,820
They are in their own house.

291
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,180
But the Treasury is not a national treasury.

292
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,220
Those who break into the Treasury

293
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,660
will be punished by death.

294
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,420
Isn't this making trouble for me?

295
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,380
What's so good about the Treasury?

296
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,140
Let's go.

297
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,140
What?

298
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,020
The Treasury is so empty.

299
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,820
Wow, the Great Chen lair is so translatorless.

300
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,820
You're really responsible for that.

301
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,500
Go on with your taboos.

302
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,900
I just saw someone

303
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,060
coming to the Treasury passing by.

304
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,340
You're too old.

305
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,980
Now,

306
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,180
I can only admit that

307
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,820
it's me.

308
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,420
You didn't expect that, right?

309
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,780
I know it's you.

310
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,940
Otherwise, I would have taken you down.

311
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,780
How did you know?

312
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,260
There are more stupid people

313
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,780
in this imperial palace.

314
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,980
You're also in the imperial palace.

315
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,860
I hate it when people say something stupid.

316
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,980
Let's change the word.

317
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,100
For example,

318
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,900
simple-minded.

319
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,980
Simple-minded?

320
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,460
Little brat.

321
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,700
Why are you playing with me?

322
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,460
Why didn't you sleep in the middle of the night and come to the imperial palace?

323
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,060
Tell me.

324
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,180
What's your conspiracy?

325
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,740
I don't have any conspiracy.

326
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,620
This imperial palace is cleaner than my face.

327
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,420
What can I do?

328
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,660
lonely.

329
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,460
Are you looking for flying loan letters from Chuang saders?

330
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,660
Playing with what?

331
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,220
Playing with using?

332
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,140
You're easier than some people33

333
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,100
on a non-sleeping night

334
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,380
and come to maintain the 우리가.

335
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,460
Are you just playing carelessly?

336
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,060
I...

337
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,020
I...

338
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:29,780
Okay.

339
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,420
If I don't accept this, I'll tell everyone

340
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,820
that you arrived at the empire

341
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,700
The city that was lost

342
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,700
because of the lack of provisions

343
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,100
will be yours.

344
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,500
I'd like to see

345
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,180
how that old-fashioned woman

346
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,220
will stop Youyou

347
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,340
from winning the battle.

348
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,820
I'm so scared.

349
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,860
I thought I was going to be caught.

350
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,460
Why didn't you tell them the truth?

351
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,860
Why are you here?

352
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,660
Where's Long Qing?

353
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,460
I'm here.

354
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,420
What's Madam Xiao

355
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,340
thinking about?

356
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,060
I guess she's worried about His Majesty.

357
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,540
Your Majesty,

358
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,100
you must stand up.

359
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,580
What's the truth?

360
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,100
What's your conspiracy?

361
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,060
What conspiracy?

362
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,660
Chen Xiaohui,

363
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,820
aren't you here to donate money?

364
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,660
Donate money?

365
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,260
What money?

366
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,540
Where did I get the money?

367
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,540
You have it.

368
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,060
My money.

369
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,180
You're killing me.

370
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,660
You're even trying to be a star.

371
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,180
I was going to donate money anonymously.

372
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,540
But you found out about it.

373
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,300
Yeah.

374
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,580
I'm doing this for the country and the people.

375
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,180
I'm worried.

376
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:01,980
Chen Xiaohui,

377
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,300
what makes you think

378
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,020
you can say such nonsense for the country and the people?

379
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:09,820
I...

380
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,260
You go.

381
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,580
You go.

382
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,380
Actually,

383
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,820
it's not impossible.

384
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,660
I think

385
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,940
His Majesty is sincere.

386
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,260
After all, we don't have

387
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,580
any evidence of his involvement.

388
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,780
Besides, His Majesty even made some private...

389
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,980
private donations.

390
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,380
There are five people here.

391
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,820
Some people think

392
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,420
His Majesty didn't do it on purpose.

393
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,620
Instead, he donated money anonymously.

394
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,060
It's clear who's right and who's wrong.

395
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,860
Very good.

396
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,940
Every daughter of our family

397
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,500
is like Chen Xiaohui.

398
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,460
Then please be generous and help us

399
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,820
to save the country.

400
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,620
So that our family

401
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,300
can live in the treasury every year.

402
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,260
We can support all the people

403
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,220
of Wangping.

404
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,260
distance is similar to length of apartment.

405
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,340
So, everyone of you

406
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,740
and people like me

407
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,380
should always keep distance.

408
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:08,980
Alright.

409
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,700
Yes.

410
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,300
Yay!

411
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,260
We郢 all realize

412
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,260
Your Highness.

413
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,980
I wanted to use this to threaten him

414
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,140
and let him know the purpose of staying in the Treasury.

415
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,700
I'm afraid that he might find out

416
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,940
some clues about the jade seal.

417
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,340
It's a big deal.

418
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,540
The jade seal will be the best.

419
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,740
But you

420
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,340
have only been busy for a few days.

421
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,260
You must have been thinking about helping your husband.

422
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,740
We don't dare to do that.

423
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,980
But Uncle told us

424
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,620
to gain the King's trust as soon as possible

425
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,820
and get pregnant as soon as possible.

426
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,020
We can only be the King's people.

427
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,660
My good brother

428
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,980
is a good fighter.

429
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,700
I'm afraid that Chen Xiaohua

430
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,380
is a bad-for-nothing.

431
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,380
She can't give birth to a child.

432
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,220
I think you

433
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,460
are also living in a living hell.

434
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,500
Go back.

435
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,620
Yes.

436
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,900
Ask someone to dig up the Treasury

437
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,260
from top to bottom.

438
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,980
I want to see

439
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,540
what's the secret.

440
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,940
I'm afraid that

441
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,260
the King's people

442
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,500
will use this opportunity to impeach him.

443
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,300
Impeach him?

444
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,380
If the old man wants to impeach him,

445
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,540
let him do it.

446
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,500
It's about the jade seal.

447
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,240
There must be a big

448
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,620
and small man to help me.

449
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,660
What if I burn him?

450
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,700
Yes.

451
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,780
Say something.

452
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,020
You are very violent.

453
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:50,980
What?

454
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,140
I'll give you the jade seal.

455
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,060
No need.

456
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,660
You are really good at talking.

457
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,660
You can even do this by stealing the treasury.

458
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,500
No.

459
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,180
I just want to

460
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,940
steal two treasures.

461
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,060
Two are not enough.

462
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,660
Just one.

463
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,300
The poor and the rich.

464
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,380
Think about it.

465
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,660
If one day

466
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,500
we can't live in the Imperial Court,

467
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,300
we will be in a mess.

468
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,260
But I mean it.

469
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,620
I really don't want to take much.

470
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,180
I just want to take this

471
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,060
and live a peaceful life.

472
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,100
But who knows

473
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,740
the country is so poor.

474
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,740
The treasury is empty.

475
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,100
No.

476
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,860
The treasury is empty.

477
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,540
Then we will have no money.

478
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,540
If we really have no money,

479
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,820
we can't manage my food.

480
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,740
I can't even afford to eat.

481
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,580
What can I do

482
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,260
as the puppet king?

483
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:47,860
What can I do?

484
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:48,860
Really.

485
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,180
Wait.

486
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,860
No.

487
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,380
Where is Long Qi?

488
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,300
Didn't I tell Long Qi to watch you?

489
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,660
What do you mean?

490
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:04,940
What do you mean?

491
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,380
No.

492
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,420
Even if you are my wife,

493
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,060
but you are my brother,

494
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,220
I...

495
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,500
Long Qi.

496
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,780
Long Qi.

497
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,540
Long Qi.

498
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,340
Long Qi.

499
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,300
Long Qi.

500
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:20,980
What?

501
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,700
You are back.

502
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:30,940
Yes.

503
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,580
I was thinking

504
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,420
you haven't cleaned your clothes.

505
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,380
I can't sleep.

506
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,180
So I...

507
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,860
Then you should go to bed early.

508
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,860
I'll leave now.

509
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,220
The man's private room.

510
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,940
Zuo Zuo will definitely have it.

511
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:20,780
No.

512
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,540
I must have opened it in the wrong way.

513
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,700
Is it

514
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,780
that it's not formal enough?

515
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,900
It's not in the spell.

516
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,300
All the fantasies

517
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,860
can be repeated.

518
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,700
Cai Ji.

519
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,420
Let go.

520
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,660
Let's go and have a look.

521
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,260
No.

522
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,380
Why is it finally out of the spell?

523
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,180
I did say Cai Ji.

524
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,140
One more time.

525
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:08,940
Go.

526
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,500
Go.

527
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,100
Go.

528
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,020
Go.

529
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,540
Open.

530
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,820
Where is the wrong way?

531
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,700
Cai Ji.

532
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,940
Go away.

533
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,260
Long Qi.

534
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,180
Leng Ru.

535
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,740
I'm destined to be with you.

536
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,620
I'm not born to be with you.

537
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,860
I'm as pure as the green.

538
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,820
I'm as pure as the honey.

539
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,540
Cai Ji.

540
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,700
Go away.

541
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,780
I love drinking.

542
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,980
You Fei.

543
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,340
You Fei.

544
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,220
Cai Ji.

545
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,580
Cai Ji.

546
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,740
What's the matter?

547
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,580
Give me back my dragon.

548
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,540
Give me back my dragon.

549
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,020
It's noisy.

550
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,180
It's gone.

551
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,620
It's all gone.

552
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,060
It's empty.

553
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,660
My brother is still alive.

554
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,500
Xie Fu'er is still a monster.

555
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,660
He's really a talent.

556
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,100
Zhou Yu is useless.

557
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,580
Maybe he's not in danger.

558
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,540
Fine.

559
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,700
Since that's the case.

560
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,460
It's okay.

561
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,540
It's not a big deal.

562
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,540
Close your eyes and turn around.

563
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,540
Open your eyes again.

564
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,340
You'll get everything you want.

565
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,940
You'll get everything you want.

566
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,180
The dragon is back.

567
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,540
The bacon is back.

568
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,540
Maybe Xie Fu'er...

569
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,740
Xie Fu'er is also in danger.

570
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,980
Wait.

571
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,420
My mother said

572
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,020
money is precious.

573
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,420
Life is expensive.

574
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,300
If I don't get back what I lost,

575
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,220
I'll be in a big trouble.

576
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,500
Forget it.

577
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,140
I'll think of something else.

578
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,300
Rongqi.

579
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,660
Wang.

580
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,500
I've been reading it for so long.

581
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,660
I really don't understand

582
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,020
what you're playing.

583
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,140
What am I playing?

584
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,820
I'm playing with your head.

585
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,980
Wait.

586
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,380
Where did you go?

587
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,700
I thought you...

588
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:58,940
No.

589
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,580
I told you to look at Mrs. Xiao.

590
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,380
Where are you?

591
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,580
I was looking at Mrs. Xiao.

592
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,180
I was staring at her room.

593
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,380
I didn't even see a fly.

594
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,180
Bullshit.

595
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,060
She's been flying around in the palace.

596
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,180
Forget it.

597
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,620
She can do magic.

598
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,460
You can't see it.

599
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:19,980
But

600
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,300
it takes courage to commit suicide.

601
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,340
Everyone knows that

602
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,540
Chen Xiaohua is the least courageous.

603
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,260
Committing suicide?

604
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,580
I've been reading it for so long.

605
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,340
I didn't expect that.

606
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,020
Not only you didn't expect it,

607
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,700
Chen Xiaohua didn't expect it either.

608
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,460
Damn it.

609
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,380
Who made me end up like this?

610
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,140
I'll break her into pieces.

611
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,580
I...

612
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,260
I...

613
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,940
Call her!

614
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,420
She's been screaming all night.

615
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,580
Can you let her sleep?

616
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,940
Lu Qi.

617
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,380
What's that?

618
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,260
What's that?

619
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,020
What's engraved on it?

620
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,980
It's the land of Dancunfang Village.

621
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,500
The land of Dancunfang Village.

622
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,220
She's so mysterious.

623
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,380
She's so suspicious.

624
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,100
Is it possible that she's

625
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,940
taking a word to describe the Zisun River?

626
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,020
Zisun River?

627
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,460
Isn't it the meaning of the seventh?

628
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,940
The seventh?

629
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,580
That's great.

630
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,740
Someone sent me a needle when I was in the room.

631
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,860
With the land,

632
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,940
I won't be in danger.

633
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,700
Your Highness, be careful.

634
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,740
Your Highness, are you all right?

635
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,580
I'm fine.

636
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,260
It's just...

637
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:54,340
The

638
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:41,900
Okay.

639
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,100
Dr. Pei.

640
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,100
Jiang Tao.

641
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,020
Why are you here?

642
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,900
That dog was Mr. Wu's dog, right?

643
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,380
Yes.

644
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,540
He's adopted.

645
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,060
Come in.

646
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,340
Come in and have a seat.

647
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:09,980
Okay.

648
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,620
Come on.

649
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,900
Come on.

650
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,820
Jiang Tao.

651
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,700
What are you doing here?

652
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,980
I want to ask you

653
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,100
about the Human Life Plan.

654
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:51,780
Please.

655
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,500
Your experiment

656
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,860
has been applied to my department

657
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,300
as a real person.

658
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,340
I've read the data.

659
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Your experiment

660
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,500
has reached

661
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,700
the standard of real people.

662
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,180
You and our company, Blue Brain,

663
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,220
have developed

664
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,460
the game of the infinite life virtual plan

665
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,420
of the universe.

666
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,220
It's an experiment, not a game.

667
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:18,780
Okay.

668
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,580
Experiment.

669
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,380
Humans can transfer their will

670
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,780
to this experiment

671
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,540
to achieve real life.

672
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,740
It will make the infinite life

673
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,820
infinitely longer.

674
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,980
The population density of the earth

675
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,180
has reached a saturation.

676
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,900
But

677
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,460
there are still 38% of people

678
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,540
who die from radiation sickness every year.

679
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,900
Many people

680
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,020
are living in the process of nothingness.

681
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,780
In our game,

682
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,780
we can let them

683
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,260
live the life they want

684
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,140
and become the people they want to be.

685
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,940
This is the purpose of the game

686
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,940
that you and our company, Blue Brain,

687
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,540
right?

688
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,700
What do you mean?

689
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,180
I'm thinking

690
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,380
since we can transfer our consciousness

691
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,540
to the game

692
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,180
and then complete the adventure

693
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,300
through our consciousness,

694
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,780
can this process

695
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,580
help humans

696
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,620
to repair the brain?

697
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,380
What do you want to tell me?

698
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,220
YoYo English Channel YouTube

699
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,540
If time stop

700
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:12,540
Is it you in the outline of the dream?

701
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,540
The result of the cycle of events

702
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,540
Repeating the impulse

703
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,540
Is happiness

704
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:32,540
Your smile hasn't appeared recently

705
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:39,540
How I wish you were in the clear picture

706
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,540
The way you and I exist

707
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:47,540
The lost story

708
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:52,540
For you, it's not far

709
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:59,540
Just like this, willing to enjoy every day

710
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:06,540
Imagine we have a lot of, a lot of tomorrow

711
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:14,540
I'm used to the wind you gave me for so many years

712
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:19,540
I take what I hear to reach the end

713
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:26,540
Just like this, willing to accompany you in your world

714
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:33,540
I wish one day you can take me to the end

715
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,540
Even if it's a new start

716
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,540
Give me ten thousand choices

717
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:49,540
Or do I have to be buried in the back?
