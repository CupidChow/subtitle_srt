Detroiters

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,940
season 11

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,400
If you can't get through the gate,

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,600
you can't repair the神经元.

5
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,720
It's just a waste of resources.

6
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Someone came here to hurt you?

7
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,560
How can you inform you

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,720
about the crime and the Got nothin' to do with it?

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,740
It's good.

10
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,760
I should have just escaped first.

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,980
Tutor immortal

12
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,340
The begginer,

13
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,060
Please input the urgent training center in thirty seconds.

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,240
Otherwise they will start the alarm device

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,640
In sea and system

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,000
Emergency training center

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,740
They've got ten seconds before the alarm

18
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,940
Seven seconds.

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,260
Six seconds.

20
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,700
Five seconds.

21
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,180
Four seconds.

22
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,580
Three seconds.

23
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,820
Two seconds.

24
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,660
Without my red devil certification,

25
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,740
you can't enter the system.

26
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,660
Are you going to help him pass the test?

27
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,260
I can't watch him like this.

28
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,740
I won't do anything.

29
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,780
First, no one can change the game's script.

30
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,420
Even I can't.

31
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,980
Second, you help him solve the difficulties he faces.

32
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,860
It changes the way we make him face difficulties.

33
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,060
Solving the difficulties.

34
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,820
That's the essence of this.

35
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,660
If you want to save him,

36
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,460
you can only make him face difficulties alone.

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,780
And finally wake up.

38
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,100
But now it seems

39
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,220
it's too hard for him.

40
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,900
I always think you're a rational person.

41
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,260
You should understand that there are too many people

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,980
in this world who are as lucky as him.

43
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,540
Every day, every hour, every moment,

44
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,700
some people die because of radiation.

45
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,020
Everyone must live on.

46
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,300
One day after another.

47
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,500
Doctor, you don't want your experiment to end so soon, do you?

48
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,540
You also want to see him

49
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,780
repair the brain nerve in your experiment, right?

50
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,180
This will be a great achievement for the civilization.

51
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,220
Let me go in

52
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,500
and choose the strongest supporting role.

53
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,100
For example,

54
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,940
for example, Goddess of Dance.

55
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,300
Okay.

56
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,220
But you can't use the special skills of Goddess of Dance to help him.

57
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,060
I know.

58
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,420
I will only use the role of Goddess of Dance

59
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,900
to guide him

60
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,420
to face difficulties and solve them.

61
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,020
If that's the case, it's doable.

62
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,220
Do you know where the boundary is?

63
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,780
I know. I know it very well.

64
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,660
I want to say one more thing.

65
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,420
Why do you insist on doing all this?

66
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,980
You should understand that

67
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,900
as the manager of the core project of the brain brain group,

68
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,100
you have enough conditions to live on.

69
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,500
Even after a short time,

70
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,980
you have better survival conditions.

71
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,060
Do you think it's a mistake?

72
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,700
About what?

73
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,860
Why?

74
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,620
Why are you asking me?

75
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,700
I don't want to say it.

76
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,060
You don't want to say it?

77
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,900
I just breastfeed them.

78
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,860
So I...

79
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,380
You just...

80
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,620
You just breastfeed them.

81
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,980
My brand is Medx.

82
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
I just...

83
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,640
I'm worried about him.

84
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,320
I just want to confirm his gender.

85
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,760
I can control him.

86
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
The female god of martial arts.

87
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,760
It is necessary to remind you that after entering that world, all players will lose the foundation of the real world.

88
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,720
The

89
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
Where are you taking me?

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Cold Palace.

91
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
To save Chen Xiaohua.

92
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Are you sure you want to save her?

93
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Although she is the eldest son of the former king, she has never been out of the Cold Palace.

94
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
I have also given her a chance.

95
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
But she is waiting for death all day long.

96
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
She has never done anything that is beneficial to the country.

97
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,680
She will only be happy.

98
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,680
I am sure that as long as she is released and returned to her throne,

99
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,680
she will focus on the government and lead the country.

100
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,680
All right.

101
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
It is enough to have you.

102
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
But you should not forget to promise me.

103
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
In case there is no country to break.

104
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,680
In case there is no country to break.

105
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,680
I promise you.

106
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
The former king.

107
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
You are right.

108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Izo.

109
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
The remaining chimneys.

110
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,720
I'm not sure if I can do it.

111
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm not sure if I can do it.

112
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,720
I'm not sure if I can do it.

I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
I'm not sure if I can do it.

I'm not sure if I can do it.

I'm not sure if I can do it.

I'm not sure if I can do it.

I'm not sure if I can do it.

129
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720

Honey,

144
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
do you think

145
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
I'm a failure?

146
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
No.

147
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
You've got the people of Chen

148
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,720
to come to Dayu

149
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
and punish the corrupt officials for them.

150
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
But the ministers

151
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
are usually

152
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
caught and chopped.

155
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
If it's really

156
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,720
like what Eunuch Li said,

will be in the capital in less than half a month.

159
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Do you regret checking the accounts?

160
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
No.

161
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Because the Qi Yu scene

162
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,720
is the first time in my life

163
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
I've seen your conviction.

164
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
This is definitely

165
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
the most important thing in my life.

166
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
For you,

167
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
I'm willing to do anything.

168
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,720
For you,

169
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
I want to make Chen State strong

170
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
and conquer the Five Kingdoms.

171
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Then,

172
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
I'll go to the Ten-Nine Heavens with you.

173
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
It's over.

174
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
But what if

175
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,720
we can't conquer the Five Kingdoms?

176
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,720
In my eyes,

177
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Chen State is like this lake.

178
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
I

179
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,720
watch them from afar

180
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
and see them

181
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,720
fight for power and power.

182
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,720
But I don't care.

183
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
I don't care

184
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,720
what they do.

185
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Because in my opinion,

186
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
I'll leave here sooner or later.

187
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Leave this lake

188
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
and not be the king.

189
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Do you still think so?

190
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Now I realize

191
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,720
I'm not standing by the shore.

192
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
I'm like them.

193
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
I can't get out of this lake.

194
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
When I have the courage

195
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
to look at this lake,

196
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,720
I find it's about to

197
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
disappear.

198
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
The lake is always there.

199
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
As long as you have the courage to face it,

200
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
everything is not over.

201
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Everything is not over.

202
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Really?

203
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
I believe you.

204
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Wife.

205
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Remember.

206
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
No matter what happens,

207
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,720
I'll be with you.

208
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Your Majesty,

209
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Grand Tutor Wang wants to see you.

210
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Your Majesty.

211
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Your Majesty.

212
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
I'm guilty.

213
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
I read the book.

214
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
I read more than half of the book.

215
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
I read the book.

216
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
I read the book.

217
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,720
I read the book.

218
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,720
I read the book.

219
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
I'm guilty.

220
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,720
I'm guilty, Your Majesty.

221
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Forget it.

222
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,720
Let's call it a day.

223
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Your Majesty.

224
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
I've made up my mind.

225
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Tomorrow morning,

226
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
I'll resign

227
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
all the things in the court

228
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
and retire.

229
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Grand Tutor, you can't go.

230
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Your Majesty.

231
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm guilty, too.

232
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
I was reckless.

233
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
I misjudged and misjudged.

234
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
I misjudged.

235
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
I'm willing to give up all my military power

236
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
and let you deal with it.

237
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,720
You...

238
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
I've said it.

239
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
The case of the corruption case is over.

240
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
You two are not friends at all.

241
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Now the enemy of the Wu State is in front.

242
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,720
You don't care about it?

243
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
What?

244
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Do you want me to fight against the Wu State alone?

245
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
The innocent are innocent.

246
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,720
You two are both the veterans of the two dynasties.

247
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,720
When the former king was alive,

248
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
the state of Chen was in a good state.

249
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,720
The power of the Wu State was strong.

250
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Now the Wu State is going to invade our state.

251
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
Our state is weak.

252
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
If I still say something wrong,

253
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
if I still say something wrong,

254
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
it's my fault.

255
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Report!

256
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Your Majesty, I report to you.

257
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,720
The Wu State has been under the hand of the Han State.

258
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
They have been attacking and coming straight to the capital.

259
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
They are about to leave the capital.

260
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
They are less than 200 miles away.

261
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Impossible.

262
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
The border between the capital and Chenwu

263
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
is separated by Han State and the border between Kang and Shaozhou.

264
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
How can it be so fast?

265
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Your Majesty,

266
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
the border between Kang and Shaozhou is also narrow.

267
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,720
It's not safe to go there.

268
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Kang and Shaozhou are still in danger.

269
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
I know.

270
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Leave.

271
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Yes.

272
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
If there's any more news, report it quickly.

273
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Yes.

274
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Wait.

275
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,720
I'll be back soon.

276
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Eunuch Li

277
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
didn't lie at least.

278
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
He only went to the capital

279
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
within half a month.

280
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Old man,

281
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
they are at the gate of the house.

282
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
You still want to report to me?

283
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,720
You...

284
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
I'm not a coward.

285
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,720
Fine.

286
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,720
Then join hands with me to fight against the Wu State.

287
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Let them see

288
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
that the Chen State is not easy to bully.

289
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,720
I'm guilty.

290
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
I deserve to die.

291
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,720
But the war is on.

292
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,720
After this battle,

293
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,720
I'll let Wang Chu Zhen do it.

294
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
We should gather all resources

295
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
and set up the city.

296
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
This is the best time.

297
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Minister,

298
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
if the Wu State goes there

299
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
in a full speed, how long will it take?

300
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Three days.

301
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
Three...

302
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,720
Three days to the capital?

303
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Yes.

304
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
The Wu State is in danger.

305
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
We should go there.

306
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Yes.

307
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
We should go there.

308
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Yes.

309
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
We should go there.

310
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Yes.

311
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
We should go there.

312
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Yes.

313
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
We should go there.

314
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
Yes.

315
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,720
We should go there.

316
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Yes.

317
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,720
We should go there.

318
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Yes.

319
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
My wife.

320
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
My wife.

321
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
I want to eat fish.

322
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
I'll call the doctor.

323
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,720
No.

324
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,720
I'll do it myself.

325
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Okay.

326
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,420
We'll have dinner when we arrive.

327
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,000
Greetings, Your Majesty and Consort Rong.

328
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,440
Leave us.

329
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,520
Yes.

330
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,640
I just need it.

331
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,200
Okay.

332
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,600
Come and help me.

333
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,360
Let's go.

334
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,800
Don't be scared.

335
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,040
Let's use this big knife.

336
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,920
Cut the green onion for the fish.

337
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,640
Cai Yi.

338
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,200
Do you people

339
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,400
all like sweet things?

340
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,480
I know that

341
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,040
Long Qi secretly

342
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,520
gives you my sweet food.

343
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,360
If I remember correctly,

344
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
your favorite sweet food should be

345
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,240
osmanthus cake.

346
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,280
I read in the book that

347
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,160
every time it's spring,

348
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,800
the osmanthus fragrance is all over the country.

349
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,240
The osmanthus fragrance is all over the country.

350
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,480
I really want to go there.

351
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,520
You haven't been back for a long time.

352
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,920
You must miss home.

353
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,360
Cai Yi.

354
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,640
The war is coming.

355
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,040
If not,

356
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
you should go back.

357
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,120
Don't worry about

358
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,480
the Princess Consort.

359
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,440
I know.

360
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,240
The person you're most worried about

361
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,240
must be the head of the fish.

362
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
To be honest,

363
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,480
the head of the fish

364
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,600
really likes you.

365
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,800
If it weren't for the war,

366
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,840
I would have brought it to you

367
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,240
and made it say

368
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,760
what it was thinking.

369
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,600
Then,

370
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,280
I'll give you a long vacation.

371
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,720
You can go to the world

372
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,400
and eat what you should eat

373
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
and drink what you should drink.

374
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,680
Do whatever you want.

375
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,240
Actually,

376
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,360
I envy you.

377
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,520
You see,

378
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,960
Jiu Jiu and I

379
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,840
are so in love.

380
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,120
We just want to live

381
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,560
a normal life.

382
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,280
But if we can do it,

383
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,800
we can't win this battle.

384
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,080
In this way,

385
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,840
it's really good

386
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
to be with you.

387
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,600
Wang,

388
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,320
I brought the wine.

389
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,960
It's so hot.

390
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,360
I, Zhang Jinlong, have no future in this life.

391
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,840
I've been alone all my life.

392
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,200
I'm just Chen Guoluo.

393
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,760
Master.

394
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,960
I've been so gorgeous to you.

395
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,240
Was it because

396
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,760
I caused you become like that?

397
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,480
Because it's about you

398
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,280
I'm someone else.

399
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,880
You pushed me away.

400
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,200
I knew it.

401
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,080
But I still

402
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,760
china

403
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,120
It's been a long field day,

404
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,800
so why did you just walk away from me?

405
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,520
Back.

406
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,680
Chenzhou's army were strong in formation.

407
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,600
Zhaodu's Fan Li

408
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,280
fought four driveiors

409
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,440
with me and the former King of Qin.

410
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,680
They needed me there to kill them.

411
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,480
Chenzhou and your capital usage of ten days.

412
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,160
We just need to prolong that.

413
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,800
After Yuanbin arrives,

414
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,720
It's impossible.

415
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,240
The escort troops are so fast.

416
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,520
It must be Hu Xiaogu.

417
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm afraid the guards who went to the city

418
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,640
must be very dangerous.

419
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,680
They're all here.

420
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,760
Let's go and meet them.

421
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,700
Princess.

422
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,680
The escort troops are coming.

423
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,000
Your highness, somebody cards the sketchbook.

424
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,520
allows the 노래入歌

425
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,040
Yes.

426
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,560
I did find the sketchbook.

427
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,160
Blade mirror source.

428
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,480
The authentic signature at the Darong calm.

429
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Go, go, go.

430
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Go, go, go.

431
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Go, go, go.

432
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Go, go, go.

433
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Go, go, go.

434
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Go, go, go.

435
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Your Majesty.

436
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Yes.

437
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
I think there's a trap.

438
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Let him go.

439
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Your Majesty.

440
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Now Wu Jun didn't go to the city.

441
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
The city is not in danger.

442
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
There's still a chance for you to escape.

443
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
With me and Da Si Ma here,

444
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Liu De and Qing Shan are still in the city.

445
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
I'm afraid they haven't been eliminated.

446
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Yes.

447
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Your Majesty.

448
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Once the reinforcements arrive,

449
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
they will come back to save us.

450
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
There's no Prince Qin's body.

451
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
I'm sure.

452
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
The tree fell and the tiger was scattered.

453
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Either the elephant fell,

454
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
or the official died.

455
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
But since the escape city

456
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
can save lives,

457
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
it's time to leave.

458
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
The country can be broken.

459
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
But the people are still here.

460
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
I'm the King.

461
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
I have to stay.

462
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Protect the Crown Prince.

463
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
I'll be with you.

464
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Let's go.

465
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Let's go.

466
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Madam.

467
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
There's a noise outside.

468
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
The soldiers are missing.

469
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
I'm afraid Wu Jun is coming in.

470
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Madam.

471
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Madam.

472
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Madam.

473
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Madam.

474
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
The King is here to see you.

475
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Madam.

476
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Wake up.

477
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Madam.

478
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
The King is here to see you.

479
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Madam.

480
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
The King is here to see you.

481
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Madam.

482
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

483
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Greetings, Minister of War.

484
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
None of the brothers

485
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
of the Tiger Valley

486
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
have returned yet.

487
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
How many soldiers are there in the city?

488
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
I don't know.

489
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Where is Lord Yu?

490
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Yu...

491
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
The west gate is still open.

492
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Let's escort the people to leave the city.

493
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Yes.

494
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Li's Mansion

495
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Chen Xiao Hua.

496
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Stop struggling.

497
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Open the city gate and hand in the jade seal.

498
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
I'll spare your life

499
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
and let you be a rich and virtuous man.

500
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
You just said to open the gate.

501
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
If you're capable,

502
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
then come up yourself.

503
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Our Chen State

504
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
is in a difficult situation.

505
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
We have enough food supplies.

506
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
If you don't prepare for ten days and half a month,

507
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
then hurry and go back.

508
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
I'm telling you.

509
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
In a few hours,

510
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
my soldiers

511
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
will have your asses wrapped.

512
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
I'll persuade you to go back

513
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
and fight with me.

514
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
I'll give you

515
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
a good laugh

516
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
from the old man who died of bone cancer.

517
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Do you think I can't get in?

518
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
If you can get in,

519
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
then why bother talking?

520
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Okay.

521
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Come with me.

522
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
The city gate is closed.

523
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
Let's go.

524
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Yes.

525
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
There are spies inside.

526
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Lord Ping.

527
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Go and guard the gate.

528
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Yes.

529
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Kill.

530
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Kill.

531
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Kill.

532
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Kill.

533
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Kill.

534
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Kill.

535
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Lord Ping.

536
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
The city gate is closed.

537
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Chen State is in danger.

538
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
I'll go and guard the gate for you.

539
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Long Qi.

540
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Lord Ping.

541
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Long Qi has been in a bad situation all his life.

542
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
It's my fortune

543
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
to be with you.

544
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
If there's a next life,

545
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
I'm willing to be your bodyguard.

546
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
I'm willing to be your bodyguard.

547
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Cai Yi.

548
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Next life.

549
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
I hope we can meet sooner.

550
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Long Qi.

551
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Wang.

552
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
You are the one chosen by the God.

553
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,840
No more gratitude.

554
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,960
I'll repay you in the next life.

555
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,560
Smile for me.

556
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,800
Be natural.

557
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,520
Have no fear of danger.

558
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,720
Have no fear of danger.

559
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,080
Have no fear of danger.

560
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,600
Have no fear of danger.

561
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,640
Have no fear of danger.

562
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,520
Be ready to fight quickly.

563
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,440
Now,

564
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,840
it's time for you to fulfill your promise.

565
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,680
How?

566
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,640
I'm not afraid of danger.

567
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,720
You have to do it.

568
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,640
I want to do it.

569
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,600
But I can't.

570
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,720
What do you mean?

571
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,800
I can't protect Chen Wen

572
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,080
through my power.

573
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
I can't protect Chui San Hua.

574
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,640
Why?

575
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,960
I'm a Martial Soul,

576
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,640
but I'm not.

577
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,440
What...

578
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,240
What are you talking about?

579
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,360
You can't use the special skill of the Martial Soul.

580
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,960
If you want to save him,

581
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,800
you can only make him face difficulties alone

582
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,480
and wake up.

583
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,040
I know

584
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,080
you must be in pain now.

585
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,080
But you'll only hurt him

586
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,720
if you do it now.

587
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:03,920
Circle your forehead.

588
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,240
Don't move.

589
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,040
Your back is off.

590
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,600
Big yao,

591
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,680
take a good rest,

592
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,080
and wait for the time to return.

593
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,400
Okay!

594
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,560
Please,

595
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,320
Ama!

596
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,800
No,

597
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,280
don't move.

598
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,120
Don't move!

599
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,400
Ama!

600
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,160
Ama!

601
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,200
Ama!

602
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,800
Ama!

603
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,760
Ama!

604
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,960
Ama!

605
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,480
Ama!

606
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,600
Ama!

607
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,160
Ama!

608
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360
If you don't show your skills,

609
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,360
the gate of Chen State

610
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
will be opened by yourself.

611
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
You'd better surrender.

612
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,360
If you have the ability,

613
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
why are you playing with your mouth?

614
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Come on.

615
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Wait for me.

616
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Go.

617
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,360
Kill.

618
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,360
Kill.

619
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,360
Kill.

620
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,360
Kill.

621
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,360
A spring water flows into the mortal world.

622
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,360
The sky is still cold.

623
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,360
The sea is dry and the mountains are broken.

624
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Even if there is no limit, it is just a dream.

625
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,360
The land is scattered.

626
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,360
The mountains and rivers are not dry.

627
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,360
The past is the grudge of victory.

628
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,360
The cold rain comes and goes.

629
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
The wind blows.

630
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
The people are all different.

631
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Who is in the deep of the autumn?

632
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,360
The rain is light and the wind is strong.

633
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,360
The End
