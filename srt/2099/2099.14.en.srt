1
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,399
(Grand Marshal.)

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,719
(I remember your favorite)

3
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,200
(is Shuozhou's beef jerky.)

4
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,679
I specially prepared this for you.

5
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,560
It was a long journey to Guishan.

6
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,320
Thanks, Your Majesty.

7
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,920
When I went to war,

8
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,320
it was inconvenient to cook.

9
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,000
During forced marches,

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,640
the beef jerky was a delicacy.

11
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,400
Grand Marshal.

12
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,760
You've fought countless battles.

13
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,000
Were you ever afraid?

14
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,079
Sure.

15
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,599
At first, I was indeed afraid.

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,079
I was afraid of losing my life.

17
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,799
I feared I wouldn't return home.

18
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,799
I was also afraid
I wouldn't see my family again.

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,200
But after seeing so much blood,

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,319
I came to realize

21
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,640
that it was useless to be afraid.

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,480
Just charge forward.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,040
It's useless to be afraid.

24
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,599
Just charge forward.

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,519
You know what?

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,519
The Grand Tutor tried

27
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,799
to stop me from helping you many times.

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,480
So he

29
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,640
couldn't stop you?

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,519
Not so.

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,280
I just realized you had grown up.

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,639
Last time you came to me for help,

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,560
you played it by ear,

34
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,280
just like your father.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,120
When I was young,
I was by the former king's side.

36
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,599
I felt there was nothing
he couldn't achieve.

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,400
He cared about the state.

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,199
He was resourceful and wise.

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,039
You fought against corruption

40
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,960
and made the plan this time.

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,560
Those are acts of a wise ruler.

42
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,960
I have not let him down.

43
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,800
I'm willing

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,319
to hand over Chen State

45
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,039
into your hands.

46
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,159
Rest assured, Your Majesty,

47
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,199
all the fallen soldiers here,

48
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,199
regardless of nationality,
will be buried with all due ceremony.

49
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,479
This is the situation,

50
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,319
and we all must accept it.

51
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm so sorry.

52
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
At present, things are going on

53
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,960
as you wish.

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,599
I just hope

55
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,759
that these people have not died in vain.

56
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:55,872
(Yizhan Deng)

57
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,080
Your Majesty,

58
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,560
allow me to say one last thing.

59
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,279
Have you achieved your goal?

60
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,480
Is this the result

61
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,639
you wanted?

62
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,119
There's a carriage down the hill.

63
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,959
Long Qi, do you know the way or not?

64
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,399
It should be here.

65
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
- But we...
- Long Qi,

66
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,360
is there a person over there?

67
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,439
Go ask her.

68
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,040
Yes.

69
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,800
Miss.

70
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,399
Miss.

71
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:53,760
=Episode 14=
(Isolated Village)

72
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,199
Chen State?

73
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,879
I never heard of it.

74
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,799
The patriarch has read a lot.

75
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,720
He might know.

76
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,040
You can ask him later.

77
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay.

78
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,160
Zhao'er,

79
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,480
you're back.

80
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
Huzi.

81
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,399
Who are they?

82
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,319
They are people of Chen State.

83
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,559
Came from Guishan.

84
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,839
They want to return home.

85
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,319
But they got lost.

86
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm taking them to see the patriarch.

87
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,759
Their hairstyle is different.

88
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,639
What is Guishan?

89
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Where is Chen State?

90
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,239
Have you heard of it?

91
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,359
I haven't heard of it.

92
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,559
Is it downstream of the river
east of the village?

93
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,559
Definitely not.

94
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,759
Going downstream,

95
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,800
it takes a few days
to reach the great waterfall

96
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,359
with a sharp drop.

97
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,439
There's no way down.

98
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,439
Yes, I've heard of it.

99
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,199
What's going on here?

100
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,040
Another side quest?

101
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,560
So, shall we go?

102
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:47,040
Let's go.

103
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,000
I planned to chop wood.

104
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,879
Alright.

105
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,519
Be careful.

106
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,480
Mr. Fu.

107
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,439
Mr. Fu.

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,439
Look, guests have come. Look.

109
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,240
Mr. Fu.

110
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,120
Zhao'er, who are these people?

111
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,319
They are people of Chen.

112
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,439
They came from Guishan.

113
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,720
They want to return home.

114
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,399
Welcome all of you to Shangyao Village.

115
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,720
I'm Fu Yi, the patriarch of the village.

116
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,559
Sir, may I ask if this is the territory
of Chen State?

117
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,519
I've lived here for a long time.

118
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,600
But I don't know where Chen State is.

119
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,600
What about Wu State?

120
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,639
I don't know either.

121
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,040
Are you from the state of Chu

122
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,039
or Yue?

123
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:44,840
You must be
from beyond the mountains, right?

124
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,440
When Tong State was destroyed,
our ancestors

125
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,719
came here

126
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,360
to avoid the chaos of war.

127
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:56,000
By the time I took over as patriarch,
it had already been seven generations.

128
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,120
Tong State?

129
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,960
It was doomed long ago.

130
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,840
Since your clan survived,

131
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,639
why didn't you return?

132
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,559
Well.

133
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,240
We've settled.

134
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,840
It's quite nice to live here.

135
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,600
We are all very content.

136
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,039
Everyone is very content.

137
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,240
I see.

138
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,240
We came from Guishan.

139
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,399
We're returning home.

140
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,159
But we got lost.

141
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,720
Fortunately, this girl brought us here.

142
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,840
I see.

143
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,559
May I know how to address you?

144
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,840
They all call me Mr. Wang.

145
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,320
Mr. Wang.

146
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,120
Long Qi.

147
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,799
Mr. Long.

148
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,448
Caiyi.

149
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:41,840
Caiyi.

150
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,399
Please just call me Xiao'er.

151
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,759
Xiao'er.

152
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,639
Look, they dress so oddly.

153
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,399
And they're sloppy.

154
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,559
Are you injured?

155
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,639
Huzi.

156
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,160
Get the physician here.

157
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,679
- Okay.
- They need to be treated.

158
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,280
Alright, I'll be right back.

159
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,120
Wait a second.

160
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,840
It's alright.

161
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,399
It's not my blood.

162
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,720
Bandits' blood.

163
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,279
It's good if you're fine.

164
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,320
It's good.

165
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,079
You have come from afar.

166
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,279
Why not rest here for a while?

167
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,000
Zhao'er.

168
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,559
Take them to the courtyard
north of the village

169
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,639
to have a rest.

170
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,360
Okay, follow me.

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,039
This way, please.

172
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,599
Come on.

173
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,600
Please.

174
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,439
This way, please.

175
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,039
Please.

176
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:38,848
Please.

177
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,400
A bit shabby.

178
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
I hope you won't mind it.

179
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,440
Of course not.

180
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,480
Thank you, Zhao'er.

181
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,719
You rest for a while.

182
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,799
I'm leaving.

183
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,720
Okay.

184
00:11:07,872 --> 00:11:08,440
Your Majesty.

185
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:09,679
It's weird.

186
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,759
It might be a trap.

187
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,760
We can't totally

188
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,240
trust that patriarch.

189
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,039
Why are you getting so cautious now?

190
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,559
I think they look sincere.

191
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,440
Enough, we're all tired.

192
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,039
Take some rest.

193
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,039
We'll leave once we find a carriage.

194
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,799
Your Majesty.

195
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,360
It's getting late.

196
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,720
I've prepared clean clothes for you.

197
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,559
Why don't you stay for the night?

198
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,439
I'm here.

199
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,200
I'm here.

200
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,840
You must be starving.

201
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,719
I made food.

202
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,759
You eat while it's hot.

203
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,879
Go ahead.

204
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,760
This is the best physician here.

205
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,760
Mr. Fu has asked him

206
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,639
to treat your wounds.

207
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,480
Then take a look at him.

208
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
He has some bruises.

209
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,000
Alright, please.

210
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,440
Let me take the two girls to bathe
and change clothes.

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,960
Long Qi.

212
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,279
You stay here to look after Mr. Wang.

213
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,240
Yes.

214
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:16,760
Let's eat.

215
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,960
Let's eat first.

216
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,240
Xiao'er.

217
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,039
Zhao'er.

218
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,240
I made this rabbit toy.

219
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,240
It has an herbal scent.

220
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,279
It can help you sleep.

221
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,920
But it looks not very nice.

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I hope you don't mind.

223
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,799
Everyone here is so thoughtful.

224
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,399
Outsiders rarely come here.

225
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,200
Thank you.

226
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,320
What's wrong?

227
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,919
Honey.

228
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,519
I dreamed about your rabbit toy.

229
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,799
You looked just like this in my dreams.

230
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:44,760
Your Majesty.

231
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,559
You...

232
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,839
I've checked.

233
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,879
The main room is okay.

234
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,120
Caiyi's room too.

235
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,519
I still find this place a bit strange.

236
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,159
So, I'll keep watch tonight.

237
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,320
(Your Majesty.)

238
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,960
(Is this the result you wanted?)

239
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:05,120
- Grand Marshal!
- Your Majesty!

240
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,200
Do you think their deaths

241
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,080
make any sense?

242
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,919
Dowager Zhang died for love.

243
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,799
She died

244
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:36,000
with the man she loved.

245
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,399
That may be their best end.

246
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,799
Though it deviated a bit from the plan,

247
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,360
we narrowly won in the end.

248
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,639
We killed Wu Liang

249
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,559
at the cost of dozens of men's lives.

250
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
But what we got is

251
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,399
that countless people

252
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:56,960
were spared from a disaster.

253
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,159
I think Grand Marshal would be happy

254
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,919
about that.

255
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,320
But I don't think
it was a narrow victory,

256
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,120
but a crushing defeat.

257
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,919
You think killing me will be the end?

258
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,559
Even if you kill me,

259
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,360
someone else will take over.

260
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,120
(After the death of King Wu,)

261
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,919
I found that this wasn't the end
I had imagined,

262
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,240
but a new beginning.

263
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,279
Yes,

264
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,759
King Wu is dead,

265
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,759
but the Wu Army still remains.

266
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,200
There will be a new king in Wu State.

267
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,359
Wasn't he on watch?

268
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,039
Who's there?

269
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,680
I stood guard the entire night.

270
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,799
It's safe.

271
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,519
Who gave me a blanket?

272
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,319
You slept like a log
the first half of the night.

273
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,016
I feared you'd freeze to death.

274
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Today is a big day for our village.

275
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,479
You two are the most skillful

276
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,439
and strongest people in our village.

277
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,039
Butcher two pigs

278
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,680
and 25 chickens.

279
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,319
Come on.

280
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,359
Remember,

281
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,359
make sure to bleed the pigs.

282
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,640
- No problem.
- Go on.

283
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,359
Let's go.

284
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,519
Mr. Fu.

285
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,640
Is the carriage we need ready?

286
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,960
Oh right.

287
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,279
My memory

288
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,559
is getting worse.

289
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,720
Huzi.

290
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,880
Go and check if the carriage is ready.

291
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,160
Okay.

292
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,359
I'll go have a look.

293
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,559
I guess you haven't had breakfast.

294
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,688
Zhao'er, get some food ready
for the guests.

295
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:17,319
Okay.

296
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,160
It's still early now.

297
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,080
Please have a seat over there.

298
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,960
Breakfast will be ready soon.

299
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,559
Please.

300
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,119
Here are the dumplings.

301
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,039
Thank you, Zhao'er.

302
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:39,920
Thank you.

303
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,839
By the way,

304
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,319
why are those tables all put together?

305
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,319
Is it for a banquet?

306
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,920
Yes, on a happy occasion,

307
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,840
every household will

308
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,600
bring their own chairs and tables

309
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,920
and wine and dishes together.

310
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,119
It's so lively.

311
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,519
Really nice.

312
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,400
Mr. Fu.

313
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,960
It's all simple food.

314
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,319
Are you all accustomed to it?

315
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,920
- Delicious.
- It's already very good.

316
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,480
Mr. Fu, is our carriage ready?

317
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,160
Our villagers

318
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,439
rarely use carriages.

319
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:21,679
Yesterday, we found a problem
with the axle.

320
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,839
I'm not sure if it's already fixed.

321
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,400
There's another thing.

322
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,079
There are few people in our village.

323
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,440
Could I trouble you to do me a favor?

324
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,000
What is it?

325
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,720
Slow down.

326
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,319
How is it?

327
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,920
Ten centimeters further to the left.

328
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,119
What?

329
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,000
Ten centimeters is...

330
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,680
Three cun.

331
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,120
Three cun to the left.

332
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,839
Got it.

333
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:01,519
It's good now.

334
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,759
Let me do it.

335
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,720
Mr. Fu.

336
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,720
Is the axle already fixed?

337
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,359
It should be fine now.

338
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,279
That's good.

339
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,160
Huzi.

340
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,599
The axle is already fixed?

341
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,519
Axle?

342
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,119
There's no problem with that.

343
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,359
Once we finish hanging the lanterns,

344
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,559
we will set off.

345
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,240
Wait.

346
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,240
Axle?

347
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,680
Is the axle broken?

348
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:45,559
Mr. Fu.

349
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,880
The axle is okay.

350
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,039
Since the axle is already fixed,

351
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,119
we should set off.

352
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,759
When I arrive home,

353
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
I'll have someone
send the carriage back.

354
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,759
I'll also give you a big gift.

355
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,640
For the bride and groom.

356
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,559
Mr. Wang.

357
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,119
We're done.

358
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,559
Good.

359
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,799
Mr. Fu.

360
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,200
We're leaving.

361
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,320
It's time.

362
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
If there is a chance,

363
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:13,039
we will come back to visit you again.

364
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,560
Mr. Wang,

365
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,680
we mean no harm.

366
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,160
We sincerely invite you to stay

367
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,479
for a meal

368
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,599
and a drink.

369
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,519
You are in such a hurry to rush back.

370
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,359
Is there something important?

371
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,160
Yes.

372
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,279
It's a happy thing

373
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,079
to come to the wedding banquet.

374
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,959
Why not stay

375
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,160
and have a good time?

376
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,680
Xiao'er,

377
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,079
Mr. Wang, don't leave.

378
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,279
Stay, please.

379
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,680
What do you think?

380
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,960
Since it's a banquet,

381
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,240
we'll stay and join in the fun.

382
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,080
Great.

383
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,960
Great.

384
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,640
What are you doing?

385
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,559
Your Majesty, it takes so long to fish.

386
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,559
I'll go catch some fish for you.

387
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,519
It's fine.

388
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,079
I want to catch a fish by myself.

389
00:22:38,432 --> 00:22:39,000
I'll be quick.

390
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:39,960
Caiyi.

391
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,240
You hold my sword.

392
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,400
No need.

393
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,359
I want to catch a fish by myself.

394
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,679
I'll be over there.

395
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,679
I won't disturb you.

396
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,960
I want to catch a fish by myself.

397
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:52,559
Long Qi.

398
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:55,880
Let him fish by himself.

399
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,160
You and Caiyi go to the kitchen

400
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:00,080
and prepare the ingredients.

401
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,959
Get the stove ready.

402
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:01,920
We'll be there later.

403
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,559
Yes.

404
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:18,359
Honey.

405
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,319
I just want to sit here quietly

406
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,359
and catch a fish myself.

407
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,480
I know.

408
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,960
I'm with you.

409
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,119
Mr. Wang.

410
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,199
Mr. Wang, you're good at cooking.

411
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:49,960
Come on.

412
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,680
You must try this fish.

413
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,439
Pour a drink.

414
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,440
Pour a drink for you.

415
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,559
Come on.

416
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,359
Mr. Wang cooked the fish.

417
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,359
It's so delicious.

418
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,599
Indeed, it is good.

419
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,656
Good!

420
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,440
Here they are.

421
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,720
