1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You can't get that right!

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Your Majesty, I just got confused for a moment.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Your Majesty, I just got confused for a moment.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's the way I hired him to kill Little Madam.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's the way I hired him to kill Little Madam.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,800
I should have been the one to blame.

17
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,560
I almost hurt His Majesty and Lady Xiao.

18
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,000
I should have been the one to blame.

19
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,800
But I don't know what Grand Tutor Wang's plan is.

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,760
Since His Highness ascended the throne,

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,680
he has been acting like a fool.

22
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,760
He has no sense of democracy at all.

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,160
For the sake of our Great Chen,

24
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,000
at the scene of the uprising,

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,560
I almost fell for it.

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
No wonder at the scene of the uprising,

27
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,760
I said I was coming to save people.

28
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,920
Everyone was pretending to be deaf and dumb.

29
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
Good.

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,400
My two loyal officials,

31
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,400
one wanted to kill me,

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,520
and the other wanted to kill my beloved consort.

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,320
I deserve to die.

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,440
But I don't regret it.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Your Majesty,

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,520
I deserve to die.

37
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,760
But at that moment,

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,960
the potential that Your Majesty has released,

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,560
and the sincerity that you have shown,

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,240
may really move the God.

41
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,000
I thought at that moment,

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
this might be the will of God.

43
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,960
Wang Reng,

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,360
you finally know what is responsibility

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,320
and what is democracy.

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,640
Your Majesty,

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,600
many people say Grand Tutor Wang is going to rebel.

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,640
I don't believe it.

49
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
When the former king was alive,

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,960
he fought against the south and the north many times,

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
and sacrificed himself to save the country.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,320
He risked his life.

53
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,640
Your Majesty,

54
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,600
you can kill me if you want,

55
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,880
but you can keep Grand Tutor Wang.

56
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,320
He will continue to worship you.

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,440
Your Majesty.

58
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,600
I was blinded by the story

59
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,080
and misunderstood you.

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,240
I thought you were not good to His Majesty.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
Now I think

62
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,760
you are worried about yourself.

63
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,880
I have forgotten it.

64
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,280
Your Majesty is wise and wise.

65
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,200
You saved the country

66
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,600
with your own strength.

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,920
Yes, I feel the same way.

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
I really feel the spirit of the spirit.

69
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,640
Urgent military report!

70
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,920
Report!

71
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,120
Report!

72
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,200
Report!

73
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,840
Your Majesty,

74
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,920
Urgent military report from Wu State.

75
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,680
King Wu died.

76
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,800
King Wu's heir ascended the throne.

77
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,760
During the funeral,

78
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,960
he has already prepared three armies

79
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,840
to fight against the enemy.

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,320
He will be here soon.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,400
The real murderer

82
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,280
has just appeared.

83
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,520
I have been in contact with the Wu State for half a lifetime.

84
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,760
King Wu was defeated by the former king.

85
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,040
He has been through a lot in his life.

86
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,960
He didn't dare to touch us.

87
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,920
But this new king, King Wu,

88
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
took advantage of the Wu State's power.

89
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,600
It seems that he really came for us.

90
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,680
Let's fight.

91
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,120
Who is afraid of who?

92
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,040
My minister, Ziming,

93
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,480
has already seen my changes

94
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,720
at the Qiyu site.

95
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,360
They are very surprised

96
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,520
at me now.

97
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,360
Now we are united.

98
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,920
This time, I, Chen Xiaohua,

99
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,200
stand up.

100
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,200
What are you going to do next?

101
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,720
Fight.

102
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,800
I will definitely fight against him.

103
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,960
I will be defeated.

104
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,360
Honey,

105
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,800
look at me now.

106
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
Do I look like a wise king?

107
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,120
Honey,

108
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,440
today,

109
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,120
we also took care of two old bones.

110
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,960
The mouths of these two people

111
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,720
are indeed a bit sweet.

112
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,080
I'm embarrassed to praise this old six.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,080
There is progress.

114
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,960
But don't be too proud.

115
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,120
It rained yesterday.

116
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,560
It was just a natural phenomenon.

117
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,360
The thunder and rain that the strong wind blew against the weather

118
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,300
did not affect the

119
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,120
upper layer of the sky.

120
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,240
What are you talking about?

121
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
It was me who

122
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,560
made this rain for the Chen State.

123
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,720
What is this?

124
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,240
This is called the sky is bright and the moon is bright.

125
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
The emperor of the imperial family

126
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,920
is about to lead the Chen State

127
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,040
to the peak.

128
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,520
The great defeat is imminent.

129
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,960
Honey,

130
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,440
before this,

131
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,560
I was indeed a little too kind.

132
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,200
And those old bones

133
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,600
did be a little too careful to me.

134
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,440
But look,

135
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,040
I just have to work hard.

136
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,840
What?

137
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,480
Isn't this all done?

138
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,160
Honey, look.

139
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,800
After we defeat the five states,

140
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,200
and kill them,

141
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,920
I'll take you to the mountains and play in the water.

142
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,960
Enjoy the rain in the distance,

143
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,120
sunbathe and watch the stars.

144
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
What do you think?

145
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,120
Honey.

146
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,760
Your Majesty,

147
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,520
the latest military report

148
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,840
shows that the five states have crossed the border.

149
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
The king of the five states has come to fight.

150
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,440
He has now arrived outside the city of Hanzhou

151
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
to fight.

152
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,240
Yes.

153
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,840
Yes.

154
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,640
Dear all,

155
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,320
what do you think?

156
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,080
Your Majesty,

157
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,120
in my opinion,

158
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,600
the military is still not moving at this time.

159
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,320
And there is a chance of peace.

160
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,880
If the troops are sent at this time,

161
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,480
it will be a tough battle from the front.

162
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,560
In fact, winning

163
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,040
will also make the border of our country

164
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,800
more difficult.

165
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,640
And our country's army

166
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,640
has not been tough for a long time.

167
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,720
What Mr. Zhang means is that we don't fight.

168
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Your Majesty,

169
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,280
I think

170
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,560
it's a crisis that will last forever.

171
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,480
We are here

172
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,280
to talk about peace

173
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,360
and let other countries

174
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,240
see our ministers.

175
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,120
Your Majesty.

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,840
Your Majesty,

177
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,960
what you just said

178
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,760
makes sense.

179
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,440
If we don't push it,

180
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,760
our army will really start from the northwest

181
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,040
and support Hanzhou.

182
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,520
It's not about the food.

183
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,720
It's just the food and the capital.

184
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,960
The military costs are too great.

185
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,040
If we compare the two,

186
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,560
we can talk about a plan

187
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
that is more advanced.

188
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,680
Your Majesty,

189
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,880
it seems that our generals

190
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,560
have already passed the test of

191
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,440
the time of the war.

192
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
They don't plan to prepare for the war.

193
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,560
Who are you talking about?

194
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,960
You know who I'm talking about.

195
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,720
You bookworms,

196
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,120
just fight.

197
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,560
It's not easy to go to war.

198
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
If you are sent to the battlefield,

199
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,560
maybe I can't even cut the knife.

200
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,400
Come on.

201
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,920
There are many skills.

202
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,360
Although we don't have

203
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,600
general's skills,

204
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,680
we can hold the knife,

205
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,200
but we can hold the pen.

206
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,360
In terms of military affairs,

207
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,480
only the Minister of War

208
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,360
has the right to speak.

209
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,240
I want to fight, too.

210
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,960
But the army has not moved the food and the capital.

211
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,880
Where is the money?

212
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,120
Grand Tutor Wang,

213
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,280
where is the money?

214
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,200
Fortunately, the enemy has not attacked the city yet.

215
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,840
There is still room for retreat.

216
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,560
Your Majesty,

217
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,600
I think there is one more

218
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,120
more important thing.

219
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
I don't know if I should say it or not.

220
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,960
Grand Tutor,

221
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,560
just say it.

222
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,080
I think

223
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,920
Your Majesty should

224
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,360
set up the subsidiary of the harem

225
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,760
as soon as possible.

226
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,600
The state will decide

227
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,520
when the army is established.

228
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,360
What Grand Tutor said is right.

229
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,200
I also have this idea.

230
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,880
Let me think about it.

231
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,920
I will decide

232
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,880
when it is established.

233
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,200
My dear, have some tea.

234
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,760
Thank you.

235
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,160
Well,

236
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
I don't know

237
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,080
if I should say it or not.

238
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,800
Go ahead.

239
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,280
Look,

240
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,600
the war is coming.

241
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,840
The court is fighting

242
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,840
and the situation is getting worse.

243
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,080
And then?

244
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,960
And then,

245
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,640
Grand Tutor Wang's suggestion is

246
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,560
the state will decide when the army is established.

247
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,440
What do you want to say?

248
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,320
What Grand Tutor Wang means is

249
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,080
we should hurry up.

250
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,120
Well,

251
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,720
what is that?

252
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,800
What?

253
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,160
Get on the horse.

254
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,280
The war is coming.

255
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,560
Grand Tutor Wang wants you to stay.

256
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,600
If the country is defeated,

257
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,480
you will die.

258
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,160
At least, the country will be in chaos.

259
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,280
Well, that's the point.

260
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,200
But, my dear,

261
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
it feels weird

262
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,440
to say it out of your mouth.

263
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,800
But it doesn't matter.

264
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,080
My dear,

265
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,360
for the future of our country,

266
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,400
let's start.

267
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,360
Wait.

268
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,200
My dear,

269
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,760
you said it's reasonable.

270
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,920
I understand.

271
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,240
It's my first time, too.

272
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,560
Let's go.

273
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,480
Listen to me.

274
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,360
No, I won't.

275
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,200
Actually, it's okay to listen.

276
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,560
Go ahead.

277
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,400
You are the king of Cheng.

278
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,040
You want to make yourself

279
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,920
a part of this dangerous court.

280
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,840
You want Cheng to rise under your leadership

281
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,880
and conquer the five states.

282
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,680
And then?

283
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,400
We will have a good time.

284
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,080
The enjoyer will be far away.

285
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,440
Look at the stars and the moon.

286
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,320
I mean,

287
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,880
you need to

288
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,520
have a good time

289
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,240
and make the people of the country

290
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,760
feel at ease.

291
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,640
You choose one of them.

292
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,640
You will have a child with them

293
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,600
and protect the country.

294
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,160
What do you mean?

295
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,600
You want to make fun of me?

296
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,640
I don't want to do that.

297
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,480
I know.

298
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,760
Women

299
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,480
are jealous.

300
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,720
I swear

301
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,360
I'm not interested

302
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,200
in these two women.

303
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,800
You must be interested.

304
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,080
Even if you are not interested,

305
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,640
you should focus on the big picture

306
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,480
and try to make them interested.

307
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,360
To continue the child is the foundation.

308
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,080
This is the required action

309
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
you must take

310
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,840
to complete the devilish and hellish mission.

311
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,680
Wife,

312
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,640
I will be reborn first.

313
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,880
I won't die.

314
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,440
Secondly,

315
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,720
I just want to have a child with you.

316
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,120
I don't care

317
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,240
if the world is peaceful.

318
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,240
You must care.

319
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,440
You are the king.

320
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,280
They are your concubines.

321
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,160
They are loyal to you.

322
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,240
Okay.

323
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,840
If it's just a child,

324
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,600
you can have one.

325
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,000
Why do you have to push me to others?

326
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,480
Do you have a heart?

327
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,280
I don't have a heart.

328
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,800
I'm a robot.

329
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,160
You are a real robot.

330
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,800
You don't want me to be a good king.

331
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,400
Do you have no feelings for me?

332
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,040
I have no way

333
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,680
to be selfish.

334
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,160
What are you doing?

335
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,160
You scared me.

336
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,760
You are the one who is being sneaky.

337
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,120
You are arguing with me.

338
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,080
I'm getting married.

339
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,240
When will they stop arguing?

340
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,240
What are you doing here?

341
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,480
The duty of the king is to protect the king.

342
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,120
Annoying.

343
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,080
I don't mean anything else.

344
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,120
I just want to know

345
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,240
if my wife is really stupid

346
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,120
to let the king sleep with another woman.

347
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,560
What?

348
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,720
Who sleeps with who?

349
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,400
You go back and listen to me.

350
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,920
You don't love me?

351
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,200
Are you listening to me?

352
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,480
I mean

353
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,800
I have no way

354
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
to have a child.

355
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,320
I understand.

356
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
You don't care at all.

357
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,880
I care.

358
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,640
But for your ultimate goal,

359
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,520
you have to find them.

360
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,480
So you mean

361
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,720
you want me to be with someone else?

362
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,520
You want me to be with someone else?

363
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
I have no choice.

364
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,160
You...

365
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,960
I have no other choice.

366
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,640
Why are you so close to me?

367
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,440
You want to get rid of me?

368
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,680
You asked me to see you.

369
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,280
You want to get rid of me.

370
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,640
What do you mean by that?

371
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,120
If it weren't for me, you would...

372
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,400
What do you think of me now?

373
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,080
You university student.

374
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,680
Took so long to study!

375
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,380
Not me.

376
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,560
She is lying to me.

377
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,640
She hasn't been friends with you at all.

378
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,560
Don't you take so long to give me warm welcomes?

379
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,400
Is this the Rui protagonists' compliance?

380
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,160
Longорон,

381
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,880
tell Eunuch Li

382
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,660
What?

383
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,520
Don't get over nervous,

384
00:15:51,520 --> 00:16:07,840
I'm not in the mood to cry over this 글 Regel

385
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,780
I agree your strategy is good,

386
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,920
but I feel really responsible.

387
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,340
I don't mind.

388
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
He first became the king,

389
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
and then he became himself.

390
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
You are all great people.

391
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
I don't understand.

392
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Ladies.

393
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
We are not here.

394
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Ladies.

395
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Ladies.

396
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
This is Mrs. Xiao's mansion.

397
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
Get in.

398
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Let's

399
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
go to the Linhua Hall directly.

400
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
Isn't that good?

401
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Eunuch Li, are you afraid that

402
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
that demon will kill you?

403
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
You don't think about it.

404
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
If you offend us,

405
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
you will die too.

406
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Sister.

407
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
You said that some people

408
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
are broken and on fire.

409
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Even if the mechanism is closed,

410
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
there is no chance of this.

411
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
You are right.

412
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
The king wants to leave a good name for Chen.

413
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
Of course, the first choice

414
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
can't be just that pair of chopsticks.

415
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
What pair?

416
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
It's a pair.

417
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
Sister Xiao.

418
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Tomorrow morning,

419
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
should we tell you

420
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
how the king

421
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
favors us today?

422
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Baoer.

423
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Why are you so old-fashioned?

424
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Let Sister Xiao think about it.

425
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Madam.

426
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Can I kill them?

427
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
No need.

428
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
If you want me to say,

429
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
let's go first.

430
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Aren't you two

431
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
really not afraid?

432
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
He dares to.

433
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
Baoer.

434
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
The king suddenly came to the mood today

435
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
and asked me to be with my sister.

436
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Let's not let him wait for long.

437
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Yes.

438
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
The king is now determined.

439
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
He is anxious at this moment.

440
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
He is anxious.

441
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
He can't wait.

442
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
Let's go.

443
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Bring the cups up.

444
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Drink.

445
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Cheers.

446
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Madam.

447
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Drink slowly.

448
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Drink slowly.

449
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Drink slowly.

450
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
If you drink like this,

451
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
I can't hold it.

452
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
I didn't notice.

453
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Come on.

454
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Drink some more.

455
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,880
Drink some more.

456
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Drink some more.

457
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
Come on.

458
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Drink too much

459
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
and you'll sleep well tonight.

460
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
You'll sleep well.

461
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Drink.

462
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
You...

463
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Fine.

464
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
You forced me to do this.

465
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Your Majesty.

466
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
Let's continue drinking.

467
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
Cheers.

468
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Come on.

469
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Drink.

470
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,880
This wine

471
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
is not at all coincidental.

472
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
It's not at all coincidental.

473
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
It's not at all coincidental.

474
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
It's not at all coincidental.

475
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,880
But it's like water.

476
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Your Majesty, drink.

477
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Drink some more.

478
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
I'll drink tonight.

479
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
Don't drink too much.

480
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Drink.

481
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Honey.

482
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Why don't you understand?

483
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,880
I just want to be your only son.

484
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
I understand.

485
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Honey.

486
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Why are you here?

487
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
At this moment,

488
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,880
shouldn't you be in your bedroom?

489
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Honey.

490
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,880
They and I have nothing.

491
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,880
I did this

492
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
to make you angry.

493
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Don't say that to me.

494
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
I'm not angry.

495
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
I'm not angry.

496
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
What do you mean?

497
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
I'm not angry.

498
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Actually, from the beginning,

499
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,880
there's only one person in my heart.

500
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
That's you.

501
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
That's weird.

502
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,880
How can there be such a strange feeling?

503
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
This is a feeling beyond calculation.

504
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
I'm not going.

505
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Honey, don't go.

506
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
Honey.

507
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
It's okay. You sleep.

508
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
I'm sorry.

509
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
It's your appearance

510
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
that makes me realize

511
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,880
the joy of being a human.

512
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
I hope in the next life,

513
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
you can still be by my side.

514
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
All this has nothing to do with my love.

515
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,880
I love my love.

516
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
I love my country.

517
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
Cheng Tian, if you want to fight,

518
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,880
just fight me to death.

519
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
It's weird.

520
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,880
What is this?

521
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
Honey,

522
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
one day,

523
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,880
will you leave me?

524
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,880
No.

525
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,880
I exist because of you.

526
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Will you leave this palace with me?

527
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
I don't want to be the king anymore.

528
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Let's find a world-class escapee

529
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,880
and grow old together, okay?

530
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
For you and me,

531
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
there's no escape.

532
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
There's only destiny.

533
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
What destiny?

534
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
My destiny

535
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
is to help you become a wise king.

536
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
Your destiny

537
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
is to become a wise king

538
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
and make your name known to the world.

539
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
To make Cheng country

540
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
return to its glory 100 years ago.

541
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
The world will be peaceful.

542
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
The sea will be peaceful.

543
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
That's the problem.

544
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Why must it be me?

545
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
I don't know.

546
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
I only know that

547
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
I have to complete my mission.

548
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
But I believe

549
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,880
you can do it.

550
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
I always think so.

551
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
I can feel your touch

552
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
when I listen to your words.

553
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
I can see the eyes of the people.

554
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
I think

555
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
the people of Cheng country

556
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
will believe

557
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,880
that you can lead them to that day.

558
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,880
The end

559
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,880
According to your words,

560
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,880
peace talks and war need money.

561
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
How much do we need?

562
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Your Majesty,

563
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,880
we need to settle the scores.

564
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,880
You must have spent a lot of money on the ceremony.

565
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,880
You spent money on this kind of trivial thing.

566
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
You don't have any money now?

567
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,880
What is this?

568
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,880
Enough. I just want to know how much money the treasury has now.

569
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
How much money do you need?

570
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Your Majesty, this indeed requires a lot of planning.

571
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Your Majesty, do you really miss him?

572
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,880
I just want to know how much money the treasury has now.

573
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Your Majesty, the treasury is empty now.

574
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,880
Where did the money go?

575
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,880
Your Majesty, recently, the country has been very poor.

576
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,880
There is really no income.

577
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,880
Plus the death of the late king,

578
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,880
the repair of the palace, and so on.

579
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,880
It really requires a lot of capital.

580
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,880
The treasury is empty. The country knows everything.

581
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,880
But what Your Majesty really wants to know is this year.

582
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
The country is well-known in the world of salt and night.

583
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,880
The tax on the country's annual half is covered by salt and night.

584
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,880
Even if we catch up with the disaster, the salt production will not be affected.

585
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,880
Moreover, there are tax payers from all states.

586
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,880
Yes, yes, yes. I just want to ask this.

587
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,880
This year's salt tax and tax payers.

588
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
Did you figure it out?

589
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,880
Also, did the tax payers use it for other purposes?

590
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
Where did the money go?

591
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,880
Is this matter up to the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Rites?

592
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Your Majesty.

593
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,880
Your Majesty, the harem must not interfere.

594
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,880
What Madam Xiao did was against the law.

595
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
This is also an interference?

596
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,880
Grand Tutor, is this considered?

597
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,880
The big picture is not considered to be urgent.

598
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
The big picture is not considered to be small.

599
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Now is the time to change the situation.

600
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
No law, no law.

601
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
Your Majesty.

602
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Who will answer the question I just asked?

603
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Your Majesty,

604
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,880
this year's tax payers must remember everything.

605
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,880
If you have any doubts, I am willing to help investigate.

606
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
Your Majesty,

607
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Your Majesty is Li Wanji.

608
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,880
I am willing to cooperate with the Ministry of Six to investigate this matter.

609
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
How about this?

610
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Everyone is busy.

611
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,880
This military emergency, I will personally investigate this matter.

612
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Your Majesty, you are the king of a country.

613
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,880
This kind of small matter is still handed over to the Ministry of Revenue to handle.

614
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
I agree.

615
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
Your Majesty, as the ruler of a country,

616
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,880
the investigation account is already fair and proper.

617
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
You guys are all over the place.

618
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,880
What is the purpose?

619
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
Your Majesty,

620
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,880
I am sure that this matter is still handed over to the Ministry of Revenue to handle.

621
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,880
What if I have to investigate it personally?

622
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,880
I object.

623
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
Is there anything against it?

624
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,880
Investigate!

625
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
Investigate!

626
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,880
Old man.

627
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,880
What are you doing?

628
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Old man,

629
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
tell me the truth.

630
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,880
Which side are you on?

631
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,880
The main battle or the main river?

632
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,880
I want to ask you, Lord Zhang.

633
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,880
Do you want to fight the main battle or the main river?

634
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
Don't play with me.

635
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,880
The Ministry of Revenue is your people.

636
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,880
If you don't investigate now, what is your intention?

637
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,880
I don't know anything about investigating.

638
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Lord Zhang, you are the leader of the court.

639
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,880
At the end, I'm afraid you need to talk to me.

640
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,880
And you are now abusing Mrs. Xiao's authority to fight the court.

641
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,880
The old saying is like a flower that is always blooming.

642
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
Stop talking nonsense!

643
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,880
That bitch has never listened to me.

644
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
Dr. Wang,

645
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,880
do you not understand

646
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,880
or are you pretending to be confused with me?

647
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,880
We can't afford to fight this battle.

648
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,880
You're a man of your word.

649
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Have you ever seen blood in your life?

650
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
The war is clear.

651
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
Where's the money?

652
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
Where's the money?

653
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,880
I believe that the battle is in the hands of the King.

654
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,880
The King is in his hands!

655
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,880
The King is in his hands!

656
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,880
Honey, you're in time.

657
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,880
But how do you know they'll talk about the check?

658
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
I don't know.

659
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,880
But I know they'll do something about the battle.

660
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
So I'll make it hard for you.

661
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,880
You're amazing.

662
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,880
Look, you've made the old guys agree to the check.

663
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
You're amazing.

664
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,880
You've made the check yourself.

665
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
That's amazing.

666
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
I'm not going to fight with you.

667
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Something's wrong.

668
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,880
The tree has grown.

669
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,880
It's all in the same place.

670
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,880
It'll come back to life.

671
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,880
What's wrong?

672
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,880
What? You want to help him too?

673
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
I'm sorry.

674
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
I'm sorry.

675
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,880
I'm sorry.

676
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
I'm sorry.

677
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
I'm sorry.

678
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,880
I'm sorry.

679
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,880
I'm sorry.

680
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,880
I'm sorry.

681
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
I'm sorry.

682
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,880
I'm sorry.

683
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
I'm sorry.

684
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
I'm sorry.

685
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm sorry.

686
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
I'm sorry.

687
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,880
I'm sorry.

688
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,880
I'm sorry.

689
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,880
I'm sorry.

690
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,880
I'm sorry.

691
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,880
I'm sorry.

692
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,880
I'm sorry.

693
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,880
I'm sorry.

694
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,880
I'm sorry.

695
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,880
I'm sorry.

696
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,880
I'm sorry.

697
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,880
I'm sorry.

698
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,880
I'm sorry.

699
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,880
I'm sorry.

700
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,880
I'm sorry.

701
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
I'm sorry.

702
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
I'm sorry.

703
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
I'm sorry.

704
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,880
I'm sorry.

705
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,880
I'm sorry.

706
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
I'm sorry.

707
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,880
I'm sorry.

708
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,880
I'm sorry.

709
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
I'm sorry.

710
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,880
I'm sorry.

711
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,880
I'm sorry.

712
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
I'm sorry.

713
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
I'm sorry.

714
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
I'm sorry.

715
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,880
I'm sorry.

716
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
I'm sorry.

717
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
I'm sorry.

718
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
I'm sorry.

719
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
I'm sorry.

720
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
I'm sorry.

721
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
I'm sorry.

722
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
I'm sorry.

723
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,880
I'm sorry.

724
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,880
I'm sorry.

725
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,880

726
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,880
I'm sorry.

727

I'm sorry.

728
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,880
I'm sorry.
