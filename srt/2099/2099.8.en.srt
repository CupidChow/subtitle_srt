1
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,079
Why is His Majesty in such a hurry?

2
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,359
It's midday.

3
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,959
And he rushed to the Treasury.

4
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,799
It's not even our shift yet.

5
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,719
Don't be silly.

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,000
It's urgent.

7
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,959
Listen up.

8
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,040
Whatever they find out

9
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,719
about the muddled accounts,

10
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,079
we might have to take the blame.

11
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:51,480
Got it?

12
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,079
Yes.

13
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,519
I guess

14
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,719
His Majesty was frightened
after praying for rain.

15
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,920
He is

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,439
throwing tantrums like a kid.

17
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,680
=Episode 8=
Yes, Eunuch Li.

18
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,280
(The Way of Rebirth)
Everyone knows

19
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,519
you get to manage the Treasury

20
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,959
as the Dowager and Grand Marshal

21
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,920
favor you.

22
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,560
They favor me?

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,840
Do you hear yourself?

24
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,159
Greetings, Your Majesty.

25
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,800
Greetings, Lady Xiao.

26
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,120
Your Majesty, look.

27
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,960
This is only part
of this year's accounts.

28
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,520
Is there still a need
to check the Treasury?

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,919
Be quiet.

30
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Since I manage the Treasury,

31
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,680
I've been working

32
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,759
very hard

33
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,159
for fear that my men

34
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,319
make mistakes.

35
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,280
Fortunately, they did a good job.

36
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,000
Currently, the accounts are clear.

37
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,639
These are accounts

38
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,360
from the former king's reign

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,319
to the current reign.

40
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,159
Ledgers of the Ministry of Revenue

41
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,919
and mine

42
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,960
are here.

43
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,159
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,319
Take your time.

45
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,800
After all, it takes a while

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,159
to check these accounts.

47
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,800
Please don't

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,879
wear yourself out.

49
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,479
I will prepare some tea for you.

50
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,199
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,840
What are we figuring out?

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,319
I just want to know

53
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,120
how the Treasury is

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,319
out of money.

55
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,479
You need money?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The Wu Army will attack.

57
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,319
Whether we fight

58
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,319
or not, we need money.

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,599
Money isn't the issue.

60
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,879
The point is,

61
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,360
why is it out of money?

62
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,319
However,

63
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,000
this year's salt tax revenues
and local tax revenues

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,199
are over eight million taels in total.

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,719
It was spent
right after being put in the Treasury?

66
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,079
Shall I

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,240
ask the kitchen staff

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,920
to cook some food

69
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,319
and send it here?

70
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,920
Your ledger

71
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,720
is really clear.

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,199
I didn't find a single problem.

73
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,759
I told you.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,920
The accounts are very clear.

75
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
However,

76
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,480
no problem found

77
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,519
is the biggest problem.

78
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,920
Your Majesty, I'm completely unaware.

79
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,879
Do you want money

80
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,000
or your life?

81
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,519
If there is embezzlement,

82
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,800
auditing is completely useless.

83
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,639
These accounts can be balanced.

84
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,120
You manage accounts.

85
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,639
Money is put in,

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,399
and you can take it out.

87
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,920
Even if there is no balance left,

88
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,480
I can push you

89
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,120
to change the result.

90
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,000
Tell me.

91
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,680
Where did the eight million

92
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,600
in revenue go?

93
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,079
I don't know.

94
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,040
Good for you.

95
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,519
Then tell me

96
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,439
who to ask

97
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,199
and who knows?

98
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,040
Well,

99
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,439
the bulk of that money was

100
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,199
spent on repairing the palace.

101
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,759
So, you should ask

102
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,720
Zhang Chao, the Minister of Works.

103
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Zhang Chao?

104
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,120
Where is he?

105
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,199
He should now be on duty at the office
outside Jingyang Gate.

106
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,720
Let's go.

107
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,639
Zhang Chao became

108
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,040
Minister of Works for his skills

109
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
in construction.

110
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,399
He used to ride with
Grand Marshal as an advisor.

111
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,920
One of Grand Marshal's men.

112
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,920
Will you keep following the clues?

113
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,759
Sure.

114
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,120
Alright, I'll do it with you.

115
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,720
Anyway, I've announced my mistakes.

116
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,199
I'm not afraid anymore.

117
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,000
My ministers say

118
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,240
I am wise

119
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
and brave.

120
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,480
Then I will show them

121
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,000
what a real wise ruler is.

122
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,959
What an unfavorable start.

123
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,839
Greetings, Your Majesty.

124
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,000
Zhang Chao.

125
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:44,839
Yes.

126
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,399
How much did you spend

127
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,000
on the renovation?

128
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,959
The cost of materials and labor is

129
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,000
more than two million.

130
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,439
Specifically, how much?

131
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,240
Your Majesty,

132
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,240
you came here for the Treasury, right?

133
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,120
During the repair,

134
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,879
all accounts are recorded clearly.

135
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,560
But the Ministry of Works
only handles the construction.

136
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,639
As for the records

137
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,199
of the expenses

138
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,160
and appropriation,

139
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,120
you have to

140
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,240
ask the Ministry of Revenue.

141
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,040
I see.

142
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,439
Okay.

143
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,560
Let's go.

144
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,720
Your Majesty!

145
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,360
Your Majesty!

146
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,279
These are accounts

147
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,839
from the former king's reign

148
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,839
to the current reign.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,480
Ledgers of the Ministry of Revenue

150
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,160
and mine

151
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,199
are here.

152
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,639
Your Majesty.

153
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,839
Take your time.

154
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,519
After all, it takes a while

155
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,879
to check these accounts.

156
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,839
Please don't

157
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,920
wear yourself out.

158
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,680
I will prepare some tea for you.

159
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
You come back!

160
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,560
No problem found

161
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,959
is the biggest problem.

162
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
I don't know.

163
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,879
Your Majesty.

164
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,039
I knew it.

165
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,200
Please spare my life.

166
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,080
Please.

167
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,200
I truly have no idea, Your Majesty.

168
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,000
You tell me.

169
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
This year, salt tax revenues
and local tax revenues

170
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,080
are over eight million, right?

171
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,759
Yes.

172
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,159
Is most of that money spent
on the Ministry of Works?

173
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,919
Yes.

174
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,799
Is the Ministry of Works
outside Jingyang Gate?

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,639
Yes.

176
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:58,960
Come on.

177
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,120
Ministry of Works.

178
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,080
Your Majesty.

179
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,039
Minister of Works...

180
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,360
Zhang Chao

181
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,399
once served under the Grand Marshal.

182
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,279
He joined the army once.

183
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,200
He's skilled in carpentry.

184
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,600
Father promoted him
to lead the Ministry of Works.

185
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,120
Your Majesty,

186
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,519
how do you know everything?

187
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,399
Of course, I do.

188
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,360
I'm the chosen one.

189
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,879
Right.

190
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,840
I believe so.

191
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,159
Are you sure?

192
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,279
Yes, I'm sure.

193
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,360
This time,

194
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,840
I must follow the clues.

195
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,679
Greetings, Your Majesty.

196
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,440
Zhang Chao,

197
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,840
you spent over two million

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,919
on house repairs,

199
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,720
right?

200
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:38,759
Yes.

201
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,279
But I should ask

202
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,679
the Ministry of Revenue

203
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,440
about the details?

204
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,320
Your Majesty, you came...

205
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,159
Just say yes or no.

206
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,080
Yes.

207
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,320
Did you send an assassin

208
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,320
to kill me?

209
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,000
Did you send an assassin to kill me?

210
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,000
Your Majesty.

211
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,240
I didn't.

212
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,639
I'm completely unaware

213
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,840
of the assassination.

214
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,600
I'll get back to you later.

215
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,480
Go. Ministry of Revenue.

216
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,559
Well,

217
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,840
are we taking a tour?

218
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,639
Go.

219
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,320
Got it?

220
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,919
Around that corner ahead,

221
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,600
an assassin is ambushing me.

222
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,559
A person

223
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,879
with a dagger.

224
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,960
Now,

225
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,120
we wait for you here.

226
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,879
You go and take him down.

227
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,639
Yes.

228
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,519
You're actually right.

229
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,879
Assassin!

230
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:03,399
Your Majesty,

231
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,000
how did you know?

232
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,320
You guessed correctly.

233
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
I told you.

234
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,679
I'm the chosen one.

235
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,600
Speak.

236
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,960
Who sent you here?

237
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,879
If you confess now,

238
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,639
His Majesty might spare your life.

239
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,879
You won't talk?

240
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,120
I have plenty of ways to make you talk.

241
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,399
Either talk or die now.

242
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,360
Come on.

243
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,919
Make it quick.

244
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,320
I can stab you 49 times

245
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,279
before killing you.

246
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,519
You sure you won't speak?

247
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,399
I'll speak.

248
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,960
Spare me. I'll speak.

249
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,279
Li Xuan sent me here.

250
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,240
Li Xuan?

251
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,279
You mean the Minister of Revenue,

252
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,120
Li Xuan?

253
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,879
Yes, it's him.

254
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,600
He asked me to ambush here.

255
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,879
Are you telling the truth?

256
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,720
Sure, I am.

257
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,840
Where is he now?

258
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,440
He's not on duty now.

259
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,120
He's in the yard over there.

260
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,840
It hurts so much!

261
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,840
Spare me.

262
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,039
I've said everything I know.

263
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,600
Let's go.

264
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,159
Arrest him.

265
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,200
Your Majesty.

266
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,879
Your Majesty, spare me.

267
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,519
Your Majesty.

268
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:41,879
Well...

269
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,440
I knew it.

270
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,440
(Ledger)
No wonder you objected earlier.

271
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,759
You feared it would lead to you.

272
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,440
As the Minister of Revenue,

273
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,639
you embezzle funds.

274
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,039
How dare you?

275
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,600
Your Majesty.

276
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,720
Initially, I didn't intend
to graft this year's salt tax revenues

277
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,120
or the revenues from the prefectures.

278
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,919
But someone told me

279
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,480
that I could cook the books

280
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,600
after the money was put in.

281
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,200
No issues would arise.

282
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,720
And no one would check it.

283
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,720
No one would dare to do that.

284
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,799
So I just...

285
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,679
So,

286
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,200
this is the real ledger, right?

287
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,480
Yes.

288
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:28,600
Who is it?

289
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,360
Speak.

290
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:33,679
Zhang Chao.

291
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,759
Zhang Chao.

292
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,879
The Minister of Works?

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,720
Yes.

294
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,320
Should we arrest him now?

295
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,600
Continue.

296
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,320
Yes.

297
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,840
Your Majesty,

298
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,799
here's the thing.

299
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,600
There was an extensive renovation.

300
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,080
The Ministry of Revenue
quoted at two million.

301
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,200
The Ministry of Works
actually allocated only 1.2 million,

302
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,759
short by

303
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,480
800,000 taels.

304
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,159
It was short by 1.2 million

305
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,039
for the disaster relief in Chenzhou.

306
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,679
800?

307
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,120
Yes.

308
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,360
How much was embezzled?

309
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,440
Half of that money.

310
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,080
You earn more than I do!

311
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,399
Tell me.

312
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,200
How was it divided?

313
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,399
I only took 20 percent.

314
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,720
Zhang Chao took 30 percent.

315
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,639
He gave the remaining money

316
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,840
to the person behind it.

317
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,039
He said none of us could afford
to offend them.

318
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,080
The assassin

319
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,399
was sent by you?

320
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,360
Assassin?

321
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,799
What assassin?

322
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,600
I know nothing about it.

323
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,679
They only asked me to destroy evidence.

324
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,600
Your Majesty,
I have nothing to do with that.

325
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,360
I am indeed guilty,

326
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,960
but I have

327
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,240
nothing to do with that.

328
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,200
I am guilty.

329
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,120
I am guilty.

330
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Of course, you and Zhang Chao both are.

331
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,799
Spare me, Your Majesty.

332
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,639
Show mercy.

333
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,600
Speak.

334
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,399
The one behind it,

335
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,080
is it Grand Marshal

336
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,519
or Grand Tutor Wang?

337
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,200
Well...

338
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,480
Speak!

339
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,440
Well,

340
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,480
it's...

341
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,200
It's...

342
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,639
Don't move.

343
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,240
Wake up.

344
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,039
Wake up!

345
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,679
Leave it.

346
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:23,840
Shot in the heart.

347
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:24,679
He's dead.

348
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,399
How is it going?

349
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,440
Didn't catch them.

350
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,279
They escaped.

351
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,320
I'll order

352
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,279
a city-wide search.

353
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,559
It's over.

354
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,080
So, it's a dead end again.

355
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,679
Which step exactly went wrong?

356
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,480
Eunuch Li of the Treasury?

357
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,600
The Ministry of Works?

358
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,639
The Ministry of Revenue?

359
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:57,679
The Ministry of Rites?

360
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,440
The Ministry of War?

361
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,320
That's not right.

362
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Which step exactly went wrong?

363
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,320
Your Majesty.

364
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,080
These people

365
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,600
are lawless.

366
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,000
Do they even regard me as their king?

367
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,360
In front of me,

368
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,879
they killed a man in broad daylight.

369
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,080
How about

370
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,279
we question the first assassin again?

371
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,480
Maybe the two assassins are connected.

372
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,240
Which step went wrong?

373
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,600
Since Li Xuan died,

374
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,600
we question some vice ministers.

375
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,240
Maybe we'll find some clues.

376
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:37,399
For questioning, we should start
with Zhang Chao.

377
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,559
He knows something.

378
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,000
Well,

379
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,080
Your Majesty,

380
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,759
what should we do?

381
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:44,960
No, wait.

382
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,120
Since Zhang Chao told us

383
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,200
to come to the Ministry of Revenue,

384
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,200
surely he has a backup plan.

385
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,360
You're right.

386
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,559
Even if you ask Zhang Chao now,

387
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,759
he will claim to be innocent.

388
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,519
I came to the Ministry of Revenue,

389
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,559
and they killed Li Xuan.

390
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:04,799
It means

391
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,319
I found the right clue.

392
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:06,960
Yes.

393
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,000
Li Xuan is dead,

394
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,799
and dead men tell no tales.

395
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,519
That's right.

396
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,680
I must be quicker.

397
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,400
I must be quicker.

398
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,400
I must be quicker.

399
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,480
Your Majesty!

400
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,480
It really hurts.

401
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,319
Since I manage the Treasury,

402
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,119
I've been working

403
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,119
very hard

404
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,599
for fear that my men

405
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,599
make mistakes.

406
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,599
Fortunately...

407
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,799
You old thing.

408
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,519
You shut up!

409
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:00,440
Nonsense!

410
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,319
Spare me.

411
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,359
Please, Your Majesty.

412
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,200
You liar.

413
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,000
Let's go.

414
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:08,480
Your Majesty.

415
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,720
What are we doing here?

416
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,079
Your Majesty.

417
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,119
Zhang Chao.

418
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,240
Go. Ministry of Revenue.

419
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,279
There is an assassin ahead.

420
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,200
I'll run.

421
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,400
You follow me.

422
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,799
Your Majesty. How did you know?

423
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,960
Can you

424
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,359
not ask the same question?

425
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,319
Long Qi.

426
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,720
There will be

427
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,240
an assassin over there.

428
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,599
They're much better
than the one with a dagger.

429
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:58,400
You

430
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,880
go there now and ambush them.

431
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,319
I reckon

432
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
it's about time.

433
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:02,880
But

434
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,240
how...

435
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:04,680
I...

436
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,400
Should I drop it?

437
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,279
There really is an assassin.

438
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,319
Long Qi.

439
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:25,880
You interrogate him.

440
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,200
Let's go in

441
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
and see Li Xuan.

442
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:47,960
I'm Li Xuan, Minister of Revenue.

443
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,640
Greetings, Your Majesty

444
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,200
and Lady Xiao.

445
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,720
You know I am coming, huh?

446
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,920
I will ask you one question.

447
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,759
Who's the one supporting you

448
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,200
and Zhang Chao?

449
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:04,799
Is it Grand Marshal

450
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,400
or Grand Tutor Wang?

451
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,200
Wait.

452
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
He took poison.

453
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
He's dead?

454
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,680
This is different from the last life.

455
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,720
Last life?

456
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,400
He's dead?

457
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:32,359
Your Majesty.

458
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,160
Speak!

459
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,400
Who is the person

460
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,599
behind it?

461
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:41,960
Your Majesty. I just found out
he is mute.

462
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,799
What?

463
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,680
Since that's the case,

464
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,920
I'll start over.

465
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:57,960
Your Majesty!

466
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,519
Since I manage the Treasury,

467
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,079
I've been working...

468
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,359
It hurts even more than last time.

469
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,480
Chest pain?

470
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,119
It's fine.

471
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,920
Have you thought of any new clues again?

472
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:21,319
Strange,

473
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,880
why did I say "again"?

474
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:23,799
Honey.

475
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,519
You know about my reincarnation?

476
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,519
Never mind.

477
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,279
Don't you have any questions?

478
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,759
Whenever you speak in that tone,

479
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,039
I better not ask

480
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,799
because

481
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I might get hit.

482
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,799
Good for you.

483
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,240
Very clever.

484
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,200
Long Qi.

485
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,759
Have Imperial Guards

486
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,279
split into two groups.

487
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
One group goes to the Ministry of Works

488
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,559
outside Jingyang Gate

489
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,599
and brings Zhang Chao here.

490
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,599
The other group

491
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,519
goes to the Ministry of Revenue

492
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,680
and brings Li Xuan here,

493
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,400
alive or dead.

494
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,440
Remember,

495
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,440
as long as there's written stuff
on them,

496
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:14,880
including small notes,

497
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,000
bring it all back.

498
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:16,799
Yes.

499
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,000
I haven't finished yet.

500
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,880
Come closer.

501
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:32,400
Really?

502
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,799
Sure.

503
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,240
Go ahead.

504
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Aren't you supposed
to check the accounts?

505
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,279
Why suddenly arrest the two ministers?

506
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:46,799
This doesn't make sense.

507
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,759
We're arresting people instead of

508
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:49,920
checking the ledger?

509
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,559
I actually think

510
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,200
it's quite interesting.

511
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,319
I will go to the kitchen

512
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,519
to prepare some food for Your Majesty.

513
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,359
Come back.

514
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm not hungry.

515
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:03,759
No need to prepare food.

516
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Eunuch Li.

517
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,920
You and I wait for them

518
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,200
to return.

519
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,000
By the orders of His Majesty,

520
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,559
Li Xuan, Minister of Revenue,

521
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,799
enters the palace.

522
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,599
You freaked me out.

523
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,119
Commander Zhou,

524
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,039
you startled me.

525
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,640
Why is His Majesty summoning me

526
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
to the palace?

527
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,559
Did His Majesty really find out?

528
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
Besides,

529
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,839
what's the plan?

530
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,920
He says

531
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,279
if you leave now,

532
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,839
he'll save your life.

533
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,359
The carriage is waiting for you
outside the city.

534
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,680
The guards at the city gate

535
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:46,960
will let you go.

536
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,119
Alright.

537
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,160
I will leave now.

538
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,319
I will leave now.

539
00:24:08,095 --> 00:24:10,454
(To Fan Kuan,
Minister of War of Wu State)

540
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,599
Still not confessing?

541
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,839
Alright.

542
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:22,559
No rush.

543
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,680
Your Majesty.

544
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,640
This is everything.

545
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,920
As expected,

546
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,400
the Imperial Guards

547
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,000
have moles.

548
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:41,892
(Ledger)

549
00:24:45,306 --> 00:24:46,464
(To Fan Kuan,
Minister of War of Wu State)

550
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:51,808
(Secret Letter)

551
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,359
What about Li Xuan?

552
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,119
He's dead.

553
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,279
Again?

554
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,440
I was late.

555
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
Please forgive me.

556
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:04,640
Eunuch Li.

557
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,440
So, the mastermind,

558
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,599
are you going to confess?

559
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,799
You embezzled tax revenues

560
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,480
and betrayed the country.

561
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,920
You leaked our defense deployment maps

562
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,559
and weapon designs.

563
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,000
You colluded with Wu State
with hundreds of officials.

564
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,160
You spent the embezzled money

565
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,839
on the properties in Wu State.

566
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,480
Most of the money was transited
through Hanzhou

567
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,640
under the protection
of the Governor of Hanzhou.

568
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,319
Hanzhou is doomed.

569
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,599
Zhang Chao,

570
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,759
how did you become like this?

571
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,200
Who gave you the guts

572
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,880
to commit a capital offense?

573
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,880
You'll get your whole family killed.

574
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,599
You were righteous when you fought

575
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,799
alongside me.

576
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,000
What happened to you?

577
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:00,799
What are you laughing at?

578
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,119
Grand Marshal.

579
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,480
Why do you keep asking him?

580
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:11,400
Aren't you aware
of the military strength

581
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,559
of Chen State?

582
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,400
Wu State has raised an army.

583
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,880
Chen State is doomed.

584
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,359
Back off.

585
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,519
I don't intend to hurt anyone.

586
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,240
I just want to say something.

587
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,200
Is that okay?

588
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,759
Is that okay?

589
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,799
Is that okay?

590
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Let him speak.

591
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,519
Why did I collaborate with Wu State?

592
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,799
Why did I embezzle money?

593
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,359
I did it all to leave myself a way out.

594
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,000
Due to the prestige
King Chen Wu established back then,

595
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,559
the Wu Army doesn't move for now.

596
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,680
But they'll attack sooner or later.

597
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,039
Why can't I plan for myself?

598
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,920
Chen Xiaohua,

599
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,720
you made the Edict of Self-Reproach

600
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,680
and then the rain fell.

601
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,519
You thought you were remarkable.

602
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,880
How many stupid things have you done?

603
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,119
Have you ever changed?

604
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,400
You never have.

605
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,720
The Minister of Revenue

606
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,359
has his reasons.

607
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,119
Ministry of Revenue? Ridiculous.

608
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,880
That ministry has no money at all.

609
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,319
When King Chen Wu was alive,

610
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,799
the Ministry of Revenue was rich.

611
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,960
Since you became king,

612
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,920
the Ministry of Revenue has been a mess.

613
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:51,960
Can you manage it well?

614
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,799
No, you can't.

615
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:56,680
What is the current level
of the soldiers?

616
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,000
How long has it been
since they practiced?

617
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,640
Grand Marshal.

618
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,160
You tell us.

619
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:04,720
Though I think

620
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,079
we all know.

621
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,079
You're short of money.

622
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,640
You are like a paperhanger

623
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,079
working on appearances.

624
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,640
You're helpless to change it.

625
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,079
Grand Tutor Wang.

626
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,519
He is not here, but it's okay.

627
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:20,880
Don't judge

628
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,640
the Governor of Hanzhou.

629
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,480
He has no money

630
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,920
or military supplies needed.

631
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
He only has

632
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,200
hundreds of old soldiers around my age

633
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,000
guarding the city.

634
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,200
Can he guard it?

635
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,079
He can't.

636
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,039
After one year, I'm poor yet patriotic.

637
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,160
After two years, I'm poor yet patriotic.

638
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,359
After another year,

639
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,799
I would starve to death.

640
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,400
We're loyal to Chen State.

641
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:54,599
But who can protect us?

642
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,400
Can Chen Xiaohua do it?

643
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,000
You're incapable

644
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,559
of fighting Wu State.

645
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,839
Shame on you.

646
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,920
Shame on you!

647
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,559
Chen State

648
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,799
is going to perish!

649
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,000
You shut up!

650
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,880
I won't

651
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,799
let it happen.

652
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,640
In any case,

653
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,599
you can't change it.

654
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,200
If you don't believe me,
ask your sister.

655
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,839
You'll know how much she's taken
in your name.

656
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:27,480
Your Majesty.

657
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,480
Please allow me to kill this wretch.

658
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,440
Let him finish.

659
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,519
Chen Xiaohua,

660
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,920
you are destined

661
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,599
to be a ruler of a fallen state.

662
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:55,519
The century-old legacy of Chen State

663
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,880
will all be destroyed at your hands.

664
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,319
Let me tell you the truth.

665
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,720
King Wu has declared

666
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,039
that they will seize the capital
within half a month.

667
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,039
Right now,

668
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,400
I'm just going to die ahead of you.

669
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,599
I love Chen State,

670
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,920
but who loves me?

671
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,799
Why are you all looking at me?

672
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:20,599
I'm fine.

673
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
I'm going out

674
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,720
to take a break.

675
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,240
Your Majesty.

676
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,799
The Governor of Hanzhou has
joined the Wu Army with his forces.

677
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,480
Governor Wang Kai and the general
opened the city gates

678
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,319
for King Wu.

679
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,759
All the officials and guards in the city

680
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,400
have all defected.

681
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,319
Why did it happen?

682
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,440
How could they defect?

683
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,400
Your Majesty.

684
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,200
Grand Marshal,

685
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,960
should we discuss this first

686
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:41,480
or another matter first?

687
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,079
What do you think, Your Majesty?

688
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,079
Imperial Guards!

689
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:50,799
- Yes.
- Yes.

690
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,440
Why?

691
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,359
Your Majesty!

692
00:32:57,984 --> 00:32:58,960
Your Majesty!

693
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,279
Your Majesty, why?

694
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,680
Your Majesty!

695
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,559
Come on.

696
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:04,640
Move.

697
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,319
Money is gone.

698
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,039
So are my officials.

699
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,680
Let me think twice

700
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,359
about fighting Wu State.

701
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:19,680
Court adjourned.

702
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:33,319
(Li Xuan, Minister of Revenue,)

703
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,960
(Zhang Chao, Minister of Works,)

704
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,680
(and Yi Xiangquan, Minister of War,)

705
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,960
(colluded with officials)

706
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,920
(in six ministries)

707
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,200
(to embezzle money.)

708
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,640
(The military funds embezzled)

709
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,799
(have reached millions.)

710
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,880
(It's unpardonable)

711
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,039
(and outrageous.)

712
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,599
(The people have long suffered
from corruption.)

713
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,799
(The current officials)

714
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:52,400
(should not deceive the superior
nor neglect the subordinate.)

715
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,599
(If the ministers are stagnant
and afraid,)

716
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,680
(they won't even dare
to do small good deeds.)

717
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,599
(By the edict of His Majesty,)

718
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,680
(execute the families
of criminal officials involved.)

719
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
(Hereby making it public)

720
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,440
(to serve as a warning.)

721
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:08,519
Get the carriage.

722
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:09,360
I'm leaving.

723
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,719
Quickly bring out my son.

724
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,719
We meet outside the city.

725
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,440
Why?

726
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,440
Do what I say.

727
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,760
Eunuch Li has given all of us away.

728
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,360
My brother will definitely not spare me.

729
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,719
If I don't leave now,

730
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,719
I won't be able to leave.

731
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,239
I heard he has already reached Hanzhou.

732
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,559
I need to go see him.

733
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,639
Once I meet him,

734
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:33,800
everything will be fine.

735
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,760
Yes.

736
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,840
Hurry up!

737
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,920
Hurry up!

738
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,119
How dare you!

739
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,119
What are you doing?

740
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,119
Open the door.

741
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,559
Open the door!

742
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,599
Open the door!

743
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,559
I want to see my brother.

744
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,599
Brother.

745
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,199
Brother.

746
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,280
I know you're there.

747
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,480
So this is your order.

748
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,599
Your Majesty.

749
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,480
Well,

750
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,639
her nature is not bad.

751
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,880
She must have been incited by traitors.

752
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,360
I do not believe

753
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,760
she's colluded with Wu State.

754
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,679
Well,

755
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,320
considering she's my sister,

756
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,360
I hope you can spare her life.

757
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:53,960
Brother.

758
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,039
When did you start siding
with Chen Xiaohua?

759
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,079
Didn't you say he was unreliable

760
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:03,760
and that he should be deposed?

761
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:08,960
Our family has been loyal.

762
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:12,400
We gave it all to Chen State.

763
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,400
But how has Chen Xiaohua treated you?

764
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,920
Let me tell you the truth.

765
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,039
I've indeed colluded with Wu State.

766
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,400
Chen Xiaohua.

767
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,639
Can you guess

768
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,840
how did King Wu quickly invade Hanzhou?

769
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,599
Half of the nation's tax revenue has

770
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,360
become the Wu Army's military expenses
