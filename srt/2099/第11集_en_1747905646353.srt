1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
After a short break

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's dangerous.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, I don't understand.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What is it that you have to say?

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I've actually told you many times.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But I don't think you'll believe me.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I believe everything you say.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm actually a man of the heavens.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You must be.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I can be reborn.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I checked the accounts of the last life.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I caught a lot of important officials.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But then, the five countries invaded the capital.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You all died.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The last life and the last life, and the last life.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I actually have a wife.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Her name is Mrs. Xiao.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
She's different from everyone.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
She thinks I can be a good king.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But in the end, I still failed.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you understand?

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If you don't understand anything, just ask.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Although it sounds a bit ridiculous,

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I believe in you.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The point is, do you really have no impression of Zhang Xiao'er?

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't know.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But I think His Majesty must really love Mrs. Xiao.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Do you think I'm crazy?

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If His Majesty says so,

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
this time, are we going to attack?

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Maybe.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I still didn't go to the morning court today.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I thought that when Qu Yu came back,

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
he would change his mood.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And also,

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
he's been looking for a beauty lately.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He said it was his own concubine.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The imperial guards all went out.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They searched the whole capital but couldn't find her.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Little bastard.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You're determined to be a king.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's good.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's good too.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The more he came to pick me up,

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the closer we are.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
King, what are we going to do next?

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Fishing.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And then?

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Still fishing.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
At this moment, the army of the Wu Army is pressing in.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Shouldn't you be looking at the bright side and deploy against the Wu?

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't want to.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Why?

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can't do anything.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I thought that I could save Chen Gu Yu from the fire

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
by chasing back the sleeping camp.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But I didn't expect that

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
it would speed up the progress of the Wu.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't want to see you and everyone

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
die in front of me.

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
King, don't worry.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm going to live well.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
As a human being,

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
you have to live well.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Then you say,

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
if I don't do anything,

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
maybe the result will be different.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You don't have to die.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He doesn't have to disappear.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
King, I don't understand.

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But if one day,

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I die because of you,

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I will not live alone.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Enough.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What do you mean by die?

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You have to live well.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Brother.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Silly fish.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The most tempting is the most dangerous.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why are you so silly?

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I thought that the king's thunderous means

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
of punishing, corrupting and attacking the national treasury

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
had been directed by the Ming army.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I didn't expect to go back to the past.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I heard that

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
he buried the chicken of General Changsheng

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and cried all afternoon.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I heard it.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The enemy is in front of us.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Is he afraid or

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
he has other intentions?

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Dr. Wang,

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you think too highly of him.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What does he want from another intention?

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Tell me now.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
How can he stop the enemy from coming?

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He is hoping that King Wu will withdraw his troops.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think that the king

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
is different from before.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I can't say it,

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
but I can feel it.

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He couldn't do it before.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He did it in the court that day.

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That kind of thing.

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
In public, I hugged you, Dr. Wang.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Master,

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
don't make jokes.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But I believe that

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
the king will not sit and wait.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I hope so.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
News.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Sometimes I wonder

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
if he really appeared.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm not sure about it.

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Long Qian,

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
is it possible that

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I just had a dream

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and he came out of my dream?

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Wang,

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
after inquiring,

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I found out that

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
this is the token

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
that was given to the mountain.

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Wang,

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
the mountain is located in the intersection

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
of Chen, Wu, Chu, Yue,

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and the four countries.

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The area is mixed with fish and dragon.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Due to the danger of the terrain,

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
it has become a place

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
outside the power of the countries.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It is also the center of the trade

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
of the people of various countries.

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So,

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
it is possible that

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
the jade seal is in the mountain.

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Jade seal?

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Jade seal.

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Wife,

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
did I do something wrong?

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I didn't be a qualified king

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
like you said.

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The innocent people

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
are about to be beaten.

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But this time,

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
why are you not here?

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,600
The

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Good news.

163
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I just upgraded the whole system.

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If you go in again,

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
you can keep

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
all the memories of the real world.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Really?

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's great.

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But,

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I always talk about it.

171
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You can't do it for him anymore.

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I know.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let me in.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Cai Ji.

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I knew you would come back.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Do you know

177
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
that you were not here for a while?

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
They all said I had a disease.

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They said I was looking for

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
someone who didn't exist.

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Wife,

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
where are you?

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Do you know...

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Chen Xiaohua,

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
do you know

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
that you will die if you do this?

187
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Then you will really die.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I will kill you.

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I will kill you.

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I will kill you.

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I will kill you.

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Then you will never get out of here.

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You can just

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
take a bath in the real world.

195
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You have been here for so long.

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You still do nothing

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and ignore the court.

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Do you know

199
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
how much effort I have put into saving you?

200
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Can you give me a break?

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Wife,

202
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
what are you talking about?

203
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Are you my wife?

204
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes,

205
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I am your wife.

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You are not dreaming.

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Do you want me to

208
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
repeat that password for you?

209
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You have a birthmark on your waist.

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You always talk when you eat.

211
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You snore when you sleep.

212
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Do you want me to repeat that?

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Wife,

214
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Wife,

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Wife,

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Wang,

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Longxian,

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Longxian,

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I told you,

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
my wife,

221
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Mrs. Xiao,

222
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Princess Consort.

223
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You, you remember?

224
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
How could I not know Princess Consort?

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Chen Xiaohua.

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No,

227
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I know.

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If you are my second son,

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I will ignore the court.

230
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's because you are gone.

231
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
If I am gone,

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
you can stop working.

233
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You can stop doing anything.

234
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The five-storied tree

235
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
is almost at the door of the house.

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What have you done?

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Do you want to see everyone

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
die again?

239
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Longxian,

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Longxian,

241
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
my wife is angry.

242
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Wife.

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Chen Xiaohua,

244
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
listen to me

245
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
carefully.

246
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Everything here

247
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
is fake.

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's fake.

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
This is a game world.

250
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This is a world.

251
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Longqi

252
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and everyone around you,

253
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
including the whole Chen State,

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
are all fake.

255
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
They don't exist.

256
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Do you understand?

257
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You must now

258
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
win this virtual game

259
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
with your own efforts

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
to defeat Wu State

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and become an excellent monarch

262
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
so that you can survive.

263
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Game?

264
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Longqi,

265
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
do you understand

266
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
the virtual game?

267
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No.

268
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't understand either.

269
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Wife, what do you mean?

270
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You once said

271
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
that after this game,

272
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
you would take me to the Nine Heavens.

273
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But with your current situation,

274
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I don't think I can wait until that day.

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So I beg you,

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
can you be more mature?

277
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
How am I not mature?

278
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Have you tried your best?

279
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
How did I try my best?

280
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You ask Longqi.

281
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I even asked her to find the jade shoes.

282
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We spent a lot of money, right?

283
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes.

284
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Did you find it?

285
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Not yet.

286
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But now I have an idea

287
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
that will definitely turn the tables.

288
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Just you?

289
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What idea can you come up with?

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yes.

291
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Just me, Chen Xiaohua,

292
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
have an excellent idea.

293
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And this time,

294
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I have to see it

295
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
by myself.

296
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Longqi.

297
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's go.

298
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Your Majesty.

299
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Longqi doesn't understand.

300
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You always love Mrs. Xiao the most.

301
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Don't you think she's a little bit more fierce this time?

302
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's totally different from before.

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Your Majesty.

304
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Was she not fierce before?

305
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What are you talking about?

306
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Your Majesty, what should we do next?

307
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Where is the bamboo?

308
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Bamboo?

309
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Your Majesty.

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Your Majesty.

311
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Okay.

312
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,640
Go.

313
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,560
We must find the way to the mountain

314
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,440
to get through the jade seal.

315
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,960
Benlong, do you know the way to the mountain?

316
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,200
You underestimate our secret position.

317
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,480
We've learned how to survive in the wild.

318
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,640
We can survive in the wild

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,640
through the sun, moon and stars.

320
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,320
You're really good at talking.

321
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,640
I'm really good at it.

322
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,400
Your Majesty, we have to climb the mountain

323
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,800
when we get to the bottom of the mountain.

324
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,160
I told you.

325
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,680
After you leave the palace,

326
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,920
don't call me Wang.

327
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,920
Call me Young Master.

328
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,640
Yes.

329
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,520
Young Master Wang, can you climb the mountain?

330
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,840
What are you talking about?

331
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,080
I'm a man of my word.

332
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,960
It's hard for me to do that.

333
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,880
We're here.

334
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,440
Let's go.

335
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:36,920
Go.

336
00:16:42,000 --> 00:17:05,600
Sprンド

337
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,560
Sit down.

338
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,040
Wang, you still have a long way to go.

339
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
How about I carry you?

340
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Carry what?

341
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
What do you mean?

342
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
I'm not Cai Ji.

343
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Wang, slow down.

344
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Fenlong, are you sure this is the right way?

345
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
This is not right.

346
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
It should be here.

347
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
Did you get the wrong intersection?

348
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
Which intersection?

349
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,040
Is it at the big stone?

350
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Isn't it 20 miles away?

351
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Chenguo is safe.

352
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
Isn't it like living in the wild?

353
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
You're a murderer.

354
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Don't talk nonsense.

355
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
What have you done all the way?

356
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
You didn't do anything, and you're still jumping around.

357
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
How did I do nothing?

358
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
You make it clear.

359
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
You...

360
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Take it.

361
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
What?

362
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
You're a man, and you want me to carry your bag?

363
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
And,

364
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
the Princess Consort asked me to follow you, to monitor you,

365
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
not to serve you.

366
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
You're a murderer.

367
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
Me?

368
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
I'm a murderer.

369
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
I've never lied to you.

370
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
I made a bet with the Princess Consort.

371
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
I'll see if Wang will keep being stupid.

372
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Now,

373
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
I'll be the Princess Consort's maid,

374
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,040
and I'll be with Wang to protect him for a long time.

375
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
How can you say that?

376
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
What's wrong?

377
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
You said,

378
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
am I really stupid?

379
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
No, Wang...

380
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
No, Young Master.

381
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
I'm stupid.

382
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
What Cai Yi said is right.

383
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Wang...

384
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
What are you doing?

385
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
You're smart, aren't you?

386
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
You don't know what to do.

387
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Why did you say that?

388
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
I didn't mean it.

389
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
You're the one who's mad at me.

390
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
That's not what I meant.

391
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
What should I do?

392
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
This time, you must find the jade seal

393
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,040
and prove to my wife that

394
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
I can do it.

395
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Young Master, follow me.

396
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Young Master, I'll go and have a look.

397
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Young Master,

398
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
we found two suspicious people.

399
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
There's no food.

400
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
You're not hungry.

401
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
How many things are you preparing?

402
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
I'm innocent, sir.

403
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
We just came here.

404
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
We didn't mean to rush you.

405
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Please forgive us, sir.

406
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Please forgive us.

407
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Please forgive us.

408
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
Tell me.

409
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
What are you two doing?

410
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Sir,

411
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
we're merchants

412
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
of the Shanjing Prefecture.

413
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
From Kang?

414
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Long Qing,

415
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
he doesn't look like a bad guy.

416
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
It's not easy to do business.

417
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Let him go.

418
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
Merchants.

419
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Merchants have so many old ladies.

420
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
It's hard to do business.

421
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
They're not mercenaries.

422
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Tell me the truth.

423
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
I'll let you go.

424
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Say it.

425
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,040
We're soldiers of the Shanjing Prefecture.

426
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
A while ago,

427
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
the Shouhu Army was about to attack

428
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
and the border was in chaos.

429
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
My brothers

430
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,040
said the war was about to start.

431
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
The King of Chen was in a daze.

432
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
He was on the battlefield.

433
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
He should have fled.

434
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
He was dead when he was attacked.

435
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
He was dead when he was captured.

436
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
He was still alive.

437
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,040
He was out of military power for months.

438
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
We all ran away

439
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
as soon as we got together.

440
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
So,

441
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,040
you don't want to die for the King of Chen.

442
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Exactly.

443
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
My wife and kids are waiting for him.

444
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
My brother is waiting for my sister.

445
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
We're going to the temple now.

446
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
We're not willing to die.

447
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
We are.

448
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
We're not willing to die.

449
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Let's go.

450
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Thank you, sir.

451
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Thank you, sir.

452
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Thank you.

453
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
Thank you, sir.

454
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
We have to hurry.

455
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
We should be there soon.

456
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,040
How many times have you said that?

457
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Look.

458
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Let's go.

459
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,040
I told you we wouldn't go wrong.

460
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Let's go.

461
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Let's go.

462
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Let's go.

463
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Caiyi.

464
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,040
If I stand up one day,

465
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
don't do anything behind my back.

466
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
I want to understand.

467
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Let's go.

468
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Let's go.

469
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Let's go.

470
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
Water.

471
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Are you thirsty?

472
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Sir,

473
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,040
do we still have buns?

474
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Sir,

475
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,040
we came from a long way.

476
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
It's dark here.

477
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,040
There's nothing to eat.

478
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
Can we still make buns?

479
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
We've sold out the buns.

480
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Only these three left.

481
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,040
You can eat the buns in the morning.

482
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Thank you, sir.

483
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
Thank you.

484
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
Eat.

485
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
You came from a long way.

486
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Yes, I came from a long way.

487
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Thank you.

488
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
Thank you.

489
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
What does he mean?

490
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,040
I don't know.

491
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,040
But he doesn't look like a beggar.

492
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Then what should we do?

493
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Forget it.

494
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
It's so late.

495
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
We're tired.

496
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Let's find a place to stay.

497
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Let's go.

498
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,040
This is the best inn in Guishan.

499
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
The whole Guishan is a one-way inn.

500
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Let's go.

501
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
Sir,

502
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
three rooms.

503
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
Three rooms are all closed.

504
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,040
The bed sheets and the bedding need to be new.

505
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
No rooms.

506
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
No rooms?

507
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Then the best room here

508
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
is three rooms.

509
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Sir,

510
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
we came from a long way.

511
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
We have money.

512
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
We can't afford it.

513
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
We can't afford it.

514
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
We came from a long way.

515
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
We have money.

516
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Let's see how we can afford it.

517
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
You're good friends.

518
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
You deserve it.

519
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
How dare you!

520
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Do you know who he is?

521
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
He can be anyone.

522
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
It's up to me.

523
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Sir,

524
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
we're not here to make trouble.

525
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
We just want to know

526
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,040
how we can afford it.

527
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
You have money, right?

528
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
Okay.

529
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
This room.

530
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
This room.

531
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
Humph.

532
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
He dares to ask us for so much money in this room?

533
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
It's a black shop.

534
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
I'll go find him.

535
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
Enough.

536
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,040
Don't get angry.

537
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
We came from a long way.

538
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
We need to be low-key.

539
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
He's so arrogant.

540
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
He must be reasonable.

541
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Everything is important in the big picture.

542
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
Sir,

543
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
you've changed.

544
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
How?

545
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
You never said

546
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
the big picture before.

547
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
Enough.

548
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Go and see Caiyi.

549
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Don't let anything happen to Caiyi.

550
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
I'm going to the bathroom.

551
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
What are you doing?

552
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
What do you mean?

553
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
I...

554
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
Mr. Wang asked me to see you

555
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
in case you were taken away by the wolf.

556
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
But I think

557
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,040
even if the wolf comes,

558
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
it will be killed by you.

559
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,040
You...

560
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
Tell Mr. Wang

561
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
to call me if the wolf comes.

562
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
It's useless to have you as a guard.

563
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
I'm here.

564
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
I'm taking off my clothes.

565
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Close the door.

566
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
Wang.

567
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Wang Xin.

568
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Let's sleep in the same bed tonight.

569
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
No.

570
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
I can't do that.

571
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
I'll sleep on the floor.

572
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Where's Caiyi?

573
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,040
He's fine.

574
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
I'm exhausted.

575
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,040
Aren't you?

576
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
Wang, take a rest.

577
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
I think this place is a little strange.

578
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
I'll give you a hand tonight.

579
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Yes.

580
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
This place is really strange.

581
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
But if you're tired,

582
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
who's going to protect me?

583
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
Why are you still standing?

584
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Sit down.

585
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Sit.

586
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
Mom.

587
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,040
I really think you've changed.

588
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
I said it.

589
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
What did you call me?

590
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Young Master.

591
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,040
In the past,

592
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
the ministers always said

593
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
that you didn't go to the court

594
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
and that you were just trying to get the government.

595
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
But I know

596
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
that you didn't want to take care of it.

597
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
You just wanted to be a good son.

598
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
You didn't want to be a good son.

599
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
You just wanted to be a good son.

600
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
You just wanted to be a good son.

601
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,040
But you couldn't.

602
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
Young Master is actually

603
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
a very gentle person.

604
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
You are very good to everyone.

605
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
You are responsible for us.

606
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
But this responsibility is too great.

607
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
If it were me,

608
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
I might have done it before you.

609
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
Don't misunderstand.

610
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
I didn't mean to slander.

611
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
I...

612
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
All right.

613
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
I know.

614
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,040
You never hit or

615
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
slashed anyone.

616
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Including the beggar today.

617
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
You are also very good to him.

618
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
But I always feel

619
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
that in your eyes,

620
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
we are all human beings.

621
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
What nonsense are you talking about?

622
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Silly boy.

623
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
What are you not human beings?

624
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
I mean,

625
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
you never treated us as servants.

626
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
The girl next door

627
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,040
is the assassin who killed you

628
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,380
because she was a

629
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,040
murderer of Wu Guo.

630
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
You treated her the same way.

631
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
You really care about her life.

632
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
In my opinion,

633
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
we are all the same.

634
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
You are the one who

635
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
protects me.

636
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
And now,

637
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
I just want to be myself

638
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
and be the king of Chen.

639
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Let my wife look up to me

640
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
and not look down on me.

641
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
I don't want you

642
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,040
to die under the sword of Wu Jun.

643
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Because the Grand Tutor said

644
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
that life is short

645
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
and the grass is long.

646
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Life is short,

647
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
but it can't be wasted.

648
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,040
They can kill me.

649
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,040
But if you,

650
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
you,

651
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
your wife,

652
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
Grand Tutor Wang,

653
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
and the Grand Tutor

654
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
die,

655
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
I will not allow it.

656
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
I will not allow it.

657
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,040
I will not allow it.

658
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
I will not allow it.

659
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
I will not allow it.

660
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
I will not allow it.

661
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
I will not allow it.

662
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
I will not allow it.

663
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,040
I will not allow it.

664
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
I will not allow it.

665
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
I will not allow it.

666
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,040
I will not allow it.

667
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
I will not allow it.

668
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
I will not allow it.

669
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,040
I will not allow it.

670
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
I will not allow it.

671
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
I will not allow it.

672
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
I will not allow it.

673
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,040
I will not allow it.

674
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
I will not allow it.

675
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
I will not allow it.

676
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
I will not allow it.

677
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
I will not allow it.

678
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
I will not allow it.

679
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
I will not allow it.

680
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
I will not allow it.

681
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
I will not allow it.

682
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
I will not allow it.

683
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
I will not allow it.

684
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
I will not allow it.

685
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
I will not allow it.

686
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
I will not allow it.

687
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
I will not allow it.

688
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
I will not allow it.

689
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
I will not allow it.

690
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
I will not allow it.

691
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
I will not allow it.

692
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
I will not allow it.

693
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
I will not allow it.

694
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
I will not allow it.

695
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
I will not allow it.

696
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040

I will not allow it.

701
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
I will not allow it.

702
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
I will not allow it.

703

I will not allow it.

711
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
I will not allow it.

712
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,040
I will not allow it.

713
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,040
