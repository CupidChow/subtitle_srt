(Game Over)

2
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,239
This time I misjudged.

3
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,640
They are very simple.

4
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,040
They're living a carefree life.

5
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,640
Cheers!

6
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,000
Cheers!

7
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,239
I think

8
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,439
this is like a dream.

9
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
It's a little too good to be true.

10
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,039
Actually, I want to say...

11
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:11,960
Long Qi.

12
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,759
Your Majesty.

13
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,639
I'm listening.

14
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,000
I have an idea.

15
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,560
Well,

16
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,800
we keep quiet

17
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,240
for a while.

18
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,159
Let's soak in the moonlight.

19
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,639
Soak in the moonlight?

20
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:29,240
His Majesty is asking you to shut up.

21
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,319
You're so fierce.

22
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,439
Actually, I want to say

23
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,800
that before today,

24
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,840
I was always on edge

25
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,159
when protecting Your Majesty.

26
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,280
I have to be on guard.

27
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,280
But here,

28
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,840
I'm not afraid they will harm us,

29
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,840
nor am I afraid of assassins.

30
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,039
Nobody here will poison us.

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,479
Is it

32
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,280
because today's wedding was lively?

33
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,680
Actually, I want to say

34
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,639
I attended a wedding for the first time.

35
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,439
I realize getting married

36
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,960
is such a wonderful thing.

37
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,960
I never imagined

38
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,199
my own wedding.

39
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,159
Me neither.

40
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,639
I also attended a wedding
for the first time.

41
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,840
I used to wonder

42
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,240
who exactly I am.

43
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,319
Am I a person
from the state of Wu or Chen?

44
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,439
But today, I think

45
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,280
if only I were a person
from this village.

46
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,039
(It's all my fault.)

47
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,960
I shouldn't have been so greedy.

48
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,039
After all the scheming

49
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,759
and plotting, it turns out

50
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,599
we could have been together long ago.

51
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,079
What does it matter how others see us?

52
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,920
Why bother?

53
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,600
If there is a next life,

54
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,639
we won't go through this.

55
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,759
We will find a nice little place

56
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,319
and live a peaceful life.

57
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,399
I'm thinking

58
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,199
if only I were not

59
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,759
King Chen.

60
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,360
Honey.

61
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,360
We're not leaving.

62
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,079
Is that okay?

63
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,000
What's going on?

64
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,600
The system went wrong again?

65
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,639
It didn't.

66
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,360
I have an urgent matter
to discuss with you.

67
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,839
What happened?

68
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,639
How did it happen?

69
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,040
You should have expected this result
on the first day.

70
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,079
Look at the number.

71
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,720
It's just like your phone battery.

72
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,879
It's about to shut down.

73
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,519
But he just killed Wu Liang.

74
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,480
He's made great progress for once.

75
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,279
I thought he was about to succeed.

76
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,480
Why is there...?

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,480
Why is there a sudden drop?

78
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,199
The data does not lie.

79
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,480
Has he deviated from the main mission?

80
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,319
So if he

81
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,079
completely defeats Wu State,

82
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,600
he might survive?

83
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,240
In my opinion,

84
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,800
why not let him live in the game world?

85
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,639
Digital immortality.

86
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,199
This is for the best for him.

87
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:29,680
No.

88
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,959
As long as there is a chance,

89
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,160
I will not give up.

90
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,199
Honey.

91
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,879
Honey.

92
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:28,680
Where are they?

93
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,240
Strange.

94
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,320
Where are they?

95
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,440
Honey.

96
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,360
I've been looking for you.

97
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,320
Where did you go?

98
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,480
Honey.

99
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,559
Don't you find it strange?

100
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,559
The people in this village
have all gone.

101
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,679
I did it.

102
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,240
What do you mean by that?

103
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,639
I told you before.

104
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,559
Everything here is fictional.

105
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,279
This world does not exist.

106
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,759
Honey.

107
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,519
I don't understand what you're saying.

108
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,759
Even if it is true,

109
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,039
and there is indeed another world,

110
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,919
I still choose to stay here.

111
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,720
Whether you understand or not,

112
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,159
you must pull yourself together now.

113
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,240
Time is running out.

114
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,519
Defeating Wu State is your only way out.

115
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,720
Wu Liang is dead.

116
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,279
There is bound to be a new King Wu.

117
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,679
For your people,

118
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,200
for your own life,

119
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,000
you must return to the capital city

120
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,360
and be a king.

121
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,080
Fight Wu State,

122
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,399
and fulfill your mission.

123
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,879
Didn't we agree not to leave?

124
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,639
I can't save Chen State.

125
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,519
I want to stay.

126
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,759
You cannot stay here.

127
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,039
Do it for me.

128
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,159
I'm begging you.

129
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,480
Otherwise,
you'll never be able to get out.

130
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,240
I can't get it.

131
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,039
Honey.

132
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,559
Why do you want me to leave here?

133
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,559
Why do you have to force me

134
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,799
to do what I can't do?

135
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,080
Alright.

136
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,000
I admit

137
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,840
I can't be a good king

138
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,559
or save Chen.

139
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,480
I'm just a Rookie.

140
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:44,840
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,720
I can't do what you said.

142
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,840
Chen Xiaohua.

143
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,440
Tao.

144
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,679
Tao.

145
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,759
Who allowed you to break my game rules?

146
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,120
You are a member of Lannao Company.

147
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,039
You should be very clear

148
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
about the original intention
of this project.

149
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,039
Dr. K designed the entire virtual world.

150
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,600
Wu Jing?

151
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,879
The Earth is already overwhelmed.

152
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,000
Just let those useless people

153
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,840
on earth...

154
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,120
Those useless people on earth

155
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,840
stay here with the lowest consumption

156
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,639
and happily spend their lives.

157
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,639
Isn't it good?

158
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,799
Your boyfriend Chen Xiaohua

159
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,039
likes this place.

160
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,840
This place suits him so well.

161
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,200
Just let him waste his life here.

162
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,600
Oh sorry,

163
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,080
enjoy his life. Isn't it good?

164
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,519
Why do you repeatedly
interfere with his choices?

165
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,240
I'm just doing what I think is right.

166
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,679
It is very rude

167
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,919
to interrupt.

168
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,440
I've seen your boyfriend's files.

169
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,639
He is not

170
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,480
an adventurous person.

171
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,600
He cannot

172
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,720
complete the ultimate task
as you and Dr. K anticipated.

173
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,879
Give him a little more time,

174
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:56,919
and he will finish it.

175
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,559
There are so many people on this planet,

176
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,320
but most of them

177
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,200
are just wasting resources.

178
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,360
They have no hope

179
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,480
or future.

180
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,720
Just let them live happily here.

181
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,639
Isn't it good?

182
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,279
To put it plainly,

183
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,320
Chen Xiaohua

184
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,600
is just one of those useless humans.

185
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,279
You just let him live happily here.

186
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,360
Isn't it good?

187
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
So, it seems I have no choice.

188
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,559
You indeed have no choice.

189
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,320
Who gave you the right

190
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,960
to make this place gone?

191
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,720
You indeed have no choice.

192
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,919
Who gave you the right

193
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,120
to make this place gone?

194
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,159
You indeed have no choice.

195
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,039
Who gave you the right

196
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,759
to make this place gone?

197
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,240
Just let Chen Xiaohua live happily here.

198
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,279
Isn't it good?

199
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,960
Just let that loser live happily here.

200
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,559
Isn't it good?

201
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,559
Just let that rookie live happily here.

202
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,399
Isn't it good?

203
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,039
Why do you keep interfering
with his choices?

204
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,159
Just let him stay here.

205
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:46,799
Let that loser

206
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,960
live happily here.

207
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,639
Isn't it good?

208
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,440
Let that rookie

209
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,639
live happily here.

210
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,120
Why not?

211
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,399
- You have no choice.
- Why not?

212
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,639
Let him live happily.

213
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,960
Isn't it good?

214
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,320
You have no choice.

215
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,240
Isn't it good?

216
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,159
Dr. K.

217
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,120
Why am I out again?

218
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,159
Send me back.

219
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,279
Hello, Jiang Tao.

220
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,360
I knew that this village was strange.

221
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,559
Now it seems I guessed right.

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,639
Weird.

223
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,320
Why is there no one else here?

224
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,440
Lady Xiao.

225
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,200
Your Grace.

226
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,480
Your Grace.

227
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
She has no injuries.

228
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Go find His Majesty.

229
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,600
Your Grace.

230
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,039
So,

231
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,080
are you okay?

232
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,559
(Wu Jing, CEO of Lannao Company)
You look very weak.

233
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,559
How is it?

234
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,279
Is it very tiring

235
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,519
in the game world?

236
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,559
Your boyfriend, Chen Xiaohua.

237
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,200
How should I describe him, Dr. K?

238
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,200
One...

239
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,240
Never mind.

240
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,080
To put it bluntly,

241
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,799
he is nearing brain death.

242
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,639
I know.

243
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:55,000
His brain peak reached 73 percent.

244
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,679
But look now,

245
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,720
it's 16 percent,

246
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,480
and it will continue to decline.

247
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,440
So,

248
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,399
accept it.

249
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,159
I know your plan with Dr. K.

250
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,519
I think it's very good.

251
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,159
I'm serious.

252
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,000
The idea is good.

253
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,840
However,

254
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,440
he...

255
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,600
He has

256
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,279
no chance of coming back.

257
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,200
As long as there is
a one percent chance,

258
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,200
I will continue to work hard.

259
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,639
People want to change their destiny

260
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,679
through their own efforts.

261
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,039
That is actually a terrifying idea.

262
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,720
In this world,

263
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,320
an ordinary person,

264
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,279
sometimes, no matter how hard they try,

265
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,360
can't change

266
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,519
established facts,

267
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,159
including your boyfriend's death.

268
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,120
Dr. K, do you understand what I mean?

269
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,840
Maybe you're right,

270
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,840
but can you give him another chance?

271
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,519
I'm begging you.

272
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,240
When I adopted it,

273
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,440
it was not four months old.

274
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,600
Now, in a few days,
it will be fifteen years old.

275
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,519
It has severe arthritis,

276
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:00,240
heart disease, and kidney failure.

277
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,679
To save it,

278
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,400
I've performed a dozen surgeries on it.

279
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,720
Why should I save it?

280
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,200
People come

281
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,319
and go.

282
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,039
That's the rule.

283
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,240
Perhaps from its perspective,

284
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,119
every additional minute of life

285
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,720
is a kind of torment.

286
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,640
So why let it suffer

287
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
in this world?

288
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,519
You are a good employee,

289
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,640
serious and responsible,

290
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,240
diligent and positive.

291
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,640
I forgive you for what you secretly did,

292
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,759
but that's all.

293
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:14,920
You have three days off.

294
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,920
Come to my office in three days.

295
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,440
You can't define a person's life
like this.

296
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,480
You can't pronounce his death.

297
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,680
Dr. K,

298
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,119
thank you.

299
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,599
Thank you

300
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,240
for creating such a perfect world.

301
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,599
Thank you
for letting everyone have a chance

302
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,039
to live in their own paradise

303
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,839
and obtain their own happiness there.

304
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,319
Of course,

305
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,599
we also need to thank the first player.

306
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,720
Turn off the infinite rebirth mode.

307
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,640
After Chen Xiaohua passed away,

308
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,960
retain all the data
from this experiment.

309
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,839
When the system restarts again,

310
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,200
Dr. K,

311
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,119
your work will shine
in front of all humanity.

312
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,480
Three days.

313
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,799
See you in my office three days later.

314
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:33,519
Dr. K.

315
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,119
What's wrong?

316
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,799
How did it go?

317
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:54,880
Your Majesty,

318
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,960
Lady Xiao has a problem with her brain.

319
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,079
The brain is the key part of the body.

320
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,920
It is also where the primal spirit is.

321
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:03,640
Talk sense.

322
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,200
Yes.

323
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,000
Did Lady Xiao ever

324
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:08,079
suffer a serious injury to the brain?

325
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,680
I can give a medicine to calm the mind.

326
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,720
I think...

327
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,880
I think that the massage
and acupuncture can be tried.

328
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,079
Seconded.

329
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,559
Seconded.

330
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,279
How is it going?

331
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,920
Your Majesty, don't worry.

332
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,039
I've cured many cases like this before.

333
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,279
I bet my prescription

334
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,720
will cure her illness.

335
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,720
This is Mr. Ma, a top physician.

336
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,480
Your Majesty,

337
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,759
can I have a word with you in private?

338
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,839
Your Majesty,

339
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,960
the Grand Marshal has died.

340
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,519
So,

341
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,119
could we hold a funeral

342
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,720
and build a cenotaph for him?

343
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,039
I know I overstepped.

344
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,039
Lady Xiao has been ill.

345
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,319
I shouldn't have proposed a funeral

346
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,160
for the Grand Marshal now.

347
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:14,559
Just do it.

348
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,279
He served in the army all his life

349
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,960
and devoted himself

350
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,079
to Chen State.

351
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,799
How can we let him leave quietly?

352
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,160
I'll trouble you with this.

353
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,680
You manage it.

354
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:39,720
Your Majesty.

355
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,799
All good physicians have examined her.

356
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,920
They're all confident in their skills.

357
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,799
However, Lady Xiao...

358
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,279
I can give a medicine to calm the mind.

359
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,200
I think...

360
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,079
I think that the massage
and acupuncture can be tried.

361
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,279
Seconded.

362
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,960
Seconded.

363
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,119
Long Qi.

364
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,400
Do you remember that day,

365
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,839
among those physicians,

366
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,920
there was someone

367
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,279
who hesitated to speak?

368
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,920
He wanted to say something but didn't.

369
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,599
I remember.

370
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,519
Get him here.

371
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,319
Yes.
