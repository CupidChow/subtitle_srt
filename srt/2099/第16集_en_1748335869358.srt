1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
Here's what we do when we get to where we stop.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,260
Enjoy the rest of the video!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,060
I'll eat on this day.

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,700
Wait.

5
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,460
Stay.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,960
Let's eat.

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,660
The food is very delicious.

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,720
Yes.

9
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,720
It's delicious.

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
It's a fake one.

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,320
I'll eat this cake

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,120
with this one.

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,520
It's my favorite.

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,120
When they bully you,

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
you tell me.

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,120
I tell you.

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,120
You beat them.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
They're better than you.

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,920
They beat you so hard.

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,920
Anyway, I will protect you.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,720
You protect me.

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
When I grow up,

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,520
I will buy you many small cakes.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,120
But I don't like small cakes.

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,720
What do you like to eat?

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,120
I like to eat small tomatoes.

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
But the hospital director and the teacher said

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,520
that the fruit is expensive.

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,120
We can't buy it in our hotel.

30
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,320
I'll make money.

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,920
I'll buy you more.

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,120
Xiaotang.

33
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,920
Have you ever eaten cake?

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,920
It's not that everyone

35
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,920
can eat cake once.

36
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
The director only made us a bowl of noodles.

37
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,920
He only brought a bag of eggs.

38
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,120
What day is your birthday?

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,320
I'm not sure.

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,120
It's summer.

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,120
The director's mother said

42
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,920
that it was the time of the peach tree.

43
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,120
So she asked me to pick the peach.

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,120
I'll pick the peach.

45
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
I'll pick the peach.

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
I'll pick the peach.

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
I'll pick the peach.

48
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
I'll pick the peach.

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
I'll pick the peach.

50
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
I'll pick the peach.

51
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
I'll pick the peach.

52
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
I'll pick the peach.

53
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
I'll pick the peach.

54
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
I'll pick the peach.

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
I'll pick the peach.

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
I'll pick the peach.

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
I'll pick the peach.

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
I'll pick the peach.

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
I'll pick the peach.

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
I'll pick the peach.

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
I'll pick the peach.

62
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
I'll pick the peach.

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
I'll pick the peach.

64
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
I'll pick the peach.

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
I'll pick the peach.

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
I'll pick the peach.

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
I'll pick the peach.

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
I'll pick the peach.

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
I'll pick the peach.

70
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
I'll pick the peach.

71
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
I'll pick the peach.

72
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
I'll pick the peach.

73
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
I'll pick the peach.

74
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,820
This doctor has many symptoms.

75
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,660
But the body was vilified.

76
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,020
He didn't perform surgery on others.

77
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,420
That means he's still a former doctor.

78
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,120
Sir, I've seen that he was a young ghost.

79
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:38,820
If that was all,

80
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,320
then has your father gone to me and saved his life again?

81
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,220
No.

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,040
What other Wanted Medicine

83
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,620
can we use to meet?

84
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,620
Stop her jealousy.

85
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,620
She said she was crying and Tudo is no use.

86
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,620
What's worse,

87
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,620
I... I really like it.

88
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,620
I like the Jianghu Pianzi.

89
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,620
Xifeng. Xifeng. Xifeng.

90
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,620
Xifeng. She's awake. She's awake.

91
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,620
Xifeng.

92
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,620
Xifeng. Xifeng.

93
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,620
Xifeng. Xifeng.

94
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,620
Xifeng.

95
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,620
I...

96
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,620
I can confirm that Mrs. Xiao is not ill.

97
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,620
It's because the soul is not in the Qichun.

98
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,620
I have tried to summon her.

99
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,620
But I can't find the right person.

100
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,620
It's like she's not in the world.

101
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,620
I'm a witch. I have no reason to go back.

102
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,620
But there's no other way.

103
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,620
Wang. Don't give her any more needles.

104
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,620
Take the medicine for her.

105
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,620
It's useless.

106
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,620
Wang.

107
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,620
Listen to her.

108
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,620
Take the medicine.

109
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,620
You haven't had a rest for a long time.

110
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,620
Go back and rest.

111
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,620
We're fine.

112
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,620
Let's stay here.

113
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,620
Go back.

114
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,620
You can rest.

115
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,620
Then you can take my place.

116
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,620
Chenyin.

117
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,620
Chenyin.

118
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,620
Chenyin.

119
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,620
What the hell is this?

120
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,620
Mom, you're so cute.

121
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,620
It's a tomato egg.

122
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,620
Where did you get it?

123
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,620
I bought some ingredients before I got it.

124
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,620
Wait.

125
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,620
When it's your birthday,

126
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,620
you don't only eat cake,

127
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
but also blow candles to wish me good luck.

128
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,620
Master.

129
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,620
Your medicine is ready.

130
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,620
Please take your medicine.

131
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,620
Today is our anniversary.

132
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,620
That's right.

133
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,620
So I chose this place.

134
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,620
But to be precise,

135
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,620
it's not a anniversary.

136
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,620
If we add the 15th anniversary

137
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,620
of Kongbai together,

138
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,620
it's a 16th anniversary.

139
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,620
Happy 16th anniversary.

140
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
Cai Ji.

141
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,620
Happy 16th anniversary.

142
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
I'll bring you a gift.

143
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,620
Happy 16th anniversary.

144
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,620
Happy 16th anniversary.

145
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,620
I heard that you and Tai Fei

146
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,620
died for the sake of His Majesty.

147
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,620
No.

148
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,620
His Majesty never mentioned this thing

149
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,620
after he came back.

150
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,620
Yes.

151
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,620
Didn't His Majesty

152
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,620
tell you to send Zhang Jia?

153
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,620
If you can't bear to see this,

154
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,620
Zhang Jia is a loyal man.

155
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,620
He's a great man.

156
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,620
He's a great man.

157
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,620
He's a great man.

158
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,620
Where did he come from?

159
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,620
How could he send you to him?

160
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,620
If he really died,

161
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,620
why didn't His Majesty show up?

162
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,620
Before His Majesty died,

163
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,620
please take a good look.

164
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,620
His Majesty is busy with work.

165
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,620
Why didn't he show up?

166
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,620
His Majesty is here.

167
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,620
Your Majesty.

168
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
Your Majesty.

169
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,620
You're a soldier.

170
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,620
After all,

171
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,620
I can't bear to see you die.

172
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,620
Yes.

173
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,620
This is

174
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,620
for your uncle.

175
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,620
General Dacheng.

176
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,620
Dacheng.

177
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,620
I'm here to save you.

178
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,620
Please give me my word.

179
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,620
I am Dacheng.

180
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,620
General Dacheng.

181
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,620
General Dacheng.

182
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,620
General Dacheng.

183
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,620
General Dacheng.

184
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,620
General Dacheng.

185
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,540
Lately

186
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,340

187

193
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,980
good

194
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,460
what

195
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,300
my

196
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,120
tiddol

197
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Yes, sir.

198
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,320
The new king, Wude,

199
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,920
is on the throne.

200
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,520
He said he would settle the case.

201
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
The first king, Wei Xibao, is avenged.

202
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,920
Where is the king now?

203
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Kangzhou.

204
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,920
When the throne is in danger,

205
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,320
the crown prince will be summoned.

206
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,120
Please return the favor.

207
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,920
Please return the favor.

208
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Yes, crown prince.

209
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,920
The king is on the throne.

210
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,920
The crown prince is sick.

211
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,320
Please use the crown prince as a guard.

212
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,720
I will now appoint the crown prince as the crown prince.

213
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,920
I will go and persuade him.

214
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Pass the order.

215
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
Chen Zhoujun,

216
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,120
go to Kangzhou.

217
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Yes, sir.

218
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,520
I will go and persuade the king.

219
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,320
Please make sure the king is safe.

220
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
I know

221
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,920
what you are thinking.

222
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,520
The king is on the throne.

223
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,920
The behavior is a bit strange.

224
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
But in the future,

225
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,120
Chu Tanfu will kill King Wu.

226
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,920
It's not a big deal.

227
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,120
The king and Lady Xiao are against the power.

228
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,520
Please give the king some more time.

229
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Get out of the way.

230
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,920
Thank you.

231
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,120
Thank you, mom.

232
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,120
I haven't been able to hold on to you for so long.

233
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,120
No, the queen is now sleeping.

234
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,320
Please take a rest.

235
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
We will take care of her.

236
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,520
I'm fine.

237
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,920
I just hope that she can see me

238
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,520
when she is awake.

239
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,720
Don't worry.

240
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,520
I am here.

241
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,720
She woke up and informed you.

242
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Yes, queen.

243
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,720
You don't want the queen to lie on the bed

244
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,720
when she wakes up, right?

245
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,120
I'm just a rechtless girl,

246
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,920
who never photokus onPAAC.

247
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,520
Don't forget to go and live with me,

248
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
if you have all the ideals

249
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,120
you willlet's live my life together.

250
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
I know it.

251
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,920
Greetings.

252
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,120
You're welcome.

253
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,720
I'm frog monger.

254
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
That sounds nice.

255
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,420
Thank you.

256
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,320
Don't you know that

257
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
it's locked

258
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,620
Oh.

259
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,620
Oh.

260
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,320
Of whatเล o t h o

261
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:08,840
I must always remember

262
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,600
Everything is Dios

263
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,960
You wouldn't know

264
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,720
I already took the dis mà

265
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,440
Your Majesty.

266
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,520
Don't fight.

267
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Go back and rest.

268
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,040
But, Your Majesty.

269
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,200
There's nothing to be afraid of.

270
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
You should sleep well.

271
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,040
Then you can come to me.

272
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,400
Your Majesty, you can rest.

273
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,080
Alright.

274
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,800
Why are you so serious?

275
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,720
Report.

276
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,320
Your Majesty,

277
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,440
the crown prince asks for an audience.

278
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,360
Send him in.

279
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,080
Yes.

280
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,880
Your Majesty.

281
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,520
It's a very dangerous situation

282
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,400
to be in the middle of the night.

283
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,840
The new army has come to report.

284
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,480
They have no choice but to fight.

285
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,640
The Khenzhou army is in the Khenzhou army.

286
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,520
The whole army is in the Khenzhou army.

287
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,320
Now, the enemy is under attack.

288
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,800
They are afraid that Your Majesty will return to the court.

289
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,960
They will re-establish the Qi Valley.

290
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,160
They will be in a state of shock.

291
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,040
I didn't expect that after killing the King of Wuhu,

292
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,280
this time,

293
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,000
you came so fast.

294
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,680
There's one more thing.

295
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,360
I thought

296
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,600
it was a bad opportunity.

297
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,400
I know.

298
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,080
The crown prince wants to talk about the son of Yanxu.

299
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,640
Your Majesty,

300
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,840
Liu De is still alive.

301
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,320
He is not afraid of the fire.

302
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,760
The Khenzhou army will be in the Khenzhou army soon.

303
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
But the time will come.

304
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,520
The enemy will come and revenge.

305
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,160
I'm worried about that.

306
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
You're worried that

307
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,160
the King of Wuhu has cut me off.

308
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,760
So, he will be killed.

309
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,080
Please think twice.

310
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,840
I'm worried about the illness of the princess.

311
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,200
But Your Majesty,

312
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,040
you are a great man.

313
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,880
I will decide the son of Yanxu.

314
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,240
I will attend the court meeting tomorrow.

315
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Don't worry.

316
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,920
Leave me alone.

317
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,440
Your Majesty.

318
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,920
Leave me alone.

319
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,000
Your Majesty,

320
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,800
I have nothing else to say to my son.

321
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,480
I just want to stay here

322
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,000
with Linghe and Xiao'er.

323
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,520
Your Majesty,

324
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,160
let's stay here.

325
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,360
We won't disturb you.

326
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,360
If Your Majesty doesn't want to talk,

327
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,160
I won't talk to my sister.

328
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,920
If Your Majesty is fighting against me in private,

329
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,160
I will grow up with my sister.

330
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,320
We can help each other

331
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,040
in the battle of the army.

332
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,160
We can help each other

333
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,760
in the battle of the army.

334
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,480
Linghe,

335
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,280
come in.

336
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,480
Your Majesty,

337
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,640
the name of the King has changed.

338
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,080
It's just掰掰.

339
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,360
Your Majesty,

340
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,200
not having a enemies is more than good.

341
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,860
Now the Koreans are fighting

342
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,600
in haste so that Your Majesty can get back the victory.

343
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Come on

344
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,140
Wheeee

345
00:20:43,140 --> 00:21:05,800
aters

346
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Please confirm whether the key is the unlimited reset mode.

347
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
The unlimited reset mode is closed.

348
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,800
After the player dies, the system will automatically stop.

349
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
The player dies, the player dies.

350
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,800
The player dies, the player dies.

351
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Xiefeng, if you say that this is the only way to save you,

352
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I will try it.

353
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Wang!

354
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Wang!

355
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Wang!

356
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
What's going on?

357
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Wang, why did you cut your sword?

358
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
I know you never brought me and my sister.

359
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,800
You just don't listen to what the Grand Preceptor said.

360
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Your Majesty, I can't share your worries with you,

361
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
but I won't make trouble for you.

362
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:47,800
If you trust us, I will help you take care of Xiao'er.

363
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Your Majesty, you have to live.

364
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
I will definitely find her.

365
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
I will.

366
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Where is my wife? I haven't seen her for a long time.

367
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Are you looking for Mrs. Zhen or Mrs. Bao?

368
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Where is Mrs. Xiao?

369
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Who is Mrs. Xiao?

370
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
I don't know who Your Majesty is asking.

371
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Who is Mrs. Xiao?

372
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
You don't know who Mrs. Xiao is?

373
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Your Majesty, I have been in the palace for years.

374
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,800
I have been in the palace for at least three years.

375
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
I can't die.

376
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
If I die, my wife will come back alive.

377
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
If I kill myself,

378
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,800
I will have another life.

379
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
I won't die.

380
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Your Majesty, I know that you are so stubborn.

381
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,800
You are responsible for your life.

382
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Your Majesty, what is the reason why you have been here?

383
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,800
You know that now that you are here,

384
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,800
you want to let her die to get rid of you.

385
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,800
It's easy to die, but she wants to see it.

386
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I can't die.

387
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
I really want to die.

388
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
No.

389
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Why are you looking at me like that?

390
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
It's my fault.

391
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Luo Xin, prepare the clothes for me.

392
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
You two, prepare the clothes for me.

393
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
I am hungry.

394
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Go.

395
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Luo Xin, stay here.

396
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Other people, go back and rest.

397
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Xiao Yi, you arrange for the wheel to be taken care of.

398
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Go to the court tomorrow.

399
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Yes.

400
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,800
beds

401
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Your Highness.

402
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Take the whole body with me.

403
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Take yourself.

404
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
You're early.

405
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
I haven't made the right bag yet.

406
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
But it'll be ready soon.

407
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
You can wait a while.

408
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,800
I think you're almost ready for the first set of bags.

409
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
At least you've been busy for an hour.

410
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Life is just like this.

411
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Someone always makes the best of your life.

412
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
And you're faster than me.

413
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,800
I'm not doing this for a good day.

414
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
I can't do it without a life.

415
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
If you work hard,

416
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
you'll have no results.

417
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
The result is bad.

418
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
But the key is to work hard.

419
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
You'll regret it.

420
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Right?

421
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
The bag is ready. I'll go get it.

422
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Your bag.

423
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Wait a minute.

424
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Boss, two bags of bags.

425
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
How much is a bowl of this?

426
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Here it is.

427
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Okay, sit down.

428
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
I've been back from the hospital.

429
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,800
And I've found that our city is getting better.

430
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,800
I can't say that every household has a single step.

431
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
At least the road is not lost.

432
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
There are ways to get there.

433
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
That means it's all true.

434
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
So our new king

435
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
is not as useless as the one in the media.

436
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
No way.

437
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
I heard that the female warrior

438
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
is being treated by our king.

439
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Xia Fan has made a consort for our king.

440
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
The female warrior.

441
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Really?

442
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Yes.

443
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,800
We have the new democracy and the warrior protection.

444
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
What kind of army is this?

445
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
As long as we dare to come,

446
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
we'll give it all to the army.

447
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
As long as we have the king,

448
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
we're not afraid of anything.

449
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
No matter how much they come,

450
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
we'll give them all back.

451
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Isn't that right?

452
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Our people

453
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
can just live a peaceful life

454
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
and eat them up.

455
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
I heard that the rice price

456
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
has dropped by two percent yesterday.

457
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
It's said that it's the price of

458
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
the rice price that we new kings use to make tea.

459
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
You see,

460
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
if we have such a good new king,

461
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
wouldn't our people's life be better?

462
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
That's right.

463
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
It's so cold.

464
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Here.

465
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
There are so many.

466
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
Your majesty,

467
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
the Wu State has crossed the border.

468
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
After the Khenzhou-Lun County,

469
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
the Wu army is in Khenzhou to kill and rob.

470
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
They are in the capital.

471
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
The Wu State is attacking the Chen State.

472
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Chu and Yue are in the same country.

473
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
They are in the same country.

474
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
This time,

475
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
where should I go?

476
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,800
The result of the exchange of the evidence

477
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:51,800
is the repeat of the happy moment.

478
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,800
Your smile hasn't appeared recently.

479
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,800
The beautiful scene,

480
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,800
how much hope you are in.

481
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,800
The way I exist,

482
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,800
the story I lost,

483
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:19,800
is not a lie to you.

484
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:26,800
I wish to say this every day.

485
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:33,800
I dream of how much we will be happy tomorrow.

486
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:40,800
I'm used to the years you've been with me.

487
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,800
I can't stop.

488
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:53,800
I wish to be with you forever.

489
00:30:53,800 --> 00:31:00,800
I want to be with you till the end.

490
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Even if I'm in love again,

491
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,800
I have a thousand choices.

492
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,800
I still need you.

493
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm always waiting for you.
