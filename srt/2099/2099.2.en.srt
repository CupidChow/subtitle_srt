1
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,000
Are you sure you want to let him out?

2
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,079
Immortal.

3
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,079
Monster.

4
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,000
Rookie.

5
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,216
=Episode 2=
(Dear Robot Concubine)

6
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,560
A monster?

7
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,080
Immortal!

8
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,199
Immortal.

9
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,960
You've finally come.

10
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,479
I'll kowtow first.

11
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,039
One more?

12
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:44,919
No.

13
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,840
Burn incense?

14
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,680
No need for that either.

15
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,000
Immortal.

16
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,280
Haven't we met somewhere before?

17
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,280
Why do you look so familiar?

18
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,159
I am not...

19
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,800
Not Immortal.

20
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,479
You immortals also stutter?

21
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,159
No.

22
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,919
No stuttering.

23
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,520
No stuttering.

24
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,639
Immortal.

25
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,319
What should I call you?

26
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,759
My Beloved?

27
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,040
I'm too reckless.

28
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,959
If it's improper, forget it.

29
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,000
Zhang Xiao'er?

30
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,319
Or just Xiao?

31
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,639
2...

32
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,360
2099.

33
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,879
Love to drink?

34
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,160
I got it.

35
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,079
You immortals need aliases
when descending to earth.

36
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,399
A...

37
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,839
Alias.

38
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:56,800
Immortal?

39
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,199
Immortal!

40
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,920
Quite adorable.

41
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,360
Seems foolish.

42
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,120
Not...

43
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,639
Not foolish.

44
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,759
Probably she landed headfirst

45
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,040
when descending.

46
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,560
Can't you see my royal robe on you?

47
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,720
Take it off.

48
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,079
This is improper!

49
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,519
Who's in charge there?

50
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,040
Shut up.

51
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,480
Perhaps His Majesty enjoys this.

52
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,199
Crime of compulsory indecency
and insult against women.

53
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,120
Using violence, coercion, etc.,

54
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,959
to commit indecent acts or insult women

55
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,439
shall be sentenced to imprisonment
of not more than five years.

56
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,079
What are you talking about?

57
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,560
I am the king of Chen State.

58
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,800
The sovereign of Chen!

59
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,839
I am the law!

60
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,759
Besides,

61
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,319
you molested me first.

62
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,120
Give...

63
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,680
my robe back.

64
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,839
Stop.

65
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,160
Don't do that.

66
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,399
I'm not that kind of person.

67
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,480
This robe is yours now.

68
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,000
Keep wearing it.

69
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,639
Come here.

70
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,759
Walls have ears.

71
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,279
We need to speak low.

72
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,839
There are.

73
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,040
Two

74
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,920
outside the door.

75
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:16,920
One

76
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,160
on the roof.

77
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,759
Three

78
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,720
in the side hall.

79
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,920
Four

80
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,480
in the courtyard.

81
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Awesome!

82
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,120
This immortal truly has magical power.

83
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,839
Immortal,

84
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,920
when will you take me away?

85
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,720
Where to?

86
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,000
To the celestial court, of course.

87
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,199
Although I don't know

88
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,839
how long

89
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,480
your earthly trials last.

90
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,879
Nor if you have

91
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,519
special missions.

92
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,879
- Mission.
- But,

93
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,959
in those tales,

94
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,120
fairies always take

95
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,399
their husbands

96
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,160
back up there.

97
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:02,879
Mission.

98
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:05,920
It's fine.

99
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,759
If the celestial court's unsuitable,

100
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,800
just take me to...

101
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,279
Mission.

102
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,279
A utopia.

103
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,600
That's also good.

104
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,680
Somewhere...

105
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,120
Mission.

106
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,480
With immortality and freedom.

107
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,000
But let's be clear.

108
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,920
No hardships.

109
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,600
Mission.

110
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,920
If I must eat only peaches...

111
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,360
Mission.

112
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,040
I can't take it.

113
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,000
I need meat.

114
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,639
I can't remember my mission.

115
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,279
Mission.

116
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,120
Mission.

117
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,279
Mission.

118
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,440
Stop! Stop!

119
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,720
How did you hit yourself?

120
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,679
Just feasting and revelry.

121
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,080
I can't handle this.

122
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,799
If you really dislike it,

123
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,600
we can start with wifely duties.

124
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,440
Wifely duties are...

125
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,080
No!

126
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,639
Barehanded blade-catching?

127
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,840
No matter your magic,

128
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,639
whether you are human or demon,

129
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,240
if you harm my king,

130
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,000
even if I have to risk my life,

131
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,720
I won't spare you!

132
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,919
How can she doze off standing?

133
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,399
Long Qi.

134
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
She smells of alcohol?

135
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:38,720
Did she drink?

136
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,159
Stay

137
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,559
sharp.

138
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,159
Look, her eyes are red.

139
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,080
She might be the Jade Rabbit demon.

140
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,559
Good analysis.

141
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,639
Don't analyze again next time.

142
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,759
You're creeping me out.

143
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,759
Zhang Xiao'er!

144
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,120
Get out here!

145
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,200
Who is it?

146
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,240
Sounds like Lady Bao.

147
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,919
Come out, Zhang Xiao'er!

148
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,879
Who gave you two the guts

149
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,559
to barge into my bedchamber?

150
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,120
Zhang Xiao'er, that wench,

151
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,440
dares steal my husband!

152
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,240
Your Majesty, this doesn't concern you.

153
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,639
It's our family business.

154
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,639
Let her come out.

155
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,799
Today I'll show her my power!

156
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,200
Well,

157
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,320
you

158
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,240
are all sisters.

159
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,240
Why hurt each other?

160
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
Who's sisters with this lowborn wench?

161
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,799
Bao'er, shut up.

162
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,799
Won't make her come out?

163
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,159
You protecting her?

164
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,639
Fine, I'll enter.

165
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,399
This...

166
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,639
She is asleep.

167
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,840
Can't be wakened even with slaps.

168
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,279
You'd better return.

169
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,279
We'll talk tomorrow.

170
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,200
Your Majesty.

171
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,639
You already favor her so much?

172
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,399
The more you do,

173
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,840
the more I want to end her today!

174
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,559
Move!

175
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,759
Go away!

176
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,559
Zhang Xiao'er.

177
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,759
You know martial arts?

178
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,440
Zhang Xiao'er.

179
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,200
Bedding with weapons.
What's your scheme?

180
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,360
Zhen'er, take this wench to the Dowager!

181
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
Impressive!

182
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,679
Wait, Long Qi.

183
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,240
Whose skills are better?

184
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,279
Who's winning?

185
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,320
Lady Xiao.

186
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,879
It seems

187
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,120
she's going easy on Lady Bao.

188
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,080
Going easy

189
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,960
on you.

190
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Nonsense! I'm going easy on you.

191
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,720
You gang up on her.

192
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,879
That's dishonorable!

193
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,399
We sisters live and die together.

194
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,159
No matter

195
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,480
how many the enemies are!

196
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,120
Error.

197
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:15,919
Alert.

198
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,919
Error.

199
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,360
Error 32. Self-check failed.

200
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,600
We're doomed.

201
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,519
This happened before.

202
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
This is...

203
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,360
That spell.

204
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,120
Zhang Xiao'er.

205
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,679
Cheating when you can't win?

206
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,279
Playing tricks with me?

207
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,159
Immortal!

208
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,240
Your Majesty!

209
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,240
(Rookie.)

210
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:50,720
(Come find me.)

211
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,480
Imm...

212
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:14,879
Immortal.

213
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,159
Ouch!

214
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,759
It really hurts!

215
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,000
- Bedchamber?
- Zhen'er, take this wench to the Dowager!

216
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,120
Here it comes.

217
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,000
Here it comes.

218
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,200
It's happening again.

219
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,159
It's happening again.

220
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,360
Stop!

221
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,320
This will kill her!

222
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,159
Monster.

223
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,519
Monster!

224
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:31,840
Run!

225
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,679
Monster!

226
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,559
There's a monster!

227
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,200
Monster!

228
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,240
Run!

229
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:38,799
Your Majesty!

230
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,159
Careful.

231
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,759
On second thought,

232
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,080
wasn't that scene

233
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,799
terrifying?

234
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,399
Don't worry.

235
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,080
I have my plans.

236
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,039
But I don't.

237
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,799
Your Majesty.

238
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,360
Please.

239
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,159
If the Dowager comes,

240
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:09,679
stop them.

241
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,480
Yes.

242
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,360
It's over.

243
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,279
We're done for!

244
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,039
Now everyone knows you're not human.

245
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,120
Immortal.

246
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,960
Stop shaking.

247
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,720
Well,

248
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,960
let's find a way to escape.

249
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,440
Immortal.

250
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,399
I'm afraid your mission

251
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,919
might fail.

252
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,080
Now you're in big trouble.

253
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,279
You don't know

254
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,440
how easily they could kill me,

255
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,519
let alone you.

256
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:53,960
I know

257
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,399
you are very powerful,

258
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,519
but

259
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,720
they outnumber us.

260
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,600
How about this.

261
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,399
Contact your superiors

262
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,320
and ask them to take us away!

263
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,679
Self-check activated.

264
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,480
Automatically repairing error codes.

265
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,639
Beep-beep-beep.

266
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
Repair completed.

267
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,159
Please input fingerprint

268
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,440
and restart the system.

269
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,159
What?

270
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,720
Energy reserve: thirty percent.

271
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,480
Entering power-saving mode.

272
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,240
Please recharge promptly.

273
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,400
I finally return to normal.

274
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,200
My mission.

275
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,799
Demon?

276
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,839
You mean

277
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,400
my niece is a fire-eyed demon

278
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,759
but I didn't know?

279
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,480
I dare not lie.

280
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,799
Not just I saw it,

281
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,119
but General Long Qi
ordered all in Linhua Palace

282
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,519
to keep it secret.

283
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,039
You did well.

284
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,079
Reward her.

285
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,519
Thank you, Your Majesty.

286
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,720
Keep a close watch on Chen Xiaohua.

287
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,359
Understood.

288
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,000
Get up, stop pretending.

289
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,559
Faking sleep?

290
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,119
Believe I will gouge out your eyes?

291
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,440
That's too cruel.

292
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:05,720
Immortal.

293
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,119
You aren't stuttering?

294
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,400
When did I stutter?

295
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,119
It was system malfunction.

296
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,240
Huh?

297
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,319
Never mind.

298
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,079
You just need to know

299
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,279
that from now on,

300
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,519
my mission is to make you a great ruler.

301
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:22,839
Wait, Immortal.

302
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,920
Immortal.

303
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,400
Now,

304
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,200
missions don't matter.

305
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,119
What matters is that very soon,

306
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,960
the whole palace will know
you're not human.

307
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,799
They'll summon exorcists.

308
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,000
Take my advice,

309
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,440
better a living coward.

310
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,759
The priority now is taking me

311
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:38,799
and Long Qi

312
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,240
to escape the palace tonight.

313
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:40,960
Go.

314
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:41,960
Come back.

315
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,720
Escape?

316
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,000
Now?

317
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:49,000
Real men stand tall!

318
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,119
You just want to run away.

319
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,519
Rookie.

320
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,079
Immortal.

321
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,000
Actually, I don't oppose this.

322
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,759
But isn't this timing

323
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,880
inappropriate?

324
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,920
How about this?

325
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,200
After we left,

326
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,240
we can find a place.

327
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,359
If you want to spend the night...

328
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,799
A real man should gather strength

329
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:15,799
and face it head-on.

330
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,480
Can I not

331
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,599
be a real man?

332
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,799
Height 180cm,

333
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,319
weight 130kg.

334
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,440
Muscle ratio...

335
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,640
Muscle ratio

336
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,119
is three percent

337
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,519
below average.

338
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Hair thinning,

339
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,839
expected to be bald by thirty.

340
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,440
Immortal.

341
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,279
You know my stats

342
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,000
while sitting on me?

343
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,799
Heart rate 127.

344
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,519
Hypertension, high cholesterol,
fatty liver,

345
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,480
severe deficiency of minerals
like calcium, magnesium, and potassium.

346
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:53,640
Hormonal imbalance,

347
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,680
metabolic disorder.

348
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,920
You really are weak.

349
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,039
Physique worse than I imagined.

350
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,440
Eat nourishing foods.

351
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,640
Such detailed analysis.

352
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,839
It seems I don't have much time left.

353
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,079
Since I'm about to die,

354
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,559
I don't need to rise from bed.

355
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,319
Get up.

356
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,240
I'm not getting up.

357
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,319
I said up!

358
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:22,960
Immortal.

359
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,759
Don't speak.

360
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,640
I'm feeling sleepy.

361
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,240
Let me sleep peacefully.

362
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,160
Well,

363
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,519
I'll have a nightmare

364
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,400
and die from it.

365
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:37,240
After I die, you can resurrect me.

366
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:37,960
By the way,

367
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,680
when you resurrect me,

368
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,200
make sure it's far from this palace.

369
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,680
Let's meet outside the palace.

370
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,799
Are you getting up?

371
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,720
Ouch!

372
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:53,559
A secret door?

373
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm doomed.

374
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,000
Wait, wait!

375
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,240
Stay back,

376
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,559
or I'll fight you!

377
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,039
You really know
how to stay vigilant in safety.

378
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,799
Obviously.

379
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:25,400
You think I'm stupid?

380
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,200
That look is too much.

381
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,960
Obviously.

382
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,440
The rice in that vat is moldy.

383
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,519
Throw it away. Full of bacteria.

384
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,519
No!

385
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
You don't understand.

386
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,119
I trade this for chicks.

387
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
Don't you know frugality?

388
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,559
Second watch.

389
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:54,960
Nine to eleven o'clock

390
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,799
is the best period for human sleep.

391
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,240
Studies show

392
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,680
good sleeps can boost human immunity,

393
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,039
extend lifespan,

394
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,279
and better hides android identities.

395
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
What are you saying?

396
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,920
Chen Xiaohua's memo.

397
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,519
What's it mean?

398
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,680
Why do I know this?

399
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:05,319
Your perceived world isn't real.

400
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:08,160
Your perceived people aren't real.

401
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,359
I can't understand.

402
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,559
Don't trust the Grand Marshal.

403
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,920
This part I understand.

404
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,480
Don't trust the Grand Marshal.

405
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,240
It indeed needs to be emphasized.

406
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,079
Don't trust the Grand Marshal.

407
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,160
I get it!

408
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,559
A treasure map?

409
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,720
A treasure map.

410
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,519
This must be a treasure map.

411
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:45,200
Left from my past life memories.

412
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:39,034
(Prince of Wu State)

413
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:50,960
Grand Marshal.

414
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,119
Long time no see.

415
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,759
Your Highness,

416
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,880
it has been ten years since we last met.

417
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,400
You've grown up now.

418
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,720
You really resemble your father.

419
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,039
Thank you.

420
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,440
Thank you for inviting us

421
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,359
here to visit.

422
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:13,200
But my father caught a cold,

423
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,640
so I came in his stead.

424
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,519
Please forgive us.

425
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,160
Rumors say

426
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,160
that King Wu,

427
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:25,759
is aged,

428
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,359
suffering from a severe illness,

429
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,960
bedridden for a long time.

430
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,720
Is this true?

431
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,400
Thank you for your concern.

432
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,079
My father remains robust.

433
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,640
How true are rumors?

434
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,640
That's good.

435
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,440
Grand Marshal.

436
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,400
At your invitation,

437
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,440
I came

438
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,720
for your new king's coronation.

439
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,359
Where is His Majesty?

440
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,799
Rumors say...

441
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
Rumors.

442
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:53,759
How true

443
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,880
are rumors?

444
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,440
Before I left, my father said...

445
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:03,359
Go ahead.

446
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,920
Half of Chen State
is under your control.

447
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:14,160
I was entrusted in times of crisis

448
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:16,359
as the regent

449
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,960
to temporarily govern the state.

450
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,119
Temporarily!

451
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,000
Your dedication

452
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,279
blesses Chen State.

453
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,240
Grand Marshal.

454
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,079
May the royal family of Chen State

455
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,599
all appreciate your service.

456
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,960
No need.

457
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,039
Grand Marshal.

458
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,960
Since the young king is busy,

459
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:49,839
I will

460
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,079
stay a few more days.

461
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,759
He can summon me

462
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,960
after he settles affairs.

463
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,079
Alright.

464
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,119
Stay longer.

465
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,759
You must have a tiring journey.

466
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Here, hang out

467
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,200
and enjoy some food.

468
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,920
That day I said I missed you,

469
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,640
you promised to come immediately.

470
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,640
I thought it was just a joke.

471
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
I didn't expect

472
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,079
you truly came.

473
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,119
Of course.

474
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,480
I always

475
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,160
keep my word.

476
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
You've slimmed.

477
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,079
How about you?

478
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,160
Are you alright?

479
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,160
Lian'er.

480
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:34,640
Lian'er.

481
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,119
How long can you stay

482
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,440
this time?

483
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:47,359
I will stay for

484
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,799
as long as you wish.

485
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,400
Prince Wu just feasts and tours,

486
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,400
seems quite interested in our dumplings.

487
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,680
I've been secretly observing him.

488
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,319
Nothing unusual.

489
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:11,240
What's his goal?

490
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,000
Why not return to Wu?

491
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,559
I wanted to see

492
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,680
how well King Wu is.

493
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,720
Never expected his son came.

494
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:22,680
You,

495
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,559
watch him closely.

496
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:26,920
He is not ordinary.

497
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,759
If he ascends,

498
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,119
he will be a worry for Chen State.

499
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,799
Dark night,

500
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,039
perfect for treasure digging.

501
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,200
Let me check again.

502
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,960
It should be around here.

503
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:00,759
There is indeed a treasure!

504
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,839
I'll be rich!

505
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
What is he doing?

506
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,119
I don't know.

507
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,119
Why dig here every night?

508
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,599
I really am a genius.

509
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,880
Dark night.

510
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,839
I knew you were no ordinary maid.

511
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,200
Let's leave.

512
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,599
Don't annoy His Majesty.

513
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,240
Okay.

514
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,640
On the map,

515
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,119
this is the largest star.

516
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,000
If I'm not mistaken,

517
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,839
it should be the greatest treasure.

518
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,920
Seeds?

519
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,640
What wonderful fruits

520
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,440
would grow?

521
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,720
Need to be cautious.

522
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,799
You scared me.

523
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:54,920
My dear.

524
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,200
It's so late.

525
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,519
Shouldn't you rest?

526
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,559
I did,

527
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,240
but I got woken up.

528
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,504
So I came to watch a show.

529
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,799
Watch a show?

530
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:03,960
Where's the show?

531
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,319
Rats digging.

532
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,640
Pigs fighting.

533
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,519
Digging?

534
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,359
I feel offended.

535
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,240
Who are you?

536
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,240
Who sent you?

537
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:20,400
Are you crazy?

538
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,119
Why hit me?

539
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,720
Who are you?

540
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,640
What do you want?

541
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,440
I'm the maid Xin Caiyi.

542
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,480
I'm protecting the king.

543
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,240
A maid?

544
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,599
How can a maid know martial arts?

545
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:41,480
What's this?

546
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,119
What's this?

547
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:42,880
Shut up!

548
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,039
I know

549
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,039
you tried to attack the King
with a rock.

550
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,240
If I want him dead,

551
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,759
why would I help you tonight?

552
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
If it weren't for me,

553
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,480
you'd be ten steps by the King.

554
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,319
What are you up to?

555
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,079
Cut the crap.

556
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,440
Your heart races.

557
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,000
Why?

558
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,000
I know.

559
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,880
Your cardiopulmonary function is poor.

560
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,800
Commonly called "deficiency".

561
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,800
You said your husband is deficient?

562
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,400
What happened?

563
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
Someone explain!

564
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,199
Your Majesty.

565
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,320
I suspect she's not a maid,

566
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,000
but an assassin.

567
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,079
Your Majesty, he lies!

568
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,840
Your Majesty.

569
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,840
Are you alright?

570
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,519
I'm fine.

571
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,320
Just feel like I'm about to die.

572
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,264
No!
