1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
Here in the Daniyord FRONT Fortress, you will be able to have a tactical-based Hேst loop to explore its

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,780
long-term capabilities on this West End stage.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,800
To get into the Heavy Reigung battle, you need to rock the Hermit oath to complete the

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,400
extra route of training.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:27,420
To tackle this height of Hyn Luis behind the Hein

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,420
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,420
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,420
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,420
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,420
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

11
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,420
I'm not sure if I can get the first one so I'll try and get the fourth one.

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,420
I'm not sure if I can get the first one so I'll try to get the second one.

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,420
If I can get the third one, then I'll try to get the previous one.

14
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,420
I think I normally find it harder to get the acrobatic, but since I'm thinking it's harder...

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,420
I'll try to get the third one.

16
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:29,360
Last

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,360
The End

18
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
Wang, wait for us.

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,360
The imperial guards of the imperial court, Long Qi, come to the palace.

20
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Long Qi, Madam, new talent, come to the palace.

21
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
Who told you to come back?

22
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
Get up. Get up.

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
We are here to accompany you to guard the capital.

24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
Don't worry.

25
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
Princess and Princess Zhenbao are all here.

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Do you think that death is a child's heart?

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Death is very scary.

28
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Wang.

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Didn't I ask you to leave?

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
You...

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
Actually, I and my sister

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
have already guessed the plan of the king and the crown prince.

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
I wanted to help the king to trick you away.

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
But you didn't expect that.

35
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
You are also thinking like that.

36
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Wang, don't worry.

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,360
Sister Xiao'er has been entrusted by us.

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Have you all thought it through?

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Are you really going to die with me?

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
I'm not afraid.

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
I'm not afraid either.

42
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
If

43
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
the prince is still alive,

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
he will definitely be happy.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
But let me make it clear.

46
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
I've said that death is very scary.

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
It hurts.

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Don't call me by name.

49
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
I'm not afraid of your jokes.

50
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Actually, I've died many times.

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
I've been poisoned.

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
I've been killed and killed by people.

53
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
But I'm afraid that

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
I'll die this time.

55
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Because you are with me.

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
I, Cheng Xiao Hua,

57
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
will die without regret.

58
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Business and bad,

59
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
death is a whole lot.

60
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
When death is a hell,

61
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
for the country of the Great Wall,

62
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
I'll be honored.

63
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Grandfather,

64
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
you may not understand what I mean.

65
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
But this sentence

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
is not even right.

67
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
People can choose to die.

68
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
People are interesting,

69
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
or light and red,

70
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
or finally too kind.

71
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
If you wait for death,

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
can the country of death cry?

73
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
Go.

74
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Go.

75
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Go.

76
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
Princess.

77
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
You are really a goddess.

78
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
The heaven doesn't let me down.

79
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
The heaven doesn't let me down.

80
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Crab.

81
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
Crab.

82
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
My wife.

83
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
You're back, my wife.

84
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
I thought you wouldn't come back.

85
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
How could I?

86
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,360
I won't let you face this alone.

87
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
My wife.

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Actually,

89
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
I'm not afraid of death.

90
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,360
I'm afraid of

91
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
having courage to die.

92
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
I'm afraid of

93
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
being killed.

94
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
I'm afraid of being killed.

95
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
I'm afraid of being killed.

96
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
I'm afraid of being killed.

97
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
I'm afraid of being killed.

98
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
When you face this,

99
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
you're not with me.

100
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
I understand.

101
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
So I'm back.

102
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
My wife.

103
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
The words you said

104
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
before you fell asleep.

105
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Although I didn't understand,

106
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
I know it must be for my own good.

107
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
I shouldn't have made you angry.

108
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
I blame you.

109
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
I was too anxious that time.

110
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
Actually,

111
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
I just want to tell you

112
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
that I miss you very much.

113
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
I miss you too.

114
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
My wife.

115
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Did you go to another world

116
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
during your sleep?

117
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Do you believe me?

118
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
What are you talking about?

119
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
I believe you.

120
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
But don't worry.

121
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Next time,

122
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
we'll wait for the next time.

123
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
I'll make it.

124
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
There's no next time.

125
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
What do you mean?

126
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
This time is the last time.

127
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
I always forced you to work hard

128
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
because I wanted you to leave here.

129
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
But from now on,

130
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
I won't force you.

131
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Why?

132
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Because I don't want you

133
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
to disappear from this world.

134
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
You have no chance.

135
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
In Shangyou Village,

136
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
we watched the stars that night.

137
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
You told me

138
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
if you weren't the king of Chenyuan,

139
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
I want to tell you

140
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
if we didn't have a fight that night,

141
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
Fight?

142
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
When did we have a fight?

143
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
In that world,

144
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
because we had a fight,

145
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
and you had an accident.

146
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
I had to send you

147
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
to this world.

148
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
We created everything here.

149
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
As long as you can

150
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
make Chen State

151
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
stand up and fight for Wu State,

152
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
you can wake up in that world.

153
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
My daughter-in-law,

154
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
what are you talking about?

155
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
I believe it.

156
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
But why this time...

157
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Now that world

158
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
has a problem.

159
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
You can't go out.

160
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
And this is your last time.

161
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
If you die again,

162
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
whether it's this world

163
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
or that world,

164
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
you won't exist.

165
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
So I won't force you.

166
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
You go.

167
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Go to Shangyou Village

168
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
and live your life as you want.

169
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
As long as you can live well,

170
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
as long as you can live well.

171
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
My daughter-in-law.

172
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
You go.

173
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
I'll go.

174
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
What's wrong with you?

175
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
What's wrong with you?

176
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Wang.

177
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
What's wrong with you?

178
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Hello, Chen Xiaohua.

179
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
I'm the founder of 2099.

180
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
The world's main character.

181
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
It's an impossible task

182
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
to complete

183
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
with you

184
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
in the K-pop world.

185
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
As long as you can

186
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
lead Chen State to rise

187
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
and fight for Wu State,

188
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
you can wake up

189
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
in that world again.

190
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
It's a pity.

191
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
This game

192
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
is not for...

193
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
You're the one who designed it.

194
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
You're a teenager in that world.

195
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
You're weak.

196
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
You're not capable

197
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
to change your fate.

198
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Wang.

199
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Wang.

200
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Wang.

201
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Because of your hard work,

202
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
you've made it.

203
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
In this world,

204
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Wu has already become a soldier.

205
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Your success

206
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
is only a few people

207
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
who are proud of you.

208
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Your success

209
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
will be destroyed.

210
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
This is an impossible task.

211
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Finally,

212
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
the task is finally over.

213
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
It's a pity.

214
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
It's a new one.

215
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Because of your failure,

216
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,360
he wants to change his fate for you.

217
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Your suffering

218
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
and suffering

219
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,360
are very hard.

220
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
But you can only do this.

221
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Taozi,

222
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,360
you violated the rules of the company.

223
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360
You shouldn't let your boyfriend

224
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
pass into this world of a girl.

225
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
You did everything for your own good.

226
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
You didn't allow it.

227
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Unfortunately,

228
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,360
I will end your existence.

229
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Go back.

230
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Just like you've never been to this world.

231
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Go back.

232
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Xifan.

233
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Xifan.

234
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Xifan.

235
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Xifan.

236
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Xifan,

237
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
are you okay?

238
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Xifan,

239
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,360
you don't have to hold back.

240
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
What?

241
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Wang!

242
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,360
Master, what's wrong?

243
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Have you seen the fireworks?

244
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
If there is another life,

245
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,360
I hope I can meet you again.

246
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Brother!

247
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Goodbye.

248
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Brother!

249
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Brother!

250
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Brother!

251
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Once,

252
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,360
there was a real love in front of me.

253
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
But,

254
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
I was not afraid to have it.

255
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
He said,

256
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,360
I was his backup.

257
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
He would protect me for life.

258
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
He said,

259
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
goodbye.

260
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
He said,

261
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
goodbye.

262
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,360
I will be your backup.

263
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,360
I am a selfish person.

264
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
I am coward.

265
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
I am a coward.

266
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,360
I don't know how to be responsible.

267
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,360
I am a coward.

268
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
But,

269
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
if you give me another chance,

270
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
I will do as he said,

271
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,360
let the whole country be peaceful,

272
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
let the people be happy.

273
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Uncle,

274
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
I am sorry.

275
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
I am sorry.

276
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Uncle,

277
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
I will do it.

278
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
But,

279
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
I am so sorry.

280
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
I am so sorry.

281
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
If you want to be a good girl,

282
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
you have to be in pain.

283
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
You have to believe that you will succeed.

284
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
The so-called fate is a excuse

285
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,360
for the weak to give themselves.

286
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,360
You have to live to understand.

287
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
You can only live for a lifetime.

288
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
You have to live for a lifetime.

289
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,360
You have to live for a lifetime.

290
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
You have to live for a lifetime.

291
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
You have to live for a lifetime.

292
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
You have to live for a lifetime.

293
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,360
You have to live for a lifetime.

294
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,360
You have to live for a lifetime.

295
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
Uncle,

296
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,360
the whole country can be better.

297
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,360
I can do better too.

298
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
I can do it.

299
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
I can do it.

300
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
I can do it.

301
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,360
If you give me another chance,

302
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
I will do a good job.

303
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
I, Chen Xiaohua,

304
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,360
will do everything I can to take care of the people's safety.

305
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
I will take care of their safety.

306
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
I will take care of everything.

307
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,360
I believe that if we do this,

308
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
Chen Gu's people will not abandon me.

309
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
They will not abandon me.

310
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
Yuziang,

311
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
Chen Xiaohua

312
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
is the one who loves this country.

313
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Everyone here.

314
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
I love you.

315
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,360
I love her.

316
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,360
I love you.

317
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,360
This time,

318
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,360
I will do everything I can to take care of the people's safety.

319
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,360
I love you.

320
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,360
I will do everything I can to take care of Chen Xiaohua.

322
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
I love you.

323
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
Chen Xiaohua.

324
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Exactly.

325
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,360
You bring these people to the battle?

326
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
Yes.

327
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,360
I will do everything I can to take care of the people's safety.

328
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,360
I will do everything I can to take care of the people's safety.

329
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,360
I will do everything I can to take care of the people's safety.

330
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,360
I will do everything I can to take care of the people's safety.

331
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:20,360
They will never abandon me.

332
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:31,360
They will not abandon me.

333
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:44,340
H-H Lord Frances

334
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:54,840
Jia Yu

335
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,320
¡¿Film!"

336
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,920
¡¿ Xi olmou? ¡¿Chen-guo?!

337
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,880
¡Les L vents!

338
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,520
¡G triple gong!

339
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,560
¡V trembling-tux-wen!

340
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,320
Aquí es without you.

341
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,120
You won't leave here!

342
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,720
That's right! You won't leave here!

343
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,520
If you dare to do anything that's unbearable,

344
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
I will definitely do something good!

345
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,720
I, Zheng Xiaohua,

346
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,320
am the one who killed this country.

347
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,920
I love everyone here.

348
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,720
I love...

349
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,120
I love you, Da Jian.

350
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Wu Que,

351
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,920
I don't want to be afraid of them.

352
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
As long as we unite,

353
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,320
we won't be afraid of them.

354
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,320
We won't be afraid of them!

355
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,120
Did you guys hear that?

356
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,220
Did you guys hear that?

357
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,120
Cheng中国 has been defected!

358
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,320
Yes, Cheng中国 has been defected!

359
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,160
Cheng

360
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,320
Xie Dongping, Cheng importance has been поддержBLE!

361
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,740
Oh, no!

362
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,920
In the next next next!

363
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,620
He has sealed that freedom with��는,

364
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,560
he will not be seen by young men!

365
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,560
The world is a world of dreams

366
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,560
The world is a world of dreams

367
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,560
The world is a world of dreams

368
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,560
The world is a world of dreams

369
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,560
The world is a world of dreams

370
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,560
The world is a world of dreams

371
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,560
The world is a world of dreams

372
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:52,560
The world is a world of dreams

373
00:25:52,560 --> 00:26:02,560
The world is a world of dreams

374
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:09,560
The world is a world of dreams

375
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,560
He did it

376
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,560
He really did it

377
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Come on, slowly

378
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
Don't rush

379
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Slowly

380
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,560
It's okay, it's okay

381
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,560
You've been lying in there for too long

382
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
This is called chicken breast

383
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Slowly, don't rush

384
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Come on, one, two

385
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
No

386
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Qiu Qiu

387
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
Qiu Qiu, where?

388
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,560
called Jiang Tao

389
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Where is he?

390
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:15,560
He stuck in that world to save you

391
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Can't get out of that world

392
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:50,560
He left it to you

393
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:10,560
He left it to you

394
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:20,560
He left it to you

395
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:30,560
He left it to you

396
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:40,560
He left it to you

397
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:50,560
He left it to you

398
00:28:50,560 --> 00:29:00,560
He left it to you

399
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,560
I'm back

400
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,560
He's gone

401
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,560
If he's gone

402
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,560
Then I'll stay in this world

403
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
What's the point?

404
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Can you help me?

405
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Ask the world what love is

406
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Just let people think about it

407
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,560
I'm willing to live and die

408
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,560
I don't want to leave

409
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Chen Xiaohua, wish you good luck

410
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Hello, a silver cake

411
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,560
Okay, sir

412
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,560
You must be Chen Xiaohua

413
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,560
Mr. Chen, right?

414
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
Yes

415
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
Okay, wait a minute

416
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Hello, you are?

417
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Chen Xiaohua

418
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Do we know each other?

419
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
It's me, Cai Qi

420
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
I'm sorry

421
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
I'm sorry

422
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,560
I'm sorry

423
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,560
I'm sorry

424
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,560
I'm sorry

425
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,560
I'm sorry

426
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,560
I'm sorry

427
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,560
I'm sorry

428
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,560
I'm sorry

429
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
I'm sorry

430
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
I'm sorry

431
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
I'm sorry

432
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,560
I'm sorry

433
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,560
I'm sorry

434
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,560
I'm sorry

435
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
I'm sorry

436
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
I'm sorry

437
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,560
I'm sorry

438
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
I'm sorry

439
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,560
I'm sorry

440
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,560
I'm sorry

441
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,560
I'm sorry

442
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,560
I'm sorry

443
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,560
I'm sorry

444
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,560
I'm sorry

445
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
I'm sorry

446
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
I'm sorry

447
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,560
I'm sorry

448
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,560
If time stops

449
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,560
The confusion in my dreams

450
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Or you

451
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,560
The result of the exchange of the evidence

452
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,560
Recover this conflict

453
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,560
It's happiness

454
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Your smile has not appeared recently

455
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,560
The scene is so beautiful

456
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,560
You are in the dream

457
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,560
The way I exist

458
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,560
And the story I lost

459
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,560
For you, it doesn't matter

460
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:57,560
I'm willing to say it every day

461
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:04,560
I imagine how much we will have tomorrow

462
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:12,560
I'm used to the way you've been with him

463
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,560
I'm not good at the end

464
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:24,560
I'm willing to stay with you

465
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:31,560
I want to have you by my side until the end

466
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:38,560
Even if I have to choose again

467
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,560
Or the two of us

468
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,560
I want to be with you
