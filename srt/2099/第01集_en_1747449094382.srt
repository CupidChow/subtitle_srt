00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Cai Qi, come to me.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Come to me, Cai Qi.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Wu Ge.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Was that a dream?

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Who hit me?

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Wu Ge.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Eunuch Li?

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Eunuch Li, when I was asleep,

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
was there a woman

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
who hit me?

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Sleepy cat.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It was me.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Then, let's have a dragon's foot.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Your Majesty, you're up.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Why don't we have a fight?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm Cheng Xiao Hua.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I grew up in the Cold Palace.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I didn't eat, drink or drink.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was so cruel.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But I don't know when,

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I suddenly became the king of the State of Chen.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I really didn't expect that.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But the good thing about being a king is

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I won't starve again.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Just a few dishes.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If you don't want to waste them,

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I won't eat.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This is the best blood

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
stewed with the skin of the quince.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Chicken and dragon fish soup.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Which bowl should I serve you?

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I never make choices.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I want them all.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Slow down.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What's wrong?

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Something's wrong.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There's poison.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Wu Gou!

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He's leaving again.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
King.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Eunuch Li?

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Your Majesty.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Eunuch Li.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Your Majesty.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's Lao Nong.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Something's wrong.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Did this scene happen?

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Shui Meng.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It must be Shui Meng.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's take a nap then.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's go.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's so early.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why don't we go to the court?

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I've been waiting for this day.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I finally want to go to the court.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,960
The

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Is it the blood of the left-hand

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and the right-hand

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is the blood of the left-hand

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and the right-hand

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll serve you first.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
There's poison in the steel.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I just want to wait for death.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You want to kill me in public.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Luo Qi.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Your Majesty.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
They poisoned me.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hurry up and spit it out.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Luo Qi.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
My head.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I haven't had my meal yet.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Cai Ji.

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Cai Ji.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Come to me.

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Come to me.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Cai Ji.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Who poisoned you?

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Why did you poison me?

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Say it.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If you don't give me the answer,

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll kill you.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You won't say it?

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Drink.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
One person, one bowl.

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Your Majesty.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Please forgive us.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Your Majesty.

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Your Majesty.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Please forgive us.

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm guilty.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I didn't say it.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's why I made such a big mistake.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Please give these people to me.

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I will torture them.

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Three days.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Within one day.

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Within one day.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I will find out who is behind this.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Who is behind this?

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But I don't think I'm good at acting.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's just a few.

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He asked me to be the king.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
How about this?

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You go tell Zhang Taifei and Da Si.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm the king.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's okay if I don't be the king.

146
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
My request is

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I just need to eat and drink well.

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Right?

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Then let's make the king Zhang.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Anyway, Da Si Ma is a man of the heaven.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He is also the king of the country.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Right?

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
King.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes.

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's dangerous.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Just legs are weak.

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
King Ji Fei, you can't turn.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I almost got poisoned and bled.

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I got two shots and a cannon.

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How is it?

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You shouldn't have asked me.

162
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Why do you know there is poison in the morning?

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's comforting.

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I never ask.

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Since you asked me sincerely,

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
you are my only star.

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I will give you a chance.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I will give you a chance.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I will give you a chance.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I will give you a chance.

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I will give you a chance.

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I will give you a chance.

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I will give you a chance.

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You are my only star.

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Then I will tell you with mercy.

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I...

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I...

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I can predict the future.

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Prevent the poison?

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Prevent the poison.

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So you are the man of the heaven.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You hit me again.

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You didn't expect it, right?

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's because I was relaxed.

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You hit me again.

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I won't lie to you.

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This is the king's order.

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You are lying.

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
When did I say the king's order?

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The king seems to have forgotten many things.

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Forgot many things?

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's comforting.

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Never lie.

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Then you tell me.

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Why do I order you?

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's comforting.

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Never ask.

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Come with me.

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
One more.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
King, please spare me.

201
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
King, please spare me.

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Noodles in the pot.

203
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
King.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Again.

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
King, you can't bear it?

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
This is for the servants.

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The servants eat well.

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The servants eat well.

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No poison.

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Do you understand?

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes.

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Show me.

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What do you understand?

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
King, stand up.

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes.

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I stand up.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
King, hard.

218
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Hard.

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And this time, I have four or five eggs.

220
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
God bless our king.

221
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
With this magic skill,

222
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
King Bu Chou is on the court

223
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and is in opposition to the Minister of War.

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He will take back power as soon as possible.

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Chen is still the king's Chen.

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No.

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It can be expected.

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
No.

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Although my magic skill

230
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
can save my life,

231
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
if it's on the court,

232
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
then forget it.

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's good to die here.

234
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
How good it is.

235
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Where?

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Where are you?

237
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Where are you?

238
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Cai Ji, come to me.

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Come to me, Cai Ji.

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Water.

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Water.

242
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So deep.

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So dark.

244
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No one can be here.

245
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The king is a little crazy.

246
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He can't be distracted.

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So,

248
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
the king is not here.

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No one can be here.

250
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No one can be here.

251
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No one can be here.

252
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So,

253
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
the king is suspicious of being poisoned.

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm not poisoned.

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm poisoned by magic.

256
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No wonder the king wants to kill himself.

257
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Why did you kill me?

258
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Stop it.

259
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I think there are people who have the courage to kill themselves.

260
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm looking for someone.

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Go to the lake.

262
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Let me tell you.

263
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I dreamt of a fairy.

264
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The water is changing me again and again.

265
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Cai Ji.

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Cai Ji.

267
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Stop it.

268
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll go to sleep with you.

269
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I know you don't believe me.

270
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But I have evidence.

271
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I think there is something wrong with the magic.

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm not sure.

273
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The magic is not inside.

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The magic is not inside.

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's here.

276
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm not sure.

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I think there is something wrong with the magic.

278
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm not sure.

279
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm not sure.

280
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's here.

281
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The magic is not inside.

282
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm not sure.

283
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,440
You don't even know your mother.

284
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,360
Get up.

285
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,640
Don't touch me.

286
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,800
Although I know

287
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,240
I do have a little bit of a look,

288
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,400
it's not appropriate for you to do this.

289
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
You're not a grown-up.

290
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,560
You're looking for a fight.

291
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,120
Dr. Wang.

292
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,840
Dr. Wang.

293
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,640
Great Third Sister.

294
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,640
Are you going to

295
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,520
take care of your sister?

296
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,360
You poisoned me

297
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,960
and humiliated me.

298
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,800
I'm angry, Your Majesty.

299
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,280
I'm here.

300
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,400
No one can hurt you.

301
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,840
Who said I was going to hurt him?

302
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,760
Doggie.

303
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,320
Who poisoned you?

304
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,960
Who humiliated you?

305
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,480
I'm talking to you.

306
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,400
Look.

307
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,520
Look.

308
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,400
You're so fearless.

309
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,760
You have no manners.

310
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,360
We've found the person

311
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,400
who poisoned you.

312
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,040
Dr. Wang and I

313
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,480
are here to report

314
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,640
that this has nothing to do with the Imperial Consort Dowager.

315
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,400
Eunuch Xiao has confessed.

316
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,200
He suspected that Your Majesty was in the mood

317
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,520
and bought poison from the court.

318
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,160
He put it in his breakfast.

319
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,600
You're lying.

320
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,480
He poisoned me.

321
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,200
You people

322
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,960
are always trying to fool me.

323
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,160
You want my life?

324
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,560
I caught him for you.

325
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,960
It's fine if you believe it.

326
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
It's fine if you don't.

327
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,840
He poisoned me anyway.

328
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,680
Fine.

329
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,400
You're all bullying me, aren't you?

330
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,400
Listen.

331
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,120
If I become an immortal,

332
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,600
I'll kill you the moment I come.

333
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,480
What are you laughing at?

334
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,240
What?

335
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,000
What immortal?

336
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You're so stressful.

337
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Your Majesty is so stressful.

338
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,080
You're so stressed out.

339
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,200
You're thinking about it all night.

340
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,600
That's why you look so crazy.

341
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,400
Dr. Wang is so stressful.

342
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,840
He eats five meals a day.

343
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,880
He does nothing.

344
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,800
He's so stressed.

345
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,600
Tell me what to do.

346
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,320
He'll eat on the bed

347
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,400
and sleep on the bed.

348
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,800
He doesn't care about anything.

349
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,600
He doesn't care about the state policy or politics.

350
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,480
Is that okay?

351
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,240
Excuse me.

352
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,400
Please stop.

353
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,000
Is this okay?

354
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,040
Yes.

355
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,000
As long as you give birth to Wang Si,

356
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,160
you'll never get up.

357
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,240
It's okay.

358
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,960
Give birth to Wang Si?

359
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,600
In this way,

360
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,720
it's also very important

361
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,960
to choose a virtuous woman for His Majesty.

362
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,360
Find...

363
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,480
Find a woman?

364
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,480
I...

365
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,200
I can.

366
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,840
My goodness.

367
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,200
His Majesty is looking for a woman.

368
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,560
He's so confused.

369
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,480
Is it true?

370
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,120
His Majesty, Meng Yan,

371
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,040
has been looking for immortals and rabbits all night.

372
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,720
Meng Yan.

373
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,000
He's been looking for immortals and rabbits all night.

374
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,440
Keep your voice down.

375
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,200
His Majesty

376
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,380
is determined to be a

377
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,640
jade rabbit who doesn't know where to practice.

378
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,560
He's scared.

379
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,520
His Majesty is scared.

380
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,200
My goodness.

381
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
It's so scary.

382
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Stop talking.

383
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,480
What about the next step?

384
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,760
The next step?

385
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,080
You're so scared.

386
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,120
You're still thinking about the next step?

387
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,960
Let's go.

388
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
His Majesty

389
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,840
is an adult now.

390
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,360
Choosing a princess is also a matter of time.

391
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,280
But His Majesty wants to tell us

392
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,600
what you want from the princess.

393
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,840
I can make a request.

394
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
You can make a request.

395
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
As long as you tell us,

396
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,400
Great Sima and I

397
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,840
will choose one person

398
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,600
for you

399
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,440
in the folk world.

400
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,480
Actually,

401
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,280
I don't have any requests.

402
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,520
But

403
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,160
this woman

404
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,280
is beautiful.

405
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,760
If we can choose some features,

406
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,920
it's better to be the kind of woman

407
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,320
who has a pink jade rabbit in her arms.

408
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,920
She's cool and cool.

409
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,640
She's got some acrobatics in her aura.

410
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,800
She's cool and cool in her acrobatics.

411
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,560
It's better to have a more aggressive temper.

412
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,240
She'll be like a big mouth when she comes up.

413
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes.

414
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,680
I want this kind of woman.

415
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,760
Go and find her for me.

416
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,880
You're so mean.

417
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,680
Your Majesty.

418
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,120
And you?

419
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,760
Did

420
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,800
you really

421
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:50,880
give me one more chance?

422
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,440
Did you really give me one more chance?

423
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:51,560
Did you really give me one more chance?

424
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:51,640
Did you really give me one more chance?

425
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:51,760
Did you really give me one more chance?

426
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,000
Did you really give me one more chance?

427
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,080
Did you really give me one more chance?

428
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,760
I didn't.

429
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,840
A gentleman should have more leniency

430
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,400
than begin a ladies' air.

431
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,140
A gentleman should have more leniency

432
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,480
especially not two-귀 conforms.

433
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,940
These things

434
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,300
were

435
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,460
selected by

436
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,860
really choose her.

437
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,500
Your Majesty,

438
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,060
you must choose your own consort

439
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,340
from here.

440
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,340
You are right.

441
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,180
The two leading ladies

442
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,180
are all from my family.

443
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,020
They are the most virtuous ladies.

444
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,180
In terms of

445
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,620
the two, you should call her cousin.

446
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,020
Cousin?

447
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,540
Vigorous?

448
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,700
I am Zhang Zhen'er.

449
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,100
I am Zhang Bao'er.

450
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,060
Greetings, Your Majesty.

451
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

452
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,660
I heard that Your Majesty

453
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,820
likes a woman who is unruly

454
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,340
and has a strong personality.

455
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,580
I am not talented.

456
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,020
Today, I am going to let Your Majesty

457
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,620
taste my talent.

458
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,220
It's time to show our real talent.

459
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,700
Come on, guys.

460
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,900
Bring it on.

461
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,780
But...

462
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,420
But, Your Majesty,

463
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,260
what... what are you doing?

464
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,980
Stone?

465
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,780
That's right.

466
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,700
My talent is the biggest stone in my chest.

467
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,220
Do!

468
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,420
He's coming.

469
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,300
Here.

470
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,260
Feed me this ball.

471
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,060
Come on. Feed me.

472
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,020
So hilarious.

473
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,780
That's so awesome.

474
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,980
Good.

475
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,300
Thank you.

476
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,460
You're so good.

477
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,460
You're so good.

478
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,060
Are you satisfied with me?

479
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,460
Well,

480
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,860
if you're not,

481
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,340
it's really good.

482
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,220
But if you're satisfied,

483
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,940
what can I do?

484
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,940
I chose to fly.

485
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,580
You're so determined.

486
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,020
What?

487
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,060
You're not satisfied?

488
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,740
Fine.

489
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,580
Continue.

490
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,380
What?

491
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:18,980
No.

492
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,780
I'll give you

493
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,380
a spear and a sword.

494
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,820
No, no, no.

495
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,540
Well,

496
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,500
you two are the only ones.

497
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,300
Well,

498
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,860
first of all,

499
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,500
go.

500
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,540
Go.

501
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,660
Go, go, go.

502
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,020
What's going on?

503
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,780
It seems that he's not satisfied with us.

504
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,660
He ran away.

505
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,500
Ran away?

506
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,980
No one can run away from me.

507
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,900
He ran away and I chased him.

508
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,180
I'll make him run away.

509
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:40,780
Go.

510
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,340
Why are you still standing there?

511
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,380
Go and take care of His Majesty.

512
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,140
Yes, yes, yes.

513
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,140
What's going on?

514
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,620
Your Majesty.

515
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,860
Your Majesty, slow down.

516
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,580
Your Majesty.

517
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,420
Your Majesty.

518
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,220
Your Majesty.

519
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,180
Your Majesty.

520
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,380
Your Majesty.

521
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,540
Your Majesty.

522
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,700
Your Majesty.

523
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,300
Your Majesty.

524
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,780
Your Majesty.

525
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,300
Your Majesty.

526
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,940
Stop it.

527
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,220
The lake is dangerous.

528
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,580
The lake is dangerous.

529
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,700
I think you're in danger.

530
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,820
Your Majesty, be careful.

531
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,540
It's dangerous.

532
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,420
Your Majesty.

533
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,060
Why are you running?

534
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,940
Your Majesty.

535
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,620
Your Majesty.

536
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,340
I told you it's dangerous.

537
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,380
You didn't listen and ran away.

538
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,420
You're blind.

539
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,620
You're blind.

540
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,860
Your whole family is blind.

541
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,620
Let go.

542
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,420
No, no, no.

543
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,980
Pull me up.

544
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,940
I'm pulling you up.

545
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,100
But you're not running away.

546
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:54,940
I won't run away.

547
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,300
I won't run away.

548
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,140
Are you willing to marry us?

549
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,220
Marriage is about happiness.

550
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,740
Happiness can't be forced.

551
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,420
Your Majesty.

552
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,140
There's no problem.

553
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,060
Come back to the city.

554
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,140
Cai Jin.

555
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,580
Come to me.

556
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,820
Water.

557
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,460
Water.

558
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,260
Cai Jin.

559
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,060
Come to me.

560
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,660
Come to me.

561
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,860
Cai Jin.

562
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,100
Cai Jin outside.

563
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,580
You ask me to come back...

564
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,660
To visit you...

565
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,740
I come here.

566
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,820
I got to face Literally.

567
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,940
Wait...

568
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,420
Did you see quan?

569
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,180
Yes.

570
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,220
When youも

571
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,160
You are instantly

572
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,420
I feel it.

573
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,420
That's the feeling.

574
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,420
You're too...

575
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,420
Sir.

576
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,420
Sir.

577
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
Sir.

578
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,420
Sir.

579
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
You're finally here.

580
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,420
Wang, you're finally awake.

581
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,420
No.

582
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,420
Why are you so close to me?

583
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,420
The fox has been sleeping all day

584
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,420
since the king saved him.

585
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,420
Where's the old fairy?

586
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,420
Fairy?

587
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,420
What fairy?

588
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,420
The one who saved the king was Mrs. Xiao.

589
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,420
Mrs. Xiao?

590
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,420
Your beloved consort.

591
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,420
The daughter of the Grand Minister.

592
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,420
Wang, you don't remember?

593
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,420
You mean

594
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
the one who saved me from the fox

595
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,420
was my beloved consort

596
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,420
or the daughter of the Grand Minister?

597
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,420
Yang Mi.

598
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,420
It doesn't matter.

599
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,420
Let me tell you.

600
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,420
It's her.

601
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,420
She's known as Cai Ji.

602
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,420
She's been cursing me

603
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,420
and making me sleep with the fairy.

604
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,420
I only know

605
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,420
that Mrs. Xiao is the only young

606
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,420
and most important person in the palace

607
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,420
among the three madams.

608
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,420
Wait.

609
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,420
Let me see.

610
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,420
This is Mrs. Xiao

611
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,420
who brought you out of the cold palace.

612
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,420
When you got on the throne,

613
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,420
the Grand Minister

614
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,420
sent her here.

615
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,420
Hurry.

616
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,420
Find her for me now.

617
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,420
I'll teach her a lesson.

618
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,420
What's the swordplay?

619
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,420
What's the swordplay?

620
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,420
Is it the swordplay

621
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,420
when the king calls his wife

622
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,420
to learn the old swordplay?

623
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,420
Yes.

624
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,420
King.

625
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,420
Why is it so dark?

626
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
It's like a spring.

627
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,420
What's the way to meet the god?

628
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
Leave.

629
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
I'm here.

630
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,420
