(Endgame)

2
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,599
Your Majesty. Wait for us.

3
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,920
Secret Guard Long Qi
is here to resume duty.

4
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,560
Xin Caiyi, wife of Long Qi,
is here to resume duty.

5
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,120
Why did you come back?

6
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,359
Get up.

7
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,680
Get up.

8
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,680
Let us fight alongside you.

9
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,400
Rest assured.

10
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,280
The ladies are safe.

11
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,560
Death is no child's play.

12
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,879
Death is frightening.

13
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,199
Your Majesty.

14
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,879
Didn't I tell you to leave? Why...

15
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,680
My sister and I had long guessed

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,039
His Majesty and the Grand Tutor's plan.

17
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,159
We intended to lure you away for him.

18
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,479
But it turned out
that you had the same plan.

19
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,280
Your Majesty, rest assured.

20
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,400
Xiao'er has settled down somewhere safe.

21
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,360
Have you thought it through?

22
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,800
Are you really going to die with me?

23
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,800
Your Majesty. I'm not scared.

24
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,599
Me neither.

25
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,280
If the Grand Marshal

26
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,560
were still here,

27
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,520
he would be gratified.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,319
But let me make it clear.

29
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,760
Like I said. Death is terrible.

30
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,639
It hurts a lot.

31
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,879
Don't you whine about it.

32
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,360
You may find me crazy.

33
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,639
But actually,

34
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,719
I've died many times.

35
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,840
Poisoning.

36
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:22,959
Murder.

37
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,879
Suicide.

38
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,799
But this time,

39
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,520
I'm not scared at all.

40
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,639
Because I have you guys.

41
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,719
I, Chen Xiaohua,

42
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,039
would die without regret.

43
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,280
What joy in life?

44
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,800
What suffering in death?

45
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,639
Why not

46
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,240
die for the state?

47
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,680
I feel deeply honored

48
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,120
to die for Chen State.

49
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,240
Grand Tutor.

50
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,800
I think you got me wrong.

51
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,800
But what you said fit the scenario

52
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
perfectly.

53
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,879
Life

54
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,599
is all about choices.

55
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,759
Man is bound to die,

56
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,639
but death can vary

57
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,239
in significance.

58
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,120
Why not

59
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,319
die for the state?

60
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,560
Let's go.

61
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,840
- Let's go.
- Go.

62
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,639
Your Grace.

63
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,839
She's truly the Warrioress.

64
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,080
Heaven bless Chen State.

65
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,199
Heaven bless Chen State!

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,600
Rookie.

67
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,199
Honey.

68
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,279
Honey.

69
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,720
You're back, honey.

70
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,359
I thought you weren't coming back.

71
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,360
No way.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,879
I won't let you face it alone.

73
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,720
Honey.

74
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,160
I'm not afraid of death at all.

75
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
What I fear is

76
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,119
when I finally

77
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,720
have the courage to face it,

78
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,959
you're not by my side.

79
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,319
I understand.

80
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,360
That's why I'm back.

81
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,439
Honey.

82
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,160
I didn't quite understand

83
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,759
what you said

84
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,399
before you fell asleep,

85
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,839
but I know you meant to do me good.

86
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,560
I shouldn't have made you mad.

87
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,639
It's not your fault.

88
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,199
I was too hasty that day.

89
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,879
Actually,

90
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,160
I just want to tell you

91
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,000
that I've missed you.

92
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,079
Me too.

93
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,000
Honey.

94
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,199
Did you go to the other world

95
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,560
while you were asleep?

96
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,079
You believe me now?

97
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,040
Now, I'll believe

98
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,360
whatever you say.

99
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,000
But rest assured.

100
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,160
Let's wait

101
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,279
for the next life.

102
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,519
I will make it.

103
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,439
There is no next life.

104
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,800
What do you mean?

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,800
This is your last chance.

106
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,600
I kept pushing you to work harder

107
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
because I wanted to get you out of here.

108
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,600
But from now on,

109
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,000
I won't push you anymore.

110
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,399
Why not?

111
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,239
Because I don't

112
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,199
want you to disappear from this world.

113
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,639
You won't make it.

114
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,879
When we watched the stars

115
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,800
in Shangyao Village that night,

116
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,759
you said

117
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,439
if only you weren't King Chen.

118
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,800
And I want to tell you.

119
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,800
If only we hadn't argued that day.

120
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,519
Argue?

121
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,959
When did we argue?

122
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,600
In the other world.

123
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,119
We argued

124
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,360
and you had an accident.

125
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,439
I had no choice

126
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,639
but to send you into this game.

127
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,840
Everything here

128
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,360
was created by us.

129
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,119
As long as you can

130
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,399
clear the level

131
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,920
and make Chen State rise

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,959
to defeat Wu State,

133
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,360
you can wake up in that world.

134
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,519
Honey.

135
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,759
I believe whatever you say.

136
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,680
But why is it

137
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,000
the last...

138
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,000
Something happened in that world.

139
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,319
You can't get out.

140
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,360
And this is your last chance.

141
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,000
If you die again,

142
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,799
you will cease to exist

143
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,079
in both worlds.

144
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,439
So I won't push you anymore.

145
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,120
Go.

146
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,919
Live the life you want
in Shangyao Village.

147
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,759
Just stay alive and live in peace.

148
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,799
That's all I want.

149
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,879
Honey.

150
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,240
Get going.

151
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,320
Honey.

152
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,360
What's wrong?

153
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,039
Honey.

154
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,240
Your Majesty!

155
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,120
Honey.

156
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,200
What's going on?

157
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,360
Hello, Chen Xiaohua.

158
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,440
I am the creator of 2099,

159
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,799
the master of this world.

160
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,760
She and Dr. K

161
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,880
have set up

162
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,360
an impossible task for you.

163
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,320
As long as you lead Chen State to rise

164
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,639
and defeat Wu State,

165
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,960
you can wake up in the other world.

166
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,080
Unfortunately,

167
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
this game

168
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,759
is not designed for someone like you.

169
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,439
In that world,

170
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,600
you are a loser.

171
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
You are weak

172
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,279
and self-deceptive.

173
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,520
You can't change your fate.
You don't deserve...

174
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,800
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

175
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,080
A girl like her.

176
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,519
Thanks to her tireless effort,

177
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,360
you have come this far.

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,160
However, in this world,

179
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,240
the Wu Army is at the city gates.

180
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,399
Chen State

181
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,320
only has a few people left.

182
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,919
Chen State

183
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,639
is about to be destroyed.

184
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,799
This is an impossible task.

185
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,320
Finally,

186
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,480
you are going to fail.

187
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,919
Unfortunately,

188
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,159
she came back again.

189
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,600
She can't part with you,

190
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,399
so she is trying to change your fate.

191
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,080
The love of you ill-fated couple

192
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,799
is a beautiful tragedy

193
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,000
but can only end here.

194
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,960
Tao.

195
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
You violated the company's rules

196
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,319
by transferring

197
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,000
your boyfriend's will
to this virtual world.

198
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,240
Everything you did for him

199
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,519
is forbidden by the company.

200
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,200
Unfortunately,

201
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,240
I will terminate you.

202
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,919
Time for destruction.

203
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,760
It will be

204
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,080
as if you have never
existed in this world.

205
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,159
Time for destruction.

206
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,559
Honey.

207
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,840
Honey!

208
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,159
Honey.

209
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,200
Is that you, honey?

210
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,440
Your Majesty!

211
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,559
Honey.

212
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,600
Are you alright?

213
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,120
Have you seen fireworks?

214
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,919
If there is another life,

215
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,080
I hope to meet you again.

216
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,840
(Goodbye.)

217
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,440
(Once,)

218
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,440
(I was offered sincere love.)

219
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:04,840
(However,)

220
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,399
(I didn't deserve it.)

221
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,639
(She said)

222
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,240
(that I was her core command)

223
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,759
(and that she would protect me forever.)

224
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,799
(She said,)

225
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,720
("Rookie.)

226
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,759
(I'm here.)

227
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,759
(Don't be scared.")

228
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,480
I used to be

229
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,200
a selfish person
who only cared about myself.

230
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,399
I was a coward.

231
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,320
I avoided reality

232
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,679
and had no idea
how to shoulder any responsibility.

233
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,679
I, Chen Xiaohua,

234
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,159
am such a loser.

235
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,159
But if heaven

236
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,799
gives me another chance,

237
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,559
I will meet her expectations.

238
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,480
I'll bring peace and prosperity

239
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,160
(to Chen State and its people.)

240
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,880
(Jiujiu.)

241
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,440
(I swear I'll make it.)

242
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,640
But now,

243
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,799
I've messed it up.

244
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,480
I've messed it all up.

245
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,320
(Those who succeed)

246
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,559
(are destined to go through pain.)

247
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,160
Believe in yourself.

248
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:47,880
Destiny

249
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,200
is merely an excuse for the weak.

250
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,799
A person who can't

251
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,640
figure out the truth of life

252
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,640
can only be drowned in pain
throughout his lifetime.

253
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,319
You make your choices about life.

254
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,440
Your fate is in your own hands,

255
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,359
Your Majesty.

256
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,640
Wait.

257
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,599
Chen State can be better.

258
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,079
I can be better too.

259
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,079
I can do it.

260
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,880
I got this.

261
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I got this!

262
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:34,519
If

263
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,720
you dare to give me another chance,

264
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,400
I swear I will be a good king.

265
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,599
I, Chen Xiaohua,

266
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:47,039
will attend court sessions every day,

267
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,680
safeguard the well-being of the people,

268
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,920
and make sure they have ample supply.

269
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,800
I will manage

270
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,039
drought and flood relief.

271
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,440
I believe

272
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,599
that as long as I do that,

273
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,880
people will not abandon me

274
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,359
and leave everything behind.

275
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:06,920
That's right.

276
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
I, Chen Xiaohua,

277
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,799
love this state.

278
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,400
I love everyone here.

279
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,319
I love you all.

280
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,720
I love everyone.

281
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,759
This time,

282
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,200
I, Chen Xiaohua,

283
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,240
won't run away.

284
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:23,799
I'm sorry.

285
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,680
This is the last thing

286
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,759
I can do for you.

287
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,559
(New King Wu)
King Chen. Chen Xiaohua.

288
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,359
That's me.

289
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,160
That's all the troops you've got?

290
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,680
Grant their death wish.

291
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,840
Chen State shall not perish.

292
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,239
Chen State shall not perish.

293
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,920
Chen State shall not perish.

294
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,320
Chen State shall not perish.

295
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,160
Chen State shall not perish.

296
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,800
Chen State shall not perish.

297
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,479
Chen State shall not perish.

298
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,239
Chen State shall not perish.

299
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:42,240
Chen State shall not perish.

300
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,119
Chen State shall not perish.

301
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,039
Chen State shall not perish.

302
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,359
Chen State shall not perish.

303
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,640
Chen State shall not perish.

304
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,680
Chen State shall not perish.

305
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,640
Chen State shall not perish.

306
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:01,599
Chen State shall not perish.

307
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,000
Chen State shall not perish.

308
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,519
(Our Chen State)

309
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,240
(has high mountains)

310
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,039
(and big rivers,)

311
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,359
(crops in the fields,)

312
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,160
(soybeans in the ground,)

313
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,640
(salt in the lake,)

314
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,119
(and mines in the rocks.)

315
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,240
This is

316
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,839
where Chen's people

317
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,960
have settled for generations.

318
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,000
You won't abandon this place.

319
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,920
That's right.

320
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,599
You won't abandon this place.

321
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,400
If

322
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,319
you dare to give me another chance,

323
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,920
I swear I will be a good king.

324
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,559
I, Chen Xiaohua,

325
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,200
love this state.

326
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,839
I love everyone here.

327
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,440
I love you all.

328
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,759
I love everyone.

329
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:49,559
Why should we

330
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,559
be afraid of the Wu Army?

331
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,599
As long as we are united,

332
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,319
we may not lose.

333
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,240
We may not necessarily lose.

334
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,800
Do you hear me?

335
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,080
Chen State shall not perish.

336
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,080
Do you hear me?

337
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,600
Chen State shall not perish.

338
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,880
Chen State shall not perish.

She made it.

357
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,680
She made it for real.

358
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,200
Come on, slowly.

359
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,160
Don't rush.

360
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,039
Be careful.

361
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,799
It's okay.

362
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,519
You've been lying in there for too long.

363
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,200
You've lost muscle mass.

364
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:30,680
Come on.

365
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,519
Slowly. Don't rush.

366
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,400
Come on, one, two.

367
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,359
Wait.

368
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:42,799
Jiujiu.

369
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,319
Where is Jiujiu?

370
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:47,759

372
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,160
Where is she?

373
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,440
She tried to save you

374
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,480
and got stuck in that world.

375
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,720
She can't get out.

376
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:48,720
She left this for you.

Where are you going?

380
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,599
She stayed

381
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,599
in that virtual world to save me.

382
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,319
I'm back.

383
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,920
But she's gone.

then what's the point for me to stay

00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,960
in the real world?

387
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,720
Dr. K.

388
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,039
Help me.

389
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,880
What is this thing called love,

390
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,519
to which we vow life and death?

391
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,640
May I find true love,

392
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,319
till white-haired we remain two.

393
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,119
Chen Xiaohua.

394
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,240
Good luck.

399
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,400
- Mr. Chen, right?
- Yeah.

400
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,400
Okay, one second.

401
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,759

Chen Xiaohua.

403
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:43,880
