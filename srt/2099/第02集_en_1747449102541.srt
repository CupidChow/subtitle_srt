1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,020
Whereas I'm ears...

2
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,520
have no power overpubalance any less!

3
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,060
All of my position is because the only thing that I can have is strength!

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,060
There's nothing I can do.

5
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,600
I may just be supposed

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,280
to absorb blades as little as possible from security.

7
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,060
I am no longer a matured robot slave middle-aged girl!

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,820
Are you sure they're going to let it go?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,280
Doublet exchange

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,720
Only...

11
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,200
Do you see this?

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:33,700
and there remains

13
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,780
I'm going to make a

14
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,280
I'm going to make a

15
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,280
I'm going to make a

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,280
I'm going to make a

17
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,280
I'm going to make a

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,280
I'm going to make a

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,280
I'm going to make a

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,280
I'm going to make a

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,280
I'm going to make a

22
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,320
I'm going to make a

23
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,320
I'm going to make a

24
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,320
I'm going to make a

25
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,320
I'm going to make a

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,320
I'm going to make a

27
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,320
I'm going to make a

28
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,320
I'm going to make a

29
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,320
I'm going to make a

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,320
I'm going to make a

31
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,320
I'm going to make a

32
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,100
Two Houses x hardest

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,400
Demons!

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:29,400
Um I don't know what to do with you

35
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,620
Is this some wood?

36
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,500
Your feeling is an hour's worth of staff

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,580
I was hoping this family would water the trees

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,540
I think it's worth the result

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It is good

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Fairy.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Have we met before?

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Why do you look familiar?

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm not...

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm not a fairy.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you have a ring?

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No ring.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No ring.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Sir, what should I call you?

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
My beloved wife.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're too impulsive.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Forget it if you don't think it's appropriate.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Zhang Xiao?

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Or Xiaoxiao?

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
2...

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
2-0-9-9.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I like drinking.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I understand.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You immortals need to use the name Hua.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hua...

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hua... Hua Ming.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sir.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Sir.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's cute.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Who is it?

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Who?

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's silly.

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No.

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
No silly.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Most of the time, when you fall, your head is on the ground.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
My clothes are on you.

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Didn't you see?

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Did you see?

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Take off your clothes.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're so annoying.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Who is this?

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Shut up.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Maybe he likes this.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Forced to violate the crime of insulting women.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Forced to violate or insult women in a violent way.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Forced to be in a sexual or sexual relationship for more than five years.

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What are you talking about?

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm the king of Chen.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The god of Chen.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm the king.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Besides, you're the one who believes in me.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You...

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Change my clothes.

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Change my clothes.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Stop.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's not that.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's not that kind of sound.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll give you a massage.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Put it on.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Come here.

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Psst.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Psst.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I want to play with our secret.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
There are two outside the door.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
One on the roof.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Three in the side hall.

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Four outside the yard.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's great.

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're really powerful.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
When are you taking me away?

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Where?

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The heaven.

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know when you'll leave the world.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't know if you have any special mission.

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Mission?

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But I think the fairy will take her husband back to the heaven.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Mission?

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's okay.

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If you think the heaven is not suitable, you can take me to the garden.

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Garden is also okay.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The kind of place where you can be happy and happy.

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But I can't eat.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If you only eat the peach, I can't stand it.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You have to be kind.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I can't remember my mission.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Mission.

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Mission.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Mission.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mission.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
No, no, no.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Why don't you hit yourself?

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's so good to be finished.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't hide it.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If you think it's not suitable, we can start with the scent of the scent.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The scent of the scent is also good.

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No.

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Empty hand, no one.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
No matter what magic you know, it's a human, a demon.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you want to hurt the king, even if you have to live, I won't let you go.

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
How can you still cough while standing?

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Longqian, is there any smell of alcohol?

142
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Did you drink it?

143
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
King, don't be careless.

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You see, his eyes are red.

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Maybe he's really going to the capital.

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Very good analysis.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't analyze it next time.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's my love letter.

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Zhang Xiaoye, get out of here.

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Who?

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It seems to be Mrs. Bao.

152
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Come out, Zhang Xiaoye.

153
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Who gave you the courage?

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I should break through my palace.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Zhang Xiaoye is a bitch, who is bold enough to grab my husband.

156
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
King, this has nothing to do with you.

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This is the family business of our Zhang family.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let him come out.

159
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Today I'll show him what I'm good at.

160
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Look, they are all good sisters.

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I want to see her.

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Who is a sister to this unidentified bitch?

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Bao, shut up.

164
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You won't let him come out, will you?

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're protecting him, aren't you?

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay, I'll go in.

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This, this, this, he's asleep.

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's the kind that can't be pulled out.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why don't you go back first?

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll pull it out tomorrow.

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
King, you've already spoiled him so much, haven't you?

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The more you spoil him, the more I want to break him.

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Get out of the way. Get up.

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Zhang Xiaoye, you know martial arts?

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Zhang Xiaoye, you're a master of swordplay.

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You're not a master of fighting.

177
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Sister, take this bitch down and see the princess.

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay.

179
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Good martial arts.

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
No, I'm sorry.

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Who is good at martial arts?

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Who is the top?

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Mrs. Xiao is the top.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It looks like a kind of martial arts.

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Let go, let go, let go.

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Bullshit, I let you go.

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You bully people more than you bully people less.

188
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's not me.

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We sisters are not separated by life and death.

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We fight one, we fight a group.

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Miss, please report.

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Error 32, program self-examination failed.

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh, no.

194
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This has happened before.

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is the curse.

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Zhang Xiaoye, you can't beat me and you can't play, can you?

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Playing with the old lady.

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Immortal.

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You're a monster.

200
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You're a monster.

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You're playing with old ladies.

202
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Immortal.

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No.

204
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Cai Jin, come to me.

205
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The sword.

206
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It hurts.

207
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It really hurts.

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'll take you to see the princess.

209
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Here it comes.

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's back.

211
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Stop, it's back.

212
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's back.

213
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Monster.

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Monster.

215
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Go.

216
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Monster.

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Monster.

218
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Run.

219
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Your Majesty.

220
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Your Majesty.

221
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Your Majesty.

222
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The scene just now.

223
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Your wife.

224
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Is it a trap?

225
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Don't worry.

226
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I have a bottom line.

227
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But I don't have a bottom line.

228
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Your Majesty.

229
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please.

230
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Come.

231
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
If the princess is killed, stop them.

232
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes.

233
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's too late.

234
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's all over now.

235
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Everyone knows you're not a human.

236
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Immortal.

237
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Don't move.

238
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Or we'll find a way to run away.

239
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Immortal.

240
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm afraid you can't complete this mission.

241
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You're in big trouble now.

242
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You don't know.

243
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Those people killed me.

244
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Not to mention you.

245
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Although I know you're powerful.

246
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But I can't suppress the snake.

247
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
How about this?

248
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Can you contact them?

249
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Let them take us away.

250
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Automatic repair of the program.

251
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Automated repair of the wrong code.

252
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Automated repair completed.

253
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Please enter the fingerprint and restart the program.

254
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Restart what program?

255
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What?

256
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Energy reserve 30%.

257
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Start the power-saving mode.

258
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Please quickly charge the energy.

259
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Okay.

260
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's back to normal.

261
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Remember my name.

262
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The monster?

263
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You mean.

264
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
My nephew is the monster of the fire.

265
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But I don't know.

266
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I dare not say.

267
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I saw it with my own eyes.

268
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But General Longqi said.

269
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The whole Linghua Hall forbids this.

270
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You're a good girl.

271
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Go.

272
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

273
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Kill Chen Xiaohua.

274
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes.

275
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Get up. Stop pretending.

276
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You're pretending to sleep?

277
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Do you believe I'll dig your eyes out?

278
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That's too cruel.

279
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
My lady.

280
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Why don't you answer?

281
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
When did I answer?

282
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I was just in the program.

283
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't understand.

284
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You don't have to understand.

285
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You just need to know.

286
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
From today on.

287
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
My task is to help you become a bear master.

288
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
No, my lady.

289
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
My lady.

290
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Sir.

291
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The situation is.

292
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's not important to know.

293
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The important thing is.

294
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
As long as you stay in the room.

295
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The whole palace will know you're not a human.

296
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Then they'll find a way to deal with you.

297
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Listen to me.

298
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's better to die than to live.

299
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You.

300
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
When I'm in the emergency room.

301
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You stay here.

302
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'll take Longqi.

303
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
We'll escape from the palace overnight.

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Go.

305
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Come back.

306
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Run?

307
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Run overnight?

308
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
A man should be a man of his word.

309
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You know how to run all day.

310
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You're so mean.

311
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
My lady.

312
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Actually, I don't object to this.

313
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But.

314
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
This situation.

315
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Is it not suitable?

316
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
How about this?

317
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
We'll run out.

318
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Then we'll find a place.

319
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If you want to fight for 300 rounds.

320
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
A gentleman should be a man of his word.

321
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
A man should be a man of his word.

322
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I can't be a gentleman.

323
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Height 180 cm.

324
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Weight 130 cm.

325
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Body proportion.

326
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Body proportion is 3% lower than normal people.

327
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The top of the head is seven inches.

328
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's expected to be bald before 30 years old.

329
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Lady.

330
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You sit on me.

331
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You know my height and weight.

332
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Heart rate 127 cm.

333
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
High blood pressure, high blood pressure.

334
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Fatigue.

335
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Lack of fatty acids in the body.

336
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Lack of internal secretion.

337
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Lack of muscle mass.

338
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're really a genius.

339
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Your body is worse than I thought.

340
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You know better than anyone.

341
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Since you said it so detailed.

342
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It seems that I'm dying.

343
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm dying.

344
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Then you don't have to get up from the bed.

345
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Get up.

346
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
No.

347
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I told you to get up.

348
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Lady.

349
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Don't talk to me.

350
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm sleepy.

351
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Let me sleep peacefully.

352
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll have a nightmare.

353
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'll die if I have a nightmare.

354
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
After I die.

355
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You can revive me.

356
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
By the way.

357
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Take me to a place far away from this palace.

358
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm afraid I can't.

359
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Let's meet outside the palace.

360
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Are you going to get up?

361
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It hurts.

362
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Open the door.

363
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm done.

364
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Wait.

365
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Come back.

366
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll fight with you.

367
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You know how to think.

368
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What else?

369
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What else can you do?

370
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You're too much.

371
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What else?

372
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The rice in the jar is moldy.

373
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Throw it away.

375
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's all the laundry.

376
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No.

377
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You don't understand.

378
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm using this to change the street.

379
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Do you know how to live?

380
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Second brother.

381
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Nine to eleven o'clock is the best time for human sleep.

382
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
A lot of research data shows that

383
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
good sleep can improve people's immunity

384
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
and enhance human life.

385
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's more beneficial to cover the identity of the person who is born.

386
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
What are you talking about?

387
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Chen Xiaohua's

388
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Backward Road

389
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What's this word?

390
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
How do I recognize it?

391
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The world you think is not the real world.

392
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The person you think is not the real person.

393
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm sorry.

394
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm sorry.

395
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The real person?

396
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't understand.

397
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Don't believe in Da Si Ma.

398
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
This is called Tiananmen.

399
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Don't believe in Da Si Ma.

400
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I do need to emphasize.

401
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Don't believe in Da Si.

402
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Useless.

403
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The treasure map.

404
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Treasure map.

405
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
This must be the treasure map.

406
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I left it when I had memories.

407
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The treasure map.

408
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Da Si Ma.

409
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
How are you?

410
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Prince.

411
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's been ten years.

412
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You've grown up.

413
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You're as good as the old king.

414
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Thank you.

415
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm honored to be invited to visit you.

416
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I didn't expect my father to be so generous.

417
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm sorry to have to ask you to take the throne.

418
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Please forgive me.

419
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Rumor has it that

420
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
the old king is a dog.

421
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
He's been in bed for a long time.

422
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I don't know if it's true.

423
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Thank you for your concern.

424
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
My father has always been strong.

425
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Rumor has it that he's a real person.

426
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That's good.

427
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Da Si Ma.

428
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You're invited to visit me.

429
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You're the new king of Cheng.

430
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Why didn't you see me?

431
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Rumor has it that...

432
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Rumor has it that...

433
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Rumor has it that I'm not here.

434
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Father said that before he died.

435
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Say it.

436
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Say it.

437
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
My father's surname is Zhang.

438
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm ordered to be a subject of court.

439
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I'll be in charge of the court.

440
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Who will be in charge of the court?

441
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You're so generous.

442
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's a blessing for Cheng.

443
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Da Si Ma.

444
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I hope that the whole Cheng family

445
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
will be as good as you.

446
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
No need.

447
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Da Si Ma.

448
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Since the new king of Cheng is not as good as before,

449
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'll stay a few more days.

450
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
When the new king of Cheng is done with the work,

451
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
please come to see me again.

452
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Okay.

453
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Stay a few more days.

454
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The new king of Cheng is tired.

455
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Come to my country.

456
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Let's go shopping.

457
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Let's go shopping.

458
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm leaving.

459
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I said I missed you,

460
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
you said that you'd be here soon.

461
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I thought it was a joke.

462
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I didn't expect you to really be here.

463
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Of course.

464
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I did it.

465
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I did it.

466
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I did it.

467
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
How about you?

468
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Are you okay?

469
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Linger.

470
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Linger.

471
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
How long can I stay?

472
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
As long as you want.

473
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I will stay.

474
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Prince Wu is just shopping.

475
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Seems he is interested in our country.

476
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I have been sending people to observe.

477
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But I didn't find anything.

478
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
What does he want?

479
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Why didn't you go back to Wu Bo?

480
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I wanted to see the old Prince Wu.

481
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But I didn't expect this guy to come.

482
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You.

483
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You should keep an eye on him.

484
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
He is not an ordinary person.

485
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
If he takes the throne,

486
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
he will be the new king of our country.

487
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Come.

488
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's dark and windy.

489
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I should go.

490
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Let me see.

491
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It should be around here.

492
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
There is a treasure.

493
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's amazing.

494
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
What is the king doing?

495
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I don't know.

496
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Why is he here every night?

497
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I am a genius.

498
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It's dark and windy.

499
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I know you are not an ordinary girl.

500
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Don't go around.

501
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Don't let the king see you.

502
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's the biggest star on the map.

503
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
If I am not wrong,

504
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
it is the biggest treasure.

505
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Seeds?

506
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
What kind of human body is this?

507
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I am so careless.

508
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I am scared.

509
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Honey.

510
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's late.

511
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Shouldn't you go to bed?

512
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I did.

513
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But I was woken up by the noise.

514
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So I came to watch the play.

515
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Watch the play?

516
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
What play?

517
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
The monkey is fighting.

518
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
The pig is fighting.

519
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Fighting?

520
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It feels like I am being offended.

521
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Who are you?

522
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Who are you?

523
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Are you crazy?

524
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Why are you hitting me?

525
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Who are you?

526
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
What are you trying to do?

527
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I am the new maid of the palace of Chengguang.

528
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I want to protect His Majesty.

529
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Maid?

530
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Why is the maid the maid?

531
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
What are you doing?

532
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
What are you doing?

533
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Are you crazy?

534
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
What are you doing?

535
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
To protect you.

536
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Protect me?

537
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
What is it then?

538
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
What are you doing?

539
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You are my wife.

540
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You are my husband.

541
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
How could you beat me?

542
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You are my wife.

543
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Fine.

544
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Let's go.

545
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I will sit in Red Book and we will get her.

546
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
What are you doing?

547
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Shut up!

548
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Don't think I don't know

549
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
that you used the stone to kill Wang Xing

550
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You said you wanted to kill Wang Xing

551
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Why should I fight now?

552
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
If I didn't fight

553
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
you would have been close to Wang Shimo

554
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Who knows you are Wang Shimo?

555
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Stop talking nonsense!

556
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Your heart is beating faster

557
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Why?

558
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I know

559
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
The lung function is too poor

560
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and the structure is too weak

561
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Why do you say your husband is weak?

562
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Shush!

563
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Shush!

564
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
What's going on with you two?

565
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Who can explain it to me?

566
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Wang, I suspect that she is a fake maid

567
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
