00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,320
home

2
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,120
on

3
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,120
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

4
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,120
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,120
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

7
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,120
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

8
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,120
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

9
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,120
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

10
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,120
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

11
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,120
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

12
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,120
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

13
00:01:50,060 --> 00:02:13,560
Ah

14
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
I'll pay for the chair.

15
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,560
We have something to take out.

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
Long Qing, bring out the things.

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Let them see us.

18
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,560
I'm not a great man.

19
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
This place is small.

20
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
I'm afraid I can't accommodate three important guests.

21
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
There are many people on the street.

22
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
I'll take you to the restaurant.

23
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
I'll take you to another place.

24
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,560
This way, please.

25
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,560
Let's go.

26
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,560
Let go!

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Stop!

28
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Let go!

29
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,560
Let go!

30
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Let go!

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
This way.

32
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
This way.

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,560
This way, please.

34
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
Wait.

35
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,560
Let go of me!

36
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Let go of me!

37
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,720
Don't push him!

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,980
You can't do that!

39
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,560
Don't push him!

40
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,440
Don't push him!

41
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,140
Sir,

42
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,160
I have precious item!

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,140
This store is too small.

44
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,280
Please come with me.

45
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,080
Yeah.

46
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:16,460
We can

47
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:35,280
forth.

48
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
You.

49
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
It's me.

50
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Mengqi.

51
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
It's me.

52
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Mengqi.

53
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
Everyone, please sit.

54
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
Please.

55
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Everyone,

56
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
it's not urgent to buy or sell.

57
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
You are our real guests.

58
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
It's a long journey back to the mountain.

59
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
You must be tired

60
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,280
from the journey.

61
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,280
I've been through three generations

62
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
with a lamp.

63
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,280
I'm a little bit lost

64
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,280
in my own hands.

65
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,280
I wonder what you are going to do

66
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,280
when you come to my place.

67
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,280
A lamp for the ghost mountain ghost city.

68
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,280
It's a fake.

69
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
Since this gentleman

70
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,280
came for my name,

71
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,280
I'll give you a little bit of my power.

72
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,280
I'll give you a little bit of my power.

73
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,280
I'll give you a little bit of my power.

74
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
I'll give you a little bit of my power.

75
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Since you came for my name,

76
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,280
we are meant to be.

77
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
We are meant to be.

78
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Do you agree?

79
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Mengqi, let him help us open our eyes.

80
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,280
No wonder people don't take it.

81
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,280
No wonder people don't take it.

82
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,280
This wooden box is plain.

83
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,280
Plain.

84
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,280
Even if you throw it on the side of the road,

85
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,280
ordinary people won't pick it up.

86
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,280
But how do ordinary people know

87
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,280
that the real treasure

88
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,280
is actually

89
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,280
bright and beautiful.

90
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,280
I didn't expect

91
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
that I, a lamp,

92
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
would be able to see

93
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Chen's message of passing the country.

94
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Sir,

95
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,280
am I right?

96
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Yes.

97
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Where is it?

98
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Sir,

99
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,280
we came for the jade seal of Xia Nai.

100
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
We...

101
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Mengqi.

102
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,280
Sir.

103
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,280
There's poison in this.

104
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Sir.

105
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,280
I am...

106
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,280
I am the king of Chen.

107
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
This jade seal of passing the country

108
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
can save us from the fire.

109
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Please tell me.

110
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Tell us.

111
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Where is the jade seal of passing the country?

112
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Where is it?

113
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,280
You didn't pass the jade seal.

114
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,280
You came here

115
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,280
to find the jade seal of passing the country.

116
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
King of Chen.

117
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
King of Chen came here

118
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,280
to find the jade seal of passing the country.

119
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

120
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Here he comes.

121
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Groom.

122
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Groom.

123
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Groom.

124
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Groom.

125
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,280
Groom.

126
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
Groom.

127
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,280
Groom.

128
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Groom.

129
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Groom.

130
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Groom.

131
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,280
I know.

132
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,280
I know you are here.

133
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,280
If you are here,

134
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
I will go up to the ground

135
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
If you are here,

136
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
come out.

137
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Groom.

138
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,280
Actually, I did so much.

139
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
I just want to prove

140
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
that I can protect you

141
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
from now on.

142
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,280
I didn't understand

143
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
what you said to me that day.

144
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
But I know

145
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
everything you said

146
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
is good.

147
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Groom.

148
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Do you know

149
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
that you are not here

150
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,280
I really miss

151
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,280
you so much.

152
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,280
I miss you so much.

153
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Groom.

154
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Groom.

155
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,280
Groom.

156
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Groom.

157
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Groom.

158
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,280
You are really here.

159
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
I won't let you go

160
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,280
anymore.

161
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Give me back.

162
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
Don't be so useless.

163
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,280
I don't want to see you go.

164
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,280
I don't want to see you go.

165
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,280
I don't want to see you go.

166
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,280
I don't want to see you go.

167
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Can you stop being so useless?

168
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
Groom.

169
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
If you can't save me today,

170
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,280
I think we three will be here today.

171
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
Groom.

172
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
Okay, okay.

173
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Why are you still doing this?

174
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
How is this possible?

175
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
How is this possible?

176
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Welcome

177
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
to Niu Wushan.

178
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Groom. I don't understand.

179
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Why did the old phoenix

180
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,280
suddenly make you a god?

181
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
When you appeared,

182
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
he not only helped us,

183
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
but also helped us.

184
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Groom, why is this?

185
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Don't worry.

186
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Maybe that's the game setting.

187
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
But it doesn't matter.

188
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Groom, what is game setting?

189
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,280
Listen to me.

190
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,280
50 years ago,

191
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
when Niu Wushan appeared,

192
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
the city was under the help of Niu Wushan.

193
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Then Niu Wushan thought he was too good at killing.

194
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,280
So he took the most cruel

195
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,280
city border and opened the Guishan area.

196
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
So that the old soldiers could have their own places to go.

197
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
And the cost was all taken by the city.

198
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Then Niu Wushan disappeared.

199
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
This area became an outskirts because of the special location.

200
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
It slowly became like this.

201
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,280
What you said is really Niu Wushan.

202
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Can you listen to the point?

203
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Okay, wife.

204
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Wife.

205
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
As long as you come back,

206
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
I'm happy

207
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
no matter how you scold me.

208
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
I'm sorry for the poison.

209
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Please forgive me.

210
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Please forgive me.

211
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
You don't have any problem, right?

212
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
It doesn't matter.

213
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
But, senior,

214
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
how should we find the jade seal?

215
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
The jade seal

216
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
is not important.

217
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
What do you mean?

218
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Your majesty, you really want the jade seal?

219
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Then your majesty,

220
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
have you seen the jade seal?

221
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Have you seen it?

222
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
That's right.

223
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,280
The jade seal is famous all over the world.

224
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
But there are not many people

225
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280
who have seen the jade seal.

226
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
I guess your majesty

227
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
want to use the jade seal

228
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
to lure king Wu here.

229
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,280
That's right.

230
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Then I'll kill him.

231
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Then king Wu,

232
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
do you really want the jade seal?

233
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Chen Xiaohua,

234
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
don't fight.

235
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Open the gate and hand over the jade seal.

236
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
I'll spare your life.

237
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
That's right.

238
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Then it doesn't matter

239
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
if you have the jade seal.

240
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
That's good.

241
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
Senior,

242
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
you mean

243
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
we can use you as the auction house?

244
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
That's right.

245
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
Your majesty,

246
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
you killed king Wu to save the people of Chen.

247
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Of course.

248
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
But do you think you can kill king Wu

249
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,280
after you kill him?

250
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
I promise you,

251
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
I won't.

252
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,280
That's good.

253
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
I didn't expect

254
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
in the chaos,

255
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
someone

256
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
still has a lamp in his heart.

257
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
I should help.

258
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,280
I should help.

259
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,280
I feel

260
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
I'm a good person

261
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
after helping you.

262
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Let's go.

263
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
We can use this auction house

264
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,280
to release the false news

265
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
of the jade seal.

266
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
As long as he comes,

267
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
we'll kill him.

268
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
If king Wu dies,

269
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Chen's crisis will be solved.

270
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
The old man said

271
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
no one can take soldiers to the mountain.

272
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
But king Wu won't be obedient.

273
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
He'll take his trusted people.

274
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
We want to kill him,

275
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
unless we take more people.

276
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,280
What's your

277
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,280
opinion now?

278
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
What do you think?

279
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
The mountain is small.

280
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
The more people, the more people.

281
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,280
The more people.

282
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
The problem is

283
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
where do we get the soldiers?

284
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Master, king is here.

285
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Da Sima, I have an idea.

286
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,280
King came suddenly.

287
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Is there any good way

288
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,280
to solve the current situation?

289
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Your highness.

290
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Greetings, your highness.

291
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Zitang, you're here.

292
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
I have something important

293
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,280
to ask you to do.

294
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Just tell me.

295
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,280
What's so important

296
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
that you come here?

297
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,280
These days,

298
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
I've been worried

299
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
about the situation.

300
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
I was angry and went out to receive orders.

301
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
I was so angry

302
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
that I almost

303
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,280
killed the palace.

304
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
You're not in the palace these days.

305
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,280
So you went to the battlefield.

306
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Yes.

307
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
I know.

308
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Da Sima is brave and good at fighting.

309
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,280
He's a man of great power.

310
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,280
He's a man of great power.

311
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
He's a man of great power.

312
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
But look,

313
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
I'm the prime minister.

314
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
I don't even know how to use the bow.

315
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,280
Your highness came here

316
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,280
to ask for

317
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
the archery book?

318
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Yes.

319
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,280
The archery is the best.

320
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
You're the best.

321
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
I have some

322
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
good bows in my mansion.

323
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,280
I sent someone to send them to the palace.

324
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
But remember,

325
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
you must practice more.

326
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Okay.

327
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
When I come back to the palace,

328
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,280
I'll practice more.

329
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Daughter-in-law,

330
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
you heard it.

331
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
A good archer must first practice his skills.

332
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Your highness,

333
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
I think

334
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
you're a man of great power.

335
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
That's good.

336
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Okay.

337
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Okay, I'm fine.

338
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
I'll go now.

339
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
This bastard.

340
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
He just left like that?

341
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,280
So,

342
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,280
His majesty knew

343
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
something wrong with the concubine.

344
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
That's right.

345
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
But I don't know

346
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,280
when you knew about it.

347
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
When did you know?

348
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
When the city gate was broken last time.

349
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Forget it.

350
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,280
It doesn't matter.

351
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
I know it anyway.

352
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
I'll go now.

353
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
I know it anyway.

354
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,280
You scared me.

355
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,280
If we really

356
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,280
make it public,

357
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
our plan will be ruined.

358
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
But just now,

359
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,280
I think I've made it clear

360
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,280
to Da Sima.

361
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
He should understand.

362
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,280
I didn't understand

363
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,280
if I were Da Sima.

364
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
When I was leaving,

365
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,280
he wrote a word in my hand.

366
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
I think he asked us to wait for him.

367
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Wu Liang is suspicious.

368
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Even if he knew

369
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
the concubine was going to leave,

370
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
he wouldn't...

371
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
He wouldn't come in person.

372
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
If he

373
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
just asked his family to come,

374
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,280
our plan wouldn't work.

375
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280
He asked the emperor to enter the palace and hold the sword in the palace.

376
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,280
But the problem is

377
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,280
the emperor has to enter the palace.

378
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,280
So someone has to invite him.

379
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,280
I see.

380
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Zan Yi, I'll count on you this time.

381
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Go find the concubine.

382
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,280
You must pass this message to her.

383
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,280
My concubine's rare treasures

384
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,280
are countless.

385
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,280
I'll give them to your wife.

386
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
I'm an assassin from Wu.

387
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Assassin from Wu?

388
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Do you know this is my court?

389
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
If I say a word,

390
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
you're dead.

391
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280
I told you before,

392
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,280
I had to find you.

393
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,280
I didn't want you to get involved in this.

394
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,280
But it was an emergency.

395
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
I couldn't pass the message to you.

396
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,280
I had to find you.

397
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,280
You're in such a hurry.

398
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,280
Tell me.

399
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
My concubine, it's a royal jade seal.

400
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
The king of Chen found the seal.

401
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,280
He wants to sell it

402
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
and run away.

403
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,280
My brother

404
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
is selling the seal for him.

405
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,280
How is that possible?

406
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,280
I don't know.

407
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
Maybe he wants to

408
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
borrow some soldiers from the Grand Minister's horse.

409
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
After all, the mountain is dangerous.

410
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,280
The seal is precious.

411
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
The king said

412
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
the seal is the most important thing.

413
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,280
He also told us to report it

414
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,280
as soon as we have any clues.

415
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
Your king

416
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
cares about the seal.

417
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
But since the war started,

418
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
my superior has disappeared.

419
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
If anything happens to the country,

420
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,280
report it to me immediately.

421
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
How is it?

422
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
I've said it.

423
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,280
But I'm not sure if the Grand Consort will do as we want.

424
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
I hope she will.

425
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,280
The Grand Minister's horse is here.

426
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,280
Let's go.

427
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
The soldiers are waiting outside.

428
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
I guess I'm not wrong.

429
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Let's go.

430
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
Grand Minister's horse,

431
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,280
what did I say?

432
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,280
You really understood?

433
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,280
I've heard about Lian'er.

434
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
It's not convenient for Shangwu to be here.

435
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,280
I understand.

436
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,280
The bow is strong.

437
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,280
The sword is long.

438
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
The horse is the first to be captured by the enemy.

439
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
The king's strategy

440
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
is to capture the king.

441
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,280
Right?

442
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,280
You're really something.

443
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Grand Minister's horse,

444
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,280
tomorrow,

445
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,280
the old court will host the meeting in the middle.

446
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
All forces will be here.

447
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,280
You will pretend to be the merchant

448
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,280
and stay here.

449
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,280
The other side is Wu Heng.

450
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,280
The old court said

451
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Chu Yue might be here.

452
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
I've prepared

453
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,280
50 soldiers.

454
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
They are all under the secret guard.

455
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,280
I'm going to divide the 50 soldiers into two teams.

456
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,280
The first team is in the field.

457
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,280
The first team is the second team.

458
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
The second team is the third team.

459
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
The one who sends the message

460
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,280
will be the old court's men.

461
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,280
Wang and Xiao'er,

462
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
you two will be on the second floor.

463
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
The second team will be

464
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
Longqi and Caiyi.

465
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,280
When the meeting starts,

466
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
you must tell the old court

467
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,280
to clear all the members.

468
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
If the members are outside,

469
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,280
you will be the ones to be killed.

470
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,280
After the appearance of the Crown Prince,

471
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,280
the old court will

472
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,280
continue the normal auction process

473
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,280
to remove his alertness.

474
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,280
After the identity of the Crown Prince is confirmed,

475
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
we will act as we please.

476
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
Just listen to me.

477
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,280
We will come down

478
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
and kill him.

479
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
The plan of the Grand Minister is complete.

480
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
I have one more concern.

481
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Chu Yue's forces

482
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
will not come alone.

483
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
If their own forces are all on the street,

484
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
how can we

485
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
join the forces at the same time?

486
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,280
So I suggest

487
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
to get rid of the rest of the forces

488
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,280
and kill them all.

489
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,280
This requires the old court

490
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
to be strict during the auction.

491
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,280
Not to act as soon as we see King Wu.

492
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
And to make sure our plan goes smoothly.

493
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,280
But I don't think

494
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
it's enough to be perfect.

495
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,280
You are from Wu.

496
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,280
You should know more about King Wu.

497
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,280
No. I was 14 years old.

498
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,280
I only saw King Wu once.

499
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
I don't know much about him.

500
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,280
But I personally think

501
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Chu Yue's plan is very thorough.

502
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,280
But once the plan starts,

503
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,280
there will be various situations.

504
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
Instead of fighting him,

505
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,280
we should kill him.

506
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Since the old court can't poison us,

507
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
why can't we poison King Wu?

508
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,280
Everyone is right.

509
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Wife, what do you think?

510
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
I think three push-ups

511
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,280
are not conflicted.

512
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
They are one-off.

513
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Especially for the one who gets the first one.

514
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
If he gets the first one, he will be the least likely to die.

515
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,280
That's right.

516
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,280
I think you are right.

517
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
That's it.

518
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,280
We have a lot of business.

519
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
But we still have

520
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
a little bit.

521
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
I am sorry.

522
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Wife,

523
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
you are thinking too much.

524
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,280
I want to say

525
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,280
from now on,

526
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,280
I can't help you anymore.

527
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Can you understand me?

528
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,280
I can understand

529
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
whatever the reason is.

530
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Because as long as you are by my side,

531
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
that's enough.

532
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
From now on,

533
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,280
I will protect you.

534
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,280
I am thinking,

535
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,280
the people in the city

536
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
should have already gone to sleep.

537
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
I have seen them

538
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,280
face the difficulties.

539
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
So this time,

540
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,280
I can't lose.

541
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
I believe you.

542
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
I believe you.

543
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
I believe you.

544
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,280
I believe you.

545
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,280
I believe you.

546
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,280
I believe you.

547
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Really?

548
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,280
I am not born

549
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
to be a fool.

550
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,280
You always say

551
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,280
you are the chosen one.

552
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
I don't have anything in my heart.

553
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
What is there to say?

554
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
Do you understand?

555
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,280
People who can do things

556
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
are destined to suffer.

557
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
You have to believe that you can do it.

558
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,280
The so-called fate is just an excuse for the weak.

559
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Your fate is in your own hands.

560
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
I believe you.

561
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,280
I believe you.

562
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
I believe you.

563
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,280
I believe you.

564
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,280
I believe you.

565
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
I believe you.

566
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
I believe you.

567
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
I believe you.

568
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
I believe you.

569
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
I believe you.

570
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
I believe you.

571
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,280
I believe you.

572
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
I believe you.

573
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
I believe you.

574
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,280
I believe you.

575
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,280
I believe you.

576
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
I believe you.

577
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
I believe you.

578
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,280
I believe you.

579
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
I believe you.

580
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
I believe you.

581
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,280
I believe you.

582
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
I believe you.

583
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
I believe you.

584
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
I believe you.

585
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,280
I believe you.

586
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,280
I believe you.

587
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,280
I believe you.

588
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:36,280
Being impulsive is happiness.

589
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,280
Your smile hasn't appeared recently.

590
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:50,280
How I wish you were there in the clear picture.

591
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,280
The way you and I exist and the story of the past

592
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:04,280
is not far for you.

593
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:10,280
I'm willing to enjoy every day with you.

594
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:18,280
I imagine we have many, many tomorrows.

595
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:26,280
I'm used to the wind you gave me for so many years.

596
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,280
What is the end of the world?

597
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:38,280
I'm willing to accompany you in this world.

598
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:44,280
I wish you could walk with me until the end.

599
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Even if we meet again, give me ten thousand choices.

600
00:30:52,280 --> 00:31:00,280
Or should I be buried with my head held high?
