00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,040
Don't run.

Caiying.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,760
Go prepare some green grass and apples.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,600
Yes.

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,840
When did Duofu steal it?

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:48,920

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,040
Yes.

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,840
So,

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,920
you predicted that there would be a box on the roof.

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,120
Not predicted.

17
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,560
It was in my previous life.

18
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,320
When I was about to hang myself,

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,760
you lifted me up.

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,760
And you knocked me down again.

21
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:32,840
I don't understand.

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,080
But why did you kill yourself?

23
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,120
It's hard to explain.

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,120
I was so talented.

25
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,280
I...

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,520
I was in a dark place.

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,440
I never felt anything.

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,960
So there's a mole in the box.

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,960
A mole?

30
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,680
A poisonous needle.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,520
A poisonous needle?

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,040
What should we do?

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,640
What do you think?

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,600
I see.

35
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:02,840
I'll open it.

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,080
Please.

The fake is real, the real is fake.

42

The ghost shadow of the mountain returns, the light is dark.

The fake is real, the real is fake.

The ghost shadow of the mountain returns.

45
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,120
That's right.

46
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,480
No.

47
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,640
We've been struggling for a long time.

48
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,240
The light is so bright.

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,560
In my opinion,

50
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,080
it's like the real King's Avatar.

Your secret book...

53
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,760
It's so dark.

I think these two riddles

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,720
shouldn't be so simple.

63

I think I've seen this before.

66
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,560
But I can't remember it.

67
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,000
My dear wife.

68
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,240
Since you can't remember it,

69
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,560
I'll keep it for you.

70
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,280
I'll be here when you remember it.

71
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,520

72
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,560
The real one is too hot.

73
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,080
The real one is too hot.

74
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,480
Why is it shaking again?

75
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,480
It's about to smoke.

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,600
Hurry up and fan it.

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,280
Or it'll get burnt.

78
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,840

No.

82
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,920
He didn't have me before.

83
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,880
This girl.

84
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,160
She beat me, beat me, scolded me, and even tolerated me.

85
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,320
But

86
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,000
she's my pet.

87
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,960
She even stole my treasure.

88
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,600
This woman is too cruel.

89
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,160
She's a man.

90
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,680
She can't be tolerated.

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,360
She can't be tolerated.

92
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,160
If it's really the treasure that the King left for the descendants,

93
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,080
we must take it back.

94
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,440
That's right.

95
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,960
Take it back.

96
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,240
King, please tell me.

97
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,600
How to take it back?

98
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,320
We can't beat her.

99
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,200
Then we'll use the first move.

128
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
Do you want to play or not?

129
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Play.

130
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Of course.

131
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
From such a long distance,

132
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,840
even if she can use the move,

133
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,840

143
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
The window is closed.

145
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840

146
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Her figure

149
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
looks like she's sitting in front of the dressing table.

150
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840

152
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840

shoot her with a sword.

160

You've thought it through.

161
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840

162
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Mrs. Xiao is your favorite woman

163
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840

169
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
She's changed.

170
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
She's changed.

171
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840

176
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
on my side.

177
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
She's forcing me to do this

178
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
and forcing me to do that.

179
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Drink.

180
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
She's even

181
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
a big mouth

182
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
and a big mouth

183
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
to beat me up.

184
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Sorry.

185
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
I'm a big mouth.

186
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Stop talking nonsense.

187
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
I'll really do it.

188
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
I'll really do it.

189
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
No one can take this sword

190
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
from me.

191
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
No one can take this sword from me.

192
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Do it.

193
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Do it.

194
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Is there such a swordplay?

195
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Is there such a swordplay?

196
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Is there such a swordplay?

197
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
A person who's always on my side

198
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
is kind and kind.

199
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
He's gentle and cute.

200
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
He's only useful for 12 hours.

201
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
He's only useful for 12 hours.

202
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
He's a good wife and a good mother.

203
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
He only knows how to play swordplay.

204
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
He doesn't know how to play the swordplay.

205
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Then,

206
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
is there a kind of learning?

207
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
A person who's always on my side

208
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
can hurt his head

209
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
and make him lose his mind.

210
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
He can hurt his head

211
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
and make him lose his mind.

212
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
Isn't this

213
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
a special skill?

214
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
You've changed too.

215
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
You've changed too.

216
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
How about this?

217
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
How about this?

218
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Use the sword to scare him.

219
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Use the sword to scare him.

220
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Let him hand over the bamboo slice in his hand.

221
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Let him hand over the bamboo slice in his hand.

222
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Deal.

223
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Deal.

224
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
It's that bad?

225
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
You really hit me, didn't you?

226
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
You really hit me, didn't you?

227
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
You shouldn't...

228
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
You shouldn't...

229
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Let's go.

230
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Let's go.

231
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Let's go and have a look.

232
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Madam.

233
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Madam.

234
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
What's wrong?

235
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Madam.

236
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Let go.

237
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Okay.

238
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
You're good at it.

239
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Thank you for your compliment.

240
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
There's a trap.

241
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
There's a trap.

242
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
He's a monster indeed.

243
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
He's a monster indeed.

244
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
He's a monster indeed.

245
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
He's a monster indeed.

246
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Don't be soft-hearted.

247
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
If we don't kill him,

248
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
If we don't kill him,

249
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
there will be a big trouble for Chen State.

250
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
There will be a big trouble for Chen State.

251
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
You're right.

252
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
You're right.

253
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
I think...

254
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
I think...

255
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
I think...

256
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
What kind of comfort is this?

257
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
What kind of comfort is this?

258
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
I...

259
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,840
You're playing chess at this late hour?

260
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
You're here to get the bamboo chips?

261
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
No, no, no.

262
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
Madam.

263
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
I don't want a man to bully his wife.

264
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
I don't want a man to bully his wife.

265
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
I won't forgive this

266
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
ungrateful man.

267
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
I won't forgive this

268
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
You're not a sister.

269
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
You're not a sister.

270
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Who are you?

271
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
What does it have to do with you

272
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
that we're fighting?

273
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
What does it have to do with you

274
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
that we're fighting?

275
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Do you think my wife will be bullied by you

276
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
and do those things to bully her husband?

277
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
I will.

278
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Long Qi.

279
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
Long Qi.

280
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
This way.

281
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
It doesn't seem right.

282
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Put me down.

283
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Let's run.

284
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
The more you run, the more you have to run.

285
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
You're looking for Long Qi.

286
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
The rumor is true.

287
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
The rumor is true.

288
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Our King likes this.

289
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Our King likes this.

290
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
This is too exciting.

291
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Damn it.

292
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Zhang Xian'er has done

293
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
what I've always wanted to do.

294
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
This...

295
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
Should we save her?

296
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Can you do the firecracker?

297
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
I can't.

298
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
You can't?

299
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
That's good.

300
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
You can't kill her anyway.

301
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Don't you think

302
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,840
it's great to beat your husband?

303
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
Yes.

304
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
It's great.

305
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Are you going to attack?

306
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
No.

307
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
No.

308
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
No.

309
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Calm down.

310
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
No.

311
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
How is it?

312
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,840
Does it hurt your mind?

313
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
You're walking on the horse and looking at the flowers.

314
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
You're turning into ashes.

315
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
You're turning into ashes.

316
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
You're turning into ashes.

317
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
You can hit me.

318
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
You can hit me.

319
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
You can hit me.

320
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
You can hit me.

321
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
I can hit you.

322
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
I've been here before.

323
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
I'm so angry.

324
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,840
Why do you always want to take some money

325
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
to escape from this palace

326
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,840
and not want to be a good king

327
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
with a strong will?

328
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
You really want to know?

329
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
Then I'll tell you.

330
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
I've been a big man since I was a kid.

331
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
I can't eat well.

332
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
I can't wear warm clothes.

333
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
Since I became a king,

334
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
someone wanted to poison me.

335
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
Someone wanted to assassinate me.

336
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
I would have died sooner or later.

337
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
I just want to take some money

338
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
to leave this place

339
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
I've never left before.

340
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Am I wrong?

341
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
No one cares about my feelings anyway.

342
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
I don't want to be the king.

343
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
I don't want to be manipulated.

344
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
I want to be myself.

345
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
I want to be myself.

346
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
I care about you.

347
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
You mean...

348
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
You care about me?

349
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
You care about me?

350
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
What do you mean?

351
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
What?

352
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Others may not be here.

353
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
But I'm here.

354
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
The only purpose I exist

355
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
is to let you

356
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
be a man who can stand God and the Earth.

357
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
A man who is famous

358
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
and have the courage

359
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:57,080
What... What is my mission?

360
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,880
Your mission is to defeat the Wu State

361
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,680
and make the state of Chen a peaceful and prosperous state.

362
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,280
Do you understand?

363
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
Alliance with Chinese Medicine

364
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,440
Long Qing.

365
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,040
Come out!

366
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,320
Father!

367
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,880
Long Qing.

368
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,120
Long Qing.

369
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,360
Long Qing.

370
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,880
Wang.

371
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,120
Choose one.

372
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,880
I'll apply the medicine for you.

373
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,520
Or you can use the whip to hit me.

374
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,040
Is there a possibility

375
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,520
that you apply the medicine for me first

376
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,680
and then I'll use the whip to hit you?

377
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,200
Do you want me to

378
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
to give you a massage?

379
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,680
No.

380
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,120
No need.

381
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,720
I'm not done yet.

382
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,920
What if he enjoys it

383
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,360
and we go in without permission?

384
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,240
Wang,

385
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,320
be patient.

386
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,880
Long Qing,

387
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,520
tell me

388
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,880
if I was hit by a whip.

389
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,600
Wang,

390
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,400
there's a place where you can't be wrong.

391
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,000
It's really hard to tell.

392
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,040
Ask that Dr. Wang

393
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,640
and let him investigate his court rules.

394
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,840
How can I punish this man?

395
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,080
I don't think

396
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,640
it's necessary.

397
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,360
Dr. Wang is old.

398
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,440
He can't stand a few whips.

399
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,400
No.

400
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,800
I won't report this.

401
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,200
You're a coward.

402
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,280
Long Qing,

403
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,120
what else can you do?

404
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,360
I'll kill him.

405
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,320
But why do we have to kill him?

406
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,720
He's Wang's concubine.

407
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,200
Why do we have to kill him?

408
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,120
Tell me.

409
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,320
We kill him

410
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,200
for the bamboo slice, right?

411
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,760
Bamboo slice?

412
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,240
You're smart.

413
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,560
Bamboo slice.

414
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,760
His Majesty has a long sword.

415
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,880
He wants to kill me.

416
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,640
So you want his sword to kill you.

417
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,360
A king who wants to kill his own concubine.

418
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,560
Your Chen's achievements

419
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,800
are really extraordinary.

420
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,800
With this stupid king,

421
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,320
we can't be a king for long.

422
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,120
But, Your Highness,

423
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,800
we've been working all night

424
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,320
on this bamboo slice.

425
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,920
What is it for?

426
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,480
Do you know what's

427
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,200
behind the words on this bamboo slice?

428
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,000
What?

429
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,120
To spread the country's good fortune.

430
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,480
Spread the country's good fortune?

431
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,920
So I said

432
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,760
His Majesty has a long sword.

433
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,440
I've underestimated him.

434
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,080
Do you want it?

435
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,200
What does it say?

436
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,880
The life is in the heaven,

437
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,280
and the soul is in the river.

438
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,600
Spreading the country's good fortune

439
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,920
is the destiny of the heaven.

440
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,800
It's the blessing of the king of the past.

441
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,440
It's said that

442
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,480
the one who spreads the country's good fortune

443
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,080
will have the world.

444
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,040
If the one who spreads the country's good fortune

445
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,440
is dead, he will be dead.

446
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,760
It's a legend.

447
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,360
Who doesn't want it?

448
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,320
If you want it,

449
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,600
take it.

450
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,560
If you want it, take it.

451
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,840
I don't want it.

452
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,120
If you don't want it,

453
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,120
your Prince Wu won't want it either.

454
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,920
Of course I want it.

455
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,920
But can this little bamboo slice

456
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,880
really spread the country's good fortune?

457
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,200
If you really don't want it,

458
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,880
take it

459
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,120
and give it to Shen Xiaohua.

460
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Then you're not afraid that I'll run away with the bamboo slice?

461
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,840
You won't.

462
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,600
Don't you also want to see

463
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,520
if this stupid king

464
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,240
can finally find the one who spreads the country's good fortune?

465
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Test me?

466
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,640
Go.

467
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,240
Go to the hospital before you leave.

468
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,000
Get him two pairs of gold bandages.

469
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,000
Yes.

470
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,000
Get in.

471
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,200
Father.

472
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,920
This is news from the palace.

473
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,440
The king found something on the breakfast.

474
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,480
What's that?

475
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,440
A bamboo slice.

476
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,520
There's a rumor that

477
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,960
it's related to the jade seal

478
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
that Prince Wu lost.

479
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,800
Jade seal?

480
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,280
What's the meaning?

481
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,500
Lord下來

482
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,840
How could I have thought that the imperial jade seal wasn't in the hands of the Chen's royal family?

483
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,400
Maybe,

484
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,160
he didn't know which king he lost to.

485
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,840
Moreover,

486
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,240
what's the use of a jade seal?

487
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,960
The army will soon be able to break through the state.

488
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,800
What can a jade seal be used for?

489
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,520
My brother wants it.

490
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,800
The royal family also wants it.

491
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,560
If you ask me,

492
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,240
Sister Zhang shouldn't have worked for the Chen's royal family.

493
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,800
He should have gone to the Chen's royal family.

494
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,880
Your Highness, you are being too harsh.

495
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,640
What harsh?

496
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,040
I married an old man in my youth.

497
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,000
I finally got him killed.

498
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,040
I can't do anything about it.

499
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,280
Look.

500
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,280
This palace doesn't even have a foundation.

501
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,400
So boring.

502
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,240
A woman who is just a woman,

503
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,440
is lonely too.

504
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Enough.

505
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,920
Let's fire her.

506
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,040
Let's send the message to the Prince of Wu.

507
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,120
Sister, we can't let that evil consort be so arrogant anymore.

508
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,240
You didn't see it.

509
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,840
She doesn't even care about the king.

510
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,640
What are you panicking about?

511
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
Can you not be panicking?

512
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,000
She even left after the Prince of Chen said so.

513
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,600
She won't be able to kill us sisters in the future.

514
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,040
Then tell me,

515
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,600
what do you want to do?

516
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,400
Can we defeat that evil consort?

517
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,600
We can't just sit and wait.

518
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,000
Who said we can sit and wait?

519
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,400
You forgot what uncle told us before.

520
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
No matter how arrogant Madam Xiao is,

521
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
as long as we have the children to help us,

522
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
she can't touch us.

523
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,200
I spent a lot of money to get this medicine from the Western Regions.

524
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,800
It's a spell.

525
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,200
No matter how strong Chen Xiaohua is,

526
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,000
she has to defeat us sisters.

527
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,200
But I'm not ready yet.

528
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,800
I'm ready.

529
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,400
It's a matter of the heart.

530
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,200
I'll go first.

531
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,600
Okay?

532
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Your Majesty, why are you so badly injured?

533
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Don't worry.

534
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,400
Your Majesty is the king of a country.

535
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Your body is precious.

536
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,200
Of course you should be careful.

537
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,000
Your Majesty, I'll find another imperial physician to check on you.

538
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's too troublesome.

539
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,800
There's no need.

540
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,200
I spent a lot of money to get a pot of medicine for Your Majesty.

541
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,400
I'm going to make a special medicine for you.

542
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
You must take it.

543
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,400
Greetings, Your Majesty.

544
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,800
Greetings, Madam Zhen and Madam Bao.

545
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Did Madam Xiao call you here?

546
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,200
Put it down.

547
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,000
Tell your wife that tonight,

548
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll serve you and Madam Bao.

549
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Your Majesty, Madam said

550
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,800
I must watch you finish this medicine.

551
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
How dare you!

552
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
You're a bitch.

553
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
How dare you order His Majesty?

554
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,600
Get lost!

555
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,000
Sister,

556
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,800
is it too much?

557
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It seems so.

558
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,800
This bottle is ten times as much.

559
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,200
Your Majesty, come with me.

560
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,600
Qiu Qiu.

561
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Qiu Qiu.

562
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Qiu Qiu.

563
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Qiu Qiu.

564
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,800
Qiu Qiu, what are you doing?

565
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,600
Qiu...

566
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,600
Qiu...

567
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Are you asleep?

568
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
You're asleep.

569
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,800
Qiu Qiu,

570
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,800
I'm poisoned.

571
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
I should die.

572
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,600
But before I'm reborn,

573
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,400
I have to tell you something.

574
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,600
Because I'm afraid that

575
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,800
after I'm reborn,

576
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,200
there are many things

577
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
that you don't remember.

578
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Actually,

579
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,400
since the first time I saw you,

580
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,400
forget it.

581
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,000
I can't live anyway.

582
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,200
I can't complete your special training.

583
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Look.

584
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,000
Look.

585
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
In this net hall,

586
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,200
I'm reborn again and again.

587
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,000
To me,

588
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,200
it's a cage.

589
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,600
I can't get out of it

590
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,800
no matter how many times I try.

591
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,200
But

592
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,800
before I die,

593
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,400
I want to

594
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,000
let go.

595
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,200
I don't care if you're awake,

596
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,400
or if you hit me,

597
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
or if you scold me.

598
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
I've admitted it.

599
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,600
Do you know?

600
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,800
This place

601
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,200
is my favorite place.

602
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Because this place

603
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,800
is the highest place in the whole imperial city.

604
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,800
And it's also the most familiar place.

605
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm sorry.

606
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I...

607
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm sorry.

608
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm sorry.

609
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,600
I'm sorry.

610
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Actually, I

611
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,600
don't want to be the emperor.

612
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,600
I've always wanted to be

613
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,600
an old farmer who grows flowers and grass.

614
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,600
But what's the use?

615
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,600
I can't change all of this.

616
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,600
I'm not the one who decides everything.

617
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,000
Actually, I don't want to kill you.

618
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,800
I don't want to fight with you.

619
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,200
Instead,

620
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,200
it's your appearance

621
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,000
that makes me discover

622
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,600
the fun of being a human.

623
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
I hope you can be by my side

624
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,600
in the next life.

625
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Episode 3

626
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,600
According to the examination,

627
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,200
the patient has had

628
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,400
a chronic radiation syndrome.

629
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,600
His brain nerves are seriously damaged.

630
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,000
We can't find a effective treatment.

631
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,600
What if I can use some way

632
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,400
to stop his brain from shrinking

633
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,200
and restore his brain nerves?

634
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,600
Will he be saved?

635
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,000
Yes. But it's impossible to restore his brain nerves.

636
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,600
So you'd better prepare for his funeral.

637
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,600
My boyfriend had an accident.

638
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,600
He's facing an irreversible brain tumor.

639
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,600
If this continues,

640
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,600
he won't have much time.

641
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
I'm thinking that

642
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
your experiment

643
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,600
will be a great success.

644
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
I'm sure

645
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
your experiment

646
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
can help him.

647
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Help him wake up.

648
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,560
The

649
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,600
As long as he follows the pre-determined version,

650
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
I'm sure

651
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
his brain nerves will be restored.

652
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
The time has come.

653
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Let's see it together.

654
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,600
All data has been uploaded.

655
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,600
He has successfully entered the game.

656
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Ye Hao0001 player Chen Xiaohua,

657
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,600
welcome to the blue brain technology virtual universe.

658
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Who's talking to me?

659
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Where's Tao Zi?

660
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Where am I?

661
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Please select your destination.

662
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Please select your role in the virtual world.

663
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
What role?

664
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
You're part of the interview.

665
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Please select your role in the virtual world.

666
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
You want me to choose?

667
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
That's embarrassing.

668
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
I'm not going to choose.

669
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
What can you do?

670
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,600
According to the calculation,

671
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,600
you can die.

672
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Who are you scaring?

673
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,600
I was scared when I was a kid.

674
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Wait.

675
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
I think Xiao Yong is good at fighting.

676
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
He's good at archery.

677
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,600
He can also kill enemies.

678
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
He He, check the target.

679
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
I should respond.

680
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
It shows that the target is dead.

681
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
He He He He.

682
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
According to the system identification,

683
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,600
you chose the king of the country.

684
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Friendship hint.

685
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
After entering that world,

686
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,600
everyone will lose the chance to see the real world.

687
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:53,600
The feeling of being in love is happiness.

688
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Your smile hasn't appeared recently.

689
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:07,600
How I wish you were there in the clear scene.

690
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:14,600
The way you and I exist and the lost stories.

691
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:20,600
To you, it's not far-fetched.

692
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:27,600
I'm willing to enjoy every day with you.

693
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:34,600
I imagine we have many, many tomorrows.

694
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:41,600
I'm used to the gifts you gave me.

695
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,600
I take the opportunity to reach the end.

696
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,600
I'm willing to accompany you in your world.

697
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:01,600
I wish you would walk with me to the end one day.

698
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,600
Even if we meet again,

699
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,600
give me ten thousand choices.

700
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Or do I have to take all the blame?
