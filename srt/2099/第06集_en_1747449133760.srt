00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,000
It hasn't rained for months.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,320
The land is dry and the grains are unripe.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,440
The most urgent thing is

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,160
to read the most urgent edict.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,000
The wolf-slaying horse is so ambitious.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,040
Drag him out.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,840
Kill him.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,120
I dare not.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,680
I'll beat him to death.

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,840
I'll kill him.

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,120
Then the king

13
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,480
will be their master.

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,920
Anyway, the wolf-slaying horse

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,120
is a man who can protect the heaven

16
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,840
and the king of the country.

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,760
In my opinion,

18
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,280
Zhang Jin should not have

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,400
served the country.

20
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,000
He should have died long ago.

21
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,840
Chen Xiaofan is not worthy of the throne.

22
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,680
The shame of the country

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,960
should be over.

24
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
After three days,

25
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,360
Wang Changhui will pray to the temple.

26
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,320
I need you to do it today.

27
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,800
Kill that wolf-slayer in the middle.

28
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,960
At that time,

29
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,120
he still wanted a bunch of

30
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,120
rags on the government's land.

31
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
Zhang Jinrong

32
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,280
can only die.

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360

The wolf-slayer is dead.

53
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
The wolf-slayer is dead.

54
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
The wolf-slayer is dead.

55
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
The wolf-slayer is dead.

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000

The wolf-slayer is dead.

73
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,160
Your Majesty, are you all right?

74
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Three days have passed.

75
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,080
I came to change your clothes.

76
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,840
We should go to the top of the mountain

77
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,200
to pray for the rain.

78
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,840
Long Qing, how are you?

79
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm fine.

80
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,640
But my butt still hurts.

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,360
Forget it.

82
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,760
Don't go today.

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,160
Take a rest here.

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,600
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

85
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,240
Someone will heal him.

86
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,760
Let's go.

87
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
The mountain is covered with snow.

88
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
The mountain is covered with snow.

89
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
The mountain is covered with snow.

90
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
The mountain is covered with snow.

91
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
The mountain is covered with snow.

92
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
The mountain is covered with snow.

93
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
The mountain is covered with snow.

94
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
The mountain is covered with snow.

95
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,880
The mountain is covered with snow.

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The mountain is covered with snow.

97
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
The mountain is covered with snow.

98
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
The mountain is covered with snow.

99
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
The mountain is covered with snow.

100
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
The mountain is covered with snow.

101
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
The mountain is covered with snow.

102
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
The mountain is covered with snow.

103
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
The mountain is covered with snow.

104
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
The mountain is covered with snow.

105
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
The mountain is covered with snow.

106
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
The mountain is covered with snow.

107
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
The mountain is covered with snow.

108
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
The mountain is covered with snow.

109
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
The mountain is covered with snow.

110
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
The mountain is covered with snow.

111
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,660
Hmmm.

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,720
Wang Longqi.

113
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,440
He hasn't fully recovered yet

114
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,440
atphone shop.

115
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,880
You go to him.

116
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,880
My lady,

117
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,840
I skipped this part for review hours.

118
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,440
I know you are concerned about him.

119
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,840
Later there is no need to go to the scene.

120
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,360
People eat after hanging by finally.

121
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,440
Just sleep after hanging after.

122
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,960
and have a thought in your mind,

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,280
then go and realize it.

124
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,640
I know you care about Long Qi now.

125
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,040
Go and take care of her.

126
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,200
I don't have a wife. I just...

127
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,720
Get lost.

128
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,360
Okay.

129
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,840
Chen Xiaohua.

130
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,520
Today is very important.

131
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,080
Today, as the ruler of a country,

132
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,320
you face your people for the first time.

133
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,760
If you really forget

134
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,080
how to read the words on the drunkard's photo,

135
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,160
just express it

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,360
sincerely as you want.

137
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,800
Is it really okay?

138
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,400
What if I forget everything?

139
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,560
Then just wait here.

140
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,680
You're so unlucky.

141
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,480
Why are you looking at me?

142
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,920
You're the first woman

143
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,040
who organized my clothes

144
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,960
except for my mom.

145
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,840
There were so many maids in the court.

146
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,400
They didn't help you

147
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,440
to organize your clothes.

148
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,280
Where are the maids from?

149
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,760
They're all eunuchs.

150
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,000
And it's strange.

151
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,080
I forgot

152
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,040
what my mother looked like.

153
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,840
Then let's talk about it first.

154
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,360
Okay.

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What about the late king?

156
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
I don't remember.

157
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
He was a son of a nun.

158
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,360
What about you?

159
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,640
You're all

160
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,200
eunuchs.

161
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,640
What did your parents look like?

162
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,880
No parents.

163
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,000
Impossible.

164
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,760
The Grand Tutor said

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,360
that the body is fat and the body is fat.

166
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,080
Even the three-year-old children know it.

167
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,960
The Grand Tutor may not be right.

168
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,600
What do you mean?

169
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
You're the king.

170
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,320
You should have your own judgment.

171
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,280
Don't just say what you want.

172
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,760
They're all here to assist you.

173
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,120
They're not here to help you.

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,560
They'll harm you sooner or later.

175
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,320
The Grand Tutor won't harm me.

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
He's my teacher.

177
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,320
How can a teacher harm his students?

178
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,400
In this world,

179
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,400
the only one you can trust

180
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,840
is yourself.

181
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,880
What about you?

182
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
I mean them.

183
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,400
You're right.

184
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,120
By the way,

185
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,840
I have one last question.

186
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,840
Go ahead.

187
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,200
You're a power generator, right?

188
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,560
Can you

189
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,760
speak in the rain today?

190
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,360
No.

191
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,200
In the rain?

192
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
I'm a robot.

193
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,840
Robots are not all-round.

194
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,760
It's not within my capacity.

195
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,080
All right.

196
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,360
It seems that

197
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,280
I have to depend on myself today.

198
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,320
Come on.

199
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,600
Listen to me.

200
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,920
If I hadn't been in pain,

201
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,160
I wouldn't have let you

202
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,320
take the medicine from Lihua Hall.

203
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,880
Listen to me.

204
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,720
If I hadn't...

205
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,000
My butt hurts.

206
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
You're rude.

207
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,120
If my butt hurts,

208
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,520
I wouldn't have let you, the assassin,

209
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,840
live until today.

210
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,240
What are you doing?

211
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm giving you a chance.

212
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,560
Repeat what you said.

213
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,680
If there's one word

214
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,160
that makes me feel unsatisfied,

215
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,440
I'll make you and your butt

216
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,360
all rotten.

217
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,560
I...

218
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,160
One word.

219
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,360
I...

220
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,640
Two words.

221
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,200
What do you want to hear?

222
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,720
Praise me for being beautiful.

223
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,520
What?

224
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,200
Praise me for being beautiful.

225
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
It's hard to understand.

226
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,640
I...

227
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,240
I think you're beautiful.

228
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,240
When did you start to think so?

229
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,280
Since

230
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,160
you wanted to throw the stone to the wall.

231
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,680
Since then, I've started to think I'm beautiful.

232
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,320
You should stop thinking.

233
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,080
You just realized!

234
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,160
Why don't you speak?

235
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,560
Forget it.

236
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,560
Let me and my butt rot there.

237
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
Slow down.

238
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,240
Be gentle.

239
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,080
支持我皮筋

240
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,880
I'm not taking it off.

241
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,960
I told you to take it off.

242
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,280
I won't take it off even if you beat me to death.

243
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,480
Your pants are stuck to the ground.

244
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,360
Bear with it.

245
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,640
Let's just forget about it.

246
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,360
No, you have to take care of it.

247
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,160
You got beaten so many times

248
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,120
at the Fengxian Shop that day

249
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,440
and you didn't make a sound.

250
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,680
You're quite a man.

251
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
A real man.

252
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,640
What are you doing?

253
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
You lie down here.

254
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,800
You...

255
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,600
I'll fetch some water

256
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,760
to clean your wound.

257
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,640
Wait here.

258
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,840
No, you...

259
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,480
Lie down.

260
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,240
You can turn around if you want.

261
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,120
Your Highness,

262
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,440
it's all ready.

263
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,520
Let's go.

264
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,600
He can read this kind of book.

265
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,320
Your Highness,

266
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,600
there's nothing here.

267
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,680
A fool

268
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,040
who doesn't know anything

269
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,360
can hide his treasure there.

270
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,040
Your Highness,

271
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,240
how about

272
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,880
we go over there and have a look?

273
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,040
Your Highness,

274
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
we didn't find it.

275
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,360
Your Highness.

276
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,360
Your Highness.

277
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,480
Your Highness, look.

278
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,080
There's a secret compartment there.

279
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,400
Hawaiian.

280
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:29,440
The

281
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,440
It's probably a key clue to the imperial jade seal.

282
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,240
Your Highness,

283
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,440
are you sure you won't take the bamboo leaf?

284
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,240
Just send the secret message of the bamboo leaf.

285
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,040
But I don't think we can find the jade seal.

286
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,240
Today, at the fengshan qiyu scene,

287
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,240
Chen Xiaohua wanted to read the result of the most popular poem.

288
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,040
If you can't satisfy him,

289
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,240
he and your consort

290
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,640
will both die.

291
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,640
Your Highness,

292
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,240
Lord Zhang is right.

293
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,640
We can't tell him before it happens.

294
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,840
Otherwise, things will be...

295
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,640
What are you afraid of?

296
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,240
Now that it's come to this,

297
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,240
even if the immortals of the big tower come,

298
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,840
there's no chance of turning back.

299
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,040
The Great Sima's Rebellion

300
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
I don't quite understand.

301
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,640
So they mean

302
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,440
the Great Sima is really going to rebel.

303
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,240
I understand.

304
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,240
The Great Sima is trying to rebel.

305
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
He's in the wrong position.

306
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,840
No.

307
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
I have to leave the palace immediately

308
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,640
to protect the Wang family.

309
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,240
Okay.

310
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,840
You can stand up.

311
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
Why did you act so weak just now?

312
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,240
I...

313
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,240
I...

314
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,640
You?

315
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
You're asking too many questions.

316
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,240
Find me a pair of pants.

317
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
Who are you talking to?

318
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,240
I'm not your maid.

319
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
Lay down. I'll apply the medicine.

320
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,440
It's too late.

321
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,240
Find me a pair of pants.

322
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,440
I said, lay down.

323
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,640
Even if you go to the fengshan now,

324
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,840
what can you do?

325
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,640
In your current state,

326
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,840
how much can you protect the King of Chen when the battle starts?

327
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,240
Didn't you hear them?

328
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
The Great Sima is in the hands of the King of Chen now.

329
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,640
You can't change anything even if you go.

330
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,440
I'm going, too.

331
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,240
My duty is to protect His Majesty until I die.

332
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,840
Besides,

333
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,840
I died.

334
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,440
Isn't it exactly what you want?

335
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840
An assassin who came to assassinate the King of Chen.

336
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,840
Isn't this situation

337
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,240
worthy of your respect?

338
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
Didn't I say it earlier?

339
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
I did want to assassinate the King of Chen at first.

340
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,440
But because he's stupid, I didn't want to kill him.

341
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,840
I don't believe it.

342
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,040
There must be a conspiracy behind this.

343
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,440
Stupid dragon.

344
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,640
I can't make it clear to you.

345
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Anyway, now,

346
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
I'm not only not going to kill him,

347
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,040
but also protect him in the fengshan.

348
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,440
Why?

349
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,640
Because he's stupid,

350
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
but the Great Sima is not.

351
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,440
The Great Sima is evil, distant, green, sinister and poisonous.

352
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
If the King of Chen really changes him to Zhang Jinlong,

353
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,440
the power of Chen will surely increase.

354
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,040
This is very bad for Wu State.

355
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,840
What's wrong?

356
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,840
I don't understand.

357
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,040
I...

358
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,440
I can understand it now.

359
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Why can't you understand what I'm saying?

360
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,040
An assassin who came to assassinate the King of Chen.

361
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,840
Now, not only is he not going to kill the King of Chen,

362
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,640
but also protect the King of Chen.

363
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,440
This is unreasonable.

364
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,240
Don't worry about the reason.

365
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,440
Although he's stupid,

366
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,440
he's not a good king,

367
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
but I think

368
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
he's a good person.

369
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,640
Yes.

370
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,240
That's enough.

371
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,440
Lie down.

372
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,840
Give you some medicine.

373
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,640
I'm going to fengshan to protect the King.

374
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Good.

375
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,240
The King of Chen

376
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,040
is singing and dancing every night.

377
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,840
The so-called King of Chen doesn't go to court.

378
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,640
He only looks for his wife.

379
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,840
He coaxes his wife every day.

380
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,640
He's sitting in the new column every night.

381
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,240
Sir, take care.

382
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,440
The King of Chen

383
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,840
only looks for his wife every day.

384
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,440
He coaxes his wife every day.

385
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,240
He's sitting in the new column every night.

386
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Who said that?

387
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,440
Yes.

388
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,240
What's wrong with the man in the window?

389
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
What's wrong with him?

390
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,440
This time, it seems that the King of Chen

391
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,640
is not in a good mood.

392
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
It's raining.

393
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,840
It's raining.

394
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,440
It's raining.

395
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
It's raining.

396
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,840
It's like raining.

397
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
It's raining.

398
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,640
It's raining.

399
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,440
It's really raining.

400
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Put on your backpack.

401
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,440
Yes.

402
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,840
The King of Chen is coming out.

403
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
The King of Chen is coming out.

404
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,840
The King of Chen is coming out.

405
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

406
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

407
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

408
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

409
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,840
Attention.

410
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:42,480
The first official Make a 4-year

411
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
of fatherqueting.

412
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,240
battery tip strand can support both father and son.

413
00:20:53,240 --> 00:21:09,060
My fabricated tongue will

414
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,560
Doctor.

415
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,840
How to read this?

416
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,920
firmware as when the paper needs flight to make it perfect

417
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
What's wrong with him?

418
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,840
He's not a good person.

419
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,120
How can he be like this?

420
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,640
He's not a good person.

421
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,920
He's not a good person.

422
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,440
He's not a good person.

423
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,640
He's not a good person.

424
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,240
He's not a good person.

425
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,640
To rule the country without a true name,

426
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,680
to follow the name,

427
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
is my sin.

428
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,400
I'm so...

429
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,840
weak.

430
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,440
Chen Xiaohu,

431
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,800
what are you doing?

432
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,280
I can't read it.

433
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,440
I told you just now.

434
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
You forgot it, right?

435
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Are you trying to kill me?

436
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
You're a demon.

437
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,720
You...

438
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
You... You...

439
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,280
My son Ruoling

440
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,960
has been taught by the Imperial College of Imperial Examination

441
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,080
to be a good son-in-law.

442
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,720
I'm so grateful to him.

443
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,960
Forget it.

444
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,600
Doctor,

445
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,360
I can't read it.

446
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:12,880
I can't read it.

447
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,560
Take it away.

448
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,160
Take it away.

449
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,360
Okay.

450
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,840
I don't need to read it.

451
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
Wait for me.

452
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,840
Go.

453
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
What's going on?

454
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,840
Take it away.

455
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,440
Give it to me.

456
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,240
The police are here to investigate.

457
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,240
ого

458
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,240
In a daze.

459
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,000
Let's start it.

460
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,760
Let's start asking people for help.

461
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,460
Yeah.

462
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,980
Xuan Lang,

463
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,500
when do you have more islands left?

464
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,820
We have more islands now.

465
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,380
Please guarantee complete고요.

466
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,100
Yeah.

467
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,420
Don't waste your time.

468
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,160
Keep going.

469
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,360
Waar is the fate,

470
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,160
I am only Rise High!

471
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,120
Who dares to bother the Rose

472
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,700
will be the family of thunder.

473
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,620
All hands under the nails!

474
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,880
Liッer pipeline

475
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,520
Oh.

476
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,760
There's someone on the move.

477
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,480
Haifei, look.

478
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,360
I've touched the Heavenly Emperor.

479
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,440
You demoness,

480
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,000
show yourself now!

481
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:38,680
Now.

482
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:39,680
Haifei,

483
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,360
now.

484
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:40,840
Now.

485
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,680
Kill me now.

486
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,880
I don't want to hurt you.

487
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
I only said once.

488
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,320
I'm not a demon.

489
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,160
No matter how tough you are,

490
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,360
you can't beat us.

491
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,200
Wang Tingli

492
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,240
saw you shooting firecrackers at night.

493
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,200
There's more than one person.

494
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,520
If it weren't for you,

495
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,560
God wouldn't punish Chen.

496
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,760
It would be a great disaster.

497
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,040
People would be in misery.

498
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,800
Me?

499
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,640
Shooting firecrackers at night?

500
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,560
Today,

501
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,240
we'll do justice for heaven.

502
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,240
I'll take you.

503
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,920
Be careful, Your Highness.

504
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,120
Go to hell.

505
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,680
You...

506
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,800
Surrender...

507
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,800
What?

508
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,440
What's this?

509
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,920
Black dog blood.

510
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,960
Are you afraid?

511
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,160
If you get black dog blood,

512
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,840
you'll be punished.

513
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,360
You're so naughty.

514
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,040
Be careful, Your Highness.

515
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,360
Taiji, shut up.

516
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,680
Impossible.

517
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,360
You're not afraid of gluttony?

518
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,120
You're just a sandbag.

519
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,640
I'm really going to be angry.

520
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,720
Your Highness.

521
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,080
You've been a demon for at least a thousand years.

522
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,880
It seems that

523
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,680
you're going to

524
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,440
learn the skills of five sects today.

525
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,640
That's a bad way.

526
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,000
Zhao Shi is right.

527
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,080
My beloved consort is not a demon.

528
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,280
She's my beloved consort.

529
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,960
Your Majesty's demon is obsessed with your mind.

530
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,000
You can't trust her.

531
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,120
For the sake of the Great Chen,

532
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,560
take this demon's consort away.

533
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,280
Yes.

534
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,120
Stop.

535
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,880
Warning.

536
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,920
The amount is insufficient.

537
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,480
Warning.

538
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,600
The amount is insufficient.

539
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,680
If you want to kill my beloved consort,

540
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,720
kill me first.

541
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,360
Your Majesty.

542
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,080
Beloved consort.

543
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,120
Stop.

544
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,880
Protect His Majesty.

545
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,880
What's going on?

546
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,920
What's going on?

547
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,720
What's going on?

548
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,600
What's going on?

549
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,480
What's going on?

550
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,280
What's going on?

551
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,080
What's going on?

552
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,800
What's going on?

553
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,200
Beloved consort.

554
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,760
Beloved consort.

555
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,160
Your mission

556
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,920
is to defeat Wu Yu.

557
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,480
Let the state of Chen be peaceful

558
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,680
and the state be prosperous.

559
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,120
I don't want to be the king.

560
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,720
I don't want to be manipulated.

561
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,400
No one cares about the state anyway.

562
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,360
I care.

563
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,760
The state of Chen has been in drought for a long time.

564
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,720
The refugees have been displaced.

565
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,720
And the enemies have been harassed.

566
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,720
I want to start the Qi Yu ceremony.

567
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:58,080
You have to read the

568
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,120
poem you wrote.

569
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,880
Just read it as you want.

570
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,880
Just express it sincerely.

571
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,120
God.

572
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,560
If you want to kill me,

573
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,240
just kill me.

574
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,320
If God

575
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,760
really wants me to be an immortal

576
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,360
and the king,

577
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,040
just look at me.

578
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Look at the people of the state of Chen.

579
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,280
The state of Chen is in drought.

580
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,280
The grain is also in the dry.

581
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,320
This is a good thing.

582
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,840
The cucumber has grown by two thousand.

583
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
The cabbage has grown by ten thousand.

584
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,160
You don't even give water.

585
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,840
Who do you want to drown

586
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,520
in the dry?

587
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,200
How do you let people live?

588
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,160
The old people don't understand.

589
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,320
They understand everything.

590
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,640
If someone really made a mistake

591
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,080
and offended the god of death,

592
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,200
I, Chen Xiaohua,

593
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,040
I, Chen Xiaohua, will still take the responsibility.

594
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,880
I, Chen Xiaohua, can't do anything.

595
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,400
I'm a useless person.

596
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,840
I can't promise anyone

597
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,200
to make anyone happy.

598
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,000
But

599
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,840
all this has nothing to do with my wife.

600
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,440
I love my wife.

601
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,720
I love my country.

602
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,320
All this has nothing to do with her.

603
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,880
If I can make the people of the state of Chen

604
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,880
eat grain and eat food,

605
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,960
I will take all the responsibility.

606
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,640
I, Chen Xiaohua,

607
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,160
will take all the responsibility.

608
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,120
I'll cut you into pieces.

609
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,720
I'll cut you into pieces.

610
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,400
I'll cut you into pieces.

611
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,920
I'll cut you into pieces.

612
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,120
Compses in 좀 spacesteant

613
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,560
Get up, get up.

614
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,960
Get up.

615
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,640
Get up.

616
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,720
Get up.

617
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Get up.

618
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,240
Get up.

619
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,640
Er跟你说

620
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,920
I promise

621
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,280
that I'll listen to you

622
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,640
The wind is not strong.

623
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,320
Look at that, it's thick.

624
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,640
It's getting heavy.

625
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,520
Let's go!

626
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,240
Xia Ruo!

627
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,280
OH!

628
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,640
Theles!

629
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,600
It's raining!

630
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,140
It's raining!

631
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,660
It's raining!

632
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,820
It's raining!

633
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,180
It's raining!

634
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,340
That's great! It's raining!

635
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,420
The window is now complete.

636
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,560
Xi Fa! Xi Fa!

637
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,120
Xi Fa.

638
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,060
It's raining.

639
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:31,680
Ocean's

640
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,480
Long Live Emperor Wu

641
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,200
Long Live Emperor Wu

642
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:45,920
Long Live Emperor Wu

643
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Long live the King of Dacheng

644
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Long live the King of Dacheng

645
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,000
The King of Dacheng is here

646
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,600
Dacheng is saved

647
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,920
The King of Dacheng is saved

648
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:30,920
The King of Dacheng is saved

649
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:55,920
Long live the King of Dacheng

650
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,640
The result of the cycle of events

651
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:27,280
Repeating the impulse is happiness

652
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:34,000
Your smile hasn't appeared recently

653
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,800
How I wish you were there

654
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,040
The way you and I exist

655
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,400
The lost story

656
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:54,440
For you, it's not far

657
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:01,280
I'm willing to enjoy every day like this

658
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:08,400
I imagine we have a lot of tomorrow

659
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,680
I'm used to what you've given me

660
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,840
I've been preparing for so many years

661
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:21,480
I hold the end of the bottle

662
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:28,280
I'm willing to accompany you in this world

663
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:35,480
I wish you would hold me until the end one day

664
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,760
Even if it's a new life

665
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Give me ten thousand choices

666
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Or do I have to go against the rules for life
