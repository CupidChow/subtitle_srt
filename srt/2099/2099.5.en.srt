1
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,760
Finally out of this miserable place.

2
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,519
Assassin!

3
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,000
Bro.

4
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,199
Who are you?

5
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,959
Smells amazing!

6
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:06,920
Yeah!

7
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,079
It smells so good.

8
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:08,799
Serve the dish.

9
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,560
Let's taste it first.

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,519
It looks great and smells nice.

11
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,400
Dish it up.

12
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,040
Let's have a taste.

13
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,359
Surround it!

14
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,159
His Majesty has died of poison.

15
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,159
Execute everyone
in the Imperial Kitchen!

16
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:22,760
No.

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,280
Wait.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,840
I'm not from the Imperial Kitchen!

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,599
Slowly!

20
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,319
I'm not from the Imperial Kitchen!

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,439
This is his best record?

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,640
Dying over 70 times in a month.

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,719
This is the only time he survived
until the former king's death

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,239
and the closest he's gotten

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,840
to escaping the Cold Palace.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,400
How could this happen?

27
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,040
If he can't pass,

28
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,200
what would happen?

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,640
If he can't pass,

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,920
his neurons won't repair.

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,719
All his brain neurons will die.

32
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,360
He'll be no different
from a coma patient

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
on life support.

34
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,919
Just a waste of resources.

35
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,439
He often plays games at home.

36
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,199
How can't he even clear the first level?

37
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,199
Well,

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,840
honestly,

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,080
he's a master at living.

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,560
In those 70 replays,

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,840
he managed to grow corn
in the Cold Palace 40 times

42
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,000
and taught himself to cure bacon

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,639
a dozen times.

44
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,240
But in this world,

45
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,840
it's impossible to achieve these things.

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,159
Think about it,

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,039
Jiang Tao.

48
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,520
Have you ever seen real corn?

49
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,159
Have you ever seen

50
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,479
a piece of pork

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,199
turn into bacon?

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,159
Have you ever tasted a real tomato?

53
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,919
In our era,

54
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,560
these were ordinary things.

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,439
But now,

56
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,280
only the rich and idle

57
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,639
get to experience them.

58
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,879
He must have read related books.

59
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,680
If not for saving his life,

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,159
he'd truly fit to live in that world.

61
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:02,976
=Episode 5=
(The King Wants the Imperial Seal)

62
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,120
I'm not dead?

63
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,000
Your Majesty.

64
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,439
You're awake.

65
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,800
Long Qi.

66
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,639
What happened yesterday?

67
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,680
I don't know the details.

68
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
I just know
you disappeared for two hours.

69
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,240
Then, Lady Xiao

70
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,680
sent Xin Caiyi to bring you back.

71
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,800
She said you were poisoned.

72
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:28,800
But

73
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,040
she cured it.

74
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,240
So she heard everything?

75
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
I'm done.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I think I was poisoned

77
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,040
by Xin Caiyi.

78
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,800
Crocodile tears.

79
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,920
Thought we can't fight the Queen,

80
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,879
we can target her maid!

81
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,040
A King who couldn't kill his own Queen

82
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,959
ordered a top warrior

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,439
to bully a little maid?

84
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,199
Pathetic.

85
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,199
Long Qi.

86
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,519
Kill her.

87
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:09,728
Your Majesty.

88
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,839
This is humiliating.

89
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,079
I don't care.

90
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,040
Do it!

91
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,480
Wait!

92
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,079
Let's negotiate.

93
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,800
Hey,

94
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,639
what's wrong with you lately?

95
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,040
How about this?

96
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,439
Give me the bamboo slip.

97
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,759
If I find the money,

98
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,759
I'll share it.

99
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,720
Do you agree?

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,040
I don't need money.

101
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,399
And the Queen said,

102
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,439
there is no money.

103
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,399
It actually leads to the Imperial Seal.

104
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,800
The Imperial Seal?

105
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,519
What's it for?

106
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,000
The Imperial Seal is

107
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,120
a national treasure.

108
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,360
A symbol of legitimacy.

109
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,279
Whoever holds it unifies the realm.

110
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,399
Chen has lost it generations ago.

111
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,040
We kept sending secret guards to search,

112
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,439
but failed to find it.

113
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,759
Not only the Chen State,

114
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,439
Wu State's also searched it for long.

115
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,079
Even Wu's kids know the legend.

116
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,519
Emperor Qin

117
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,560
got He Shi Jade after conquering Zhao,

118
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,959
and then let Chancellor Li Si carve it
into a seal in Small Seal Script.

119
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,040
Just a Jade Seal

120
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,639
made Wu State bow down?

121
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,399
If I had it, would Grand Marshal
and Prince Wu

122
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,680
obey me?

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,399
Would Dowager Zhang

124
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,879
wash my feet?

125
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,920
Maybe.

126
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,079
What do you think?

127
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,839
I'll never kneel down

128
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,079
and wash your feet.

129
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,920
See?

130
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
Then, it's useless.

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,800
Just break it up.

132
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Don't regret it.

133
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,319
Wait.

134
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,399
The Imperial Seal?

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,879
Imperial Seal?

136
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
What was it made of?

137
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,040
He Shi Jade.

138
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:44,959
A piece of jade.

139
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,439
Doesn't that mean it's priceless?

140
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,439
Yes.

141
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
This large?

142
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,240
This large.

143
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,439
(I can make a move)

144
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,439
(after they find it.)

145
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,199
It hasn't rained for months.

146
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,360
Drought everywhere.

147
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,519
No harvest of crops.

148
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,279
Yan City, Luming, and Xiang City

149
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,879
suffer the most.

150
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,800
Refugees are everywhere.

151
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,240
National funds are insufficient.

152
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,480
It's impressive for you

153
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,160
- to issue an Edict of Self-Reproach.
- Edict of Self-Reproach.

154
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,680
Your Majesty is wise.

155
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,720
After fasting and bathing,

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
at the ancestral temple,

157
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,000
- before all officials,
- Before all officials,

158
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,799
- issue...
- issue an Edict of Self-Reproach.

159
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,000
(How does he know
what I'm going to say?)

160
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,559
Grand Marshal.

161
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,720
I know quite well

162
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,440
what you'll say.

163
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,879
Do you know why?

164
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,360
Because I'm heaven's chosen!

165
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,200
Your Majesty.

166
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,919
What the Grand Marshal says
is indeed urgent.

167
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,600
Currently, the people are desperate.

168
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,200
Wu Army waits at the border.

169
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,279
I think

170
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,960
peace makes a nation strong.

171
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,159
Prosperity fills the treasury.

172
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,799
The treasury is empty.

173
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,240
- Refugees are everywhere.
- Refugees are everywhere.

174
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,039
Minister Li.

175
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,000
Since

176
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,000
you cherish Chen so deeply,

177
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,399
why not

178
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,440
sell your family's lands

179
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,200
and donate to the treasury?

180
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,000
Grand Marshal harbors malicious motives.

181
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:31,799
Guards!

182
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,840
Drag him out

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and execute him!

184
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,639
Who dares!

185
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,000
Nobody listens to me, right?

186
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,600
If no one heeds me,

187
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,120
there would be no rain,

188
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,440
or Edict of Self-Reproach.

189
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,639
Even you don't obey me,

190
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,159
how could Heaven

191
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,240
listen to me?

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,840
I'm not going.

193
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,279
Court adjourned!

194
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,120
Court adjourned.

195
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,279
The bamboo slip

196
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:50,039
Is now in Zhang Xiao'er's hands.

197
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:53,600
Upon returning to the palace,
I will send people to kill her.

198
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Investigate what's written on it first.

199
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,720
Lady Xiao...

200
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,639
Don't touch her.

201
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Don't touch?

202
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,159
There is no one I can't touch
in the Chen State.

203
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,799
She's the Warrioress.

204
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,480
Warrioress?

205
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,639
Not a complete certain,

206
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,440
but it's very likely.

207
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,039
If she really is the Warrioress...

208
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,000
Lian'er.

209
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,080
Don't make me worry about you.

210
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,679
What should we do then?

211
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,799
My ascension to the throne
isn't far off.

212
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,639
At that time,

213
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,759
I will muster the troops

214
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,879
to conquer Chen,

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,399
and help your son be the ruler.

216
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:59,000
Then, no one will dare gossip about us.

217
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,279
Do you truly not mind
that I have a child?

218
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,240
Let me tell you once again.

219
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,240
The one I love

220
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,840
is you.

221
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:24,240
Your past made you the one I love.

222
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,720
I only want you.

223
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,120
When fake is real, real is fake.

224
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,000
So is it real or fake?

225
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,879
I don't know.

226
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,799
Then, shut up.

227
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,399
Guishan has a ghostly shadow
by candlelight.

228
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,360
What is Guishan?

229
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,279
I know it.

230
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,200
It's a place name.

231
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:04,879
Place name?

232
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,720
Right.

233
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,639
It's in the mountain range
bordering Chen and Wu.

234
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,480
Miasma frequently appears there.

235
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,320
A great war occurred a century ago,

236
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,000
hence the population became sparser.

237
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,159
Legends say the souls of fallen soldiers
haunt the forests.

238
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,960
Over time, it became

239
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,559
an abandoned place by both states

240
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,200
and attracted gatherings of outlaws.

241
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,840
Get to the point.

242
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,600
It's dangerous.

243
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,200
You're leading Your Majesty into danger!

244
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,919
Your Majesty, don't go.

245
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,879
That's too far.

246
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,000
You can't go there.

247
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,960
Relax.

248
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,200
Don't put on a stern face.

249
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,840
Grand Tutor said,

250
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,159
the more critical the moment,

251
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,679
the steadier we must stand

252
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:39,720
as a mountain.

253
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,120
Steady

254
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,200
as a mountain?

255
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,320
That's a metaphor!

256
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,320
A metaphor!

257
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,080
Listen.

258
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,399
Give me a smile.

259
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,279
Make it natural.

260
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:54,720
Your Majesty.

261
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,759
You mustn't go

262
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,879
Guishan.

263
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,919
But if we don't,

264
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
how can we find the seal?

265
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,799
Your Majesty.

266
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:02,759
You just said

267
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,832
Guishan has a ghostly shadow
by candlelight.

268
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,919
Could this thing

269
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,320
not be in Guishan,

270
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,799
but by candlelight?

271
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,480
By candlelight?

272
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,759
What does that mean?

273
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,919
The meaning is the darkest place

274
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,919
is directly by candlelight

275
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,440
that illuminates everywhere.

276
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,960
So the Imperial Seal

277
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,759
might be right in front of us,

278
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,200
in the Chen palace.

279
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:30,360
That's "by candlelight".

280
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,600
If it was

281
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,399
hidden nearby,

282
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:34,799
where would it be?

283
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,039
In the compartment
under my bed in Linhua Hall.

284
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:42,679
Wait.

285
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,879
All possible hiding places
have been used.

286
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,559
Then if it's hidden in the palace,

287
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,519
where could it be?

288
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,080
Show me the bamboo slip.

289
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,440
Where is this?

290
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,759
The Fengxian Hall.

291
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,759
Let's go.

292
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,639
Caiyi.

293
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,159
Y-You search over there.

294
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,799
Long Qi.

295
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,600
You search there.

296
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,519
I'll search here.

297
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:58,399
Long Qi.

298
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,399
His Majesty caused chaos at midnight

299
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,120
and smashed the Fengxian Hall.

300
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,320
I've checked.

301
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,120
Totally a mess inside.

302
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,720
I cannot punish His Majesty

303
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,000
and defy my superior.

304
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,840
But this servant...

305
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,440
Beat him to death!

306
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,720
No mercy!

307
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,080
Are you serious?

308
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,599
Stop!

309
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,279
Stop it!

310
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,599
Stop!

311
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,720
I arranged all of this.

312
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:37,279
I had someone give the bamboo slip
to His Majesty,

313
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,200
making him come to Fengxian Hall

314
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,519
to search

315
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,119
for the Imperial Seal.

316
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,599
Imperial Seal?

317
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,119
Did you find it?

318
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:50,920
No.

319
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,720
Chen Xiaohua.

320
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,799
Chen has had no rain for ages.

321
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,720
Refugees are numerous.

322
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,799
And foreign invaders threaten.

323
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,960
Yet you wrecked the Fengxian Hall

324
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,759
just for the so-called Imperial Seal?

325
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,039
Listen.

326
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,319
In three days,

327
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,279
I'll commence the Rain Prayer Ceremony.

328
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,200
You must read the Edict of Self-Reproach

329
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,279
to quell public anger

330
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,599
and reassure them.

331
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,960
Can you do it?

332
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,079
Me?

333
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,440
He can.

334
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,559
I can.

335
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,599
Alright.

336
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,200
Since you can,

337
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,599
tonight's matters end here.

338
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,160
Imperial Guards!

339
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:43,960
Here!

340
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,119
Take Your Majesty
to reflect in seclusion.

341
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,039
Who dares?

342
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:49,279
Grand Marshal.

343
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Today, you

344
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,400
not only openly beat my secret guard,

345
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,319
but also want to confine me?

346
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,359
Have you lost your mind?

347
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,279
Forgotten I'm Chen's King?

348
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,960
Do you think you are?

349
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:04,759
I...

350
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,880
Honey.

351
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,200
What

352
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,359
does he mean?

353
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,359
If you consider yourself Chen's King,

354
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,839
you should know what you should do,

355
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,400
and what you shouldn't.

356
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,559
Honey.

357
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,720
Honey.

358
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,519
Whether confinement or rain prayers,

359
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,400
I think you're right.

360
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,440
If not?

361
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,480
Just now,

362
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,680
were you trying to kill me?

363
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:09,799
Don't forget

364
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,000
the agreement between us.

365
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,400
There is no "us" between you and me.

366
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,200
Only you and I.

367
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,079
His Majesty

368
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,599
has grown up.

369
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,319
Learned to care about others

370
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,559
and protect others.

371
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,960
In three days,

372
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,960
His Majesty will pray for rain.

373
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,119
Publicly reading
the Edict of Self-Reproach

374
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:41,000
to admit his incompetence

375
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,400
caused Chen's continuous disasters.

376
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,799
This isn't his fault.

377
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,799
Your Highness.

378
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,960
There's an urgent message.

379
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:08,544
(Your father is gravely ill.
Please return now!)

380
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,720
Your Highness.

381
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:25,599
What's happened?

382
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,680
Father is seriously ill.

383
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,559
Considering the current situation,

384
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,400
you are still in the Chen State.

385
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,279
I'm afraid

386
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,519
your two elder brothers...

387
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
They are not my threats.

388
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,240
Chen State's former strength

389
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,240
came from their ancestor
finding the Imperial Seal,

390
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,319
and claiming

391
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,119
to be the mandate of Heaven.

392
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,480
Now that Chen's King Wu has died,

393
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
Wu has reformed

394
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,160
and become stronger.

395
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,319
In our reign,

396
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:20,559
the humiliation of paying tribute
for centuries

397
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,960
should come to an end.

398
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,519
So,

399
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,480
you mean...

400
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,079
Chen Xiaohua is unworthy the position.

401
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,920
If we obtain the Imperial Seal,

402
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,680
it'll prove King Wu's posthumous son,

403
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,359
Dowager Zhang's youngest son,

404
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,119
is the real King of Chen.

405
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,559
Then, we'll have a justified reason

406
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,400
to raise troops

407
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,319
and support him to ascend the throne.

408
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,839
Brilliant, Your Highness.

409
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,680
Tomorrow,

410
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,400
I will return to the capital.

411
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,599
Wu Zhong.

412
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,200
Keep investigating
the Imperial Seal's whereabouts.

413
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,240
If there is any clue,

414
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,640
let me know immediately.

415
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,480
Understood.

416
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,960
Take care.

417
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,799
After this,

418
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,319
I don't know when we will meet again.

419
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,079
Don't worry.

420
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,039
I'll be back soon.

421
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,640
When I return,

422
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,920
we won't need to hide anymore.

423
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
All these years,

424
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,480
you've had it tough.

425
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,839
No.

426
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,839
With hope in my heart,

427
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,680
there are no sufferings.

428
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,680
I feel guilty

429
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,279
about eating temple offerings.

430
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,160
Maybe I

431
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,160
should stop?

432
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:39,839
Have you no shame?

433
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,960
That's your tenth piece!

434
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,559
I'm choking.

435
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,559
Chen Xiaohua.

436
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:51,880
Honey.

437
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,480
It's for Long Qi.

438
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,240
Apply it for him.

439
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,680
Thank you.

440
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,328
(JiuJiu's Mini-Lecture:)
Chen State is located inland,

441
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,440
(The screenwriter is too verbose.)
far from the sea.

442
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,200
(Let me fast-forward.)
Moist air can't

443
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,160
reach most of the Chen's farmlands.

444
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,599
Additionally, Chen's borders
are located on a plateau.

445
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,640
In summer, the plateau

446
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,960
becomes a heat source,

447
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,640
while the surrounding areas
act as cold sources.

448
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,039
Cold air flows over the plateau,

449
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,519
making the air more arid.

450
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,799
That's right.

451
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
You are correct.

452
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
Didn't understand, right?

453
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,559
In short,

454
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,880
the drought isn't your fault.

455
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
Rain prayers

456
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,000
or self-reproach edicts

457
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,920
are just to reassure the people.

458
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,160
And that is

459
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,559
your responsibility.

460
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:38,880
As for the bamboo slip,

461
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,000
think again carefully.

462
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,960
Why did the former king leave this

463
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,839
to his descendants?

464
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,920
Long Qi.

465
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:01,920
It hurts, right?

466
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,440
It's fine.

467
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,519
If I don't move,

468
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,319
it doesn't hurt.

469
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,079
As my secret guard,

470
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,240
you're ordered around every day.

471
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,079
Do you regret it?

472
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:17,960
Secret guards

473
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,000
never regret.

474
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,519
That's right.

475
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,880
But what if you had the chance

476
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,279
not to be a secret guard?

477
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,640
I never thought about that.

478
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,440
But

479
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:33,799
my life

480
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,039
is yours.

481
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,000
Your life is your own.

482
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,480
I'd

483
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,279
be dead.

484
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:45,799
If not for...

485
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:48,680
Forget it.

486
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,599
Anyway, for this lifetime,

487
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,000
I am your guard.

488
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,519
Whatever you command,

489
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,680
I will do it.

490
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,119
Why?

491
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,240
Because

492
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,319
you treat me well.

493
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:07,000
Are you an idiot?

494
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,000
But honestly,

495
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,400
Chen's people

496
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,759
are truly pitiful.

497
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,680
Edict of Self-Reproach

498
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,200
is indeed necessary.

499
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:23,759
But,

500
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,720
what if we have grain?

501
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,160
Without water,

502
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,799
we'll still choke.

503
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
That's true.

504
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,119
Ancestors of the Zhang family,

505
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,920
I, Zhang Jinlong, have exhausted myself

506
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,559
for Chen's prosperity.

507
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:45,640
Yet with great enemies approaching,

508
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,759
Chen Xiaohua, the King,

509
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,319
proves incompetent.

510
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
Three days later,

511
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,119
we will hold the Rain Prayer Ceremony.

512
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,720
The King will read
the Edict of Self-Reproach.

513
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,759
If...

514
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:05,839
If by then,

515
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,079
he remains that useless...

516
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,400
I, Zhang Jinlong, must rise up.
