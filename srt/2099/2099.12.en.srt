(Welcome, Warrioress)

2
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:47,136
(Grocery store)

3
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
I've paid back

4
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,159
what I owe you.

5
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,199
Want to pawn something?

6
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,599
Long Qi, take it out

7
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,240
to show the manager.

8
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,639
Please forgive me.

9
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,719
This humble shop

10
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,599
is not qualified to host you.

11
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,840
Let me take you

12
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,280
somewhere with fewer people around.

13
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,520
This way.

14
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,159
Big.

15
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,480
Big.

16
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,639
- Small.
- Big.

17
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,480
Big.

18
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,576
- Small.
- Big.

19
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:13,423
Again!

20
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,079
Come on, go on.

21
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:21,679
Go on.

22
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,880
- Big.
- Place your bets.

23
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,119
- Big.
- Big.

24
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,520
Show me the item.

25
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:26,960
Place your bets.

26
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,679
Big.

27
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,480
Small.

28
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,759
- Small.
- Big.

29
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,159
Alright.

30
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,680
Bet placed.

31
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,000
- Small.
- Big.

32
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,280
- Small.
- Big.

33
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,959
Sir, this item is too valuable

34
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,039
for our petty store.

35
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,719
Please follow me.

36
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,960
Sir, come with me

37
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,199
to see the true master of Guishan.

38
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,319
Please.

39
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:22,208
(Pawnshop)

40
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,839
It's you.

41
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,120
That's right.

42
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:43,879
Long Qi.

43
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,079
Everyone.

44
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,680
(Yizhan Deng)
Please be seated.

45
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,519
There's no rush to do business.

46
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,160
You are our honored guests here.

47
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,560
The way to Guishan is long and rugged.

48
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,160
You must be exhausted
from the long journey.

49
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,560
After three generations of hard work,

50
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
I've finally
gained a bit of a reputation.

51
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,559
I wonder what you're planning

52
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,519
to pawn here?

53
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,920
Yizhan Deng, Guishan Ghost Market.

54
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,240
Guaranteed authenticity.

55
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,319
Since you have come for my reputation,

56
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,199
then I consider us bound by destiny.

57
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,720
My honored guest, would you agree?

58
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,639
Long Qi, show him the item.

59
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,600
No wonder others didn't take it.

60
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:35,560
This wooden box
appears to be simple and plain.

61
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,040
Common folks wouldn't pick it up

62
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,319
even if it's lying by the roadside.

63
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
But how would common folks know

64
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,639
that true treasures
are often understated,

65
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,120
their brilliance hidden?

66
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,640
I really didn't expect

67
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,960
that I'd be lucky enough to see

68
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
the Imperial Seal of Chen State.

69
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,279
Sir,

70
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,279
am I right?

71
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:14,080
(Save every inch of land)

72
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,240
Where is the seal?

73
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,560
Sir, we came to look for
the Imperial Seal.

74
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,640
We...

75
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,920
Long Qi.

76
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,600
You poisoned us?

77
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,000
Sir.

78
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,079
I am

79
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,199
the king of Chen State.

80
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,920
The Imperial Seal

81
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,319
can save Chen State from peril.

82
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,439
Please tell...

83
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,439
tell us...

84
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,000
Where is the Imperial Seal?

85
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,079
You don't have the Imperial Seal?

86
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,079
You came to me
to look for the Imperial Seal?

87
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,680
King Chen...

88
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,079
King Chen came to me
to look for the Imperial Seal.

89
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,720
Kill them.

90
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,279
Honey.

91
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,279
Honey.

92
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,639
Honey.

93
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,480
Honey.

94
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,320
Honey.

95
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,639
Honey.

96
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,559
Are you also here, honey?

97
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,120
I know.

98
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,080
I know you're here.

99
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,600
If you're here,

100
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,639
please come out.

101
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,120
Honey.

102
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,639
I did all this

103
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,039
just to prove

104
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,639
that I, Chen Xiaohua, will be able

105
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,720
to protect you from now on.

106
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,360
I didn't understand

107
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,639
what you said to me that day

108
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,360
but I know

109
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,960
that you said it for my own good.

110
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,320
Honey.

111
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,200
You know?

112
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,559
While you're gone,

113
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,120
I've really, really missed you.

114
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,639
Honey.

115
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,879
Honey.

116
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,799
It's you.

117
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,679
Honey.

118
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,919
Honey.

119
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,480
You really came, honey.

120
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,960
I will never let you go again, honey.

121
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,320
Let go.

122
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,200
Can you stop embarrassing me?

123
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,080
Honey, if you hadn't come to save us,

124
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,000
the three of us

125
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,000
would probably have died here.

126
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,479
Enough.

127
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,840
Don't be so whiny.

128
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,879
How come you're still helping him?

129
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,039
How could it be?

130
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,600
How could it be?

131
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,320
Welcome, Warrioress.

132
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,559
Honey, I just don't get it.

133
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,439
Why did

134
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,519
that antiquarian master
start worshiping you?

135
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,080
Once you showed up,

136
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,080
he gave us the antidote and even

137
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
offered to help us.

138
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,399
Honey, why is this?

139
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,679
Don't delve into it.

140
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,080
Maybe it's just the game setup.

141
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,480
But it doesn't matter.

142
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,559
It worked.

143
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,240
No need to get to the bottom of it.

144
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,200
Honey, what do you mean by game setup?

145
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,799
Listen to me.

146
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,480
Guishan was built 50 years ago.

147
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,920
(Jiujiu's lecture)
The Warrioress appeared.

148
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,679
(Long story)
At the beginning,

149
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,040
(Fast-forwarding)
the Warrioress helped your father

150
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,719
conquer all.

151
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,240
But she regretted the killings.

152
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,839
Therefore,

153
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,479
she established Guishan

154
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,079
in the most war-stricken border area

155
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,400
to give the veterans a home.

156
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,519
All expenses were borne by Chen State.

157
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,760
Then she disappeared.

158
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,439
Due to its geographical location,

159
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,559
this place slowly

160
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:01,000
became a lawless place.

161
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,080
So you are really

162
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,519
the Warrioress?

163
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,960
Can you focus on the key points?

164
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Alright, honey.

165
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,080
Honey, I'm just happy to have you back.

166
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,360
Scold me however you like.

167
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,360
I love it.

168
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:25,312
(Yizhan Deng)

169
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,000
I apologize

170
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
for poisoning you.

171
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,240
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

172
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,840
Is everyone feeling alright?

173
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,320
We're fine now.

174
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,000
But sir,

175
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,960
won't you just tell us

176
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,919
how to find the Imperial Seal?

177
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,080
The Imperial Seal is not important.

178
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,840
What do you mean?

179
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,879
Your Majesty really wants
the Imperial Seal?

180
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Then, Your Majesty,

181
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,879
have you seen the Imperial Seal?

182
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,240
Have you?

183
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,279
There you go.

184
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,479
The Imperial Seal
is famous throughout the world.

185
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,400
But very few people have seen it

186
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
with their own eyes.

187
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:18,960
I bet Your Majesty
wants to use the Imperial Seal

188
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,960
to lure King Wu over.

189
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,679
That's right.

190
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,279
Then trap and kill him.

191
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,080
Does King Wu
want the Imperial Seal that much?

192
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,919
(Chen Xiaohua,)

193
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,279
stop struggling.

194
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,879
Open the gate.

195
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,200
Hand over the Imperial Seal

196
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,840
and I will spare your worthless life.

197
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,399
Yes, he does.

198
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,879
So it doesn't matter
whether there's an Imperial Seal.

199
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,240
Sir.

200
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,200
Are you saying that we can
use your auction house...

201
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,679
That's right.

202
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:09,840
Your Majesty.

203
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,679
You want to kill King Wu
to save the people of Chen.

204
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,559
- Of course.
- Then, Your Majesty.

205
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,160
After you kill King Wu,

206
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,960
will you wage war against Wu State?

207
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:21,960
I won't.

208
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,399
I assure you.

209
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,240
Alright then.

210
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,600
I really didn't expect
that someone is upholding

211
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:33,720
such a noble idea in this chaotic time.

212
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,879
I will absolutely help you.

213
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,600
Helping you

214
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,840
makes me feel like a good person again.

215
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,000
(Guishan map)
We can release false news

216
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,879
about the Imperial Seal
before the auction.

217
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,480
As long as he comes,

218
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,399
we will eliminate him.

219
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,639
Once King Wu dies,

220
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,679
Chen State won't be at risk anymore.

221
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,879
The antiquarian master

222
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,600
said that weapons

223
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,480
are strictly forbidden in Guishan.

224
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,599
But King Wu won't comply.

225
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,200
He'll definitely bring his people.

226
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,720
To kill him,

227
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,879
we need more hands.

228
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,840
Where do you stand on this?

229
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,480
What do you think?

230
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,639
Guishan is small.

231
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,600
A big group may attract attention.

232
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,440
So quality over quantity.

233
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,440
The problem is, where do we get troops?

234
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,024
(Grand Marshal's Mansion)

235
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,120
Master, His Majesty is here.

236
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,279
Grand Marshal.

237
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,720
- I found a way...
- Did Your Majesty

238
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,759
come up with a good plan
to deal with the threat

239
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,320
facing Chen State?

240
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,159
Dowager.

241
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,679
My respects, Dowager.

242
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
I came here

243
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,959
to ask for your help,

244
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,440
Grand Marshal.

245
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:28,360
You could have

246
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
issued a decree.

247
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,159
What's the important matter

248
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,440
that brings Your Majesty to my mansion?

249
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,200
I have been

250
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,000
burdened by the warfare

251
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,480
these days.

252
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,520
I couldn't take it anymore

253
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,520
and went hunting.

254
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,920
But none of my shots

255
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,919
hit the target.

256
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,039
I was so angry

257
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,519
I almost broke the bow.

258
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,919
That's why you haven't been
in the royal court.

259
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,679
It turns out that you went hunting.

260
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,879
That's right.

261
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,320
Everyone knows

262
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:00,879
that the Grand Marshal
is a great warrior

263
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,279
peerless under heaven.

264
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,679
You use the strongest bow

265
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,359
and the fastest arrows.

266
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,000
But you see, the Wu Army
is already at the city gates.

267
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,400
And I can't even use a bow.

268
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,400
Your Majesty came to my mansion

269
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,400
just to learn how to master archery?

270
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,319
That's right.

271
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,480
There's no other way to master archery

272
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,880
but to practice until skilled.

273
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,400
I happen to have

274
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,079
a few good bows in my collection.

275
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,199
I'll have them sent to the palace.

276
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,680
But remember.

277
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,640
Practice makes perfect.

278
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,799
Alright.

279
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Once I go back,

280
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,039
I will practice whole-heartedly.

281
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,000
Honey.

282
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,920
Do you hear that?

283
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,759
To do a good job,

284
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,599
one must sharpen one's tools.

285
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,759
Dowager, I just feel that

286
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,599
I don't have a handy tool.

287
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Problem solved.

288
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,599
All set.

289
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,200
Alright, I'm done here.

290
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,480
I'll take my leave.

291
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,960
This brat just left like that?

292
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,000
So you knew early on that
something was wrong with the Dowager.

293
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,480
That's right, I just don't know

294
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,079
when you found out about this.

295
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,480
When did you find out?

296
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,119
When they breached the gate.

297
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,720
Forget it. It's not important.

298
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,039
Anyway, I found out.

299
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,880
I was so scared.

300
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,959
If you spoke your mind
in front of the Dowager,

301
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,519
then our plan would have been spoiled.

302
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,320
But I think I have

303
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,000
made it clear to the Grand Marshal.

304
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,400
He got the message.

305
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,680
Are you sure?

306
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,119
At least, I wouldn't have
understood anything if I were him.

307
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,079
When I was about to leave,

308
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,119
he wrote "return" in my palm.

309
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,960
I think he wanted us to return and wait.

310
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,200
Wu Liang was born skeptical.

311
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,560
Even if he knows

312
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,319
that the Imperial Seal
has appeared in Guishan,

313
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,440
- he might not...
- He might not show up.

314
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,880
If he only sends his confidants,

315
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
we still can't carry out this plan.

316
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,319
Get him into the trap

317
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,039
and capture him.

318
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,480
But we must get him into the trap first.

319
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,400
Someone has to invite him.

320
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,920
Caiyi.

321
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,319
We're counting on you.

322
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,400
Go to the Dowager.

323
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,319
Make sure she delivers this message.

324
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,920
Our Dowager has countless

325
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,839
rare treasures.

326
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,920
Offer this ordinary jade
to your lady instead.

327
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,240
I'm an assassin from Wu.

328
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Assassin from Wu?

329
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,839
Do you know
this is the royal court of Chen?

330
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,759
With one word from me,

331
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,039
you'll be dead.

332
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,279
They only allow me

333
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,440
to contact you
when it's absolutely necessary.

334
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,039
They don't want to get you involved.

335
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,720
But this is urgent.

336
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,560
I can't get the message out.

337
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,799
That's why I came to you.

338
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,559
What's so urgent?

339
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,119
Let's hear it.

340
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,079
Dowager, it's the Imperial Seal.

341
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,480
King Chen has found it.

342
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,279
He's going to sell it in Guishan

343
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,279
and run away.

344
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,200
So he wanted my brother

345
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,480
to help him sell the Imperial Seal.

346
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,119
How is this possible?

347
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,039
I have no idea.

348
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,320
Perhaps he wants to ask
the Grand Marshal for some troops

349
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,680
to safeguard this journey.

350
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,600
Guishan is a dangerous place.

351
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,240
And the seal is immensely valuable.

352
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,039
They say that our king

353
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,199
is deeply concerned

354
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,880
about the Imperial Seal

355
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,839
and that we should
keep him updated on this issue.

356
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Your king

357
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,680
is quite concerned about this seal?

358
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,999
But since the war started,

359
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,680
my superior went missing.

360
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,720
Keep me updated
about any further developments.

361
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,160
Understood.

362
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,480
How did it go?

363
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,080
I did my part.

364
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,959
But I'm not sure

365
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:02,160
if the Dowager will do what we expect.

366
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,839
I hope she will.

367
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,119
The Grand Marshal has arrived.

368
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,839
The soldiers are waiting outside.

369
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,839
I hope I have not misunderstood you.

370
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,319
Grand Marshal.

371
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,319
Did you really understand
what I was saying?

372
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:51,000
I have long heard about Lian'er.

373
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,880
She was there. So we couldn't talk.

374
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,720
I understand.

375
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,600
Use the strongest bow

376
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,000
and the fastest arrows.

377
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,679
To defeat the army,

378
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,039
first capture its general.

379
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,839
You want King Wu, right?

380
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,559
I knew you'd get it.

381
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:23,136
(Auction house map)

382
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,000
Grand Marshal.

383
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,839
The antiquarian master
will stay in the center tomorrow.

384
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,240
All forces will arrive.

385
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,599
You will disguise yourself
as a wealthy merchant here.

386
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,000
(Opposite King Wu.)

387
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,080
(The antiquarian master)

388
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,519
(said forces from Chu and Yue
might also be there.)

389
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,439
I have prepared 50 soldiers,

390
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,999
all reserve secret guards.

391
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,959
I plan to divide these 50 soldiers

392
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:50,959
into two teams.

393
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:51,920
One team will be

394
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,079
at the venue.

395
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,519
(20 on the first floor.)

396
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,719
(10 on the second floor.)

397
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:56,999
(The antiquarian master)

398
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:59,359
(will assign a messenger.)

399
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,400
Your Majesty

400
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,400
and Xiao'er.

401
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,119
You two will oversee everything
from the second floor.

402
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,559
The second team

403
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,480
will follow Long Qi and Caiyi.

404
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,600
After the opening,

405
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,999
(tell the antiquarian master
to get all the guards out.)

406
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,759
(Once they're outside,)

407
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,080
(you can get rid of them.)

408
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,559
(Yizhan Deng)
(If a fight breaks out inside,)

409
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,160
you need to come back to help.

410
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:22,199
(Once King Wu appears,)

411
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:23,199
(proceed with)

412
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,880
(South)
(the auction as usual)

413
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,959
(West)
(to get his guard down.)

414
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,240
(Once we confirm he's the target,)

415
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,119
we will wait for the opportunity.

416
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,320
When you hear me smash a cup,

417
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,079
(launch an attack from all sides.)

418
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,720
Your plan is impeccable.

419
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,039
But I still have some concerns.

420
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,400
The Chu and Yue higher-ups
won't come alone.

421
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,600
(Yizhan Deng)
(If their guards)

422
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,199
(block the alleyway,)

423
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,199
(how can we deal with)

424
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,079
three forces at once with so few troops?

425
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,560
Therefore, I suggest

426
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,559
we try our best

427
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,080
(Yizhan Deng)
(to divert their major forces)

428
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,079
(away from the street.)

429
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,320
(The antiquarian master)

430
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,720
has to prolong the auction

431
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,800
rather than take action instantly

432
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,559
to make sure our plan goes smoothly.

433
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,079
But I think this is not foolproof.

434
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
You are from Wu.

435
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,440
You should know King Wu better.

436
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,720
Not really. I came here when I was 14.

437
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,279
I've only seen King Wu once.

438
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,680
I don't know him well.

439
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,680
But I think that

440
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:30,599
although you have everything sorted out,

441
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,039
we will inevitably

442
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,119
face uncertainties in action.

443
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,880
Instead of confronting him directly,

444
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,279
it's better to poison him.

445
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,519
(The antiquarian master can drug us.)

446
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,680
(Why can't we poison King Wu?)

447
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,279
Everyone makes valid points.

448
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,400
Honey, what do you think?

449
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,519
These three plans
don't conflict with each other

450
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,880
and can be carried out together.

451
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,880
Among them, Caiyi's plan

452
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:00,800
is the best

453
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,680
if it works.

454
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:02,880
That's right.

455
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,960
She is right.

456
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,279
Let's do it this way.

457
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,759
Our chances of winning are very high.

458
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,759
And we have

459
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Xiao'er with us.

460
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,599
Honey.

461
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,480
You seem bothered.

462
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm just thinking

463
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,480
that from now on,

464
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,039
I won't be able to help you.

465
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,680
Are you fine with that?

466
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,720
You have your reasons.

467
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,599
I understand.

468
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,240
Because I'm happy
as long as you're by my side.

469
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,720
From now on,

470
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,759
let me protect you.

471
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,640
I'm thinking,

472
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,000
the citizens
must all be asleep right now.

473
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,400
I've seen them in times of great peril.

474
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,119
So this time, I can't lose.

475
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,440
I believe in you.

476
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,200
Really?

477
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,720
Are you sure I wasn't born

478
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,799
to be a loser?

479
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,480
Don't you always say
you are the chosen one?

480
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,480
People always brag about

481
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,759
what they lack the most.

482
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,920
Those who can accomplish things
are destined to be in pain.

483
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,720
Believe in yourself.

484
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,880
Destiny is just an excuse for the weak.

485
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,519
Your destiny is in your own hands.
