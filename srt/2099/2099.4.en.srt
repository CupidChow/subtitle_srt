1
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:11,359
Again?

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,359
I'm going now.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,079
Caiyi.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,960
Go prepare some grass and apples.

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:24,760
Yes.

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,799
Where is my bacon?

7
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,000
When did she steal it?

8
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:49,216
Your Majesty.

9
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,439
Long Qi.

10
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,320
Yes.

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,079
So,

12
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,680
you predicted

13
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,159
that there's a box on the beam?

14
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,319
I didn't predict.

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,519
In a past life,

16
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:26,719
when I was going to hang myself,

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,079
you lifted me up

18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,120
and then hammered me down.

19
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:33,159
I don't get it.

20
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,359
Why did you commit suicide?

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,200
It's hard to explain.

22
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,680
Back then,

23
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,319
I lost everything.

24
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,519
I...

25
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:47,719
A secret guard!

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,480
Never asks questions.

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,200
So, there is a land deed in this box?

28
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,120
Yes.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,000
And poison needles?

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,640
Yes.

31
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,439
What will we do?

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,799
You know what to do.

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,000
I see.

34
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,120
Let me open it.

35
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,319
Go ahead.

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,759
Long Qi!

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,639
Your Majesty.

38
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,039
When fake is real, real is fake.

39
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,560
Guishan has a ghostly shadow
by candlelight.

40
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,000
When fake is real, real is fake.

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,439
Guishan has

42
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,400
a ghostly shadow...

43
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,360
Yes.

44
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,039
So, all we managed to do was

45
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,400
to get this riddle?

46
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,560
In my view,

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,960
this looks like King Chen Wu's stuff.

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,719
King Chen Wu's stuff?

49
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,199
Come to think of it...

50
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,759
It's good calligraphy.

51
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,120
Wait.

52
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,680
King Chen Wu is wise.

53
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,319
He wouldn't just leave
a mechanism box carelessly.

54
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,120
Yes.

55
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,919
He wouldn't just leave
a mechanism box carelessly.

56
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
This is a riddle.

57
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,879
I don't think

58
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,959
it just refers to a land deed.

59
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,839
Here you go.

60
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,759
Drink it.

61
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,720
Guishan has a ghostly shadow
by candlelight?

62
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,959
I feel I've seen this somewhere,

63
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,759
but I can't remember.

64
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,079
My Beloved.

65
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,160
Since you can't remember,

66
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,439
let me keep it for you for now.

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,199
When you remember, I will...

68
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:52,736
Your Majesty!

69
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,600
Warning.

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,519
Memory overheating.

71
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,800
Warning. Memory overheating.

72
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,480
Hey, why is she shaking again?

73
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,319
She is smoking.

74
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,120
Come on. Cool her down,
or she'll ignite.

75
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,680
Come on.

76
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,279
Look,

77
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:25,800
she doesn't

78
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,839
respect me at all!

79
00:05:27,712 --> 00:05:28,600
Your Majesty.

80
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,160
She never did.

81
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,920
This blighter!

82
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,319
I tolerated her hitting and scolding me.

83
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,120
However, she even stole my bacon

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,759
and snatched my stuff.

85
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,560
She is too cruel.

86
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,120
I can't take it

87
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,480
anymore.

88
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,439
Sure, you can't.

89
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,160
If that's from King Chen Wu,

90
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
we must get it back.

91
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,439
Yes.

92
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,040
Get it back.

93
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,399
You're wise.

94
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,759
But how?

95
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,319
Can't beat her.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,279
So, let's strike first.

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,639
Then we'll do

98
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,319
a surprise attack.

99
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,240
How's it going?

100
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,759
Is it surprising?

101
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,519
Yes.

102
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:50,240
=Episode 4=
(The King Intends to Kill the Queen)

103
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,839
I knew it.

104
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,600
In a long-distance attack,

105
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,199
though she knows magic,

106
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,720
we have the upper hand.

107
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,920
If nothing unexpected happens,

108
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,439
by this time tomorrow,

109
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,920
we will

110
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,319
have the treasure.

111
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,759
We will never be bullied again.

112
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,319
No time to lose.

113
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,040
Let me see

114
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,279
what she is doing.

115
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,279
That window is closed.

116
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,600
It blocks my view.

117
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
I can't see her.

118
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,839
How annoying!

119
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,319
I can see.

120
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,160
It seems like

121
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,560
she's sitting before the dresser.

122
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,720
Strangely,

123
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
I can't see her head.

124
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,679
Wonderful.

125
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,279
It's the perfect distance.

126
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:36,919
Long Qi,

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,200
you shoot her.

128
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Are you sure?

129
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,440
You loved Lady Xiao the most

130
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,559
before you went mad.

131
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,559
In the martial world, we call you as

132
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,200
scum.

133
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,960
She's changed.

134
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,240
She is not the gentle immortal

135
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,639
from my dreams anymore.

136
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,919
Now,

137
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,320
she bosses me around

138
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,240
and forces me

139
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,039
to do things.

140
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,039
Drink it.

141
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,879
She even slapped me

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,480
and abused me.

143
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,879
Your excuses.

144
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,720
Typical scumbag.

145
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,879
Shut up.

146
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,879
I'm going to shoot her.

147
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,120
No one

148
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,919
can resist this arrow from me.

149
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:16,559
S- Shoot!

150
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,559
Wait.

151
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,879
Do you know that kind of archery

152
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,919
that can make

153
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,279
the person hit by the arrow

154
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,240
kind, gentle,

155
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
lovely,

156
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,919
and committed

157
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,240
to being a good wife?

158
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,879
I know archery,

159
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,799
not magic.

160
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,840
Is there

161
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,679
an acupuncture point that,

162
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,720
when hit by an arrow,

163
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,279
will make her

164
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,320
reflect,

165
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,480
realize her mistakes,

166
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,960
and change her ways?

167
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,639
Again, I don't know magic!

168
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,000
You've changed too.

169
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,320
You're yelling at me.

170
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,360
Alright!

171
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,519
You just try

172
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,279
to scare her

173
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,159
to get my bamboo slip back.

174
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,799
Okay.

175
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,039
Shoot.

176
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,639
She's screaming.

177
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,519
You actually shot her?

178
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,320
I don't think...

179
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,440
so.

180
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,440
Go.

181
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,279
Take a look.

182
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,279
Madam.

183
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,600
What happened?

184
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:24,559
Stop it.

185
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:25,960
Alright.

186
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,840
Well done.

187
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,360
Thank you.

188
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,000
It's a trick.

189
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,039
I knew she was a monster.

190
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,440
The flying head magic
is an ancient dark art.

191
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:37,120
Your Majesty, don't be soft.

192
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,919
If we don't kill her,

193
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,519
Chen State might face a huge disaster.

194
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,559
Good point.

195
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,600
You're righteous.

196
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:46,592
Oh, my!

197
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:49,632
Oh, my!

198
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,159
T-This...

199
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,240
Are you my secret guard?

200
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,039
He's not loyal.

201
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,039
Well, I...

202
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,279
It's so late.

203
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,240
A surprise attack?

204
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,200
For the bamboo slip?

205
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,320
No, that's not right.

206
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:08,960
Madam.

207
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,759
I can't watch men

208
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,399
bullying their own wives.

209
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,360
So, I'll certainly

210
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,000
make this cold-hearted man pay.

211
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,039
Come on.

212
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,679
Who are you?

213
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,200
This is between her and me.

214
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,720
You stay out of this.

215
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,600
Do you think my wife will
be provoked by you

216
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,320
and betray me?

217
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:30,679
I will do that.

218
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,879
Long Qi.

219
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,799
It's still not safe for me.

220
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,480
Put me down.

221
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,960
We split up and run.

222
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,279
I'm not your enemy.

223
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,080
Go find Long Qi.

224
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,679
You hit him.

225
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,120
The rumors are actually true.

226
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
His Majesty

227
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,320
likes this.

228
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,480
This is too exciting.

229
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:51,840
How annoying!

230
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,360
Zhang Xiao'er did what I always

231
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,279
wanted to do the most.

232
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,919
Well...

233
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,639
Should we symbolically save him?

234
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,480
Can you fight her?

235
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,480
No, I can't.

236
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,799
So, just give up.

237
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,000
Anyway,

238
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,120
she won't kill him.

239
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,480
I have to say.

240
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,759
Beating the husband

241
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,240
looks pretty good.

242
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,159
Yeah.

243
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,039
So good.

244
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Attack me?

245
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,360
No.

246
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,480
So why did you do that?

247
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
I'm sorry.

248
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,559
So,

249
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,799
does it make you

250
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,440
reflect,

251
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,600
realize your mistakes,

252
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,399
and change your ways?

253
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,840
Hit me!

254
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,039
If you dare,

255
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,919
j-just

256
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:34,919
kill me.

257
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,080
At worst,

258
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,120
I'll start over.

259
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,519
I don't know.

260
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,559
Why do you always want to get some money

261
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,519
and escape this place

262
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,159
instead of making an effort
to be a good king?

263
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,320
You really want to know why?

264
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,320
Alright.

265
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,679
Let me tell you why.

266
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
When I was little,

267
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,519
I was often hungry

268
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:56,679
and cold.

269
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,919
Since I became the king,

270
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,919
they've tried to poison me

271
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,600
and assassinate me.

272
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,679
Anyway, I'll die sooner or later.

273
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,919
So, I just want

274
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,440
to get some money

275
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:07,600
and leave

276
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,960
this place I've never left.

277
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,919
Am I wrong?

278
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,799
Anyway, nobody cares how I feel.

279
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,559
I don't want to be the king.

280
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,120
I don't want to be controlled.

281
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,679
I want to be me!

282
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,120
To be truly me!

283
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,320
I care.

284
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,080
What?

285
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,720
Others may not care,

286
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,559
but I care.

287
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,639
The only purpose for my existence

288
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,200
is to make you

289
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,720
become a real righteous man

290
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,440
and have the courage

291
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,399
to face your mission.

292
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,960
My mission?

293
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
What

294
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,080
is it?

295
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
Your mission

296
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,720
is to defeat Wu State

297
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,200
and make Chen State prosperous

298
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
and peaceful.

299
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,799
Got it?

300
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,799
Long Qi.

301
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,360
Come out.

302
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,080
Long Qi.

303
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,399
Long Qi!

304
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:34,679
Long Qi.

305
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,399
- Your Majesty.
- Oh, my!

306
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,840
You choose.

307
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,559
Either I apply medicine,

308
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,039
or you whip me.

309
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,360
Is there a possibility

310
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,960
that you apply medicine first,

311
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,279
and then I whip you?

312
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:00,320
Shall we

313
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,696
go in and take a look?

314
00:15:01,696 --> 00:15:02,480
No...

315
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,919
No need.

316
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,399
What if His Majesty doesn't need help?

317
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,039
What if he's enjoying it?

318
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,600
If we rush in...

319
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,519
Your Majesty.

320
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,720
Bear with it.

321
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,320
Long Qi,

322
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
you count.

323
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,000
How many bruises are on my back?

324
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:20,919
Your Majesty.

325
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,639
They are overlapping,

326
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,200
so I can't count.

327
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,320
You go

328
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,200
and ask Grand Tutor Wang

329
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,039
to check the laws

330
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,919
to see what I can do
to punish that vicious woman.

331
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,039
I think there's no need for that.

332
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,879
Grand Tutor Wang is old.

333
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,840
He can't be whipped either.

334
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:48,679
I can't give in.

335
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,159
I must take revenge

336
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,519
on her.

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,600
Long Qi,

338
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,559
what other skills do you have?

339
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,440
I must kill her.

340
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,519
But why must we kill her?

341
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,679
She's your wife.

342
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,360
Why must we kill her?

343
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:07,480
You tell me.

344
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,000
Do we kill her

345
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,799
for the bamboo slip?

346
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,240
Bamboo slip?

347
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,039
Very clever.

348
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,080
Bamboo slip.

349
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,440
His Majesty has improved.

350
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,639
He even tries to kill me.

351
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,399
So, you hope he can kill you?

352
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,000
A king wants to kill his own queen.

353
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,440
Truly extraordinary.

354
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,200
(This foolish king)

355
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,759
(is bound to lose his nation
to the Wu State.)

356
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,440
Your Grace.

357
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,960
We did it all

358
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,519
for this bamboo slip.

359
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,159
What on earth is it?

360
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,559
Do you know what the words

361
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,320
on the bamboo slip refer to?

362
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,159
No, I don't.

363
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Imperial Seal.

364
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,480
Imperial Seal?

365
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,080
That's why I say

366
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,799
His Majesty has improved.

367
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,079
I underestimated him this time.

368
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,680
Do you want it?

369
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,680
I heard of something.

370
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,240
The ruler is committed

371
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,720
to making the nation prosper.

372
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,160
The Imperial Seal is bestowed by Heaven.

373
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,079
It's the blessed seal of emperors.

374
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:22,720
A legend says

375
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,160
whoever gets it gets the world.

376
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,200
If you lose it,

377
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,640
you lose your destiny.

378
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,160
It is a legend,

379
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,680
but everyone wants it.

380
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,920
If you want it,

381
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,880
take it.

382
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,079
I don't want it.

383
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,400
If you don't,

384
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
what about Prince Wu?

385
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,480
(Of course, he wants it.)

386
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,200
(But can this bamboo slip)

387
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,240
(really lead to the Imperial Seal?)

388
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,720
If you don't want it,

389
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,319
give it

390
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,440
to Chen Xiaohua.

391
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,279
Aren't you afraid I'll run off
with the bamboo slip?

392
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,359
You won't.

393
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,960
Don't you also want

394
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,799
to see if this foolish king

395
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,640
can finally find the Imperial Seal?

396
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,279
(She's testing me.)

397
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,000
Go ahead.

398
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,599
Go and get some medicine

399
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,319
for him.

400
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:14,279
Yes.

401
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,880
Come in.

402
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:37,720
Master.

403
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,680
News from the palace.

404
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,079
His Majesty found something
on the beam of his bedroom.

405
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,279
What thing?

406
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,039
A bamboo slip.

407
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,799
According to the news,

408
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,359
it might be related

409
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,920
to the lost Imperial Seal
of the Wu Dynasty.

410
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,440
Imperial Seal?

411
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,240
Come to think of it,

412
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,759
Chen State's royal family
doesn't have the Imperial Seal.

413
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,400
It's possible

414
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,680
that it was lost
by some former king long ago.

415
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,880
Besides,

416
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,319
the Imperial Seal is useless.

417
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,720
When troops attack the country,

418
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,319
what can an Imperial Seal do?

419
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,720
My brother wants it.

420
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,680
Prince Wu wants it too.

421
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,359
I think

422
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,680
the Zhang family should not work
for the Chen State anymore.

423
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,559
They should have been the ruler.

424
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,559
Dowager.

425
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,720
Mind your words.

426
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,319
Why?

427
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,880
I married an old man when I was young.

428
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,720
Since I finally outlasted him,

429
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,599
why can't I do as I please?

430
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,720
Look,

431
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,240
in this palace,

432
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,240
I have no equal.

433
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
It's so boring.

434
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,720
A powerful woman

435
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,519
is lonely.

436
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,720
Alright.

437
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:00,920
Send someone

438
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,720
to pass the message to Prince Wu.

439
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,519
We can't let Zhang Xiao'er

440
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,839
keep acting so outrageously!

441
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:11,799
You saw it too.

442
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,880
She doesn't even respect His Majesty.

443
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,160
Calm down.

444
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,200
I can't.

445
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,799
She even hit King Chen.

446
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,960
So, she might kill us one day.

447
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,640
Then you tell me

448
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,799
what you want to do.

449
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,599
Can we

450
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,599
defeat that weird woman?

451
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,640
But we have to do something.

452
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,519
Of course, I know.

453
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,079
Have you forgotten our uncle's advice?

454
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,359
No matter how arrogant Lady Xiao is,

455
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,720
as long as we have kids,

456
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,920
she can't touch us.

457
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,440
I bought this medicine at great expense.

458
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,720
It's called Bewitching Powder.

459
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,200
No matter how steadfast Chen Xiaohua is,

460
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,200
he'll have to bow down

461
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,079
to us.

462
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,759
But

463
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,839
I am not ready yet.

464
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,319
I'm not either.

465
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,160
It's no big deal.

466
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:58,079
I'll go first,

467
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,920
alright?

468
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,400
Your Majesty,

469
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,480
how did you get injured so seriously?

470
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,640
It's fine.

471
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,880
You're the ruler.

472
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,400
Your health matters.

473
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,640
We're worried about you.

474
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,039
Your Majesty,

475
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,519
shall I ask the physician
to examine you again?

476
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:16,880
It's troublesome.

477
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:17,680
No need.

478
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,359
I paid a lot for your medicine.

479
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,359
It treats injuries.

480
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,000
Please take it.

481
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,359
Greetings, Your Majesty,

482
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,000
Lady Zhen, and Lady Bao.

483
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,880
Lady Xiao sent you here, right?

484
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:42,880
Put it down.

485
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,279
Tell Lady Xiao

486
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,640
that Lady Bao and I
will attend to His Majesty tonight.

487
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,839
Your Majesty,

488
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,240
Lady Xiao told me
to watch you finish this medicine.

489
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:52,480
Insolent!

490
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
How dare you command His Majesty.

491
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:55,480
Get out of here!

492
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,200
Zhen'er.

493
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,200
Did he take an overdose?

494
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,720
Maybe.

495
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,720
Ten people can share that potion.

496
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,559
Don't panic.

497
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,240
Go after him.

498
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,119
Jiujiu.

499
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,519
Jiujiu.

500
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:26,440
Jiujiu.

501
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,119
Jiujiu.

502
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,119
Jiujiu.

503
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,839
What are you doing?

504
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:51,480
Are you

505
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:53,799
asleep?

506
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,960
Yes, you are.

507
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,400
Jiujiu.

508
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,079
I'm poisoned.

509
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,359
I'm about to die.

510
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:07,160
But

511
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,400
before my reincarnation,

512
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
there's something

513
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,079
I

514
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,920
must tell you.

515
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,880
I'm afraid

516
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,240
that after my reincarnation,

517
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,720
there are many things

518
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,640
you won't remember.

519
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,240
Actually,

520
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,440
since the first time I saw you...

521
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,000
Forget it.

522
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,839
Anyway, I can't live anymore.

523
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,000
I failed

524
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,799
to finish your training.

525
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:46,640
Look.

526
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Look.

527
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,559
In this place,

528
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,759
I was reincarnated again and again.

529
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
For me,

530
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,920
it's just a cage.

531
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,519
Whatever I do,

532
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,960
I can't break free.

533
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:04,480
But

534
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:08,079
before I die this time,

535
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:10,880
I want

536
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,039
to indulge myself once.

537
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,640
After you wake up,

538
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
you can hit me

539
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,240
and scold me.

540
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,279
I

541
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,480
will take it all.

542
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,240
You know what?

543
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,160
This is

544
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,920
my favorite place,

545
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,799
because this is

546
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,920
the highest place in this city.

547
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,799
It's also the place closest to freedom.

548
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,039
Actually,

549
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,559
I really never wanted to be the king.

550
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,319
I have been wanting

551
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,440
to be

552
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,319
a simple flower farmer.

553
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,759
But so what?

554
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,000
I can't change anything at all.

555
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Nothing is decided by me.

556
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,880
Actually, I don't want to kill you.

557
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,039
I also don't want to be against you.

558
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,359
Instead,

559
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,640
your appearance

560
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,759
made me discover

561
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,359
the joys of being human.

562
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,000
I hope in the next life,

563
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,359
you can still be with me.

564
00:26:42,984 --> 00:26:48,648
(In 2099)

565
00:26:59,039 --> 00:26:59,960
(I did the checks)

566
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:02,160
(and found the patient has symptoms)

567
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,400
(of chronic external
radiation sickness.)

568
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
(His brain nerves have
been severely damaged.)

569
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,279
(Currently, there is no way)

570
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,440
(to cure his illness.)

571
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,319
(So, if I can find a way)

572
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:13,039
(to stop his brain from atrophying)

573
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,599
(and restore his brain nerves,)

574
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
(will he be saved?)

575
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,039
(Yes.)

576
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,559
(But restoring his brain nerves)

577
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,960
(is impossible.)

578
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:20,680
(So,)

579
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,599
(you have to prepare mentally.)

580
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:34,880
My boyfriend

581
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,640
had an accident.

582
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,680
He is now facing

583
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,960
irreversible brain atrophy.

584
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,880
If this continues,

585
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,400
he will die soon.

586
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,640
I think

587
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,480
that your experiment

588
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,079
might be able to help him.

589
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:58,680
Help him wake up.

590
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,240
As long as he wins the game as planned,

591
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,200
I'll be pretty sure

592
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,160
to repair his brain nerves.

593
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,119
The moment has come.

594
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,048
Let's witness it together.

595
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:55,040
(Immortality Plan)

596
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,192
(Collecting brain data)

597
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,880
Data upload completed.

598
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,799
He has successfully entered the game.

599
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:38,079
Player No. 0001 Chen Xiaohua,

600
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:40,960
welcome to the Virtual Universe
of the Blue Brain Technology.

601
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,000
Who's talking to me?

602
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:45,519
Where's Tao?

603
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,160
Where am I?

604
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,359
Please select your character

605
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,680
in the virtual world.

606
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,240
What do you mean?

607
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,000
This is also part of the interview?

608
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,839
Again.

609
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,440
Please select your character

610
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,720
in the virtual world.

611
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,160
Why should I listen to you?

612
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,680
That's humiliating.

613
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,240
I won't do that.

614
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,440
What can you do?

615
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:10,559
According to the calculation,

616
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,640
you'll die.

617
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,480
You're bluffing.

618
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,119
I'm not scared at all.

619
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,079
Wait.

620
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,039
I'll pick

621
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
the king who's brave,

622
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,480
skilled with a sword,

623
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,720
and can heal.

624
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,039
Hehe, joke detected.

625
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,200
I should respond

626
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,960
and express appreciation for your humor.

627
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,839
Hehe.

628
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,039
Based on system recognition,

629
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:35,480
your chosen option

630
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,680
is the king of a nation.

631
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,599
Friendly tip.

632
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,960
After entering the game world,

633
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,079
all players

634
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,480
