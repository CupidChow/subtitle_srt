00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
...

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,500
He's live todaiznd

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,100
Bastard

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,740
A regrets

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,600
Da Si Ma

6
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,300
I remember

7
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

8
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,300
It was a long time ago when the Qing army was fighting.

9
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,300
The Qi army was in trouble.

10
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,300
They were in a hurry to attack the Qing army.

11
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,300
This beef liver is just a delicacy.

12
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,300
Da Sima,

13
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,300
have you ever been afraid of war?

14
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,300
I was afraid.

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,300
At first, I was afraid.

16
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,300
I was afraid that I would die.

17
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,300
I was afraid that I would not be able to return to the capital.

18
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,300
I was afraid that I would not be able to see my wife and children.

19
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,300
But after I saw more blood, I realized that

20
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,300
I was afraid that I would be useless.

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,300
I was only in charge of the court.

22
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,300
I was afraid that I would be useless.

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
I was only in charge of the court.

24
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,300
I know that

25
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,300
I helped you a lot this evening.

26
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,300
I helped you a lot this evening.

27
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,300
But you stopped me many times.

28
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,300
But you stopped me many times.

29
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,300
Fei Yi,

30
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,300
I think you have grown up.

31
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,300
You went to my house last time to help me.

32
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,300
You were like a snake.

33
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
You were like a snake.

34
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,300
You were like a snake.

35
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,300
When I was young, I was with the king.

36
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,300
I think I can't do anything without the king.

37
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,300
I have been devoted to the country.

38
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,300
I have been devoted to the country.

39
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,300
But you are a greedy man.

40
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,300
You are a kind man.

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,300
You are a wise man.

42
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,300
You can't be a good man.

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,300
You should be kind to Chen Bo.

44
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
You should be kind to Chen Bo.

45
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,300
Prince, don't worry.

46
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,300
You're not afraid of any dead soldier.

47
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Even if you are passed the buck,

48
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,300
you will face many human deaths.

49
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,300
Step into your lobby and determine your fate.

50
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,300
This air is dramatic.

51
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,300
I hope you could not compare the same.

52
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,300
The king is powerful.

53
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,300
He pro figura war is free matter.

54
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
He is powerful.

55
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,300
I swear by morale,

56
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,300
he is the king.

57
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,300
He is a talented man,

58
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,300
No, these people are not dead.

59
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,300
Wang Xiang,

60
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,300
at the end of my childhood,

61
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,300
I was so drunk.

62
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
Did you achieve your goal?

63
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,300
Is this really

64
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,300
the result you want?

65
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,300
I'm not sure.

66
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
I'm not sure.

67
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,300
I'm not sure.

68
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,300
I'm not sure.

69
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
I'm not sure.

70
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
I'm not sure.

71
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,300
I'm not sure.

72
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,300
I'm not sure.

73
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,300
I'm not sure.

74
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
I'm not sure.

75
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
I'm not sure.

76
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,300
I'm not sure.

77
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,300
I'm not sure.

78
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,300
I'm not sure.

79
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,300
I'm not sure.

80
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,300
I'm not sure.

81
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,300
I'm not sure.

82
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
I'm not sure.

83
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
I'm not sure.

84
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
I'm not sure.

85
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,300
I'm not sure.

86
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,300
I'm not sure.

87
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,300
I'm not sure.

88
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,300
I'm not sure.

89
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,300
I'm not sure.

90
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,300
I'm not sure.

91
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,300
I'm not sure.

92
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,300
I'm not sure.

93
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,300
I'm not sure.

94
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,300
I'm not sure.

95
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
I'm not sure.

96
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
We're down the hill.

97
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,300
There's a carriage.

98
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Mr. Pao.

99
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,300
Is this the right way?

100
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,300
It should be here.

101
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,300
But we...

102
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
Hongqian.

103
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,300
Is there someone there?

104
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Go and ask.

105
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,300
Yes.

106
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Miss.

107
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Miss.

108
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,300
Chen Huo?

109
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,300
You never heard of it.

110
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
The Grandfather of the Team is very educated.

111
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,300
Maybe you know it.

112
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,300
You can ask him later.

113
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Okay.

114
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
Zhao'er.

115
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,300
You're back.

116
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Brother Huo.

117
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,300
These are...

118
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,300
They're from Chen.

119
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,300
They came from Guishan.

120
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
They're going back to Chen.

121
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
They're lost.

122
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
I want to take them to the Grandmaster.

123
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Look at their hair.

124
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
I'll go with you.

125
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
What's the matter?

126
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,300
Where's the village?

127
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,300
Didn't you know about the village?

128
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
I've told you.

129
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,300
Is it the river in the village?

130
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,300
No.

131
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
It's not enough to go down the river.

132
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,300
It's the Grandfather's Department.

133
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,300
There are hundreds of places to go.

134
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,300
It's not enough to go down.

135
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,300
Yes.

136
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,300
I've heard about it.

137
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
What kind of story is this?

138
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
It's a story of the Tang Dynasty.

139
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,300
Shall we go?

140
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,300
Let's go.

141
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
The kid is here.

142
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,300
Don't turn around.

143
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,300
Grandmaster.

144
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
Grandmaster.

145
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,300
Look.

146
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,300
A guest is here.

147
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,300
Look.

148
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Grandmaster.

149
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,300
Zhao'er.

150
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,300
These are...

151
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,300
They're from Chen.

152
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,300
They came from Guishan.

153
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,300
They're going back to Chen.

154
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Welcome, everyone,

155
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
to the Grandmaster's Department.

156
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,300
I'm the Grandmaster of the village.

157
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
I'm Fu Yi.

158
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
Sir.

159
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
Is this the Inner City of Chen?

160
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,300
I've heard about it.

161
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,300
I don't know where Chen is.

162
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,300
What about the State of Wu?

163
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
I don't know.

164
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Are you a local or a musician?

165
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,300
I think they came from the mountains.

166
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,300
They first organized the country's break-in.

167
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
They didn't have to make a mess.

168
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
They came here to settle the situation.

169
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
When I was the head of the village,

170
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
I was looking forward to it.

171
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Make a mess?

172
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,300
They would have been gone long ago.

173
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Since they're still in the war,

174
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
why don't you go back?

175
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,300
We won't go.

176
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,300
It's a good place.

177
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,300
We're all very smart.

178
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,300
We're all very smart.

179
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,300
Lu San.

180
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
We came from Guishan.

181
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
We're going back to Chen.

182
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,300
But we're still in the middle of the road.

183
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,300
There's a girl who brought us to the village.

184
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,300
So that's how it is.

185
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,300
I don't know how to call you.

186
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,300
They all call me Young Master Wang.

187
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Young Master Wang.

188
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
Long Qing.

189
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
Mr. Long.

190
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,300
Cai Yi.

191
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,300
Miss Cai.

192
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Call me Xiao.

193
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,300
Miss Xiao.

194
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
They're so weird.

195
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,300
They're still in the dead end.

196
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,300
Are the few injured?

197
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,300
I'm not injured, am I?

198
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
Big Hu.

199
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Call the wolves in the village.

200
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
Okay.

201
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,300
Let them see if they're injured.

202
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
Okay.

203
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
Wait for me.

204
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
Wait for me.

205
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
It's not a big deal.

206
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
It's all written by others.

207
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,300
The bandits.

208
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,300
It's good that you're fine.

209
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,300
It's good that you're fine.

210
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
The few of you who came from far away

211
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,300
should have a rest here for a while.

212
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,300
Zhao.

213
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,300
Take the few of you to the village.

214
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,300
Thank you.

215
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,300
Okay.

216
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,300
Come with me.

217
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Come on, please.

218
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
Come on.

219
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,300
Please.

220
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,300
This way, please.

221
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Please.

222
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Please.

223
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,300
Don't be angry.

224
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,300
No, thank you, Zhao.

225
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
You guys have a rest.

226
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,300
I'll go first.

227
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
Okay.

228
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Wang.

229
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,300
Something's wrong.

230
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,300
Be careful.

231
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,300
The village head or the village head

232
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
can't believe what they say.

233
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,300
Why are you so quiet?

234
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,300
I thought they were quite similar.

235
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,300
Okay.

236
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,300
I'm tired.

237
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,300
Go to bed early.

238
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
We'll leave when we find the carriage.

239
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Wang.

240
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
It's late.

241
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,300
I've prepared some clean clothes for you.

242
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Why don't you stay tonight?

243
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,300
I'll do it.

244
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,300
I'll do it.

245
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,300
You must be hungry.

246
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,300
You just made it.

247
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,300
Eat while it's hot.

248
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,300
Eat while it's hot.

249
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,300
Eat while it's hot.

250
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
This is the best wolf curse we have here.

251
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,300
The village head told us

252
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,300
to give it to the people.

253
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,300
Then,

254
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,300
show it to them.

255
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,660
They should have some

256
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,300
serious injuries.

257
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,300
Okay.

258
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,300
Please.

259
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
I'll take you two

260
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,300
to the Mo Yi Geng Yibo.

261
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Okay.

262
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
Long Qi,

263
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,300
stay here.

264
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Zhao Kang Wang.

265
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,300
Young Master.

266
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Yes.

267
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,300
Let's eat.

268
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
Let's eat.

269
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,300
Sister Xiao'er.

270
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Zhao'er.

271
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,300
I made this rabbit myself.

272
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,300
It has herbs inside.

273
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
It can be eaten.

274
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,300
I didn't make it.

275
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,300
It looks good.

276
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Don't be angry.

277
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
The people here

278
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,300
are so considerate.

279
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
We rarely have people from Weixiang.

280
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,300
Then, thank you.

281
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,300
What are you laughing at?

282
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
Xifan.

283
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
I've dreamed of your rabbit.

284
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
And the present.

285
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Wang.

286
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,300
You go first.

287
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,300
I checked it.

288
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,300
The room is fine.

289
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
I just stayed in the west.

290
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,300
I still think

291
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,300
there are some weird things here.

292
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
I'll stay here tonight.

293
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,300
Wang Xiang.

294
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
Is this really

295
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
the result you want?

296
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,300
Deng Si Feng.

297
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,300
Wang.

298
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
Do you think

299
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
their death

300
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
is meaningful?

301
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Zhang Taifei is in love with Xun Qing.

302
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Actually, I think

303
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
it's the best

304
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,300
to have the right to

305
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
sacrifice the people he loves.

306
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,300
This time,

307
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,300
although it's a bit different from the plan,

308
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,300
at the end,

309
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
we still have to kill the people.

310
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
Although we sacrificed tens of brothers,

311
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,300
but in the end,

312
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
we have thousands of people

313
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,300
who are suffering from the death.

314
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,300
I think Mr. Zhang

315
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,300
will be happy

316
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
if he's in heaven.

317
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
But I don't think it's a risk.

318
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,300
What should we do?

319
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,300
If you kill me,

320
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,300
I'll let you go.

321
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
I'll kill you.

322
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,300
After Mr. Wu's death,

323
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
I found that this is not the end

324
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,300
I had in my mind.

325
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,300
It's a new beginning.

326
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,300
Yes.

327
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Mr. Wu is dead,

328
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
but Mr. Wu is still there.

329
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300
He will have a new king.

330
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Mr. Wu

331
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
Mr. Wu

332
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Isn't he a master?

333
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,300
Who is it?

334
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,300
I'm a doctor.

335
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
It's okay.

336
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
Who gave me the toilet?

337
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
You slept with a pig.

338
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
I'm afraid you'll die.

339
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,300
Today is the day

340
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,300
of our grand wedding in Shangyao Village.

341
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,300
You two are the best

342
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,300
and the most powerful people

343
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,300
in the world.

344
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
You two are the best.

345
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,300
You two are the best.

346
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
You two are the best.

347
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
Go and kill two pigs.

348
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
25 chickens, okay?

349
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,300
Hurry up.

350
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Remember,

351
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
you must clean the pig's blood.

352
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,300
Hurry up.

353
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,300
Go.

354
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
Mr. Wu,

355
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,300
how is the carriage we talked about yesterday?

356
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,300
Yes.

357
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,300
I remember when I was a kid.

358
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,300
Big Hu,

359
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,300
go and see if the carriage is ready.

360
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,300
The carriage?

361
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,300
I'll go and see.

362
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
You haven't had breakfast yet, right?

363
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Zhao'er,

364
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,300
hurry up and prepare the food for the guests.

365
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Okay.

366
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,300
It's still early in the morning.

367
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,300
You two,

368
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
go over there and cook.

369
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,300
The breakfast is coming.

370
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,300
Please.

371
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
The dumplings are here.

372
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,300
Thank you, Zhao'er.

373
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,300
Thank you.

374
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
Oh,

375
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
why are the tables all together?

376
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
Is it some kind of pig's blood?

377
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,300
Yes.

378
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
The carriage is a happy event.

379
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,300
The guests will be

380
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,300
all by themselves.

381
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,300
They will have a meal together.

382
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,300
And they will have a meal together.

383
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
It's so nice.

384
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,300
It's so nice.

385
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Mr. Su.

386
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Mr. Su.

387
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,300
You all are some

388
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,300
who are used to

389
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
making a lot of food.

390
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
It's delicious.

391
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,300
It's very good, Mr. Su.

392
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Mr. Su,

393
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,300
how is our carriage?

394
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,300
The carriage,

395
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,300
we don't have many people in the village.

396
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,300
We found out that there was a problem

397
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,300
with the carriage yesterday.

398
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,300
I wonder how it was

399
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
after a night of practice.

400
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
There is one more thing.

401
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,300
We don't have many people in the village.

402
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
Could you please

403
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,300
help me to make a little carriage?

404
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,300
What carriage?

405
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,300
I want a little carriage.

406
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
How is it?

407
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
It's 10 cm on the left.

408
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
What?

409
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,300
10 cm is...

410
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,300
3 inches.

411
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
3 inches.

412
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Mr. Wang.

413
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
I see.

414
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
It's okay.

415
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,300
Can I have this?

416
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,300
Mr. Su.

417
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
Have you fixed the carriage?

418
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,300
I think so.

419
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,300
That's good.

420
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Brother.

421
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Have you fixed the carriage?

422
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,300
The carriage...

423
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Take it.

424
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,300
The carriage?

425
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,300
The carriage is fine.

426
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,300
We'll get up

427
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
after we finish the lantern.

428
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,300
Wait.

429
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,300
The carriage...

430
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
The carriage is broken?

431
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Mr. Su.

432
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,300
The carriage is fine.

433
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
Since the carriage is fixed,

434
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
we'll get up.

435
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
When I get to Chen State,

436
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
I'll send the carriage back

437
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,300
to the village first.

438
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,300
By the way,

439
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
I'll give you a big gift.

440
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
I'll give it to the bride and groom.

441
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
Young Master Wang.

442
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,300
I've hung up.

443
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,300
Good.

444
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,300
Chief.

445
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
We won't continue to retire.

446
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,300
The mountain is high and the water is far.

447
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,300
If there's a chance,

448
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,300
we'll come back

449
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
to visit you.

450
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Mr. Wang.

451
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,300
Please.

452
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,300
We're not hungry.

453
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,300
We sincerely

454
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,300
invite you all to stay.

455
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Even if you eat,

456
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
smoke,

457
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,300
drink and drink.

458
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
You're in a hurry.

459
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
Is there anything important?

460
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,300
Yes.

461
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Yes.

462
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
We've been married for a long time.

463
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,300
We've met each other several times.

464
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,300
I hope you can stay.

465
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,300
You're so happy.

466
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,300
That's great.

467
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Sister Xiao'er.

468
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Mr. Wang.

469
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
Don't leave.

470
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Please stay.

471
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Where's the wedding dress?

472
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Where's the wedding dress?

473
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Since it's a long-distance banquet,

474
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
please stay.

475
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Don't worry.

476
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,300
Great.

477
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,300
Great.

478
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
Great.

479
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,300
What are you doing?

480
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Ma,

481
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,300
you've fallen too slowly.

482
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
I'll go and get some fish for you.

483
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
It's okay.

484
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
I want to get some fish

485
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,300
by myself.

486
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,300
Come on.

487
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,300
Caiyi,

488
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,300
get me some.

489
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
No need.

490
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
I want to get some fish by myself.

491
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
It's okay,

492
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,300
I'll go and catch it.

493
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,300
I won't fall in love with you.

494
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
I want to get some fish

495
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,300
by myself.

496
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,300
Don't worry.

497
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
I'll catch it.

498
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
I'll go and catch it.

499
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,300
I won't fall in love with you.

500
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,300
I want to catch it.

501
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,300
I want to get some fish by myself.

502
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,300
Longqi,

503
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
let him catch it by himself.

504
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
Caiyi and you go back to the kitchen.

505
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Prepare the fish for later.

506
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
Put the stove on.

507
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,300
We'll go back.

508
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Yes.

509
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,300
Xifeng,

510
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
I just want to sit here quietly.

511
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
I want to catch some fish by myself.

512
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
I know.

513
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,300
I'll go with you.

514
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,300
I'll go with you.

515
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
It's so delicious.

516
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
Good, good, good, good, young master.

517
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,300
You're a good cook.

518
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Come on.

519
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
This fish

520
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
must be tasted.

521
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
Look, look, look.

522
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,300
It's for you.

523
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,300
Here,

524
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
the fish made by Mr. Wang.

525
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,300
The fish is so delicious.

526
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,300
It's delicious.

527
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
It's really good.

528
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
It's delicious.

529
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Mr. Wang is coming.

530
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
They're coming.

531
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
They're coming.

532
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
It's delicious.

533
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,300
It's delicious.

534
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,300
It's delicious.

535
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,300
It's delicious.

536
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,300
It's delicious.

537
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,300
It's delicious.

538
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,300
It's delicious.
