1
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:09,320
(In 2099)

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,240
My boyfriend

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,960
had an accident.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,240
He's now facing
irreversible brain atrophy.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:16,760
Doctor,

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,280
if this experiment can succeed,

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,359
my boyfriend might be saved.

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,359
This is my only hope now.

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,359
Dying over 70 times in a month.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,199
He often plays games at home.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,039
How can't he even clear the first level?

12
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,000
If he can't pass,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,159
his neurons won't be repaired.

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,079
It's just a waste of resources.

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,680
Access restricted.

16
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,480
Please enter the emergency
authorization code within 30 seconds,

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,519
or the alarm will activate.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,040
(The emergency authorization code?)

19
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,000
Ten seconds until alarm.

20
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,359
Nine.

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,560
Eight.

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,959
Seven.

23
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,400
Six.

24
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:33,920
Five.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,239
Four.

26
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,680
Three.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,920
Two.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Without my iris authentication,

29
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,079
you cannot enter the system.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,959
Are you going to help him
pass the level?

31
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,480
I can't just sit here

32
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,040
and doing nothing.

33
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,079
First,

34
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,959
no one can modify the game script,

35
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,560
not even me.

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,000
Second,

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,199
if you go in

38
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,159
to help him solve the problems,

39
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,120
you'll alter our purpose

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,319
of making him face

41
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,960
and overcome difficulties himself.

42
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,919
If you want to save him,

43
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,599
let him face challenges alone

44
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,039
and wake up on his own.

45
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,360
But now it seems

46
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,400
too difficult for him.

47
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,080
I always thought you were rational.

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,319
You should understand

49
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,400
that in this world,

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,159
there are too many people
with fates like his.

51
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,319
Every day,

52
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,599
every hour,

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,719
every second,

54
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,800
someone dies from radiation sickness.

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,080
But we still have to keep going,

56
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,439
day after day.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,879
Doctor,

58
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,479
you don't want

59
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,719
your experiment
to end in failure, right?

60
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,719
You also want his brain neurons

61
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,319
to be repaired in this experiment,

62
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:54,960
right?

63
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,360
It will be a feat
for human civilization.

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,439
Let me enter

65
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,879
and choose

66
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,599
the strongest support character,

67
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,159
like...

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,159
The Warrioress.

69
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,439
Fine.

70
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
But you cannot use Warrioress's

71
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,319
special skills to help him.

72
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,199
I understand.

73
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,599
I will only take this role

74
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,000
to guide him

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,360
to face

76
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,560
and solve problems.

77
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,159
If that's the case,

78
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,159
it might work.

79
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,439
You know

80
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,319
where the boundaries are, right?

81
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:36,960
Yes.

82
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,000
I am quite clear.

83
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,719
Let me ask one more thing.

84
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,560
Why do you insist on doing all this?

85
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,159
You should be very clear

86
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,000
that as a core project manager

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,080
of Blue Brain Group,

88
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,199
you have enough resources to survive,

89
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,560
even to enjoy

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,159
better living conditions soon.

91
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,360
That's because

92
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,879
of a tomato.

93
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,400
A tomato?

94
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,840
Player ID 0002, Jiang Tao.

95
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,840
Welcome to the Virtual Universe
of the Blue Brain Technology.

96
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,879
Assign me the strongest

97
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,519
support character.

98
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,480
Warrioress has been selected for you.

99
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,040
Notice:

100
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,319
After entering the game world,

101
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,040
all players

102
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,240
will lose their memories
in the real world.

103
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,279
Where are you taking me?

104
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,519
The Cold Palace.

105
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
To rescue Chen Xiaohua.

106
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,839
Are you sure you want to rescue him?

107
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,920
He's the former king's eldest son,

108
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,240
but he's never left there.

109
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,199
I gave him chances before,

110
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,920
but he just wastes his days,

111
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,079
never doing anything meaningful
for Chen State.

112
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,759
He only cares about how to have fun.

113
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,319
I'm sure.

114
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,800
As long as we free him

115
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,720
and restore his throne,

116
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,680
he'd focus on governance

117
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,959
for Chen's prosperity.

118
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,360
Alright.

119
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,519
I believe you.

120
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,199
But don't forget

121
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,560
what you promised me.

122
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,480
If Wu State invades...

123
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,079
If Wu State invades...

124
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,959
I promise you.

125
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,240
Immortal.

126
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,920
Monster.

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,360
Rookie.

128
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,040
Honey.

129
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,759
Do you think

130
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,759
I'm a failed king?

131
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,439
No.

132
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,040
You've brought rain for the people

133
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,439
and punished corrupt officials.

134
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,120
=Episode 9=,
But most of the officials

135
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,600
(State Falls, Yet Not Vanishes)
have been either arrested

136
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,839
or executed.

137
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,519
Wu Army

138
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,000
could breach the barriers any moment.

139
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,120
If what Eunuch Li said is true,

140
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,160
they'll break into the capital

141
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,199
in less than half a month.

142
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,639
Do you regret auditing the accounts?

143
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,240
No, I don't.

144
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,879
At the rain-praying ceremony,

145
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
it was the first time

146
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,919
I saw your approval.

147
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,320
Your approval means more

148
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,159
to me than anything else

149
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,679
in the world.

150
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,519
For you,

151
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,759
I'd do anything.

152
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,639
For you,

153
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,879
I want to make Chen State strong,

154
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,600
defeat Wu State,

155
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,279
and then

156
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,679
live a peaceful life with you.

157
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,440
I'm rambling.

158
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,080
But what if

159
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,600
we can't defeat Wu?

160
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,679
In my eyes,

161
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,320
Chen State is like this lake.

162
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,759
I

163
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,159
stand far away on the shore,

164
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,399
watching them

165
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,960
fight for power.

166
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,240
But I don't care.

167
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,679
I don't care about anything they do.

168
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,799
Because I thought

169
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,720
I'd leave here someday.

170
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,559
I'd leave this lake,

171
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,879
not being the king.

172
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,159
Now, you still think so?

173
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,639
Now I realize

174
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,120
I'm not on the shore at all.

175
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,039
Just like them,

176
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,840
I'm stuck in the lake, drowning.

177
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,759
When I finally mustered the courage
to look at the lake closely,

178
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,559
I found it's about to disappear.

179
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
The lake is always here.

180
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,919
If you can face it head-on,

181
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
it's never too late.

182
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,639
Really?

183
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,519
I believe so.

184
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,279
Honey.

185
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,440
Remember.

186
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,240
No matter what happens,

187
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,120
I will always be by your side.

188
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,720
Your Majesty.

189
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Grand Marshal and Grand Tutor Wang
want to see you.

190
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,559
Your Majesty.

191
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Your Majesty!

192
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,720
I am guilty!

193
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,759
I have reviewed the files

194
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,320
on the embezzlement case.

195
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,080
More than half of the money

196
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:27,120
went to my disciples.

197
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,320
Though I was unaware,

198
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,240
I bear responsibility.

199
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,960
I was foolish, Your Majesty.

200
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,519
Forget it.

201
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
For this case,

202
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,080
just conclude it.

203
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,559
Your Majesty.

204
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,799
I've made up my mind.

205
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,720
Tomorrow morning,

206
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,879
I'll resign from all my positions

207
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,320
and retire.

208
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,600
Grand Tutor.

209
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,360
You can't leave.

210
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,279
Your Majesty.

211
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,720
I am also guilty.

212
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,360
I was derelict in my duty.

213
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,720
Of supervision and management.

214
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:16,559
I'll surrender all military power

215
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,919
and accept your punishment.

216
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,919
You...

217
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,279
I've said,

218
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,639
the embezzlement case is closed.

219
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,159
You knew nothing about it.

220
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,919
Now, we're at the critical moment,

221
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,080
and you want to abandon your posts?

222
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:32,559
What for?

223
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,600
Want me to resist Wu alone?

224
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,519
The uninformed are not guilty.

225
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,960
You're both elders of two reigns.

226
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,320
When the former king ruled,

227
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,120
Chen State was prosperous,
reigning as a dominant power.

228
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,799
Now,

229
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,000
Wu State is eyeing,

230
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,360
while our national power is weak.

231
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,639
If anyone is at fault,

232
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,559
it's me.

233
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,039
Your Majesty!

234
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,480
Your Majesty, Grand Marshal.
Reports from the frontline.

235
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,960
Wu Army absorbed Hanzhou's rebel forces
and is going westward

236
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,240
toward our capital.

237
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,799
Now it's less than 200 miles from here!

238
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,919
That's impossible.

239
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,240
Between the capital and the border,

240
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,559
besides Hanzhou,

241
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,679
there are Kangzhou and Shaozhou.

242
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,919
How could they be so fast?

243
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
Grand Marshal.

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,600
Kangzhou and Shaozhou
have surrendered without battles.

245
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,039
Both regions have fallen.

246
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,120
Got it.

247
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,399
Leave now.

248
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,480
Understood.

249
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,519
Any more reports,

250
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,519
inform immediately.

251
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,679
Yes.

252
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,399
Wait.

253
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,720
I forgot something.

254
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,799
I'll be right back.

255
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:06,548
(We will attack the city soon.
Kill the king.)

256
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,879
At least Eunuch Li

257
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,759
wasn't lying.

258
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,639
Within half a month,

259
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,240
they'll reach the capital.

260
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,759
Hey,

261
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,840
now that the enemy is at our doorstep,

262
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,360
do you still want to retire?

263
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,960
I wouldn't be a coward.

264
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,840
Alright.

265
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,320
Then, resist Wu with me.

266
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,679
Let them know

267
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
our warriors are not to be bullied!

268
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:40,960
Your Majesty.

269
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
I have sinned

270
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,519
and deserve death.

271
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,159
But the war is imminent.

272
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
After the war,

273
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,200
I will accept any punishment.

274
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,639
Now, we must gather all resources

275
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,600
to fortify the defenses.

276
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,159
That's the top priority.

277
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,840
Grand Marshal.

278
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,799
From 200 miles away,

279
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,279
if they advance at full speed,

280
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,480
how long would it take?

281
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:03,879
Three days.

282
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,279
Three...

283
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,720
They'll arrive in three days?

284
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,840
Yes.

285
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,000
Honey.

286
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,759
Honey.

287
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,759
I want to eat fish.

288
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,320
I'll tell them.

289
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:01,919
Wait.

290
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,720
I'll cook it myself.

291
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,039
Okay.

292
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,159
Your Majesty.

293
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,279
Your Grace.

294
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,879
You all may leave.

295
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,759
Yes.

296
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,720
Alright, you may leave now.

297
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,639
I don't need you.

298
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:33,960
Long Qi.

299
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,919
Go to the Yueshi Hall with me

300
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,279
to get a jar of yellow wine

301
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,440
for cooking fish.

302
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,159
Understood.

303
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,559
Help me.

304
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:17,083
(Kill.)

305
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,104
(We will attack the city soon.
Kill the king.)

306
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,400
That's small.

307
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,640
Use the big one.

308
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,519
Making fish...

309
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,759
Chop some scallions first.

310
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,920
Caiyi.

311
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,279
Do you Wu people

312
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,519
all like sweet food?

313
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
I know it.

314
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,720
Long Qi secretly gives you

315
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,920
my desserts every day.

316
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,839
If I'm correct,

317
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,720
your favorite dessert is...

318
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,559
Osmanthus cakes.

319
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,640
I read in books

320
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,440
that every spring,

321
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,039
Wu State is filled
with osmanthus fragrance.

322
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,319
I've always wanted to go there.

323
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,359
Well,

324
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,359
you haven't gone back for long.

325
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,720
You must miss home, right?

326
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,079
Caiyi,

327
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,480
war is coming.

328
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,720
Now it's not begun,

329
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,000
go home.

330
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,720
Don't worry

331
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,319
about the Queen.

332
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,359
I know

333
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,079
you're most concerned

334
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,160
about that foolish guy.

335
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,400
Honestly,

336
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,400
he

337
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,559
really likes you.

338
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,839
If it weren't for the war,

339
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,759
I'd drag him in front of you

340
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,799
and make him confess
all his feelings to you.

341
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,519
And then,

342
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,319
I'd give you a long vacation.

343
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
You could travel

344
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,920
across the world,

345
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,200
eat and drink

346
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,279
something delicious

347
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,640
and do whatever you want.

348
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,119
Actually,

349
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,480
I'm quite envious of you.

350
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,519
Well,

351
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
Jiujiu and I

352
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,960
love each other deeply.

353
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,200
We just want to live

354
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,599
a simple life.

355
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,279
But before that, we must

356
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,960
win this impossible war.

357
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,200
Thinking it carefully,

358
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,119
being ordinary people

359
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,000
is really great.

360
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,480
Your Majesty. The yellow wine is here.

361
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,200
So a big jar!

362
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,119
I, Zhang Jinlong, have no heirs.

363
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,599
I've dedicated my life

364
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,880
to Chen's prosperity.

365
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,480
Master.

366
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,880
Goddess of Thunder,

367
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,880
is that you?

368
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,640
(Three days later)
Chenzhou's troops are strong.

369
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,039
The Governor Fan Li
used to fight around with me

370
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:10,960
and the former king.

371
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,960
I have sent an urgent message
for them to reinforce the capital.

372
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,880
It takes ten days for them to arrive.

373
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,359
If we can hold out for ten days,

374
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,319
we can counterattack

375
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,039
when the reinforcements arrive.

376
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,480
Impossible!

377
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,920
Wu Army is moving so fast?

378
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,359
The Tiger Roar Valley might have...

379
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,200
Those who were sent there to ambush

380
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,240
are probably already dead.

381
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,400
Since they have come,

382
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,400
let's face them.

383
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,920
Officer.

384
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,680
Officer!

385
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,640
Please!

386
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,519
Don't take them all!

387
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,920
Your Majesty. This...

388
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,519
Maybe his families are inside.

389
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,359
Let him go.

390
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,359
Your Majesty.

391
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,759
Wu Army hasn't arrived.

392
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,000
The city is not besieged.

393
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,960
There's still a chance for you to leave.

394
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,680
Grand Marshal and I will stay.

395
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,279
If you live,

396
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,839
there's still hope. Your Majesty.

397
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,559
Right.

398
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,640
Your Majesty.

399
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,039
Return to save us

400
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,160
with the reinforcements.

401
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,000
There won't be reinforcements.

402
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,880
I am sure.

403
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,519
When the tree falls, monkeys disperse.

404
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,880
They either surrendered

405
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,480
or are waiting.

406
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,079
If leaving the city

407
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,519
can preserve your lives,

408
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,480
you can go.

409
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,880
The state may fall,

410
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,279
but the people remain.

411
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:16,359
I am the king.

412
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,200
I must stay.

413
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,279
I'll protect you to the death!

414
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,599
I'll stay with you.

415
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,160
Go!

416
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,000
Madam.

417
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,599
It's noisy outside,

418
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,839
and the soldiers are gone.

419
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,319
I'm afraid Wu Army has broken in!

420
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,480
Madam!

421
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,640
Madam.

422
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,599
Madam!

423
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:04,880
Madam!

424
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,400
King Wu has come to fetch you!

425
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,400
Wake up!

426
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,319
Madam!

427
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:20,440
Your Majesty.

428
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Grand Marshal.

429
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,640
None of our soldiers sent
to Tiger Roar Valley returned.

430
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,079
How many soldiers we have now?

431
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm not sure.

432
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,160
Where's Imperial Guards?

433
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,160
The west gate is open.

434
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,839
Go escort the people out of here.

435
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,079
Understood.

436
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,839
Chen Xiaohua.

437
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,359
Stop struggling.

438
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,960
Open the gate,

439
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,200
hand over the Imperial Seal,

440
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,160
and I'll

441
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,920
spare your life

442
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,000
and grant you
a wealthy and peaceful life.

443
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,359
You think we'd follow your order?

444
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,440
If you have the guts,

445
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,119
come up here yourself!

446
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,160
We have geographical advantage

447
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,960
and ample food reserves.

448
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,440
If you're not prepared to stay long,

449
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,200
go back now!

450
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,559
Listen.

451
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,359
In a few more hours,

452
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,680
my troops

453
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,839
will surround you.

454
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,960
I advise you to go home now

455
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,119
and mourn your newly dead father

456
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,039
properly!

457
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,680
You think

458
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:21,039
I can't get in?

459
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,720
If you could,

460
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,920
why talk nonsense here?

461
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,960
Alright.

462
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,200
Bring the bow!

463
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,160
There's a spy in the city!

464
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,559
Imperial Guards,

465
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,200
guard the gate!

466
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,240
Yes!

467
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,079
Kill!

468
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,680
Your Majesty, if they break in,

469
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,119
Chen State is in peril.

470
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,519
I'll go guarding the gates.

471
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,079
Long Qi.

472
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,319
Your Majesty. In my past life,

473
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,680
it's been an honor

474
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,640
to serve you.

475
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,440
Next life,

476
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,160
I want to be your guard again.

477
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,319
Caiyi.

478
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,240
In the next life,

479
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,200
I hope I can meet you sooner.

480
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,240
Long Qi.

481
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:04,319
Your Majesty.

482
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,359
You are chosen by heaven.

483
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,200
I will repay your kindness

484
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
in the next life.

485
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:17,720
Smile.

486
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,839
Make it natural.

487
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,960
I

488
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,759
never lie.

489
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,079
A secret guard...

490
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,400
never asks questions.

491
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,920
Secret guard.

492
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:35,960
I

493
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,279
will end this quickly.

494
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,240
Now it's time

495
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,559
for you to fulfill your promise.

496
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,559
How?

497
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,519
The enemy is waiting

498
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,400
at the gates.

499
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:00,839
Warrioress.

500
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,559
You should act now.

501
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,400
I want to,

502
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,759
but I can't.

503
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:07,880
What do you mean?

504
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,400
I can't

505
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,960
use my power

506
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,160
to protect Chen State

507
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,279
and Chen Xiaohua.

508
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,680
Why?

509
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,000
I am the Warrioress,

510
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,720
but not exactly.

511
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:19,480
You...

512
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,359
What are you talking about?

513
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,039
You cannot use

514
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,279
Warrioress's special skills to help him.

515
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,119
If you want to save him,

516
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,000
let him face challenges alone

517
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,720
and wake up on his own.

518
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,319
(I understand.)

519
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,400
(You must be in pain now.)

520
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,400
(But your intervention now)

521
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,039
(will only harm him.)

522
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,200
Long Qi!

523
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,680
I'm here!

524
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:29,759
Chen Xiaohua.

525
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Do you believe

526
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,880
within an incense's time,

527
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,400
your gates

528
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,680
will open for me from inside.

529
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,079
Surrender now.

530
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,559
Show your true skills!

531
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,960
Stop talking nonsense!

532
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,759
Come on!

533
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,319
Waiting for me.

534
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:22,559
