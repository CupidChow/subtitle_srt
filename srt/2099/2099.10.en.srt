00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,319
Hello.

3
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,680
Welcome to...

4
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:19,879
Hello.

5
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,599
Welcome to...

6
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,120
Hello. Welcome to Kun-BANK.

7
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,599
It is estimated that at 2 PM today,

8
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,439
it will be raining heavily.

9
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,040
Please bring umbrellas going around.

10
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,319
Hello.

11
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,359
Welcome to Kun-BANK.

12
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,920
May I help...?

13
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:26,164
=Episode 10=
(A Small Tomato)

14
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,039
His Majesty said, "kill them all".

15
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,080
Go!

16
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,879
Your Majesty. Your Grace.

17
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,879
I am going to fight.

18
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,720
Caiyi.

19
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,399
Your Majesty.

20
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,720
Your Grace.

21
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,439
I entered Chen at 14.

22
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,199
It's been ten years.

23
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,959
For me,

24
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,439
Wu State is a purgatory where I trained.

25
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,079
Chen State is a cage for me

26
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,439
till my mission ends.

27
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,279
But sometimes I was thinking,

28
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
what else can I do
after completing the mission?

29
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,160
I am just a knife of the Wu State.

30
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,424
(Kill)

31
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,800
(We will attack the city soon.
Kill the king.)

32
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,439
But then

33
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,879
I met you.

34
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,600
If you want it,

35
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,480
take it.

36
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,199
Aren't you afraid I'll run off
with the bamboo slip?

37
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,240
You won't.

38
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,680
You go.

39
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,879
Your Grace.

40
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,480
I...

41
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,959
Skip the explanation part.

42
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,839
I know you are worrying about Long Qi.

43
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,120
Go take care of him.

44
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,240
Caiyi.

45
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,240
Having been away for years,

46
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,639
don't you miss your home?

47
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,079
Caiyi.

48
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,600
The war is about to start.

49
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,000
It must be dangerous here,

50
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,279
you'd better go back.

51
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,199
These days, being with you,

52
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,480
I suddenly realized

53
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,519
that I can't be as ruthless as before.

54
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,720
It was you who made me realize

55
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,000
that I am also a person,

56
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,920
and that I can also have friends.

57
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,639
If time

58
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,680
could stop at this moment,
it would be great.

59
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,839
So, after all,

60
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,199
which state I'm serving

61
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,319
doesn't matter at all.

62
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,439
I am here just for you.

63
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,399
Just for

64
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,120
him.

65
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,879
That's enough.

66
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,879
I have no regrets then.

67
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,399
If we can reincarnate,

68
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,959
I hope to be born along with you.

69
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,000
You're here.

70
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,439
I'm here.

71
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,879
I'm afraid I would die here today.

72
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,480
Fear not.

73
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,279
I'll stay with you.

I am going to kill him!

We finally meet.

Your Majesty.

128
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,679
Your Majesty. I've served in the military

129
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,960
for the Chen State

130
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,960
and bring victories.

131
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,799
But this time,

132
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,879
I cannot secure the Chen State.

133
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,480
In my heart,

134
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,879
Your Majesty are like my own child.

135
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,679
Your Majesty.

136
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,399
I can die with no regrets
knowing the truth.

137
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,519
I've searched for the truth
with my whole life.

138
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,840
But never have I touched it till today.

139
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,000
If I died for the Chen State,

140
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,799
I would feel fulfilled.

141
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,080
Grand Tutor!

142
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,879
My pal.

143
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,840
No!

144
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,960
See you if we have chance.

145
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,320
No!

146
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,600
I'll fight with you all.

147
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,039
Hold on.

148
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,639
Surrender or not?

149
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,440
Still couldn't hold on.

150
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm sorry.

151
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,879
I can't save you.

152
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,679
No.

153
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
It's all my fault.

154
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:58,759
I was wrong.

155
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,720
I lost, Honey.

156
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,519
It's alright.

157
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,200
Don't be sad.

158
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,039
Let me go.

159
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,120
You can't die.

160
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,240
I won't let you die.

161
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,559
I didn't make it.

162
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,240
Sorry to make you disappointed.

163
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,679
I don't have the right
to live any longer.

164
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,279
Let me go.

165
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,120
You can't die.

166
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,799
Honey, do you know?

167
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,799
When we prayed for rain.

168
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,919
I thought I could make it.

169
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
But I only realized
when investigating corruption

170
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,480
that it was too hard to be the king.

171
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,480
I disappointed you.

172
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,000
I got everyone killed.

173
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,639
I am really regretful.

174
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,399
Hope next time we meet,

175
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,600
you still remember me.

176
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,120
No!

177
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,120
You shouldn't have intervened.

178
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
I couldn't hold it back.

179
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,840
I told you the first time you entered.

180
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,320
In that world,

181
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,440
you are

182
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,000
not supposed to intervene.

183
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,080
Once you did,

184
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,320
it will lead to severe damage there.

185
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,039
And it will do harm on him.

186
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,360
In that world,

187
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,720
I didn't remember this.

188
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,879
There was just

189
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,120
a vague voice telling me

190
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,080
that I shouldn't intervene.

191
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,759
But another voice was telling me

192
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,759
that I must protect him.

193
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,399
Because of your intervention,

194
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,519
his cranial repair value dropped.

195
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,200
We gave him a cheat code.

196
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,759
He has countless lives.

197
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,200
He can rebirth after lost.

198
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,240
But if you intervene,
it will only harm him.

199
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,320
Don't forget

200
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,639
your initial purpose.

201
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,519
You can only help him
change his mindset.

202
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,919
But cannot act on his behalf.

203
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,159
I understand, Doctor.

204
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,080
I won't intervene this time.

205
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,320
I must enter there again.

206
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:49,799
No way.

207
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,279
He doesn't have much time left.

208
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,279
That's no reason to harm your body.

209
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,600
If you enter now,

210
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,960
not until he coming out,

211
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,279
you'll collapse first.

212
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,559
I can make it.

213
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,240
I must enter again.

214
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,399
Tao.

215
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,240
The system malfunctioned
when you intervened.

216
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,360
Not me preventing you from entering.

217
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,159
You violated your mission.

218
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,600
It disturbed the root command

219
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,960
and caused a bug.

220
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,080
So even if you want to enter, you can't.

221
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,240
I have to solve the bug.

222
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
How long would it take?

223
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,960
Three days.

224
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,240
Player No. 0001, Chen Xiaohua.

225
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,679
Welcome to the virtual world
of Blue Brain Technology.

226
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,120
Why am I back here again?

227
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,120
Jiujiu?

228
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,000
Jiujiu!

229
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,919
Please choose the role you will play

230
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,200
in the virtual world.

231
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,840
Haven't I chosen?

232
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,799
I chose to be the king.

233
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,480
Repeat.

234
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,200
Please choose the role you will play

235
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,440
in the virtual world.

236
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,919
Are you a human or a ghost?

237
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,200
Let me out!

238
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,880
Please choose your role.

239
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,799
Fine.

240
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,839
Don't waste my time.

241
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,880
I'll just pick this one.

242
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,960
The Romantic Swordsman.

243
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,640
Okay.

244
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,880
Choice confirmed.

245
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,559
Sorry, you can't choose this role.

246
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,319
Most people

247
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,759
have no chance to choose their own life.

248
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,640
What?

249
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,680
You are wasting my time.

250
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,640
Let me out!

251
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,799
Sorry.

252
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,599
We still need to finish this part.

253
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,359
Due to the rules,

254
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,839
your role as the king
is still continuing.

255
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,880
We have our expertise.

256
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,640
Indeed, we're not
great warriors like the general.

257
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,799
We can't hold swords

258
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,960
but we can hold pens to write.

259
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,079
(I've returned to this time.)

260
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:49,799
Regarding military matters...

261
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:50,680
(Haven't investigated.)

262
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,640
the Grand Marshal
has the greatest authority

263
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,279
to speak in this court.

264
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,599
I also wish to fight.

265
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,119
But the army needs ample provisions.

266
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,039
And the money?

267
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,039
No!

268
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:08,759
Thankfully, Hanzhou
hasn't been besieged.

269
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,440
Stop.

270
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,759
Minister of Works, Zhang Chao.

271
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,599
Minister of Revenue, Li Xuan.

272
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,599
Step forward.

273
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,160
I am here.

274
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,599
Where are the Imperial Guards?

275
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,960
Arrest these two officials.

276
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,599
Are you deaf?

277
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,799
Total taxes on salt
and other projects nationwide

278
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:48,960
are over eight million taels.

279
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,920
These two officials,

280
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,079
along with a magnate,

281
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,920
took the money
under the pretext of drought relief

282
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,920
and the pretext
of the royal court renovation.

283
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,279
With six main departments
and four local governments,

284
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,279
a total of a hundred officials,
they plotted treason with Wu State.

285
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,680
More than half of them

286
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,680
have chased properties in the Wu State.

287
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,559
Most were transferred through Hanzhou

288
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,839
under the protection
of Hanzhou Governor.

289
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,119
Imperial Guards.

290
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,079
Yes.

291
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,759
Proceed to their offices and mansions.

292
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,000
Bring back every item with characters.

293
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,960
Yes.

294
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,359
Wait.

295
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,519
Eunuch Li.

296
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,039
No,

297
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,880
I'd call you the magnate.

298
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,759
Won't you kneel down?

299
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:51,799
Shut up.

300
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,000
Imperial Guards.

301
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,599
Drag him out too.

302
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,240
Stay still.

303
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,400
Let go of me.

304
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,319
Let go of me.

305
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,799
Your Majesty.

306
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,680
May I say something?

307
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,240
Your Majesty.

308
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,359
Alright.

309
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,759
For those I should know,

310
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,720
I know exactly.

311
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,960
For those I shouldn't know,
I know them too.

312
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,359
Now, Chen State
is in a period of crisis.

313
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,279
Arresting those three officials

314
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,440
is just for warning.

315
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,119
I hope all of you

316
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:31,200
have self-awareness.

317
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,559
If you have been involved in corruption,

318
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,880
hand in money anonymously.

319
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,119
Then I will let the thing go.

320
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:39,079
I can excuse you.

321
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,359
But if you persist to disobey,

322
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,279
then I'll show no mercy.

323
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:50,880
Grand Marshal.

324
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,880
Back to the issue of Wu State.

325
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,559
Actually,

326
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,680
extending the olive branch...

327
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,359
I understand.

328
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,279
Never make peace.

329
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,240
I will arrange the military
and prepare for the war.

330
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:04,920
No.

331
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:06,920
To oppose the Wu State,

332
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,359
I have a new solution.

333
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,960
(I am so handsome.)

334
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,000
(So handsome.)

335
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,319
(Right now,)

336
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,519
(it's time for my wife to show up.)

337
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,920
The Treasury is empty.

338
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,480
This is known throughout Chen State.

339
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
But what Your Majesty truly cares is

340
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:24,920
how it is this year.

341
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,880
Where is my wife?

342
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,839
I captured them in advance.

343
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,680
So she has no need to come?

344
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,920
Shut the door.

345
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:55,400
Long Qi.

346
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,200
Is there an eavesdropper?

347
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,880
No.

348
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,039
Do you remember

349
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,279
that wooden box?

350
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,480
Yes.

351
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:08,079
That one containing a bamboo slip

352
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,279
related to the Imperial Seal.

353
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,240
Take the bamboo slip outside the Court.

354
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:14,559
See if there are any clues
related to the Imperial Seal.

355
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,640
Go and find it.

356
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,279
Yes.

357
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,079
Wait, wait.

358
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,640
Where's my wife?

359
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,440
I haven't seen her.

360
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,680
Are you looking for

361
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,680
Lady Zhen or Lady Bao?

362
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,000
Where is Lady Xiao?

363
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,359
Who is

364
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,799
Lady Xiao?

365
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,440
No wonder Caiyi says you're silly.

366
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,799
Go.

367
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:40,880
Go find the clue.

368
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:43,960
And who is

369
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,319
Caiyi?

370
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,559
Honey.

371
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,640
What's going on?

372
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,119
Why is everything gone?

373
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,319
It's all dust.

374
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,839
Where is Lady Xiao?

375
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,839
Your Majesty.

376
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,720
I'm asking you, where is Lady Xiao?

377
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,720
I don't know the lady
Your Majesty is asking.

378
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,000
I don't know Lady Xiao.

379
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,799
You don't know?

380
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,839
You must be new here.

381
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,160
Don't you know the owner here?

382
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,599
Your Majesty.

383
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,519
I've been in the palace for a few years.

384
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,960
This palace has been empty
for at least three years.

385
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,200
Alright, Honey,

386
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,640
Stop playing.

387
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,599
It is not funny hiding from me.

388
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,279
I have business to discuss with you.

389
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,519
Honey.

390
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:01,440
Honey.

391
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,200
Your Majesty.

392
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,680
Find the Imperial Guards.

393
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,480
Where are you going?

394
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,559
Your Majesty.

395
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,680
I have said

396
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,839
that I, Zhang Jinlong,
have no offspring.

397
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,119
Everyone knows it.

398
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,680
Let alone the adopted daughter.

399
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:24,079
Your Majesty brought so many Guards

400
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,640
to my residence at night.

401
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,680
What is the exact purpose?

402
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,640
What do you mean?

403
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,039
I should ask what is your purpose?

404
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,200
Where is my wife?

405
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,720
Honey.

406
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,480
Just come out.

407
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,000
I will be mad if you don't.

408
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,200
I will be extremely mad.

409
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,240
Honey.

410
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:50,960
Alright.

411
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,119
You won't say, right?

412
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,880
Long Qi.

413
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,160
Lead them to search.

414
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:57,880
Didn't you hear me?

415
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:04,880
Search.

416
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:10,839
Your Majesty.

417
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,759
Rumor has it that

418
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,039
that I intend to rebel.

419
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,440
Someone wishes we have conflicts.

420
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,039
Your Majesty searched my residence
in the middle of the night.

421
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:22,920
If it spreads out,

422
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,119
then we'll get a big trouble.

423
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,400
Grand Marshal.

424
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,640
I know you are loyal to the State

425
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
with no ulterior motives.

426
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,400
But my wife is missing.

427
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,519
- Your Majesty.
- This is urgent.

428
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,680
Your Majesty, shall we

429
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,599
talk in the study room?

430
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,400
Honey.

431
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,839
Honey.

432
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,079
Honey.

433
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,240
Honey.

434
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,039
Your Majesty.

435
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,359
Your Majesty.

436
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,480
This new military report has arrived
half an hour ago.

437
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,440
Now the Wu Army is pressing the borders.

438
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,000
King Wu is leading in person.

439
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,079
Hanzhou is surrounded.

440
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,359
But they didn't attack Hanzhou.

441
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,400
Your Majesty.

442
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,200
The military situation is urgent now.

443
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,400
From my perspective,

444
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,079
Hanzhou will be attacked down
sooner or later.

445
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,079
It is now in great danger.

446
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,440
Your Majesty, please do not

447
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,759
disturb the army

448
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,279
for haphazard things.

449
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,279
Report.

450
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,920
- How's it?
- Your Majesty.

451
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,400
We've searched all around.
But there is no lady at all.

452
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,400
It's impossible.

453
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:23,480
She's not in the palace
and t at home either.

454
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,000
Where could she have gone?

455
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,839
Your Majesty.

456
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:30,640
Have Your Majesty heard
what I was saying?

457
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,880
I heard it.

458
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:32,799
I heard it all.

459
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,640
But right now, tell me.

460
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,920
Where did you hide
your adopted daughter,

461
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,799
my wife?

462
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,119
I

463
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:43,920
don't get it.

464
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,680
But I want to say

465
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,400
that Chen is already
on the brink of disaster.

466
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,079
Your Majesty,
please do not act absurdly.

467
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,880
Grand Marshal.

468
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,359
I will ask you one last time.

469
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,079
Where did you hide my wife?

470
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,000
I

471
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,440
do not know.

472
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,000
Why after coming out,

473
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,160
I was completely deleted
in the game world?

474
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,680
It should be that

475
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,680
the automatic self-check program
of the system

476
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,960
deleted your existence.

477
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,960
Then, after repaired,

478
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,160
can it be restored?

479
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,400
Probably yes.

480
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,000
(Honey.)

481
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,799
(You're back.)

482
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,559
(Why haven't you gone to work yet?)

483
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,880
(I was waiting for you before I go.)

484
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Can you hurry up and go to work?

485
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,160
Don't be late again.

486
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
Just take a look.

487
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,039
Okay.

488
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,759
Close your eyes.

489
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,480
Wait a second.

490
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,680
Don't open.

491
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,599
Alright, Honey.

492
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,759
Open your eyes.

493
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,720
Tomato?

494
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,279
I told you

495
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,200
I definitely would

496
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,799
grow a tomato for you.

497
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,359
(You've been saying since childhood)

498
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,799
(that you love tomatoes.)

499
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:05,839
(But,)

500
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,359
(it cannot be found after you grow up.)

501
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,839
(So I thought it could be)

502
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,359
(finding the taste
of childhood for you.)

503
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:16,640
(Have a try, okay?)

504
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:17,839
(Have a try.)

505
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,744
(It's my effort
over the past few months.)

506
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,079
(Chen Xiaohua.)

507
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,480
(So,)

508
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,279
(you haven't been working)

509
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,880
(for growing this thing?)

510
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,079
I'm no longer the little girl

511
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,240
who could be happy just
for having a tomato.

512
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:32,839
What I want is

513
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,000
a future that I can see.

514
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,359
I want the sense of security.

515
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,759
Are you really planning to get fired

516
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:40,720
and let me alone

517
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,960
to support this family?

518
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,920
Is it that whatever I did,

519
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,880
you won't be satisfied?

520
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,799
(What kind of life do you want?)

521
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,079
(Can you consider about me?)

522
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,920
What I need is

523
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,880
someone who can strive together with me,

524
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,559
not someone who does nothing

525
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,319
but lying down as a poor guy.

526
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
(I'm a poor guy?)

527
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,039
(Well,)

528
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,119
(even if I'm always punctual for work,)

529
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,279
(how much money can I earn?)

530
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,720
(I, Chen Xiaohua,
indeed lack ambition and effort.)

531
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,240
(But what's the reason on earth?)

532
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,559
(Because I can't change the situation.)

533
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:19,880
Anyway, can I buy a house?

534
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,839
I can't.

535
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,279
I can't offer the ideal life you want.

536
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,440
Detected ongoing arguments inside,

537
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,319
which might lead to violent disputes.

538
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,640
- Need to connect...
- Shut up.

539
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,000
Detected ongoing arguments inside.

540
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,799
Shut down.

541
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,519
Our quarrel is particularly meaningless.

542
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,519
Anyway, I...

543
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,079
I must rely on my own efforts

544
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,759
to leave this slum.

545
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:43,440
Yes.

546
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,200
You did work hard.

547
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,880
You did. How much have you made?

548
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,119
Let me tell you.

549
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,880
I've calculated.

550
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,319
Based on our salary together,

551
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,359
if we want to move out,

552
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,359
we need fifty years.

553
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,680
Is it worth it?

554
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,319
Did you see your health report
last month?

555
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,039
Look at me.

556
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,039
Don't you know

557
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,880
your body condition?

558
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,200
Don't you fear no chance

559
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,960
to spend the money?

560
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:09,960
Enough.

561
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,599
I've said a lot

562
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,839
that health comes first.

563
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,759
Body comes first.

564
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:13,400
Heard it?

565
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,039
- Can you stop?
- Did you listen?

566
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Anyway, if you can't work hard with me,

567
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,079
we'll break up.

568
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,079
Break up.

569
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:24,880
Again.

570
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,680
You always want to break up.

571
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,559
Detected quarrels escalating inside.

572
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,519
