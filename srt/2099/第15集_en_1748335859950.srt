1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Yeahicial

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,860
Yeah Инتي

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,860
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,860
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

5
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,860
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

6
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,860
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

7
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,860
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

8
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,860
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

9
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,860
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

10
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,860
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

11
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,860
I really saw it wrong this time.

12
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,860
They're really easy to deal with.

13
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,860
They don't have any worries at all.

14
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,860
Cheers!

15
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,860
Cheers.

16
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,860
I think this place is like a dream.

17
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,860
It's not like it's real.

18
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,860
But actually, I want to say...

19
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,860
Long Qing.

20
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,860
Yes, you say.

21
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,860
How about this?

22
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,860
Let's not talk about it in the middle of the night.

23
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,860
Let's have a date.

24
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,860
Date?

25
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,860
I mean, shut up.

26
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,860
Moe Yecha.

27
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,860
But actually, I want to say that before today,

28
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,860
I've been keeping an eye on His Majesty.

29
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,860
I've been keeping an eye on him.

30
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,860
I've been keeping an eye on him for ten minutes.

31
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,860
But here,

32
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,860
I'm not afraid that they'll hurt us.

33
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,860
I'm not afraid that there will be assassins.

34
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,860
And there won't be anyone who will poison us.

35
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,860
Is it because of today's wedding that you're so lively?

36
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,860
Actually, I want to say that

37
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,860
it's the first time I've seen someone's wedding.

38
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:20,860
So, it's such a wonderful thing to have a wedding.

39
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:28,860
I don't dare to think that I'll be married in the future.

40
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,860
Me, too.

41
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,860
It's the first time I've seen someone's wedding.

42
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,860
I used to think,

43
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,860
who am I?

44
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,860
Am I a countrywoman or a countryman?

45
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,860
But today, I think,

46
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,860
if I'm the person in this village,

47
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,860
it's all my fault.

48
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,860
It's all my fault.

49
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,860
It's all my fault for being greedy.

50
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,860
I'm so busy.

51
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,860
I'm so busy that I can't even talk.

52
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,860
Actually, we can be together long ago.

53
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,860
People can't tell us apart.

54
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,860
It's so hard.

55
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,860
If we don't know each other in the future,

56
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,860
we'll find a beautiful place

57
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,860
and spend our lives well.

58
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,860
I'm thinking,

59
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,860
if I'm not the king of the city,

60
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,860
how nice would it be?

61
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,860
I'm so busy.

62
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,860
I'm so busy.

63
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,860
I'm so busy.

64
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,860
I'm so busy.

65
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,860
I'm so busy.

66
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,860
I'm so busy.

67
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,860
I'm so busy.

68
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,860
I'm so busy.

69
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,860
I'm so busy.

70
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,860
I'm so busy.

71
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,860
I'm so busy.

72
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,860
I'm so busy.

73
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,860
I'm so busy.

74
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,860
I'm so busy.

75
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,860
I'm really busy.

76
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,360
Where'd you get her?

77
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,560
Sang Ju!

78
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,340
What happened?

79
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,800
Has the system caused something again?

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,620
The system didn't cause problems.

81
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,620
I have an urgent matter to discuss with you.

82
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,620
What happened?

83
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,620
How did this happen?

84
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,620
You should have thought about it the first day.

85
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,620
The value of the current is like your phone's power.

86
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,620
But the key is...

87
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,620
But he just killed Wu Ling.

88
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,620
The first time he was hit by the lens was so far away.

89
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,620
I thought he was about to succeed.

90
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,620
Why did he suddenly fall into...

91
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,620
Why did he suddenly fall into so much?

92
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,620
I will not lie to you.

93
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,620
Did he leave the main project?

94
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,620
Did he just defeat Wu Guo in there?

95
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,620
He still has a chance to survive.

96
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,620
I think...

97
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,620
he should just let him live there.

98
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,620
He may have a better choice...

99
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,620
if he has a chance to survive.

100
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,620
I will not give up.

101
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,620
No.

102
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,620
As long as there is one more chance,

103
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,620
I will not give up.

104
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
Xifang.

105
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,620
Xifang.

106
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,620
Where is he?

107
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,620
Xifang.

108
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,620
Xifang.

109
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,620
Where is he?

110
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,620
Xifang.

111
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,620
I have been looking for you for a long time.

112
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,620
Where have you been?

113
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,620
Xifang.

114
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
Don't you think it's strange?

115
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,620
The people in this village are gone.

116
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,620
I did it.

117
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,620
What do you mean?

118
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
You did it.

119
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,620
I told you before.

120
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,620
Everything here is needed.

121
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
This world does not exist.

122
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,620
Xifang.

123
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
I don't understand what you are talking about.

124
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,620
Actually, you are right.

125
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,620
There is another world.

126
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,620
But I will still choose to stay here.

127
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,620
No wonder you don't understand.

128
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,620
You must be the one who is sitting here.

129
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,620
You don't have time.

130
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,620
To defeat the Wu State...

131
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,620
is your only way out.

132
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,620
Wu Liang is dead.

133
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,620
There is still the new Wu King.

134
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,620
For your own sake,

135
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,620
for your own life,

136
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,620
you must return to the East.

137
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,620
Continue to be your king.

138
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,620
Continue to fight for your life.

139
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,620
Continue to fulfill your mission.

140
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,620
We...

141
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Didn't we agree to leave?

142
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,620
I can't save Chen Guo.

143
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,620
I just want to stay here.

144
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,620
You can't stay here.

145
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,620
Even for me, I beg you.

146
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,620
Otherwise, you will never leave.

147
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,620
I just want to ignore Xifang.

148
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,620
Why do you insist on me leaving here?

149
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,620
Why do you insist on forcing me

150
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,620
to do things I can't do at all?

151
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,620
I admit that I can't do a good thing.

152
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,620
I can't save Chen Guo.

153
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,620
I am just a vegetable chicken.

154
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,620
Sorry.

155
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,620
I can't do what you said.

156
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
Chen Xiao Hua.

157
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,620
Xiao Taozi.

158
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,620
Xiao Taozi.

159
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,620
Who allowed you to ruin my game rules?

160
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,620
You are the member of Lan Nao Company.

161
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,620
You should know

162
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,620
how to set up this project.

163
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Dr. K designed the whole virtual world.

164
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,620
Wu Jing.

165
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,620
The earth is no longer a burden.

166
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,620
Let those things

167
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,620
that are not contribute to the earth

168
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,620
to the living things.

169
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,620
Let those things

170
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,620
that are not contribute to the earth

171
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,620
to the living things.

172
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,620
Let those things that are not useful to the earth

173
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,620
to the living things

174
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
to the living things

175
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,620
to the living things

176
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,620
to the living things to the living things.

177
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,620
Your boyfriend, Chen Xiao Hua.

178
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,620
He likes this place.

179
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,620
It's so suitable for him.

180
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,620
You just let him waste his life here.

181
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,620
Oh, sorry.

182
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,620
He wants to be given a life.

183
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,620
Isn't that good?

184
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,620
Why do you want to

185
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,620
interfere with his choice?

186
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,620
I am just doing the right thing.

187
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,620
It's not polite to say

188
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,620
things that others say.

189
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,620
I have seen your boyfriend's interests.

190
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
He is not

191
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,620
a person who is willing to take risks.

192
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,620
He can't

193
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,620
finish you and Dr. K.

194
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
The final mission of the rain.

195
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,620
Give him some more time.

196
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,620
He will definitely finish it.

197
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,620
There are so many people on this planet.

198
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,620
But most of them

199
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,620
are just wasting resources.

200
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,620
They have no hope and no future.

201
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,620
You just let them

202
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,620
live happily here.

203
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,620
Your boyfriend, Chen Xiao Hua.

204
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,620
To be honest,

205
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,620
he is just a member of the crowd.

206
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,620
You just let him

207
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,620
live happily here.

208
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,620
Isn't that good?

209
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,620
Yes, I think I have a choice.

210
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,620
You really have no choice.

211
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,620
Who gave you the power?

212
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,620
But the whole world is still lost.

213
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,620
You really have no choice.

214
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,620
Who gave you the right

215
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
to let the whole Peach Garden disappear?

216
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,620
You really have no choice.

217
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,620
Who gave you the right

218
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,620
to let the whole Peach Garden disappear?

219
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,620
You just let Chen Xiao Hua

220
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,620
live happily here.

221
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,620
Isn't that good?

222
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,620
Just let that waste

223
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,620
live happily here.

224
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,620
Isn't that good?

225
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,620
You just let the vegetable

226
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,620
live here.

227
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,620
Why do you want to

228
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,620
interfere with his choice?

229
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,620
Just let the waste

230
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,620
live happily here.

231
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,620
Isn't that good?

232
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,620
Just let that vegetable

233
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,620
live here.

234
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,620
Isn't that good?

235
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,620
Is it good?

236
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,620
Is it good?

237
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,620
Is it good?

238
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,620
Is it good?

239
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,620
Is it good?

240
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,100
No

241
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,540
Who do you think they are?

242
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,940
The United States

243
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,380
President

244
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,060
Look at the space

245
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,740
You all took photo

246
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,740
Don't know

247
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,860
Nothing

248
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,660
But you

249
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,660
You're not here.

250
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,660
I think it's Princess.

251
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,660
Madam.

252
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
Madam.

253
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,660
There's no wound.

254
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
Go find the king.

255
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,660
Madam.

256
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,660
How are you?

257
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,660
Are you okay?

258
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,660
You look very weak.

259
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,660
How are you?

260
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,660
Is it hard for you?

261
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,660
You're here.

262
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,660
Your boyfriend,

263
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,660
Chen Xiaohua.

264
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
How should I describe him, Dr. K?

265
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
A...

266
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,660
Not important.

267
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,660
Be straightforward.

268
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,660
He's already dead.

269
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
I know.

270
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,660
His brain was at 73%.

271
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,660
But look at now.

272
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,660
He's already 16%.

273
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,660
And he's still going to leave.

274
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,660
So...

275
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,660
Accept the reality.

276
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,660
I know you and Dr. K's plan.

277
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,660
I think it's good.

278
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,660
Really.

279
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,660
The idea is good.

280
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,660
But...

281
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,660
He...

282
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,660
I think it's...

283
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
It's...

284
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660
There's no chance to realize it.

285
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,660
As long as there's a 1% chance,

286
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,660
I'll keep trying.

287
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,660
A person must try his best

288
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,660
to change his destiny.

289
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,660
This idea is actually very scary.

290
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
In this world,

291
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,660
a normal person sometimes

292
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,660
doesn't care how hard he tries.

293
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,660
There are many things that are impossible to change.

294
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,660
For example,

295
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
a boyfriend like you.

296
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,660
Dr. K, do you understand what I mean?

297
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,660
Yes.

298
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,660
Maybe you're right.

299
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,660
But can you give him another chance?

300
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,660
I'm begging you.

301
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,660
I've been in the hospital for less than four months.

302
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,660
I'm not feeling well.

303
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,660
I've been in the hospital for 15 days.

304
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,660
I have severe coronary artery disease.

305
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,660
Heart disease.

306
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,660
I have a severe heart failure.

307
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,660
To save him,

308
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,660
I've done a lot of small surgeries for him.

309
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,660
Why should I save him?

310
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,660
He's old and sick.

311
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,660
He's suffering from a stroke.

312
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,660
This is the rule.

313
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,660
From his point of view,

314
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,660
I've been living for a minute.

315
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,660
I'm a kind of shoulder.

316
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,660
So why should I let him stay and suffer?

317
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,660
You're a good employee.

318
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,660
You're in charge of the duty.

319
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,660
You're free to do anything.

320
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,660
I forgive you for doing everything in the company.

321
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,660
That's all.

322
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,660
I'll let you off for three days.

323
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,660
You'll come to my office after three days.

324
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660
You can't define a person's life like this.

325
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,660
I'm not going to let you off.

326
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,660
I'm not going to let you off.

327
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,660
I'm not going to let you off.

328
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,660
I can't define a person's life like this.

329
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,660
I can't just announce his identity like this.

330
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,660
Dr. K.

331
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,660
I want to thank you.

332
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,660
I want to thank you for creating such a perfect world.

333
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,660
I want to thank you for allowing everyone to have a chance

334
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,660
to live in a place that belongs to their garden.

335
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,660
And for getting their own happiness.

336
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,660
Of course, we want to thank the great player.

337
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
Turn off the unlimited replay mode.

338
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,660
After Chen Xiaohua passed away,

339
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,660
keep all the data that he's been testing.

340
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,660
When he regains consciousness again,

341
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,660
Dr. K will be in front of you

342
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,660
and will be standing by you.

343
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,660
Three days.

344
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,660
I'll be in my office after three days.

345
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
Dr. K.

346
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,660
Dr. K.

347
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
Dr. K.

348
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,660
Dr. K.

349
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,660
Did he come out? What's the result?

350
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,660
He's back to the capital.

351
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,660
Xiao Fulin's emergency is in the temple.

352
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
The brain is the master of the Blue God.

353
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,660
He's also in charge of the garden.

354
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,660
He's talking to himself?

355
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,660
Yes.

356
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,660
Fulin has been brainwashed before.

357
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,660
He's been hit badly.

358
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,660
I can open two rooms for the Blue God.

359
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,660
I think...

360
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,660
I think...

361
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,660
we can know how to get the needle.

362
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,660
I'll wait for the reply.

363
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,660
I'll wait for the reply.

364
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,660
How is it?

365
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,660
Your Majesty, don't worry too much.

366
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,660
I've already cured many of these diseases.

367
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,660
According to my prescription,

368
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,660
I'll keep the medicine in the hospital.

369
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,660
This is the horse's body on the river.

370
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
Your Majesty,

371
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,660
can I borrow a hand?

372
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,660
Your Majesty,

373
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,660
although the Great Si Ma hasn't come back,

374
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,660
can I

375
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,660
make a funeral

376
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,660
and bury a doctor?

377
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,660
I've been suffering from the disease.

378
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
I can't save the queen.

379
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
I shouldn't have

380
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,660
raised the Great Si Ma

381
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,660
at this time.

382
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
I'm sorry.

383
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,660
I'm sorry.

384
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,660
I'll raise the Great Si Ma

385
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,660
and bury her again.

386
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,660
Father,

387
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
the Great Si Ma is a doctor.

388
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,660
She's been suffering for a long time.

389
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,660
She's been working for the Great Cheng State.

390
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,660
How can she leave without a care?

391
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,660
Please take care of this.

392
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,660
Your Majesty,

393
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,660
the name of the capital has changed.

394
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,660
It's all very confident about its own way.

395
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,660
But, Your Majesty...

396
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,660
I can open two safe houses.

397
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
I think

398
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,660
it's a good idea to use the method of the needle.

399
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,660
I'm satisfied.

400
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,660
I'm satisfied.

401
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,660
Long Qi,

402
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,660
do you remember that day

403
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,660
when one of the imperial doctors

404
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,660
was talking about the imperial decree

405
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,660
and wanted to say something,

406
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,660
but he didn't finish it.

407
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,660
I think

408
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
you should wake him up.

409
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,660
Yes.

410
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,660
I'm sorry.

411
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,660
I'm sorry.
